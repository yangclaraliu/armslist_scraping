With that said, it still manages to look pretty killer. The modifications managed to decrease perceived recoil by more than 50% with loads from low recoil 00 buckshot to full power slugs (it was pretty painful in its stock form). It's now far more comfortable and reliable than a stock 590A1, but with the same devastating effect on the business end of the barrel. Bottom line, I've already done everything for you; this bedside/riot gun is ready to go with no additional modifications needed. The shotgun has about 200 rounds through it and has been well taken care of. I'll throw in 25 shells for free. Cash only, no trades.

They were also the sidearm of the Spanish Army and Navy until the 1960's. It is chambered for 9mm Largo and 38 ACP. For loading 38 acp you can use the same case as the 38 Super but you cannot load it to 38 super specs as it would hurt this gun. 9mm Largo brass is available from Star brass. Several companies are offering loaded 9mm Largo. I shoot mostly 38super brass loaded to 38 ACP standard loads. IT is an awesome collector and fun shooting gun. I am selling this one because I have four others so that is how much I enjoy shooting them.  They are so much fun to shoot and very accurate.  AWESOME GUN!!!This Gun comes with two magazines. Astra 400 magazine on ebay avearge around $43.00 dollars.   Will shoot 9mm Largo which is 9x23 and 38 Super loaded 38 acp loading.  Will not shoot full heavy loaded 38 Super. Price is FIRM! Please do not make offers you know I will reject. Remember it does not eat and does not have to be sold. I love to shoot it. Also you will have to meet me at exit 109 Old Peachtree Road on I-85 North in Lawrenceville.  Look on Gun Web Sites you will see selling in $400 to $600.

((Manufactured in Spain by Jukar (Dikar) for the CVA. Now it is made by Ardesa for Traditions))   It was built by my father in 1980. It has never been fired.  However, it could fire. Everything was done properly. Barrel was heat treated etc. This rifle was used since day one as a wall hanger for decoration in his office.  Only taken down to wipe down every once in a while.  Never seen direct sunlight.  It has never been fired. But I took it to a gunsmith and had him look it over. He said it's ready to fire and should do just fine.  It is a 45cal black powder muzzleloader. It has the octagon barrel. And has never been fired. So rifling is as it should be.  I don't have a use for this. And it deserves someone that will use it, collect it, or hang it on their wall.  Rather than packed away in a case under a bed.  I have more photos available of it.  Just ask.   Also will take any specific photos a serious buyer would want.  Contact me to see it in person.  For more photos.  Or to make a cash offer. Copy and paste this Video link in your browser to see a short video of the rifle :https://youtu.be/QflUcoBj1ZIBEST CASH OFFER !Email or TEXT 513-708-428two Thanks"
