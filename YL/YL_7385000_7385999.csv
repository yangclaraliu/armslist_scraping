These are all 100% copper plated applied electrochemically to a precision swaged lead core. So you won't come in contact with any dangerous lead while handling them and at the same time, they won't foul up and ruin your high-dollar actions and barrels. Safe for Glocks and other similar barreled firearms. After electroplating, they're then restruck once more to ensure precise diameters and consistency from bullet to bullet and lot to lot.   I've loaded and shot thousands of these so can personally report they are just as accurate as any Jacketed bullet. Not only are they very accurate, they leave no leading or copper build up in your barrel. As you can see from the pics above, they are very nice projectiles and very shiny. Definately a step up from your ""Berry's plated Bullets"". The plating on these is also nearly twice as thick as ""Berry's bullets"" too so your sizing and FCD wont damage it creating inacurrate tumblers like with the Berry's. Additionally, you'll be hard pressed to find a plated lead bullet such as this that is the weight it says on the box. Unlike Berry's that are always off by 5-10 grs. This makes a BIG difference when setting up your powder charge.   
Price is FIRM. I'm already losing plenty of money on them and you can't get em cheaper anywhere else. My loss is your gain. Buying in bulk is where it's at when it comes to reloading. I just don't have the time for it anymore and into other projects now. Must meet in Winter Haven at the Dollar General store on Lake Ruby Dr West (Mapquest it up BEFORE calling) Gas is cheap so come snap these bad boys up! Please text or call REDACTED"

These are all 100% copper plated applied electrochemically to a precision swaged lead core. So you won't come in contact with any dangerous lead while handling them and at the same time, they won't foul up and ruin your high-dollar actions and barrels. Safe for Glocks and other similar barreled firearms. After electroplating, they're then restruck once more to ensure precise diameters and consistency from bullet to bullet and lot to lot.   
I've loaded and shot thousands of these so can personally report they are just as accurate as any Jacketed bullet. Not only are they very accurate, they leave no leading or copper build up in your barrel. As you can see from the pics above, they are very nice projectiles and very shiny. Definately a step up from your ""Berry's plated Bullets"". The plating on these is also nearly twice as thick as ""Berry's bullets"" too so your sizing and FCD dies wont swage/resize them creating inacurrate tumblers like with the Berry's. Additionally, you'll be hard pressed to find a plated lead bullet such as this that is the weight it says on the box. Unlike Berry's that are always off by 5-10 grs. This makes a BIG difference when setting up your powder charge.   
Price is FIRM. I'm already losing plenty of money on them and you can't get em cheaper anywhere else. My loss is your gain. Buying in bulk is where it's at when it comes to reloading. I just don't have the time for it anymore and into other projects now. Must meet in Winter Haven at the Dollar General store on Lake Ruby Dr West about 5 min from LegoLand theme park.

I'm not even going to get into how great these things are. You already know they're the best you can get. Besides being the most accurate projectiles in the world for long range, precision target shooting, these Hollow Points are also ideal for taking game, self defense, and SHTF senarios. Perfect for all your needs. Price is FIRM. I'm already losing plenty of money on them and you can't get em cheaper anywhere else. My loss is your gain. Buying in bulk is where it's at when it comes to reloading. I just don't have the time for it anymore and into other projects now. As you can see from the pictures above, the boxes were pretty beat up from storage so I discarded them and put the bullets in bags and a sturdy plain box. Must meet in Winter Haven at the Dollar General store on Lake Ruby Dr West about 5 min from LegoLand theme park. (Please Mapquest it up BEFORE calling). Gas is cheap so come snap these bad boys up!

I am selling a brand new, freshly built Precision type AR-15 complete upper receiver group. This upper is loaded down with some of the best mil parts on the planet. Let’s begin with the barrel. It is a Ballistic Advantage Hanson profile 14.5” with a Surefire WarComp muzzle device. This will accept all fast attach socom suppressors as well as the Surefire Warden blast diffuser. The rail is the BCM KMR Rail 13” in length. The upper receiver is a Ballistic Advantage model with M4 feed ramps. Strike Industries charging handle with oversized latch. Also comes with a bipod. This is a rather inexpensive bipod, but it should get the job done for most people’s needs. The included Bolt Carrier Group is a Spike’s Tactical mil-spec model with a phosphate finish. It also comes with the newer Streamlight ProTac Rail Mount HL-X. It is mounted on a BCM offset mount, and comes complete with tape switch. As pictured, also comes with some BCM Keymod rail covers in FDE color. The upper also comes with a brand new Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8 model. It has a slight improved reticle. All in all I prefer this scope over the 1-6, but to each his own. If for some reason you don’t want the scope, I’ll work something out with you. Along with the optic you also get a brand new Burris P.E.P.R. Mount. You can choose to buy without the Vortex if you like and the price of the rifle will be adjusted accordingly. I may have left something out. Just have a look at it and tell me what you think. Thank you.."

This is very high-end 22LR ammo designed for taking small game. It's loaded with a 100% COPPER PLATED solid 40 grain bullet. The heavier bullets have a better ballistic coefficient, so shoot much more accurately and retain their energy down-range. Making these ideal for target practice, rabbits, or close-range foxes. This copper plated bullet also allows for consistent feeding in high capacity magazines and reduced barrel fouling (not the same ol' plain lead, round nose junk that ruins your barrels). This ammunition is loaded with an extremely clean burning powder as well and features non-corrosive priming for consistent, sure-fire ignition. If you compare this to any bulk ammo (even the best US made name brands) it is much nicer. Cases are very shiny, bullets a lot more uniform, and plating a lot thicker. Very, very nice. You don't see this every day. I haven't seen anything like it since before the Sandy Hook Hoax. Each 50 rounds of it is packaged in it's own individual plastic tray and retail box.
Don't throw you hard earned ca$h away on dirty a$$ old lead round nose junk or Jam-O-Matic knock off foreign made garbage. Sometimes you may even find some of those God awful silver painted (Rem Golden) bullets that leave your hands looking like the Hulk and foul the livin' $hit out of your barrel and action when they do decide to go off. And then there's the horrible plain lead bullets that are even worse pretty much everything else available is loaded with. Even most of the ultra pricey, ""premium"" or ""Match"" 22LR ammo out there is loaded with those $hit non-plated old lead bullets. Remember the real deal, made in USA 100% copper plated bullets you used to get back in the glory days? The 100% reliable feeding, 100% reliable igniting, clean burning, non fouling, excellent 22LR ammo?? The awesome ammo that didn't jam up in your semi autos every other round??

From research done by Charles Pate, ""The DSC had the role of providing arms for defense plant guards, police departments and security personnel of various government organizations.""From the DSC, I believe this revolver became the property, and daily companion of a Mr. N (to preserve privacies), who was a security guard at Crucible Steel in Syracuse, NY, during the war years, through his retirement in perhaps the '70s.I believe it passed from that gentleman's ownership, to the hands of its current owner.This gun is in great functional and cosmetic shape.It has: 4"" barrel with great Like New shiny crisp bore and sharp crown probably 90% original parkerized finish - very well taken care of in daily use Great condition Walnut Grips with Colt Pony logo inlays in both grips - normal holster and service duty wear. Due to its early production, it was outfitted with Colt checkered wooden grips with Colt Pony logo silver medalions embedded in each grip. These grips were at the time used for the civilian Colt Official Police revolvers - and apparently used on the early Commandos until the standard molded plastic grip could become available in adequate supply. US Government inspectors Flaming Ordnance Bomb stamp on upper left frame corner  Colt Verified Proof Mark (P inside a V) on lower left frame forward of the trigger Another Colt factory inspector's stamp at left rear trigger guard frame ( appears to be 'Y' ?) Another Colt inspector 'L' stamp below the SN mark on the frame under ejector rod Also included is a very nice Audley Holster - patented Oct 13, 1914 - which has apparently been with this revolver since its days at Crucible Steel.I welcome any corrections or helpful info for any of my efforts to fill in truthful history for this revolver!Please see the pics - they show a number of other assemblers marks, and the true condition of this wonderful firearm.SpecificationsManufacturer: Colt's Manufacturing Model: CommandoAction: SA/DA RevolverFinish: ParkerizedS/N: 4023Caliber: .38 SpecialCapacity: 6-round cylinderBarrel: 4""Payment InformationPayment may be made by Money Order or other form of certified check.

I absolutely HAVE TO liquidate these items ASAP. When I first listed this I did not want to part any of it out. All together, it is a beautifully COMPLETE reloading set up. Now I dont care. My son needs diapers, our vehicles need fuel so I can continue to hunt down job leads and follow up on Apps. So I am open to any offers. If you just want a can of powder for 20 bucks....Let me know. I just used my last dollar to pay rent - I am on borrowed time... Someone here is going to walk away with a damn highway robbery of a deal if they send me an even half intelligent offer. So please, try not to take advantage of my plight too maliciously. I'm definately down, and could do without the preverbial kick to the teeth.(We all have our own speed bumps in life. I apologize you had to hear me boo-hoo over mine. I am only trying to illustrate how desperately I need one of you guys to help me out and buy this stuff! Thank you--Done with the personal manifesto, Back to the basics-)I have the RCBS 5 Stage Turret press, Hornady dies in .223 and 9mm, as well as the RCBS Uniflow Powder measure (trickler) to go with it. In addition to - a Hornady case trimmer, 1 can of Hornady ""one-shot"" case lube, Hornady's reloading guide -9th edition, Hornady 6"" stainless steel digital measurement caliper, a Lyman ultrasonic case wash unit, a powder pan, Hodgdson and IMR powders, Berry's bullets in .223 and 9mm, small rifle and pistol primers, primer tubes, 1 primer tray, and a TON of brass! As well as the few things I inevitably left out & much much more! All of this stuff was hand picked by me for the quality and fit of each item when assembled as a whole production unit. In my own humble opinion, (Which isnt worth much, trust me! ha) this is a VERY nice reloading set up. The equipment has been cared for and maintained properly, leaving it in BRAND NEW condition for the lucky person who comes away with it. I produced only 500 9mm rounds start to finish, before I had to meticulously & carefully clean and box everything up. Due to us selling our home and downsizing to a much smaller property, I was left with no choice but to store the equipment until I could get it set up again. However, what I had thought would be a temporary move in downsizing, has now evolved into a dive head first off the summit. Who wants to be the lucky person who gets this great deal on these great pieces of machinery!? First come first serve, its a race. Ready...set...Go send me an offer! Any Offer! Please feel free to E-mail or text me (7027553three38) with ANY questions at all. Please direct messages to Jake. Thank you for checking out my Ad. Mostly, I thank you in advance for your compassion and support during this sensative time-I would assume this goes without saying given the descried scenario, but I know someone out there will offer me their squirtgun for this. So I will say it anyway, NO TRADES!! (Unless its an AR or long rifle of similar value, or a upper end branded 1911 pistol.)Thanks! Happy Bidding!!"

Model:  M&P
Caliber:  22 LR
Condition:  NEW IN THE BOX
 
The S&W MP series has been a huge hit …. But something was missing – the M&P 22 cal.   It’s made in Germany by Walther.
It’s true to the M&P tradition in design and function, so it will be a nice addition for those wanting to train with the economical 22 caliber that also has a lot less recoil.  Sports the same grip and feel as the other Smith & Wesson M&P pistols that made Smith and Wesson famous.       * This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.
 (No trades. No silly low offers -- these messages will not be returned.)
FEATURES:
- This is a TACTICAL 22. That means that like every other M&P, it comes equipped with a length of Picatinny rail for your attachment pleasure. Lights, lasers, mounting brackets, blades, etc.  If it has the required clamp, you can hang it from your 22 S&P MP 22!
- Threaded barrel
- Sights:   Fully-adjustable rear sight is fully adjustable for windage and alevation  It is also MILLED and dovetailed into the slide.  Front sight blade is also milled and dovetailed into the slide.  Easy to change if you want.- Very clean breaking trigger stroke -- quick and short, making follow up shots very easy.- Captured spring on the guide rod- Very easy takedown for field stripping.- Reliable Smith & Wesson action – ultra-smooth and reliable!- Safeties: Ambidextrous frame-mounted safety paddles that are large enough to flip on and off with ease.  Also has a Magazine safety.- Mag release is on the left side. Left handed shooters can switch it over to the other side if they so choose.- Loaded chamber peep hole on top of the slide.- This is an Upgraded, Special 12 Round Magazine from the Smith & Wesson factory (not the common 10 round magazine)."

Called a ""Howdah"" because guns like these were carried by 19th century tiger hunters riding in howdahs, which is what the saddle and canopy mounted on the back of an elephant is called. If a tiger attacked the elephant, then the hunter could shoot it at close range using a large caliber pistol. This pistol will shoot either a .614 ball or can be loaded with shot. Both bores are smooth bores. Beautiful wood and engraved metal - both a shooter and a display piece. With original box; the box has a few dings from shipping, but the gun is in perfect shape. Ready for recreational black powder shooting or hunting season.

It has a very unique slim profile with 8+1 capacity in a concealable 9 mm package – it distinguishes itself this way in a sea of look-a-like pistols. An almost brilliant design: small and light for concealed carry – but large enough for comfortable use at the range.

FEATURES:- Great Workmanship & High Quality:   Slides and barrels are machined from stainless steel instead of carbon steel. The slide release is an actual dimensionally manufactured part versus being a stamped part. The trigger is metal versus being polymer, as is the magazine. Even the recoil spring is a stainless double captive spring recoil assembly. Excellent quality that rivals much higher end guns for the price.- Stone cold reliability: all the safety benefits of a Glock, but without the awkward, spongey trigger safety. Simple fire control mechanism for excellent reliability! Pulling the trigger disengages the passive striker block safety, finishes cocking the gun and then completes the firing cycle by releasing the spring loaded firing pin. It is an extremely safe design which in many ways works more like a revolver then a striker fired pistol.- Trigger feel is excellent and similar to a really light, smooth, crisp double action Smith revolver than a striker-fired pistol.  Often sited as the best trigger break in any striker-fired pistol in its class – clean and crisp.- Trigger cocking locked breech “Browning-type” recoil lug design. Pulling the trigger disengages a passive striker block safety, further cocks the gun, and then completes the firing cycle by releasing the spring loaded firing pin. It is an extremely safe design, which in many ways works more like a revolver then a striker fired pistol.- Double recoil spring assembly makes the gun easy to manually cycle and charge. - Single stack magazine makes the gun SLIM -- easy to conceal and easy to handle for those with small to medium hands (or those who just a more compact feel). So slim that you would think it is 380 caliber instead of a 9 mm.- Ergonomic very similar to a 1911 but it somehow cleaner and more comfortable. Very similar to a compact 1911 commander feel. Grips are not over-textured and come with very pleasant feeling front and back straps.- Perfect size: large enough to be comfortable at the range, but slim enough on profile to be light and comfortable to conceal.- Capacity: 8 + 1"
