There is no rust visable on this gun. The bore is bright and clean.  The rifle still retains the original Buffington, elevator rear sight which is worth around $225 by itself.  The rifle shoots the 405 grain bullet commonaly known as the 45/70 Government load available at any good sports store. This rifle can be used to hunt any game animal that walks on the North American continent. This rifle was sporterized at some point; barrel cut to 23""; Sears Robuck sold these in their catalog in 1900 for $2.50 each! It has two small pieces of wood missing next to the tang but nowhere else. Is a great gun to hang above the fireplace or lots of fun to shoot.Earlier percushion versions of this rifle saw use during the Civil War. This model also saw action with Custer during his last stand and neumerous other indian campaigns in the 1890s.  Also was used during the Spanish American war and the Phillipine American war.Own a true piece of American History!  Will consider shipping to your FFL.$450 Cash or Best OfferIllinois buyer must have valid FOID."

So that is 189 rounds, total. Remember that these rounds are almost a dollar each retail!The holster is a vintage George Lawrence 1-C Challenger in very good condition. A heavy made holster.The revolver itself shows a little holster wear, but this is typical for a 1978 model. It has a lightened trigger,  and is very accurate. The extra weight that the Super Blackhawk has over the regular model really helps tame the recoil and makes it easier to shoot. Overall it is a nice revolver, and would be a great sidearm for hunting with the included heavy duty holster.The price is negotiable,  but don't push your luck.

Has a nice predictable break when you get used to it, so it's easy to stage the trigger. I bought this gun from a gunsmith who went through the gun and made sure everything was in working order. He also bead blasted and cold blued the slide. Then he cetrakoted the frame in fde. Functions perfect. I ran a box through it a couple weeks ago and had no failures. Was very accurate as well for a gun with such a short barrel and hardly any sights. I was shooting squirrel size targets at 5 yards and it was shooting straight and true. Nothing fancy, just an inexpensive, high capacity, reliable, great shooting pocket gun.

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."
