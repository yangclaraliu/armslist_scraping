It comes with a 12 round and 10 round magazine. They don't make stainless anymore so these are harder to come by. I personally have transitioned from .45 caliber pistols to 9mm pistols after receiving extensive training and no longer have a use for this pistol. It's in great shape and there is nothing wrong with it. It has just been sitting in my safe not being used. I probably put 200-300 rounds through it over the past 5 years and haven't touched it since (except for cleaning!). It has a DA/SA safety/decocker (some models don't). This is the same gun special operations use sometimes so it has the wider trigger guard and bigger buttons so it's easier to use with gloves on, etc.

Here is a Cold Warrior pistol from our opponents’ side, a genuine Zastava Yugoslavian manufactured model M57 steel frame Tokarev design pistol, chambered in the powerful 7.62x25 or .32 Tokarev caliber. This pistol came from service with the Yugoslavian State Police in what is now the State Union of Montenegro and Serbia, and comes with its brown leather police holster and cleaning rod. The Soviets pirated John M. Browning’s 1903 design and modified and chambered the new pistol for their purposes in the 1930s to replace their revolvers, then shared their milling equipment to entice the Independent Yugoslavs during the Cold War. This pistol is every bit as good as its Russian made counterparts. Several of thisM57’s ancestors saw action against the Nazi Army in World War II. Zastava Arms began production in their Kragujevac Serbia plant for Tito’s Communist Army in 1957, hence the model name, on Russian Milling Equipment. From this one’s J serial number prefix, it was manufactured in 1967, as the State Police addressed death and fallout from the Marburg virus. Its only alien marking is importation stamps located on the left forward section of its slide, and required by the 1968 Gun Control Act. These M57s have moderate surface detractions, mostly holster whitening on the slide edges and palm contact whitening or browning on the grip frame front and back straps. We rate them  as Good, perhaps Very Good, 70 percent vicinity by our estimate; photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore shows strong sharp rifling lands with some dark etchy texture in the grooves, and the chamber and mechanism are clean.As far as Specs, type is blowback single action semi-auto; caliber 7.62x25 Tokarev, and the magazine is outfitted for its original lanyard loop, and capacity is 8 + 1 rounds. Barrel length is 4 1/4 inches with full length steel guide rod; sights are blue steel dovetailed low blade front with u-notch high dovetailed steel rear; weight empty is 28.4 ounces with center of gravity at the trigger guard junction to the grip frame; grips are classic Soviet style serrated polymer. This pistol has a main safety for cocked-and-locked position, but does not have a magazine safety; that is, it will fire a single round even if the magazine is not in battery. Bore shows strong sharp rifling lands with some dark etchy texture in the grooves, and the chamber and mechanism are clean. We’re offering these attractive, collectable Zastava M57 pistols, each	for only	$ 169.00. 	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

Needing an inexpensive 20 ga or 410 shotgun for squirrel and rabbit. Mod or Full is fine. 28 gauge would be awesome but they are tough to come by but would consider one in very poor shape if available.

Reasonably priced, nice condition bolt guns and side by side are of interest too.

Buy or trade 12 ga magnum shells or if anyone is a traditional bowhunter I have hoards of cedar, ash, doug fir shafts and arrows. Even a few Sweetland Forgewood compressed shafts that are impossible to come by and a couple groups of 50's arrows for a collector.  Totally I have over 100 shafts to sort from for the correct firearm.

I get SS towards the end of the month and in serious need of such a shotgun for squirrel season to help with meat to eat. 12 or 16 ga are just too much gun IMO.

Old savage, wards, stevens, Mossberg pumps also acceptable. Need only be functional and not falling apart, safe to shoot. ""Cheap"" is the key word here, my apologies. Finances and health dictate most is gone for medical costs.

I've not modified it in any way or changed it from its stock form.    It will come with 5 mags.   A 10round chip McCormick power mag, an 8 round kimber mag, and 3 7 round kimber mags.  Depending on the deal or offer, the holsters pictured can be included.   I'd really like to trade this for a nice Sig P938 plus cash. Open to other handgun offers but if not a P938 then I'm asking for at least $450 with whatever else in trade.    I will also take cash offers as I'm not sure what to price this at.  I paid $1200 a few years ago for it an I'm the original owner.  Any questions or offers.  Text or email please.  765-918-85two six. jeremyl_13 at yahoo.com."

Before it was fired, I had the slide milled out for a Trijicon RMR and the whole slide was cerakoted Burnt Bronze -- all done by Fire4Effect Weapon Systems, great guy and a great craftsman. 

Stock sights, mag release, slide stop, etc. 

I stippled the grip, gave it side cutouts at the magwell for removing stuck mags. The grip is perfect -- very grippy, cutout on the trigger guard, slight glove bevel around the mag release, etc. 

The cerakote on the slide has some wear at the muzzle from holstering, which is inevitable. 

To attach an RMR (not included), you just fit it into the slot and then screw it in. There is a very tight fit which prevents any movement or loss of zero. 

Will include 3 factory Glock 17 mags, brand new in package Praetor Defense Glock 17 holster right hand (OWB) Glock handgun case, bore brush, manual, lock, etc. etc. 

 The picture with the G19 slide is a joke -- but you can see the Glock 17 slide and frame in the picture (just ignore the 19 slide). 

For the package with the Glock, holster, mags, case, etc. - $725 shipped to your FFL. USPS MO or paypal gift/+3.5%."

I am a former Marine Corps 2111/Small Arms Repair Technician, so be assured I have taken great care of this rifle over the years, and have added a few minor modifications. I took the wooden furniture off and re-finished it giving it a rich reddish-brown color, semi-gloss. I added a recoil buffer to keep the bolt and piston assembly from slapping into the receiver, dampening the recoil and wear on the rifle. I polished the bolt, giving it a smoother action, I also took a dremmel to the feed ramp ensuring a smoother more reliable feed. I installed a UTG aluminum quad-rail handgaurd allowing accessories to be attached. I also attached a Tapco Cage style flash hider.

Along with the rifle I am including 8 magazines (7 steel surplus ""ridgeback"" mags, and 1 10rd Tapco mag) 30rds of Wolf 122gr HP ammunition, a Leapers red/green dot sight, a quick release scope mount, a Knight Armament vertical grip, and a BLACKHAWK! quick release sling. I also still have the wooden handgaurds and original slant style muzzle brake, if you wish to return it to a classic configuration, which I'd be happy to do for you. 

I'm asking 800 which I believe is a fair price for this package, considering new ones are going at 650 with only 2 mags and a crappy sling. Please contact me at REDACTED if you are interested or have any questions."

This is a $400 discount on an otherwise new rifle so I think I'm being fair.  As I said, I've had health problems so please know what you want.  Go to the Gibbs site and use the internet to see reviews, it is truly a spectacular piece of history.  If you want the rifle, have your WA ID and you must come to Gig Harbor to pick it up.  Again, not to be rude, but go to a gun store and look at one if you're not familiar with this rifle, research the internet and have your mind made up if you decide you want this rifle.  I'm not a dealer and just want to sell it like a grownup to another grownup with minimal BS.  Thanks for looking

I have two (2) 91/30 . Was wanting to collect all the Russian built models but soon found out its nearly impossible.  That said... Both of these have been hand selected over several years. Wasn't looking for the average shooter but some of the finest examples I could locate. 

Looking to sell all together but not opposed to selling as individuals. 
The first is a 1928 Hex receiver 91/30. All the colors are uniform on the furniture.  Not like some that show the handling marks from combat. 
And the next 91/30 is a 1938 round receiver. It's also a hand picked rifle.  This one is still in cosmoline. Lightly wiped down to see all of the markings and quality of the stock. It's absolutely beautiful in color and looks to be an unissued rifle or possibly an officer rifle.  
Both of these are all matching numbers and appear to be unrearsonaled. None of the numbers have been slashed through and re numbered.  From all the research I've done on these, they do not show any signs of ever being repaired or pieced together.  
I also have all of the Bay o's and extras. I also have two tins of ammo to go with these... 
Asking $600 for it all. I can send pictures on request.  Here is one of them together. 
If you just want one of them I'm open to offers. Let's be reasonable folks. These are not every day shooters they are collectors. .. thanks for looking. ..

If you're going to lecture us like school kids you might want to check your facts:
1. ""high power"" is irrelevant. Mag law in Ohio applies weather you have a .17hmr or a .50 BMG.
2. Ohio law prohibits the USE not possession,  of magazines over  30 rounds. I can legally own a 100 round beta mag, but once I put that into a gun I have modified the gun to have a capacity of more than 31, which is then illegal.  http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/analysis-ohios-magazine-capacity-limit

This is my Sako Model 75 in ""Synthetic Stainless"" finish (synthetic referring to the stock and stainless to the action and barrel) in 270 win. This thing is a real tack driver used only for long range target shooting. In my novice hands and as it is set up it holds sub .75in MOA no problem. Imagine a shooter with decent skill... Includes a 4-16x50 mil dot scope with illuminated reticle. In good condition with the only wear being some light scuffing on the cheek weld from eye-pro and a couple of light marks on the top of the barrel near where the scope lens is. Bore is excellent. Very little use. The scope is mounted with expensive Sako optilock hardware. When I took it to a certain well known local huge gun store to get the scope mounts, they inspected the rifle and noted the excellent condition of the bore. Said it looked like it was barely fired. Bolt action feels amazing...so smooth. I hate to see this one go. I'm located in Acworth. Prefer to sell to someone with carry permit or do bill of sale for my protection."

""Almost"" BNIB, but BETTER it has been nicely upgraded. No quad-rails filled with flash lights, and other tactical gadgetry here. Just a nice simple shooter. Gun retails new for $869.99.

I have a M&P 15 Carbine in 5.56, 16"" barrel 1/8 5R twist. This specific rifle also has an M4 feed ramp which you wont find in other ""Money Saver"" A4 style AR rifles. Yet this is a true A4 upper.

It has a Hogue grip, a Yankee Hill Front gas block with a flip up front sight so you dont have the A2 front sight post (when using optics), and a Matech rear Mil spec peep sight, plus 7 mags.
