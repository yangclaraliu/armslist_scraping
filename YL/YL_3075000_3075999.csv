I have a blued Ruger sr9c in near mint condition with box and all factory accessories & paperwork. I purchased it from Shooter's World in January, fired exactly 96 rounds, cleaned it, and put it away. The only alteration made to it is I pulled out the Dremmel and polished the sh*t out of the feed ramp and barrel. You're welcome! 

Also up for trade is a Taurus poly Judge Public Defender. 2"" barrel, lightweight poly frame, blued cylinder, also near mint condition. Box, paperwork, hex key, etc. 

I can provide photos to anyone interested, obviously, but if you're reading this, you probably know exactly what they look like. I can provide ammo for both. 

So feel free to make me a trade (or possibly sale) offer. The worst I can say is no. Like anyone else, I'm interested in Ruger, Beretta, Sig, Kimber, Glock, S&W, Springfield, etc. I'll pass on the lower end Kel-Tec-type stuff, thank you.

The HK USP is the first HK pistol designed especially for American shooters. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely influenced by such famous designs as the Government model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP tactical is built for a rugged, dependable lifetime of service.

Israeli Military manufactured ammo that features a dark gray tipped bullet loaded with a Tear Gas agent.  

Based on what I was able to find - this ammo was produced in extremely limited quantities for a few months back in 1961.  

It was  designed to be able to deliver a dose of tear gas at much greater ranges than the larger caliber gas launching guns of the day were capable of (typically limited to about 150 yards). 

The idea was to shoot at a hard surface near the intended target thereby releasing the Tear Gas agent. 

I've tested several rounds of this ammo and it really works releasing a surprising amount of tear gas.

Ammo comes in it's original factory box and is in excellent (near perfect) condition.  

There are 20 rounds in the box that are loaded on four 5 round stripper clips.  

The ammo you see in the pictures is what you get. 

Primers are sealed with a purple color military sealer. 

This ammo is ever bit as deadly as any standard military ball round so it's not a novelty and must be treated with the same care as any live 7.62x51 ammunition. 

Price is $145 with pickup in the Brandon area. Shipping is available via UPS ground. Actual shipping cost will be determined by your location. You must be at least 18 years old to purchase."

7.62x39 AR pattern rifles are notoriously hard to get functioning. I have done some simple improvements to the rifle in order to get it to feed reliably 100% of the time. 

- Custom widened and polished feed ramps on barrel and upper receiver. This ensures a perfect line up between the mating surfaces of the barrel and receiver, leaving no edges or grooves for the bullet to get caught on.
- Wolff Xtra power hammer spring. This ensures no light primer strikes on even hard mil surp ammo. This rifle was tested with Wolf and Tulammo. Both brands functioned perfectly.
- Extra power mag spring in 30 round mag. The standard mag spring was replaced with a 5% extra power standard AK mag spring. This ensures even pressure on the follower to prevent ammo from tilting in the magazine. Because of the extra length of the spring, the 30 round magazine only holds 28 rounds.
- Front edges on magazines were lowered. I did this on both the 10 and 25 round magazines. This ensures that the edge of the casing does not get caught on the edge of the magazine.

All of these simple modifications were done to ensure proper feeding and cycling of the rifle. During my testing of this rifle, I experienced 0 failures.

Lightly used and certainly not abused. I used it some for a Glock 26, 17 and 19. It is specifically designed for  the G26,27&33 though. It is a retention holster but the release button is on the inside versus outside of the holster and your thumb is what makes contact with the button on the draw. Very simple to use and it is very secure. The holster is rigid kydex, belt loops are very thick leather and have some give so this is comfortable to wear. Selling because I do not own a Glock anymore.

Product Description

Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and ligher components. Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7."" Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire. 4-position sliding butt stock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations. Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications. Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures. Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud. Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance. Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories. Front barrel lug allows for easy mounting of a variety of accessories including bayonet. Features an A2 front sight and Magpul MBUS Gen2 flip up adjustable sight. Rear sight adjusts for both windage and elevation. High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness

Please do not message me saying you can get it online or somewhere else cheaper. If so then feel free to do that. The price is firm. I will not travel out of the Reno/Sparks area. I have no reliable transportation and that is why I am selling the handgun."
