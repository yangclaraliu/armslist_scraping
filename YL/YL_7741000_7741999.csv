The renowned A-bolt has a short 60 degree lift that incoporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the entire length of the bolt. When unlocked three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked these lugs provide massive bolt strength. The bolt feeds smoothly because of the unique patented cartridge depresor that stays in positoin independent of th ebolt rotation as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator locatd at the rear of the bolt offers visual firing pin status. The barrel is free floated and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of the receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity. The Boss SystemBallistic Optimizing Shooting System is a tunable option on this model. Rest assured once the concept is understood you will be using you BOSS equipped rifle and making adjustments on the fly like a pro and achieving top accuracy with all the loads you like. When you find a new load that you like it will only take a few groups and you will have your BOSS - and your rifles accuracy- tuned in to perfection. No other accuracy enhancement puts the power in the hands of the shooter like the BOSS does. BOSS theory indicates that moving the BOSS device along the barrel changes the vibration frequency or ""Sweet Spot"". The ""Sweet Spot"" is when the bullets exits the barrel at the top or bottom, as opposed to the middle of the wave, which are the times the barrel experiences the least amount of motion. Precision accuracy from the BOSS system is acheived by calibrating your rifle and ammo to your ""Sweet Spot"" setting. Video available online."

Last one I saw listed sold for nearly $1100, So I'm looking for close to $850. It's the closest you're going to get to a M9A3 without it being colored like a mudhut. Stainless finish, M9A3 frame, M9 style rail.
Two magazines.
 
HK USP with OG Case, Serpa-Derpa holster, GG&G rail adapter, two mags all the fixins. You can own this beautiful example of Kraut Space Magic for $650.
The ammo is NOT for sale seperately from the pistols. DISCLAIMER: NOT ALL THE BOXES ARE FULL, I LIKE TO SHOOT TOO. All in all it's probably a little over 200rnds of ammo not including the ammo that is already in my magazines... which you can have if you ask nicely.
 
If you buy em both I'll knock $100 off, deliver them to your door like a hot pizza, and give you a hug.
I did 4473s(standard background check when purchasing from an FFL) for both of these guns, so they're not just floating between hands.
I'm going to want a picture of your I.D. when ya buy it.
Hit my line @ 505-366-one42one if you're interested.
No I will not trade for free tattoos, or 46lbs of your mom's tamales, no matter how good they are.
My prices aren't super firm, so I'll take reasonable offers. Operative term; REASONABLE.

The 1895SBL has a stainless steel barrel and receiver, and a laminate wood stock for ultimate durability against the elements. The barrel has Ballard style rifling to handle all types of bullets—cast or jacketed. The full-length magazine tube holds 6 rounds of powerful .45-70 cartridges, and an enlarged lever loop allows shooter to cycle the action with gloved hands. The Marlin 1895SBL features side ejection, which simplifies scope mounting, and the gun comes with the versatile Lever Rail that allows mounting a standard riflescope on top the receiver, or a scout-style scope mounted farther out on the barrel. For quick, close-range shooting the 1895SBL comes with an excellent XS ghost ring, rear aperture sight mounted to the rail, and a front post with white line up the center. These sights are extremely rugged and do not get knocked out of alignment easily. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad helps absorbs recoil from heavy .47-70 rounds, allowing shooter to stay on target for fast follow up shots. A receiver-mounted crossbolt safety effectively blocks the hammer from hitting the firing pin. Sling swivel studs allow for the attachment of a rifle sling for convenient carry in the field with the hands free. Marlin 1895SBL is a very quick-handling Lever-Action Rifle that shoots a cartridge powerful enough to knock down any species of game in North America. The 1895SBL is built to hold up to rugged use in harsh environments. Made in USA. Manufacturer model #: 70478.

BCM keymod rail covers help a lot though. I'll include a few of them if you'd like.

It has a 16"", 1-7"" rifling, nitrided barrel (exact same barrel is used in the Sig 516) so you can shoot the heavy pills.  The lower is excellent, with right and left side magazine eject buttons, built in quick connects for single point slings, (also supports two point), and a rocker bolt catch/release. The Sig sets itself apart from other Direct Impingement M4's in several ways, including that it has no rattle or looseness between the upper and lower, thanks to the tensioner designed in which is adjustable, so it won't ever become loose either.  I bought it new.  It has had a lifetime total of 760rds fired through it in five outings, it's not even broken in.  I am the only owner.  It has NEVER had a FTF/FTE, using over a dozen differing types of ammo, expensive and cheap, light and heavy.  A very reliable carbine for the money.  

Also included are (4) 30-rd magazines, (3) 20-rd magazines, (2) 10-round magazines, all are Magpul PMAGs except 1 steel 30rd that came with it new from Sig, and several of them have never been used.

Included on it is a UTG 'Bug Buster' 3x9x32mm scope (One of the highest rated scopes on Amazon.)  Even though it's made in China, it's really a nice little scope.  Mil-dot 2nd focal plane illuminated reticle (red or green), lockable zero-resettable turrets .  UTG scope rings, with a special top half with a picatinny rail on it for mounting a micro red dot if desired.  The scope is sighted in at 100yds.  There is also a Bushnell TRS-25 3moa red dot sight, mounted on an included 45 degree offset (as pictured) for close range or fast-movers.  Sighted in at 50yds.

Included in the price is .223 and 5.56 ammo, including some ammo that's the absolute best; 40rds 75gr Hornady TAP, 20rds Hornady Match 75gr.,  60rds Mk262 Mod1 77gr SMK w/cannelure (40rds Black Hills, 20rds ASYM Precision), 100rds M855 62gr Light Armor Piercing Green Tip, 40rds 64gr Brown Tip tracers, 60rds Prvi Partisan 75gr match, and an uncle mike's 'tactical' carry bag with 5 magazine pouches and two other pouches (pictured).

Plus all the original equip., (forend, buttstalk, trigger assy, etc.)  and the boxes the stuff came in if you wish, including the original Sig box if you want it.  

Priced to move at $1100 Firm.  It's an excellent deal for what you get, it's really a solid, reliable shooter. 

Local sale only.  Purchaser must pay for the background check / transfer. (Tigard Pawn at the corner of 99W & Greenburg Rd. is the cheapest FFL I've found at ~$25, and it's fairly close to me.)"

Additionally the bright radiating search optic doesn't let you be with progressive dawn in the dark grope and it is a high-quality Monocular. Particularly interesting for many applications: the multiple mode of the Rangemaster. If two objects are differently far away in the sights on area, the distances are successively displayed. The LEICA PINMASTER offers further characteristics. LEICA PINMASTER, the professional laser rangefinder from Leica is a precision optical instrument that was designed specifically for the sport of golf. With the push of a button, it tells you exactly how far away you are from your target. Whether it is a flagstick or a tree, a hill or a sand bunker: thanks to the outstanding 7x magnification sighting optics and a measurement accuracy up to ± 1 m (3.28 ft), orientation becomes easy, even under difficult conditions.
