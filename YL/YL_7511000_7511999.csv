Stevens made a very good quality inexpensive gun in their day.  At 110 years old this onld single shot still functions great. However, the bushings are worn out from use, very common. The break barrel opens by dropping the lever. Becaust the bushings are worn you have to hold the lever up to fire it. Not a big deal, that is the normal position for your hand.I purchased this some time ago from a great pawn shop in Defiance. It was my sons first 22 rifle. He put about 150 eds through it. Still quite accurate.  However, as you see he has upgraded to a silver boy.I paid $179, and talked the guy down to get it for that. You won't find one complete under $300. The rifle could easily be parted out for well over that.  However, I would like to see it go to a collector.I prefer to trade for something else to out in my safe but feel free to make a fair cash offer."

The XD9 comes with original box and I have 5 16 round magazines and 3 13 round magazines; it only has about 100 rounds down range, it is an awesome shooter, and feels amazing in the hand. I bought it to replace my old glock 26 gen3 because that did not feel great in my hand (too fat of a grip). Well, I recently bought a gen 4 glock 26 and love it."

Single stack mag for (8) rounds, plus one more in the barrel, with an easily concealable pistol that you can stake your life on. If you are looking for that quality piece to carry, that won't wear you out by the end of the day, this is the gun for you. BUG guns are too small to handle in a stressful situation, and the full sized guns are very hard to conceal. The P239 is just the right size. Comes with DA/SA trigger group with hammer de-cocking. Comes with SIG case (2) mags and all SIG factory information. Come up to SIG quality for only $750"

I just prefer the standard wood stock and would like to trade my stock and handguard for your wood stock and handguard. Your Mini should be a 580 series(first 3 digits of serial number 580 or higher) so that it all fits correctly. Your stock will have to include the rear sling swivel and metal insert so that we both have a drop-in fit(the tac stock has rear sling swivel). I can be reached via text to 603-726-0986
