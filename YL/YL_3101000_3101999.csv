I had my red dot, flip up sights, and tac-light on it (those have since been spread around my collection).

Didn't keep a solid round count but I expect around 4-500. It has the production breaching barrel, pistol grip/collapsible stock combo with side saddle. I put some rail ladders on all the rails of the Full Length Black Aces Tactical Quad Rail and Heat Shield Combo. 

I tried to burn my hand by squeezing it after blasting 50 rds fast as I could and still didn't get burned. I also heat treated the racking bars and put some frog lube on it so it will rack like a champ. *Note* not that it is difficult but you do need to slam it when racking it. A friend of mine said this about it ""There is a piece that gets jammed and needs to be filed and polished. Mine was doing the same thing and I did that now I can rack it supper slow and it is SOOOO smooth."" I never really had an issue as I don't short rack it.

Standard Mossberg accuracy and the forend with the strap make it very comfortable.

The reason I am selling it is because I finally got my dream shotgun: KSG and have some immediate bills that came up.

Total capacity of 11rds in a mean package with lots of promise to make this your perfect home defense jewel.

I live in Lawrenceville,Travel through Forsyth on Sunday afternoons and work 9-6 in Alpharetta off of exit 10 on 400. Willing to drive a up to 30 min away. Farther for an interesting deal.

20 rounds - Federal JHP personal defense ammo
50 rounds - Blazer standard FMJ

Weapon is in excellent condition. I hold guns to a high standard so excellent means gun is just as if it were new. No wear, scratches, or rust.
Fired only 1 magazine through it (15 rounds). I bought it because I wanted it and I've had it for a while and it doesn't get carried or shot; it just sits around. I have other pistols I carry regularly and I'm joining the military so this is one less firearm I'll have to register on post.

I think the asking price is fair. I'm willing to accept reasonable offers. Just trying to get as much money back from it as possible.
I figured the hard case at about $20ish, maybe a little less.
Gun is right at $700 brand new.
Magazines are $20ish a piece.
JHP rounds were a little over $20 for the 20 rounds.
FMJ rounds were about $20 for the 50 rounds
That's roughly $80 without the cost of the gun...so as stated previously I think it's a fair asking price.

Bill of Sale willl be done at time of transfer of firearm. Also, I'll need to see a purchase permit, or a CCW permit, prior to allowing the trade for CYA purposes.
Thanks for viewing. More photos available if interested."

NMH-91 History
The NHM-91 is a semi-automatic civilian development of the Russian Kalashnikov AKM and RPK infantry small arm built by Norinco of China and marketed in the U.S. Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches compared to the 23.2 in of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod

About this rifle
This rifle is extremely accurate. The trigger is silky smooth just like all Chinese AK triggers. This particular rifle was manufactured in 1994. The barrel is chrome lined and has a threaded end. There is a muzzle nut tack welded onto the end of the barrel which, if you decided to remove it, would need to be dremeled off. I never did because I like my rifles in their original configuration. The internals on this gun are very clean and the rifling is excellent. I don't believe the gun has been shot very much. I have only put about 250 rounds through it. It is an absolute blast to shoot.

Aftermarket bipod

These are pretty sweet little lights, very bright. You don't need 600+ lumens...other wise you WILL blind yourself in indoor tactical situations. Shoot me a email  if you're interested in this nifty little light.

Powered by three AAA batteries the MERK uses a second generation LED to generate a blinding 180 Lumens. It is rugged and resistant to impact and water.
The MERK is 1"" in diameter the full length of the body, so it slides easily into your choice of scope rings or rail holders. With these stats it is obvious why the MERK is a contender in the flashlight industry.

No sport modifications made (traditional to secondary market of the old Mausers back in the '60s) ... Someone, at some point started carving a deer (possibly an antelope) on the stock, but never finished. 

Many Mausers this age were disassembled, then reassembled prior to hitting the private market. This resulted in mismatched serial numbers on weapon parts. ALL serial numbers match on this rifle: C 9032

The identical serial number (C 9032) is found ink-printed on the stock, and stamped in the metal of the magazine, the bolt, the chamber, and the barrel. 

I already have an offer on this gun, but I am listing it slightly higher than the offer price until Tuesday evening (2/27/14). If it is not sold and paid-for by then, I'll let it go to the buyer who made the original offer.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame with stainless steel slide. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.
