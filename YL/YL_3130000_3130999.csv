I bought this knife in early 2009. It is one of their custom handled knives, the right side of the blade is marked ""prototype"". The wood is one of a kind and unbelievable ocher spalted maple burl with a very aggressive and unique grain pattern!! I planned on using this for hunting, but couldn't bring myself to use it. I did sharpen it, it does have some slight scratches on the left side in front of the riccasso, and very faint marks from sharpening, couldn't get them to show up in pics.

The blade is a very nice convex grind, is approx. 5.5"" long, 3/16"" thick and overall knife length is 10"".

It comes with 2 leather sheaths, one from the factory, still in the plastic (opened for pictures) and another one I had made from a guy at work. This one is a high ride leather, perfect for hunting and sitting with.

The original price on the box was $299, I paid $285 plus another $50 for the extra sheath for a total of $335 spent.

Will sell for $275, , NOW $200.  I am also looking for a 22lr revolver or Glock G19 Gen 4 as trade (obvious cash on my end), I am open to other trades, let me know what you have.

It has a 14.5"" chrome lined barrel and chamber with a 1:7 twist and a YHM Phantom blind pinned to make it 16.2"" (LEGAL), carbine length (9"") Midwest Industries Gen2 free float handrail, Nickel Boron Black Rain Ordinance BCG (brand new haven't fired a shot with it), Spikes Tactical T2 (4.2oz) buffer, Rainier Arms Raptor Gen2 ambi charging handle, Troy ambi safety selector (1 short throw 1 standard length), and a Troy ambi mag release. All that and the gun only weight 6 lbs. unloaded. Included with the gun is 2 Gen2 P-Mags with windows, rear Magpul BUIS, Ergo foward grip, hard Pro-Max case, standard safety, charging handle, and mag release (if you dont like the ambi you can switch them back), and obviously the gun! I would like to make clear that this isnt a cheap or poorly made gun, Spikes Tactical is a very well known and reputable gun maker, and nothing that I have personally done to the gun will effect there work.... So please no junk or low ball offers. If you want anymore pictures or specific pictures feel free to ask. Thanks for looking! 

EDIT: The SL15 is high shelf unlike the ST15 which is low shelf. Have had a couple people ask so figured I could save the time by putting it in the listing."

This rifle has a super smooth bolt action, not like the Remington Walmart special. This rifle is brand new in box. Bought it for a hunting trip I never got to take. It's been in the safe since I've brought it home. I paid quite a bit more than what these are going for online today. (Not your problem I know) I have it priced under what it sells for online today. I can't move much on this price.

I have three boxes of Winchester 130 grain power-point for $30 for all, or $10 a box.(half of Walmart price).

Thanks for looking. It's a nice rifle. Check it out and shoot me a line.

http://www.positiveshooting.com/SilverPigeon1.html
Purchased new by me in June 2012.
From the Beretta website:
The Silver Pigeon I Sporting offers all the functional features of our premium over-under competition shotguns at a particularly attractive price. It is built around the best-in-class 686 action, which is compact and low-profile while being extremely strong. The Optima-Bore, Optima-Choke barrels are light-weight and place the shotgun’s point of balance right at the hinge-pin, meaning lively feel in the hands and natural pointability. And with its select-walnut stock and tasteful scroll engraving, the Silver Pigeon I Sporting won’t fail to turn heads at the range, also thanks to its unmistakeable Beretta looks."

Glock 26 (Sorry but I can get these at the L.E. rate of $398+tax so I'll trade one for $450 brand new. Less for a used one and yes, I will still need a little cash from you even for my OEM gun)

The Taurus Model 80 is a clone of the S&W Model 10.  It has a 4"" barrel, six shot cylinder, blued finish, and wood grips.

The mechanism locks up strong and works perfectly, and the bore is excellent. I've only shot it a few times since I got it several years ago, and it doesn't look to have seen much use at all before that.  Unfortunately, it was subjected to a couple decades of less than ideal storage by a previous owner, so there are some rust spots on the bluing.  

But this gun has a ton of potential.

Most of the rust is on the rear of the grip, which had turned the bluing into patina there. It looks like someone gripped the revolver, then stuck it in storage without oiling it properly. It would benefit from some TLC with a bronze brush and gun oil.  And if need be, you could potentially reblue the rust area, or the entire handgun could be refinished with something like Cerakote.

Also included with the revolver is a vintage Don Hume leather holster, along with 40 rounds of Remington FMJ and 70 rounds of Remington jacketed hollow point .38 special ammo.  (110 rounds total.)

$200 cash, or I'm looking to trade for a military surplus rifle or handgun, or a gun safe.

The Schmidt & Bender PMII outperforms every competitive scope in so many ways it is hard to know where to begin. This Schmidt and Bender scope has a nice solid feel and construction. Everything has a very uniform finish, tight tolerances and just excellent quality everywhere. The tube is a 34mm tube, which is becoming a more common tube diameter. There are many ring / mount manufacturers that make 34mm rings, so mounting for this particular scope was effortless. All of the moving parts are precise and smooth. The power adjust ring is very easy to grip and does not require a whole lot of effort to adjust, which is actually a little less common than you might think. There is a typical fast focus eye piece (diopter adjustment), which works wonderfully. The tube is a solid one piece tube, as you would expect, and the exterior finish is an exceptional anodized coating. The eye relief on the scope is also generous providing ample room to use the scope on high recoiling rifles without problem, and it easily covers a wide range allowing for quick full sight picture alignment.Of course, when you pay the big dollars for a S&B scope, the thing you are paying for is the optical quality, and this scope does not disappoint. The optics on the scope are exceptional

The wood is in great shape for being a 40+ year old used gun and the receiver, action,chamber, and barrel are in excellent shape. I was told when I got the gun that the round count was just under 1000 and I have put roughly 100 rounds through it myself. I would like to get at least $475 out of it, seeing as its been appraised at well over $500. 

Next I have a Ruger Air Hawk with a scope and and some pellets (there have been less than a can of pellets through this air rifle). The wood is in decent shape and the rifle works flawlessly. I bought the rifle for $169.99 new so I'm only looking to get about $80-$100 out of it.

Sarcasm Off:
This gun is F*****g ugly, but functional.  I ran one of the mags through it, and its fun as hell but just not my thing..  Im sure at one point this was really nice,  until someone at some point decided to first add, then remove the camo and some glue residue has been left behind as pictured.  Some of the paint has flaked as well.  An m4 stock kit looks to have been put on, which is also ugly.

902,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3130902,For Sale:  Dye Precision Rotor Paintball Loader - Red,"Stone Mountain, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 100,"Listed On: Sunday, September 21, 2014",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Dye Rotor is the most radical innovation in paintball loader technology fusing simplicity with mind blowing feed rates and reliability. It is easy to see why the Rotor has become the number one choice in loader technology among top level player's worldwide. 

The Rotor™ is the most energy-efficient loader in the sport, boasting a battery life of over 80,000+ ball shot count with only 3 AA batteries. The Rotor™ features a positive push button with a bright LED display informing you of when your hopper is powered on or off. The Dye Rotor system has a variety of upgrades such as color kits, quick feeds and high capacity tops. 

Low Profile Design

The Rotor™ is already one of the lightest 200-round loaders available; we've now equipped it with Low-Profile Design, a unique design that pushes balls straight down over a short distance, allowing for a small loader size and shape and an extremely low profile.

Tuff Molding

The Rotor™ is constructed with Dye's proprietary Tuff™ Molding, In testing, we found that a Rotor™ built with Tuff™ Molding could withstand a drop from a three-story building. Coupled with a water resistant coated board makes this hopper fully functional even underwater. Nothing you'll encounter on a paintball field could penetrate our Tuff Molding and cause your loader to break. 

Constant Feed

The Constant Feed Rate feature ensures a feed rate of over 50 balls per second, far exceeding pro level requirements. Rapid/Constant Feed is made possible by the combination of the Rotor™ Loader's constant feed rotor carousel, and the opposing rotation of the center rotor arm. The result is a smooth, consistent, rapid, and dependable feed performance. 

Rapid Reload

Rapid Reload makes reloading a quick and easy process. The Rotor™ has a transparent locking lid, integrated into an interchangeable dual density carrier, which allows for fast loading and a secure closure. The Rotor™ has a 200-ball capacity, 20% more than most competing loaders, and a revolutionary spring-loaded collapsing floor. Lastly, see-through windows make it easy to monitor your paint level. 

Toolless Maintenance

Tool-less Maintenance makes assembly and disassembly a rapid, highly intuitive, and effortless process. A simple slide of the locking tab and push of a button enables the breakdown of the loader for basic cleaning and maintenance. 

Sharkfin Jam Release Trigger

A simple squeeze of the Sharkfin Trigger, located on the underside of the Rotor™, releases the jammed paint immediately. 

BlackOps

No one wants to give his or her position away during night play. This unique feature enables you to turn the ON/OFF LED off during those night or low light games. 

Adjustable Torque

The Rotor allows you to fine tune your torque setting manually for any paint you encounter."

UPDATE: after urging from some interested parties who had concerns about buying an unproven rifle, I loaded 28 into a pmag and hit the range. Not a single ftf/fte,  fired in groups of 10-10-3-5, with the three round interval being as fast as I could squeeze. She's been cleaned again, and ready for pickup.

Began life as a stripped spikes lower receiver.  I gently laid a psa lpk in it, slapped an a2 and m4 on it, and crowned it with a factory assembled and test fired non chrome-lined upper from psa.
Then I test fired the whole rig briefly, and put it in the safe. It's spring cleaning time, and this is the last of my safe stash to need a new home.

Comes as shown plus a 30 rd pmag in your choice of black or flat dark earth.
