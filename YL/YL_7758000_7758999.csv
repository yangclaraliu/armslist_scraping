0,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7758000,For Sale:  Rare! Discontinued Glock Replica,"Wyoming/Grandville, Grand Rapids, Michigan",$ 35,"Listed On: Thursday, December 28, 2017",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a pair of spring Glock replicas that are no longer in production. One is a replica of a Gen 2 Glock 17, the other is a replica of a Gen 3 Glock 26. It's my understanding that these were discontinued due to legal action taken on behalf of Glock alleging copyright violations. I beleive these were made in the 90s or early 2000s. I looked around a bit and wasn't able to find any for sale online. The G17 is in perfect working order, but I don't beleive the G26 will shoot. The magazine on the G26 appears to have been modified with finger rest. Both function like the real deal: you can rack the slides and eject the magazines. The slides lock open on an empty magazine, but the internal piston on the G26 does not cock when the slide is pulled back. Might be fixable. As a neat collector item, for display, or plinking around in your backyard, these are great. Not something you see everyday. I'm looking for $35 but I'm open to all offers. Add $15 to ship if not selling locally."

Selling my never fired AR-15 cause I made a wrong choice when buying it. (Story behind this) So when I bought this rifle I planed on changing just a few things on it and all would be good, well........ I started changing everything and when I started looking at what I had bought for it and what I still wanted to change I would've changed all but the upper and lower receiver's. So to make a long story short I should've just built one. :-S Oh well, live and learn. So anyway I never got around to shooting this rifle so it's still in a brand new state all be it with an owner attached to it. As I like the Pmag gen 2's over the gen 3's I'm keeping the gen 2 that came with it and bought a gen 3 Pmag to include with the rifle. It will also at no additional cost too buyer be coming with the 150 rounds of 5.56 that I bought for the rifle and a bore snake. (That's right, FREEBIES! :-) ) If you have any questions please text or call at REDACTED. About calls from 2:30pm to Midnight. I work these hour's and can't have my phone ringing, if you get hung up on sorry but just leave a voice mail or text back and I'll reply on a break or lunch.

It is fitted with a Madbull Punisher bushing compensator and a pair of real steel 1911 pearly grips that have been modified to fit. The original box, grips, and bushing are included. I've only put a few mags through it before the current magazine broke - which means the internals are in good shape but it will need a new magazine to function properly. Aside from the magazine, there's a small gouge in the left slide of the slide, and the safety is a little floppy. None of this affects the functionality of the gun. Overall, it's a very unique looking and intimidating sidearm for the aspiring airsofter who cosplays as a drug cartel hitman or the like. Replacement mags for the 1911 run about $20, and that's all you'd need to get the 1911 back into action. Even without the magazine, it's a great display piece. Included with the 1911 is a pair of 2011 pistols that are purely for parts or display. One is a Tactical Master model and the other is a Dragon model. They're both in relative disrepair but probably have a lot of salvageable components. If you know your way around these things I'm sure you could build one functional pistol from the two of them. I'm looking to get $100 for the three pistols, but I'm open to all offers. Feel free to shoot me any questions you may have. For non-local buyers, add $20 for shipping."

Most are completely unused, and they are all in excellent to like-new condition. I'll need to see a copy of your LTC and will only ship to the name/address shown on LTC. I'm happy to send you a copy of my Nevada DL and CCW permit to maybe ease concerns of scamming. Paypal isn't going to work for ""high-capacity"" magazines, so let me know of any payment ideas you have where we can both be assured we're not being scammed.

An amazing rifle for an amazing price. And to top it all off, this rifle is brand new. I bought this rifle a little over a year and a half ago and it has sat in my safe for that entire time. I bought it with the intention of getting into long range shooting, but I haven’t had the time. Therefore, I haven’t fired a single round through this sexy beast. What better way to treat yourself or spend that tax refund than adding this beauty to your collection.If you haven’t heard, these rifles are accurate. We’re talking under .5 MOA accurate, and FN has said that accuracy extends to at least 10,000 rounds. This is a rifle you can buy and shoot with confidence for a very, very long time. The barrel is 24” long, chrome lined, and has a heavy profile. The rifle is chambered in .308/7.62, and the action is (professionally) bedded to a McMillan A4 stock. The scope rail is Badger Ordinance. This is an amazing deal, and I can't go any lower than this price. I am not looking to trade. If buyer is outside the state of Florida the rifle must be shipped to an FFL, and prior to shipping the FFL will be verified through the ATF. The only payment methods I will accept are cash, personal check (funds must be confirmed prior to shipping or delivery), and paypal.

For sale: Nice USED Para Ordnance LTC-PXT 1911 Semiautomatic Pistol in 45ACP ( .45ACP ). Contrasting black tones, all metal. You determine the condition.I am not the original owner.
This is a nice example of this Canadian company’s offerings, whose claim to fame were double stacked 1911s. With a barrel length of 4.25” and full-sized grip frame, it is essentially a duplicate of the Colt Commander's dimensions.- Frame is alloy to make it a bit lighter (25 oz.), and combined with the shorter length makes it an ideal concealed carry piece.- The match-grade barrel has an integral ramp.- PXT is Para's Power Extractor design, which is larger than that of a typical 1911, and results in better extraction and ejection of casings.- The blackened finish is business-like and also weather resistant.- The gold highlighted lettering was probably a custom or distributor special.Admittedly, it would look good open carried as well. 
Gun shoots very nice, and to me not too different from a full-sized all-steel 1911.
Some scratches here and there, but this is a working gun.
It has been ultra-reliable, and would make a hard to beat carry or family defense gun.
Comes with 4 7-round magazines.
$600 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will consider ammo plus cash.Might be interested in a trade for an AR, AK, Mini-14, a centerfire semiauto pistol with barrel longer than 5"", or even a full-sized 1911.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees.________________________________________________________________________________Buyer agrees to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License and CHL firstand sign a simple Bill of Sale.-> Nothing besides our names/signatures and the gun info will be on it.I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.A Bill of Sale will protect us both.

For sale: Nice once-USED ISSC Model Mk-22 SCAR clone, 2nd. Generation, Semiautomatic Rifle in .22LR.I am the original owner.
The design is based on the FNH SCAR-16S military rifle. Desert tan polymer folding stock. Took to the range only once and only went through a magazine.It functioned flawlessly.
Gun is made in Germany, shoots very nice, and is inherently accurate.Functional benefit is the 16"" Lothar Walther precision match barrel.Cool features are flip-up sights, a charging handle with 3 positions right AND left, and a fully folding stock!
It would be a fun plinking gun for the whole family, and certainly much cheaper to buy and shoot than the actual SCAR.
Comes with two original 22-round magazines (one black, one tan),original box, paperwork, etc.The sling pictured is not included.
$280 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will consider ammo plus cash.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees.________________________________________________________________________________Buyer agrees to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License and CHL firstand sign a simple Bill of Sale.-> Nothing besides our names/signatures and the gun info will be on it.I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.A Bill of Sale will protect us both.

The stock has an aluminum block so there is no need for bedding.The barrel is 20 in with 1:10 twist.  The barrel has an AAC brakeout with 51t ratchet system if you ever get out of this state and want to put a suppressor on it. It does a great job of recoil management while also hiding flash. The stock also has an adjustable comb; also hydro-dipped, to adjust cheek wield and sight alignment. The trigger is a timney adjustable down to 1.5 lbs I believe, its set to about 2.5. It is magazine fed, and I have 2 magazines for it, an accurate mag and magpul, both 10 rounds. The bolt knob is an over-sized badger ordnance. For a scope base i have a nightforce 20 moa. I currently have 3 308 rifles, and I haven't shot this one in awhile now. I have loading data for it as well for what i found was the best recipe for it. Its a legit tack driver, but i don't have a ton of time to shoot, and when i do, i use my other rifles. The hydrodip is not professional by any means, it came out a little faded which I really liked. If you have any questions please let me know. I have more pictures. 1,000 for gun without optics."

I bought 2 sets of these brand-new from CDNN several years back when they had a run of these in stock.These fit perfectly on most any square-butt K-frame, I've had them on a model 10 and model 15.

I don't text, and I'm not calling any phone numbers until I'm sure I'm speaking with a legitimate local buyer, so please, try and sound like one.)Thanks for looking......"

938,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7758938,For Sale:  German Army Flecktarn rucksack,"Seattle, Seattle, Washington",$ 80,"Listed On: Thursday, December 28, 2017",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"German efficiency and practicality at its best. These medium-sized rucksacks are meant to carry everything that a German soldier needs in the field. A very affordable pack for what it is.
In short, a good smaller rucksack for situations where a huge pack is simply too much and a daysack too small, like a classic overnighter or a couple of days hike. The volume of this one is about 65 litres.
Besides the main compartment, this ruck has several others: bottom of the pack has a separate compartment for rainwear, which is closed with a zipper and snap buckles. The two side pockets are quite large and are only stitched on from the sides. This has been done so that other equipment, e.g. an axe or a shovel, can be stuffed in behind the pocket. The web loops on the front are meant for a rifle, but can fit skis for instance (you'll have to come up with suitable straps yourself). The flap is large and has a pocket on top of it, and straps for a sleeping bag.
Although this pack does not have a frame, the Bundeswehr issue folding sleeping mat slips into a separate compartment and keeps the pack rigid and makes it really comfortable to carry. This also eliminates the need to carry a traditional roll-mat outside the pack, essentially allowing more stuff to be strapped on if needed. Sleeping mats sold separately when available. An alternative option is to secure a traditional roll mat to the rifle attachment points and use the folding mat pouch for something else, like a DIY stiffener and a hydration bladder.
Made of tough and durable cordura.
 
There are many new flecktarn rucksack being sold here at lower price but those cheap chinese copies can't compare to German quality."
