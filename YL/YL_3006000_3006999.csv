The English made No.4 Mk.1's are more rare/collectable because North America actually made more of the Brits' rifle than they did, themselves. Smooooooth action, cosmoline free (I thoroughly clean all my milsurps when I aquire them, and after each time I shoot them). The previous owner told me that the rifle was restained by an Enfield collector to look as if it just came from the factory, but was NOT sanded. Still has quite a bit of the original black painted finish on the metal which reduced glint and visibility by the enemy. All trades considered...junk will be ignored. Price is $400.00 obo.

Selling my hornet because I have about every varmint caliber and wouldn't mind to thin out the herd. I bought the rifle with a weaver K4 on it, but went to a new Leupold fixed 6. This rifle shoots very very well (too good for an old 4 power) and is very easy on the ears. 22 hornet makes a great varmint cartridge especially for those who keep pelts. The model 54 wasn't made in hornet for very long and collector grade rifles sell for over $2k but this is a shooter. I am a gunsmith so all cleaning and such has been done professionally. I am willing to take trades too. I have 3 boxes of hornady 35gr vmax and 100 rounds of remington soft point along with brass and dies. One of the few small caliber rifles built on a full sized platform, and has a very cool magazine. Asking $600 for everything. The scope was $300, ammo and dies $200+ so I think my price is more than fair but feel free to shoot me an offer. Email or text tyler at (858) three 49 six 589. Thanks"

The P220® Carry Elite is an 8+1 capacity compact-length pistol with a full-size frame. Chambered in .45ACP and available in a durable Nitron® finish, the P220 Carry Elite features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertailed grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite comes equipped with SIGLITE Night Sights."

Stated on press ""Designed for straight wall metallic cases""  Serial number 4793 .  When I contacted P.W. they indicated this was an early Metallic II press.  The label does not indicate a specific model.  It is in good condition.  The press raises and lowers smoothly.   It is just as shown.  It doesn't come with any of the priming features.  I can send more pictures upon request.  Ponsness Warren built these to last a couple lifetimes.  The last one on eBay , that was similar to this one, went for $293.55 plus $25 shipping.  I'm asking $280 for mine.  I'm not too interested in shipping it and would rather find a local buyer who can appreciate the press.

Like our Cop holster, a tension unit allows for micro-adjustment of the feel of the draw and precision fit to the pistol. 

Although we combined features from other holsters, the SSS has a feature that truly sets it apart from our other belt holsters: unmatched comfort. If you want a belt holster that will make you forget it's there - until you need it - the Side Snap Scabbard is the holster for you.

Lower:

The upper has Not been fired, but the BCG does have a low round count, so does the lower. I painted the lower with my own mix of marine epoxy and the highest grade glow pigment on the market (V10 Green). I don't have the means to hold onto novelties anymore, so I have to sell this... The epoxy has been sanded where needed to allow the lower to function reliably.
The lower glows SO bright that you can literally read with it...You can also use a UV laser to write anything you want on it, or use a regular flashlight. The glow pigment alone probably cost me around $60 and the epoxy another $20, plus many hours...Used the lower on another upper for a night time 3-gun match and got a ton of comments on it.
Just wanting to get what I put into the whole thing--not including labor.
Asking just $975 shipped or $925 FTF. You won't find another one of these...that is for sure!"

I got this in as trade for a pistol, but truly have no need for it (too many AR15’s as is).  This upper is truly nice and I do know that I was the one who added the chrome bolt carrier (as it came with a standardblack  phosphate coated AR15 BCG).  I also added the flip-up sights and kind of “bore sighted” it in @ 25 yards.  
The bore on the barrel is superb and sharp, and I doubt there was anything more than 200 rounds put through this barrel.

What makes this pistol rare is the stainless, no plastic here but also it has low profile combat sights instead of the dorky adjustables that looked like reminiscent of a camaro spoiler. Has some scratches from carry but the stainless polishes up well masking most of the wear it has picked up in 15-20 years. Id say hop on Gunbroker to compare but there isnt one like it to compare, only adjustable sight pieces going for more with only one mag  I dont need to sell this as i love to carry it but id like to work on some other projects.
