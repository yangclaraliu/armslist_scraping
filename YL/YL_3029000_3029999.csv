You all know it--it's ubiquitous right now, and for good reason. The shield is a super thin, very comfortable and ergonomic pistol. A nice option for concealed carry, but also not too small to have fun at the range. This one was bought new about two months ago and has 200 rounds through it and has been treated very well, having been cleaned completely each time fired. The gun is blemish-free, no marks whatsoever. I haven't even carried it besides wearing it for a couple of hours at home to feel it out. Not much else to say--just a great little gun of top quality. I just don't particularly need it right now and so decided it can go.

Included with the pistol is the box in which it came, containing all the paperwork, test shell, etc. Also, two new seven-round magazines in addition to the two (one seven, one eight-round) that came with it. The magazines are tough to find right now because this gun is so popular and I paid almost $40 each for them. So, if you are planning to buy one of these new, this could be a good option to get a couple more mags along with it. The pistol truly looks new. Thanks for looking."

“The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.”

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

Up for sale is one bag containing 250 bullets. Hollow point design uses a small hollow point leaving plenty of metal in the nose of the bullet. This is to eliminate the problem with some hollow points where the nose of the bullet fragments and leaves very little mass/weight for penetration. The bullet holds together in a heavy-hitting bullet. You WILL be happy with all aspects of this bullet - it feeds well, it shoots accurately, and hammers the target with a heavy bullet.

Shipping for one bag of 250 bullets is a flat rate of $6.00 to U.S. addresses only.

The gun is in excellent condition and will come with Leupold rings/bases and a Bushnell Elite 3200 3-9x40 scope. The only reason I'm debating on selling is to consolidate my hunting rifles. This is a very nice gun and they are hard to come by. I will listen to offers ,but I don't have to sell and will be fine with keeping it if I need to. $650 cash for gun, rings/bases, and scope. Ammo available separately. Please send contact info and I will get back asap. Thanks

I purchased this pistol for my sister in January and she just isn't into guns. Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing. Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.

I do not want your grandpa's old rifle or your plain jane factory setups. Cash is king and most trades will be considered. Also, do not include ammo in your trade value. That does me no good after its been shot. Trade values will be firearm for firearm.

I brought it out and ran 100 rounds through it with NO problems at all. So this PF9 works flawlessly.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

DESCRIPTION

The RUGER P45GMK3PRRP Pistol, 22 LR, 4.50in Barrel, Blued, Bull Barrel (10149) provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger 22/45 pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol. In addition to the identical grip angles, the pistol features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making it perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train."

Modern warriors needed an AR-15 weapon that could overcome the harshest tactical environments.

The result is the ruggedly dependable SIG516.

Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."
