So instantly he's sketched out and thinks I'm giving excuses and lying. I've responded to several messages and replied with serial numbers. They are not sold yet but have plenty buyers that want them. Whoever is interested and wants serial numbers can easily get them. Everyone else I responded to has talked to me like I was a human and didn't criticize me with racial assumptions.

Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM®Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.BCM® Presents the KMR *ALPHA*All of the same unique features and advantages of the widely favored BCM® KMR Handguard, now offered in 100% AluminumAs a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.Cold Hammer Forged Barrels: This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH™ series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)M4 Feed Ramp Barrel ExtensionM4 Feed Ramp Flat Top ReceiverIn developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.T-Marked Upper ReceiverThe contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.USGI 1/7 Twist RateThe USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.Chrome Bore and ChamberOne of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.5.56 NATO ChambersThe USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight BasesMil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases-------------------------------"

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the gun and it shoots amazing. I've put 500 rounds through it and I clean and maintain the rifle regularly. I've including everything that you see in the picture, which includes two Magpul PMAG mazines, a Magpul STR butt stock, Magpul MOE rail sections, Vortex cantilever scope mount, Blackhawk vertical grip, bipod and a Bushnell 4.5-18x40 Dropzone 223 DBC reticle that is sighted in for 100 yards and can easily shoot up to 300 yards. When not at the range, the gun has been stored in the Plano All Weather Tactical case that you see in the picture and although the case details for $75 new, I am including it FREE with the rifle purchase. The case has 5 latches that have key locks. I am including the original case that it comes with, the original box it shipped in and all manuals and the gun lock. I'm also including the original butt stock.I'm asking $1,000 or best reasonable offer. Considering that a brand new Saint costs $900 and if you had to purchase all the accessories I'm including, it would cost you approximately $1,300 at your local Cabelas or gun shop when you include taxes and possibly a background check fee.If you don’t need or want all of the accessories, I can sell you the rifle in original case with the Magpul butt stock and extra PMAG magazine for $800.You would need to pay in cash, money transfer via Zelle, but can also accept credit cards swiped with Square. However, there is a 3% processing fee you would need to pay would be $30. Otherwise, I'm perfectly happy with cash. No checks of any kind and no I will not just the gun without ever meeting you.To complete the sale, you can either show me a valid CCW permit at purchase (to verify you're not a felon). If you don't have a CCW, then we will need to fill out a firearms bill of sale with your name, address and drivers license number.

It has the original holster dated and w German markings and w an extra mag. Tests during development proved that the handgun was very accurate and stable (due to its size and mass, most stresses are absorbed and not passed on the shooter), while at the same time remaining reliable after firing more than 6,000 rounds. The Vis was generally regarded as one of the best military pistols of that period.Whether for regular use or collection of an authentic weapon from WWII this will fill both needs. I Saw others on here for much much higher than what I feel these should be priced at so I know I will be lower than them all.

Cornell Firearms Company is a trade name used by Hopkins and Allen Arms Company on hammerless shotguns made under designs marketed formerly by Forehand Arms Company. Hopkins and Allen purchased Forehand Arms Company in 1902 and continued to produce Forehand models until H & A went bankrupt in 1916. There are no records to give an exact date of manufacture.
Although this gun has fluid steel barrels, it was manufactured with the technology of 1900. Additionally, shotgun chambers of this era were often shorter than today's 2 3/4"" shells. If shooting is contemplated, and evaluation by a competent gunsmith to determine barrel condition and chamber length is recommended. Firing a 2 3/4"" shell in a short chamber creates dangerously high pressures that could damage the gun and injure the shooter and bystanders.
If deemed safe to use, only light field and target loads can be recommended. Under no circumstances should a 3"" Magnum shell be fired in this gun, even though it will fit in the chamber."

This one stands out for the gorgeous wood though it also has excellent metal finishes as well. Made in 1943, it has all numbers matching that I can see. Ending in 3837, it is on the buttplate, receiver and the magazine/trigger assembly on the bottom. WOOD-- The wood is a laminate type stock I believe with a glossy finish. There is an amazing mix of darker brown, medium tones and golden blonde in the swirls and pattern. The top and bottom edge of the butt and the bottom of the barrel have many parallel lines in the wood, while the sides have center rings and outer ones that swirl and curve. The sides of the butt and beneath the receiver are the best. There are some light and minor scuffs just in front of the barrel bands from sliding them off as they would scrape the wood some. These are minor. METAL-- The metal finish is EXC with the front barrel an even dark finish with no marks from the bayonet. Even the sight hood, cleaning rod and barrel bands have an excellent finish. The receiver has a matte finish with less gloss than the rest and the import stamp is electro-penciled as most recent imports are. The buttplate is the finest bluing as it is glossy and blue and in fantastic condition. BORE/ACTION-- The bore rates a Good+ though in the world of Mosins it is likely a step or so higher as many are not so great. The rifling is all sharp with deep grooves which is the most important part and in the grooves is where you find areas that are not shiny and smooth. To be fair, I have NOT cleaned this bore with a metal brush and have only used paper and cotton patches. It could VERY WELL clean up to EXC as it very nice rifling and a tight bore. ACCESSORIES-- Comes with the dog-collar sling in EXC+ condition, a never used bayonet with a perfect finish and untouched point. Could easily be unused/unissued. Also has the double pouch and then the tools and cleaning items. What is included is in the photos. SHIPPING-- This will ship as a 12 pound box 50+ inches long from 33324. Either Fedex Ground or USPS Priority are the same $42.95. If you live in the Southeast, Fedex will be lower and I will refund the difference. PAYMENT-- For Paypal, you must use ""SEND MONEY TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS"" to avoid fees and please let me know BEFORE paying as my Paypal address is different than the one used here.

Action still cycles like new, trigger pull is neat and crisp. Pros-Comes with a rifle case, Hogue stock and a Bushnell scope. Just need ammo and you're set.Cons- No sling, the butt pad has a tear on the bottom. Chunk missing made it cheaper the buy."

It is a part to convert a standard AR-15 to be CA compliant, which permanently attaches the magazine to the AR. The MA Lock, actually breaks off inside the mag release button after installation so it cannot be removed without an extractor. The MA Loader is a special magazine that allows you to reload the gun through the ejection port, the gun cannot fire until it is removed. Accordingly by having a fixed magazine, you are allowed to keep your features, pistol grip, adjustable stock, flash hider. So I have two sets of, 1 MA Loader and 1 MA Lock, asking $60 per set, they are brand new in the packaging. When I originally bought these, it took 6 months to get them, they are still on backorder due to the huge demand. During that time, I went ahead and converted to featureless. My loss your gain.Too see them in action,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h69CU84eDl4"
