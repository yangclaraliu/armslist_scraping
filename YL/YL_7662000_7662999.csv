It's great for self defense especially home defense because being a 9mm the defense rounds options are endless, mixed w a 16in barrel, and incredibly light weight rifle w light recoil. It becomes usable by man, woman, small, big, older, inexperienced, etc. for all the same reasons it also a very fun rifle to just take out to the range or compete with because of how fast and accurate it can be used.

Finish about 70%, and has a nice vintage look  This is a very nice conceal carry Mouse gun. Although it's designed for up-close-and-personal work, it is a surprisingly accurate model. Very small and perfect for either pocket or purse carry.  Really needs to be cleaned an oiled (actually found lint in the barrel).  Good bore with nice rifling. Passes function test."

Marlin used this ivory symbol to identify their very best rifles (you can research this on Google). And you can tell it, as the action on this rifle has a smoothness and quality feel about it that exceeds any rifle that I have ever owned.This was just built in a time when they were built better, with more care and attention to detail, and the polishing of the internal parts.It operates perfectly of course, and will be the best hunting rifle in anybody's collection, if added to it.It is a used gun, not a safe queen.

Milled steel trigger group and receiver. Included is a factory Remington +2 magazine extension (new and just installed from Midway USA) and the original magazine spring and hardware. This shotgun holds 6 rounds in the magazine. The stock and forend is wood and the barrel and receiver is phosphate cover. It shows signs of being carried in a patrol car, but the action is smoother than any modern produced pump shotgun and the barrel is mint looking. They don’t make 870s like this anymore! Bead sight and stock recoil pad. Prefer local sale near the Oviedo area. Will ship for $25 for standard ground shipping (faster shipping or insurance is extra at actual cost). Must receive USPS money order or certified bank check prior to shipping. I am not interested in trades, price is firm. The shotgun is cleaned and lubed and ready for home defense or range."
