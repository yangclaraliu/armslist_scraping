Browning designed M1911.
You will also see a picture of all the .45 ACP ammo and components I have for sale.  I was a  .45 handloader in years past.  I have approximately 15 boxes of 45 ACP ammo, a few rounds missing out of some of them, and quite a few loose miscellaneous rounds.  I’m including a set of Lyman 45 ACP reloading dies, some factory bullets and at least 1,000 cast bullets ready to load.  There are also at least 1,000 round of brass, a lot of it cleaned, sized and de-primed.  There is even a small lot of primed brass, ready to load. I’m asking $1,300 for the whole lot, pistol and ammo.  The gun is very collectable, but it's also made to shoot.  It would be a perfect gift for somebody special.
This legendary Colt Commander .45 auto is a lot of gun for the money, especially when the cost of ammo is factored in.  It's small enough for concealed carry, and perfect for home or car defense.  With all the ammo and components included, you will be able to shoot cheaply for many years.   Reply to my ad with your phone number and we'll meet so you can exame this Colt Commander.  I know you won't be disappointed.  Please be prepared to show me your Oklahoma Driver's License for proof of residency."

Springfield 1911 Range Officer Champion 9mm Specifications: 

Caliber: 9mm 

Barrel: 4"" Stainless Steel Match Grade, Fully Supported Ramp Bull 

Sights: Fiber Optic Front & Low-Profile Combat Rear 

Magazines: 2 – 9+1 Round Steel Magazines 

Grips: Cross Cannon™ Double Diamond Cocobolo 

Weight: 31.5 ozs. 

Frame: Forged Lightweight Alloy 

Slide: Forged Carbon Steel 

Recoil System: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod 

Height: 5.5"" 

MFG P/N: PI9137LP 

The Range Officer® Champion™ is a perfect fit for those looking for a concealable 1911 that won’t weigh them down. While a normal, all steel 1911 can weigh over two and a half pounds empty, the 9mm Champion™ tips the scales at just 31.5 ounces. The .45ACP model weighs in even less at just 30 ounces, thanks to the bigger hole in the barrel. That’s quite a difference when it’s on the hip all day. 

While the overall height is the same as that of the Range Officer® Operator®, the Champion™ includes a four inch stainless steel match grade barrel as opposed to the Government size five inch barrel. In the Champion™, we use a bull barrel fitted to the slide that houses a supported ramp to save wear and tear on the frame over time. As a result, we can use lighter weight forged aluminum for the frame. That helps us shave weight for its intended carry mission. The sights are all business, with a fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that won’t snag during the draw. For recoil control and function, we use a dual-spring assembly that allows us to control precisely the recoil impulse in this smaller package, thereby ensuring reliable function with a minimum of fuss to the shooter. 

The Range Officer® Champion™ is available in 9mm and .45ACP. Both models ship with two magazines, seven rounds each for the .45ACP and nine rounds for the 9MM. Even though the Range Officer® Champion™ is smaller and lighter, you won’t have to sacrifice capacity for carry convenience."

The XD(M)Â® 4.5â€ Full Size OD Green is the perfect 9mm pistol for those who are looking for full-size performance, sight radius and handling. The result is a service size pistol thatâ€™s ready for anything.  The XD(M)Â® 4.5â€ Full Size OD Green includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.  Your total XD(M)Â® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M)Â® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)Â® pistols.  Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)Â®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.  â€¢ (M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.  â€¢ (M)ulti-Adjust Rail Systemâ„¢: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooterâ€™s hand position. â€¢ (M)eloniteÂ®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged MeloniteÂ® finish on the XD(M)Â® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.  â€¢ (M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)Â® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry."

It's a tack-driver and very easy to handle; great carry gun too. It's missing the OEM holster, but everything else that came with the gun is included (mags, different colored pipes, tools, etc). Springfield 1911 Range Officer Champion 9mm Specifications:  Caliber: 9mm  Barrel: 4"" Stainless Steel Match Grade, Fully Supported Ramp Bull  Sights: Fiber Optic Front & Low-Profile Combat Rear  Magazines: 2 â€“ 9+1 Round Steel Magazines  Grips: Cross Cannonâ„¢ Double Diamond Cocobolo  Weight: 31.5 ozs.  Frame: Forged Lightweight Alloy  Slide: Forged Carbon Steel  Recoil System: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod  Height: 5.5""  MFG P/N: PI9137LP  The Range OfficerÂ® Championâ„¢ is a perfect fit for those looking for a concealable 1911 that wonâ€™t weigh them down. While a normal, all steel 1911 can weigh over two and a half pounds empty, the 9mm Championâ„¢ tips the scales at just 31.5 ounces. The .45ACP model weighs in even less at just 30 ounces, thanks to the bigger hole in the barrel. Thatâ€™s quite a difference when itâ€™s on the hip all day.  While the overall height is the same as that of the Range OfficerÂ® OperatorÂ®, the Championâ„¢ includes a four inch stainless steel match grade barrel as opposed to the Government size five inch barrel. In the Championâ„¢, we use a bull barrel fitted to the slide that houses a supported ramp to save wear and tear on the frame over time. As a result, we can use lighter weight forged aluminum for the frame. That helps us shave weight for its intended carry mission. The sights are all business, with a fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that wonâ€™t snag during the draw. For recoil control and function, we use a dual-spring assembly that allows us to control precisely the recoil impulse in this smaller package, thereby ensuring reliable function with a minimum of fuss to the shooter.  The Range OfficerÂ® Championâ„¢ is available in 9mm and .45ACP. Both models ship with two magazines, seven rounds each for the .45ACP and nine rounds for the 9MM. Even though the Range OfficerÂ® Championâ„¢ is smaller and lighter, you wonâ€™t have to sacrifice capacity for carry convenience."

The result is a service size pistol thatâ€™s ready for anything.  The XD(M)Â® 4.5â€ Full Size OD Green includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.  Your total XD(M)Â® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M)Â® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)Â® pistols.  Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)Â®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.  â€¢ (M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.  â€¢ (M)ulti-Adjust Rail Systemâ„¢: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooterâ€™s hand position. â€¢ (M)eloniteÂ®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged MeloniteÂ® finish on the XD(M)Â® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.  â€¢ (M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)Â® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry."

This one comes just like it does from the factory. It still has the price tag secured around the barrel. These things are amazing, they run any 5.56 or .223 steel or brass ammo, and I haven't had any issues with my other ones. This makes it even cheaper now to shoot. There is a bunch of aftermarket parts available for these pistols (this is my only factory stock one.)  These pistols are no longer being imported into America as of last year so they are almost impossible (or expensive) to find new. These are going for $799-850 new on gun broker plus fees and taxes and shipping. So I would like to get $575.00 out of this deal.

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. 500$ cash - I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"
