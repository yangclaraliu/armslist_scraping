Just opened to mount but my father purchased a higher magnification scope for me to go long range target shooting (30x magnification). This is great for long range hunting and target shooting but I am looking for 800+ yrds. Never been shot! Setting up the scope and reading reviews I noticed the glass is unbelievably clear and looks quite good. The scope has a great feel to it and the adjustment knobs give great feedback.

Warranty - Comes with Burris' highest end warranty. They give this a NO questions asked, NO receipt needed, and NO sign up necessary. I believe it also covers accidental but you may need to read on that. 

Below show the pricing and reviews from Amazon, Sportsman's Warehouse, and Midway. Midway and Amazon typically have the best pricing. Even on sale it has been going for 522 on Amazon with 5-Star reviews! I would agree with that without even shooting it yet. 

I am looking to get $470 cash. I think this is QUITE reasonable considering it has never been in the field. For $495 I will throw in the nice (perfectly watertight fitting) Butler-Creek Scope covers. I believe that was an extra $25 dollars for both. I also have the high-end Medium height all steel WARNE 30mm rings if you need those as well. I believe I paid $42+tax at Sportsman for those. 

This is a firm pricing. Please do not ask me to sell the scope for less as I know how much I paid for it and below are multiple sites showing the lowest it is going for and the great reviews! (**That 490 new listing on Amazon is me by the way. So technically the cheapest one is Amazon's price of $522)

The blinding 190 lumen taclight is bigger and brighter, with beam intensity and explosive strobe that give aggressors nowhere to hide. The brilliant Viridian green laser is visible day or night, indoors and out. The leaner, aluminum-body profile fits your pistol as tight as a tattoo. An arsenal of custom modes lets you pre-program your tactics, then adjust on the fly to keep the advantage on your side.

You put a lot of thought, time and training into mastering your skill with weapons and tactics. The ultimate X5L makes sure it pays off when it counts.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: The strobe mode on this light is outstanding!  Used it while breaching into a room, I gave the ""suspect"" a good dose of the light/laser combo to his face, He ended up dropping to his knees and covering his eyes. Made both my partner and I very pleased. The ONLY reason im selling this combo light, is due to the fact they do not have a level III retention holster designed for it yet. I can not carry this to work, so for that purpose I need to sell and get a prior market light. serious inquiries only, price is solid dont ask for lower."

282,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3067282,For Sale:  GG&G XDS Bipod For Sale,"NW, Lincoln, Nebraska",$ 180,"Listed On: Friday, May 16, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This Bipod is almost brand new.  I put it on my rifle and found that it is too high for me to shoot off of a bench rest comfortably.  Below is the official description from GGGAZ.com  I paid $211.27, but will let go for $180.  I will even pay to have it shipped via USPS flat rate.  In the pictures, it looks like there are scuffs on the legs, but it is only dust.  I can send you new pictures to prove it if you are interested.

The GG&G Heavy Duty XDS Bipod is perfect for those heavier weapons like the M-14 and AR-30. It offers a greater range of rifle cant than our earlier models. In addition to a much stronger pivot mechanism, the new design affords 25 degrees of cant in either direction of center. Not only does this increase better rough terrain adjustability, but this pivoting capability allows the deployed bipod leg to be used as a vertical foregrip if required for rapid transition. In addition, a tension mechanism and adjustment knob has been added so that the operator does not need tools to make tension adjustments to the swivel.

The GG&G Heavy Duty XDS Tactical Bipod is specifically designed and manufactured to meet current military requirements. The Heavy Duty Bipod is exceptionally rugged; it will not only withstand extreme environmental conditions from -55 degrees Fahrenheit to +155 degrees Fahrenheit, but will be operational under those conditions.

Manufactured from aircraft grade 6061 T6 aluminum alloy with extreme duty connection points and fasteners, this swiveling bipod for the M14, AR-10 and other large caliber rifles and carbines is still remarkably lightweight at only 17 oz.

Features include a 8"" to 10.5"" height adjustment when measured from the dovetail attachment, silent deployment, fully adjustable legs with thumbnut adjustments, and grip tight foot pads. All aluminum parts are bead blasted and Type III hard coat anodized per mil-spec in a non reflective matte black combat finish. The bipod is equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 rail adapter that does not require tools for installation. The Heavy Duty Bipod will also attach to any rifle with a 6 o'clock under barrel MIL-STD-1913 or Weaver type rail."

It was originally shipped to G. W. Shroyer and Company, Dayton, Ohio, May 16, ’25, as a blue and case colored .32-20 with 7.5” barrel. It was returned to the Colt plant sometime between then and 1937, when it was changed to a Frontier Six Shooter (.44-40) with 5.5” barrel, ivory grips with medallions, and gold plated, as evidenced by the Colt rework “&” (ampersand) mark on the right rear of the trigger guard. It appears unfired since the factory rework.

As Kopec states in his book (p. 169, 1976 edition), “… in most parts of the world the SA’s hard working days were over, and … a number of its sales after 1923 were intended as gifts, presentations, prizes or just to rekindle memories of the ‘good old days.’…” This Colt typifies guns of that nature, remaining in 95% plus condition, with only the gold having been rubbed off in spots. The nickel finish, where the gold is missing, is almost perfect (gold plated guns had to be nickel plated before the gold would adhere).

This fine Colt has been custom cased in a late 1800’s lap desk, made of hardwoods and intricate inlaid veneers. It comes with the revolver’s accessories as well as antique pen, nibs and brass ink well holders. The case also has its key and locks."

Manufacturer: Dan Wesson (CZ-USA)

Model: 715

Caliber: .357 Magnum/.38 Special

Capacity: 6 Round Cylinder

Barrel: 6"" Heavy with Ventilated Rib

These are NEW for 2014 limited run, Pre-Production 715 revolvers from Dan Wesson



Returning to regular production late summer 2014, the 715 is as it was before -- designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6"" barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357's recoil very well.

The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715.

Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers.

The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715.

While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy above other revolvers, it's the consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design.

Additionally, the clockwise-rotating cylinder reduces stress on the crane, since it turns in the same direction the crane locks, prolonging service life and keeping everything tight. The 715's frame is robust, built to handle the heaviest of factory loads."

It has a 20"" barrel, original hardwood stock that is worn with little of the original shellac but still beautiful, excellent bluing, and the original folding spike bayonet.  The numbers stamped on the receiver, magazine floorplate, buttplate and etched on the stock below the buttplate (unusual) all match.  The bolt SN does not match but has the interesting characteristic of having an Izhevsk (Russian arsenal, vertical arrow inside a triangle) stamp and has a serial number consisting of 2 Cyrillic characters followed by 4 numbers in the style of the M44.  

I have checked headspace with a field gauge and it passed.  The measured average trigger pull is 5 lbs 6 oz, which is considerably lighter than the average Russian Mosin Nagant rifle.  Trigger is smooth rather than gritty as is often the case for Mosin Nagants.  The rifle has been thoroughly cleaned of Cosmoline preservative and is in overall ""very good"" NRA military surplus condition.  I have shot this carbine and it performs very well.

I originally acquired this rifle with my C&R license, so I will need to see a valid drivers license or government issued picture ID for a transfer.  No out of state buyers, unless you want to pay for shipping to your FFL and transfer fees.  Interstate transfers require the involvement of an FFL."

But they are love marks! I have 6 mags i can throw in. Cones with a star bright case . They go for 250$ all day at a gun show. And the rifle brand new is 1750. This is a great deal. I just bought a new for escape and i need the money to help out with the payments. I would hate to see it go but you gotta do what you  gotta do.. Call or text me at REDACTED thanks zak"

One tool, any job.

The SPHINX SDP Compact Black is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact Black features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Black is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Black. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

This photo is representative, but it is a revolver from the same batch the buyer will receive. From its AU  range serial number prefix, this Smith & Wesson Distinguished Service Magnum, numbered model 681-1, was manufactured in 1987. This specimen is fully traditional, and it is part of the -1 model Suffix, First Engineering Change run with 104103 sku number, with floating cylinder hand and radius stud package. Its only other marking is import marks on the left side of the barrel, neatly executed. This revolver served with the Australian Federal Police during its law enforcement career. Construction is entirely stainless steel, including the satin stainless .265 service hammer and original .312 smooth combat trigger. Grip frame is smooth true square butt. Barrel is 4 inch full lug fixed sight, raised matte rib with integral stainless serrated front sight and notch rear. Capacity is 6 rounds of .38 Special or .357 Magnum ammunition interchangeably; and type is traditional double action revolver with transfer bar internal safety device. Hogue 19000 Conversion Grips are new replacement, but correct enough for a 1980s revolver. Surface detractions are only moderate, principally faint holster buffing and scouring on some of the sharp edges, particularly the sides of the trigger guard. We rate this 681 as Very Good, 80 to 85 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Blast effect to the underside of the frame top strap directly above the barrel’s forcing cone is minimal, only a faint etchy line that traverses the width of the top strap. This revolver has not been fired with many magnum loads at all. Cylinder face to forcing cone gap will be .005 to .008. Double action trigger pull is smooth and consistent, and the hammer travels at least 5 to 10 degrees on all six positions after the cylinder times in double action. On single action, hammer travels fully 25 to 30  degrees on all six between the timing position and full cock, and the single action trigger pull is a crisp original 3 to 4 pounds. Lateral movement to the cylinder is negligible. Bore, cylinder chambers, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. We’re offering one of these outstanding early production Model 681-1 revolvers, the one in the photos or one of its very similar mates, each	for only	$ 539.00.	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Any ammunition showing in our photos is NOT included.

This barrel is in as new condition with little to now wear on the bluing and the bore is bright and shiny with sharp lands and grooves and is in excellent condition.  The bluing is nearly entirely deep blue with no rust or pitting.  The only blemishes in the bluing are a small minor blemish near the muzzle on the left and right side as well as a slightly larger blemish on the left side of the barrel about midway between where the front sight and rear sight dovetails are located.  The three pictures I have provided depict these blemishes and the finish on the remainder of the barrel is as new. This appears to be an older take off of an original barrel on a Model 71 possibly for purposes of a caliber conversion to the original rifle on which it was installed.  I am merely guessing as to it's history as I am uncertain as to it's past.  The underside if the barrel just forward of the chamber is rollmarked 348 and 54. Price is $210.00 and is available for pick up in Stillwater, MN or I can ship it via Fedex ground to the lower 48 states for $15.00.  Shipping to Alaska would be slightly more expensive but at actual cost to the buyer."

As it says .. Sig Saur P250 compact 9mm  The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Mini Thirty rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

It comes with 2 mags in the factory box with ppwk.  Overall, I would say condition is excellent, there are some light handling marks on the left slide flat by the muzzle and one small mark on the right side slide flat by the muzzle, it has a very light “idiot mark” and all the matte finished areas looks great, I like to be as accurate as possible on descriptions and to date, everyone has been very happy.  Also, the bulky wrap around grip was replaced with rubber grip panels and there is a small strip of grip tape on the front strap, which can be removed if so desired, I like it myself.

Buyer backed out, back up for $900 firm, no less, may consider GOOD trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.

Fired for the first time last night since 1994, I put 2 mags thru it of FMJ  and various JHP's, just so I knew it functioned properly, and not one FTF, Nice tight groupings - really a pleasure to shoot !  Also included are the orig. plastic grips, a set of Beretta checkered walnut grips, and a set of smooth, fine walnut Beretta grips. (Same type as the Browning BDA's used).  Grips alone would cost well over $100. !!  
This is a true beauty, and I'd really like to see someone enjoy it, rather than it just sitting in a safe !   If you're a collector, then this is the gun for you - if you're looking for a fine .380 for everyday carry, you can't go wrong with this either - 13 rounds X 2 should be enough to do the job !  Please don't email me saying that 'Joe's Gun Shop' has it cheaper - I'm pretty firm on my price, and might only consider a trade for a Beretta Model 86, or a Beretta Model 92SB Compact, Type L, Single Stack.
