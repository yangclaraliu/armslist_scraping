Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

Browning's AB3 Composite Stalker gives legendary A-Bolt accuracy and performance in a value packed platform. The free-floating barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace. A target-type recessed crown enables uniform release of gas, helping prevent any unwanted shift in trajectory while being protected from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy. The receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts using two 8-40 screws for each base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform. The AB3's unique integrated trigger design provides a crisp 3.5-pound pull that breaks like glass, and a robust, precision-machined standard-length steel action allowing you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the bore and optical centerline offset. A generous trigger guard opening allows for easy access, even when wearing gloves. The AB3 Stalker has an electroless matte nickel-plated bolt body with 60-degree bolt lift, and a bolt unlock button to unload the chamber with the top tang safety in the on-safe position. The detachable staggered box magazine has a rugged formed steel body and feed lips for added durability, plus a tough polymer baseplate and shoulder designed to stop the forward movement of the cartridges and helps prevent recoil-induced bullet tip deformation and bullet setback in the cartridge case. This model has a durable, matte blued steel finish on all external surfaces and a rugged, synthetic stock with molded-in matte black color and textured gripping surfaces. It has an Inflex Technology recoil pad to reduce felt recoil and flinching, along with pre-installed steel sling swivel studs for easy mounting of your sling or bipod.

The cerakote finish is a matte grey color (tungsten silver is the exact color). The barrel and receiver are both coated (including the inside of the receiver, minus the bolt and other moving parts of course). The coating was done professionally. I refinished the wood stock and foregrip myself, using a dark walnut stain and semigloss lacquer. The barrel is a standard 28"" vent-ribbed and ported field barrel. A [modified] choke is installed. Also I swapped the brass front bead for a fiberoptic. Good for all day contrast against foliage.The finish has held up wonderfully, with cerakote there is no need to worry about moisture between extensive cleanings (save for the inside of the barrel). Also, the coating is scratch resistant and anti-reflective. I had planned to use this as a field gun primarily.Asking $220.

As you see this is not your regular Kimber ultra carry 2, the trigger is a custom shop trigger (I LOVE the look, and it noticeably improved the trigger pull), hogue grip(best grip for 1911s in my opinion), night sights, and will come with a 9rd Wilson combat magazine as well as a standard 8rd (my favorite, Wilson combat FTW). I'm selling one of my many 1911s and I've decided to test the waters on this. Honestly this is quite possibly one of the greatest kimbers out there as it's accuracy is almost unfair compared to other handguns, a real eye catcher, lightweight and easy to shoot for anyone, and is just beautiful. You won't find another like this, I know, I made sure of it when deciding on parts to make it stand out. ""725"" ""updated"" if you can't figure it's value, then this isn't for you.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstandingreturn-to-zero when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15 rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16 Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstandingreturn-to-zero when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15 rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16 Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Born of necessity, raised in the Army's Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. These barrels, some of the most accurate and durable barrels available, are bead blasted and chemically passivated to resist corrosion. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated. The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation. The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0 allowing for your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements. We equipped it with the Geissele SSA 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target. This precision rifle comes finished with Daniel Defense Tornado Cerakote and is furnished with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.
