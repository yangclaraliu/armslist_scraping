The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.

It was made in 1981. It has the factory extended tube magazine.  It is chambered for 2 3/4 inch shells ,as was the case back in 1981. The barrel is original to the weapon according to Remington customer service records. This highly sought 
after top folding stock brings 250 to 400 depending on condition and this one is extremely nice. We all know that the Wingmaster is the 
Cadillac of the 870s. This one is exactly how it was used by the 
police.  No dodads or crap of any sort hanging from or mounted on it. 
Yes, I know there are many used shotguns out there for less money. This one is for the guy who wants the real deal and appreciates it for 
what it is. I will trade it straight across for the best Ak47, AK74, AR15 OR quality 1911 offered. The only other weapon I may trade for is 
another Springfield XD in .45acp with all the XD gear and box although I already have two of them. Cash price is 600 dollars as I can 
get 300 for just the stock. No other trades interest me at this time. Must meet FTF in a semi public place, not at my house. Must also be willing to sign a bill of sale and have valid ID and I will do the same for you. All metal top folding stock with original bakalite pistol grip. Stock 
is stamped FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT USE ONLY. I called Remington and they verified that this truly is a police issue wepon, not one put together by someone after the fact. The barrel is 18 inches with a bead front sight. The grip is the original bakalite one marked 
Remington. This weapon is blued and very nice foe a 33 year old gun. Thank you for looking at my ad."

Overall, a very nice example of an M38 rifle.

Would like to trade for an M1891 rifle, the one that came before the 91/30. I might also consider a nice WWI Lee-Enfield rifle from 1918 or before. Maybe even a Berthier or Lebel from 1918 or before. No sporters please. I would prefer that the M1891 is complete and at least has the upper handguard. O wil sell for $340 I am located in NE Philadelphia, and can do the trade near Tanners, Surplus City, Classic Pistol, or Claytons."

Comes with One(13) round Magazine. This is a great weapon that can easily be converted into an SBR with the addition of a stock and appropriate class 3 approval. This auction does not include a stock this auction only includes the pistol and magazines no stock as we are not a class 3 dealer. From the Factory: Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the KRISS System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time. Developed over a 5-year period in cooperation with the US Army ARDEC Picatinny Arsenal, the KRISS system has been designed and proven to meet or exceed the requirements of today’s changing tactical challenges. Due to its small platform envelope and light weight, the KRISS is easily deployed in CQB and mobile tactical situations; it can be quickly and effectively deployed from behind a patrol vehicle steering wheel, covert-carried or by mounted units storing easily in a saddlebox. With its hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge, the KRISS provides in-close knock-down power at 1200 rounds-per-minute and 6” groups at stand-off distances of 100m....all with no worries about over-penetration risks and the confidence of single-fire. The KRISS Vector is built to rugged MILSPEC standards and features simple and robust moving parts. With the removal of only 4 pushpins, the KRISS field strips in 7 seconds...no tools required."

From the Sig website:

     ""The SIG516 Patrol FDE in Flat Dark Earth with a matching FDE Cerakote® finish on both the upper and lower receivers and aluminum handguard. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the Flat Dark Earth uses the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. 

     This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

     A 16” Nitride treated barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating aluminum quad rail forend.""

     My rifle has proprietary Sig flip-up iron sights and a full length top rail as well as Magpul furniture including an adjustable buttstock and a SAW style grip. I have a cheapo folding drop vertical grip on it that I had laying around. It will come with 6 magpul Pmags, an aluminum mag ( all are 30 rd mags),  a two point sling, two rotating sling attachment lugs, three rail covers, a cleaning kit, and about 120 rounds with it. The case in the picture DOES NOT come with it unless I need to make up some value; it is a $100 two-gun case and its brand new.
      This rifle was a one of a commemorative run for the Saturn Arch corporation. It came with Saturn Arch's logo laser-engraved into the right side of the receiver. I decided that was too pretty so I had a local plaque shop do a metallic subdued 29th ID decal for me. The decal could easily come off and the residue would be able to be cleaned with rubbing alcohol or goo-b-gone with no harm to the cerakote finish. If I kept it I was going to have the engraving painted over with FDE powdercoating.
     This rifle has so little recoil, its like shooting a 22! Quickest return to target of any semiauto carbine i've ever shot. And it needs so little cleaning after being shot; im told that (and reliability) are because of the piston driven system. The only reason i'm selling or trading it is that I want a 308 battle rifle that I can also hunt with, and I'm just not sure that I need an AR-15.  

   For a sale, I just want to see a valid picture ID. For trade, the same, although I will want to do a search by serial # on your guns before we trade to make they arent stolen."

This Century International Arms imported WWII rifle is a Tula made Russian M91/30 Mosin Nagant with a great bore. All serial #'s match on the Bolt, Butt Plate, Trigger Guard, & Receiver. Only the bayonet has a different Serial #. This rifle is in excellent condition and appears to have 99% of its finish intact on both metal and wooden surfaces-- with no dings in any of the brass fittings. Scratches and dings are minimal in both wood and metal surfaces. What blemishes are present are no doubt the result of being moved about in a rifle box for the better part of 70 years! It's excellent condition suggests it was probably an unissued surplus rifle as it shows the type of wear that rifles stored in boxes and moved about would have. The brass fittings suggest, in my opinion, a rifle issued to a higher ranking officer-- as most Nagants I've seen (from this time period) are either without fittings or have plain steel fittings. I meticulously removed cosmoline from every nook and cranny on this rifle-- which was laid on thick when I received it. I took this out to the range just once and shoots just as it should-- which is to say that it is extremely accurate shooting the Russian surplus ammo I purchased a case of. I put roughly 30 rounds through it down range and it has a nearly effortless bolt locking action, which is not the case for a lot of mosin nagants I've handled throughout the years. I gave it a final clean out prior to storing it and it's good to go.  I still have a bulk of that ammo available for purchase (about a case and a half) if you're looking to buy quality ammo at a reduced price (look at my other listings for the ammo). Comes with a case, bayonet, a toolkit, the ammo pouch and a tin of cosmoline as pictured.

These are very durable, reliable and accurate rifles. It also looks very impressive with the bayonet extended. The M91/30 rifle was developed after the Germans overran and killed thousands of Soviet soldiers equipped with the M38 carbine which had no provisions for a bayonet. The M91/30 was intended to be issued to all soldiers, replacing not only carbines but rifles as well.

Hey guys wanting to get rid of my Bulgarian SA-93 milled receiver AK47. I have several magazines (including drum and a bakelite) and planned on keeping this rifle and getting an ironwood stock set for it. But time and money is an issue right now. Ive decided 1200$ is firm given the magazines and the nature of this rifle. I think like two mags have ammo in them, that would be included as well. Definitely a nice AK for the collector or avid shooter!

Browning B78 300H&H Magnum.
Rocky mountain elk foundation special edition (RMEF) 426 of 450
This rifle is NEW and unfired. 25"" barrel. Complete with box, paperwork, factory scope mount, factory lock. 

This beautiful and rare rifle has been sitting in my climate controlled safe. Inside of a RMEF silicone gun sock. It still has the paper on the sling studs. I hope the photos do this thing justice. The wood is absolutely stunning, The bluing is perfect. This rifle was wiped with a silicone wipe and put away. I only took it out occasionally to admire and then re wipe it with silicone. 

I am selling this rifle because it is simply too nice for me, I would never shoot it and really enjoy it. This rifle deserves a better home where it can be enjoyed and appreciated. If you are a lover of single shots, your collection will be incomplete without this rifle. 

These blue book at 1500 without any of the engraving, or high grade wood.
