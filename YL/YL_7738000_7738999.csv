Cosmetically, it's in very good condition—about 8 out of 10—with some normal wear on the stock, which you can see in the photos. These older models were built to higher quality standards with a metal trigger guard and no use of plastic, other than the magazine. The stock was previously drilled in the butt and foregrip to accommodate a sling with screw-in hardware (which was removed some time ago.) Rifle includes the Ruger 10-round flush-mount clip, but can accommodate higher capacity magazines as well.  Additional photos: https://imgur.com/a/k7fpG"

372,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7738372,For Sale:  Model 1892 Colt DA .38,"Hyde Park, Cincinnati, Ohio","$ 1,900","Listed On: Wednesday, April 25, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Contact me for more photos; site only allows me to upload three images.I have a Colt New Army & New Navy, Civilian Model 1892 Double Action (DA) .38 revolver, with a 4.5"" barrel for sale. Serial Number is 97,735 which according to Colt's Database means this gun was manufactured in 1898 making it legally an antique vs a Curio & Relic. In the New Army/New Navy Model there were almost 300,000 of these guns made, meaning this specific gun is a relatively early manufacture made in the 7th year of the 16 years this model was made. The hard rubber grips, lack of military proof marks, or Military/Navy Stamps and other features denote this as a civilian model compared to a Military Issued gun. Another telling feature of its specific model is the milled flat slot at the back of the hammer (where it seats in full cock), this feature was only found on Model 1892's and none later. Stamps, Markings, EngravingsThe Cylinder release, crane of the cylinder and frame of the gun are all marked with assembly numbers of 971 meaning all the components are original to this gun. The assembly number found on the frame has a ""U"" stamp above it, there is also a ""43"" stamp with another unknown stamp found on the rear face of the cylinder under the ejection rod's extractor and above the ""43"" on the lip of the cylinder(see in photos).There is also a small stamp on the right side of the trigger guard at the rear of the guard (see photo). There is an engraved rampant colt on the left side of the frame (not the sideplate) directly above the grip. The only other engravings/markings on the gun are on the barrel. On the top of the barrel is marked in three lines ""COLT'S PT.F.A. MFG.CO"", ""HARTFORD CT. U.S.A."", ""PAT. AUG.5.84 NOV. 6. 88 MAR.5.95"", lastly on the left side of the barrel is marked ""COLT.D.A.38"". I have not removed the grips or sideplate, nor will I, to see if there are any engravings on the spring, or frame underneath the grips. If you buy the gun you may feel free to do so, but considering the gun's age, and difficulty in finding replacement parts I will not risk damaging any original parts in searching for more markings, which would only corroborate the already provided proof of the gun's model, manufacture, authenticity, and age.  Condition  The Bluing is 80-85%; there is some muzzle/holster wear, as well as on all expected areas (grip straps, hammer, trigger, cylinder release, sharp egdes of frame, front sight, etc). The left side grip is broken and missing a piece, and has three other  small ""chips"" from the bottom of the grip(see photo). There are some small (less than 1/8"" in length) scratchs and dings on the muzzle, cylinder, and frame. There is history of slight surface rust in select spots, but for being almost 120 years old it is in remarkable condition relatively. The bore is clean, lands and grooves are sharp in definition and not worn (see photo). The action is in perfect working order, however there may be a slight timing/indexing issue. The indexing ratcheting teeth may have been worn from use, and the cylinder stop may not be engaging properly at full cock position; however upon firing or releasing the hammer the cylinder stop engages and the indexing seems tight and proper.  I have a video showing this and if I cant attach to listing I will send via PM. I am no expert in Antique Colt Revolvers, nor a licensed gun smith so I can not say that this is abnormal operation or wear from use, nore do I state that the gun is safe to shoot, and make no claims that it is. It is the owner's due diligence to confirm this before shooting. If local I am more than happy to meet with you at a gunsmith of your choosing to look the gun over, however it will NOT be dissassembled/opened until you own the firearm.       Value   According the the NRA Condition Standards for Antique Guns this gun would classify as Excellent Condition to Factory New, and the Photo Percentage Grading System would also list this gun as Very Good to Excellent Value(80-95% original condition). It is a relatively early manufacture (made in the first 33% of total manufacture), and it is a 1898 or earlier manufacture, making it rarer, and technically an antique firearm. KBB Lists all Model 1892 & 1895's as being valued at $1850 for 100% condition, with pre 1898 models bringing a premium, as well as shorter barrels bringing more as well (3"" barrels bring 40% more). This revolver is in great condition, all original, it is also less common than the 6"" barrel models, and it is an early manufacture, therefore I am asking $1950 and am open to offers. I am willing to meet up in person, but will also ship via licensed FFL dealer.  Payment can be made via cash in person, Paypal, or via check. If via check, I will wait two weeks from deposit date to make sure funds clear before shipping."

Very high quality roof prism military binoculars by Zeiss-Jena, but not so marked. Serial numbered 6265134. Green with black rubber armor and fold down eye cups, with lens covers.

As of 8-16-17 the same binoculars were for sale on Ebay at $1,095.00 plus $55.00 shipping. Originally advertised when I bought them as Zeiss-Jena East German army, but it is marked “Made in Germany” in English over the serial number, which casts doubt on the claim of origin. Because of the tritium reticle illumination, it has the standard international black and yellow ionizing radiation trefoil symbol just below the right eyecup. Has small accessory rubber case holding two eyepiece filters which supposedly are for protection against incoming lasers. Rear of right barrel has a small up-down lever with no obvious purpose, but probably related to the formerly illuminated reticle. The right barrel has an engraved internal range estimating reticule and a height estimating one low in the field of view, typical of eastern bloc military optics."
