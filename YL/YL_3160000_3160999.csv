Also purchased Wilson Combat ETM Mags for it. None of these upgrades are in the photo below as I haven't gotten a chance to take a new photo yet and will get some this evening when I get home. Can throw in ammo for the right price, have plenty of 9mm to add to a deal.

This listing is for One CZ-82 frame and barrel assembly. This assembly is legally a pistol, so an FFL is required for interstate transfers. This pistol is Not C&R Eligible. FFLs and gunsmiths, and even gun tinkerers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-assembly price, and with no additional shipping charges. About five years ago, our neighbors at Tennessee Guns in Knoxville brought in a couple containers full of CZ-82 pistols from service with the Czech Federal Police. All of those are completely out of the distribution channels, and we happen to have some pretty nice CZ-82 pistols left. Here, however, is one parts guns that we extracted some parts from. We intended to take their barrels off and sell them, but this one’s barrel is squibbed 1/2 inch forward of its chamber, note the swell that is obvious in the photos; and besides, the barrel both pressed and pinned into the frame. Removal of the barrel will require the services of a competent gunsmith, and we are neither competent nor gunsmiths. Manufacturer, of course, is CZ of the Czech Republic, Czeska Zbrojovka of Strakonice, Czech Republic. It was manufactured in 1987 for duty with the Czech State Police. Importer is TGI Knoxville. Most specimens had TGI stamping on the bottom of their slides, GA search terms CZ82 Slide Robertson. Construction is entirely steel, blued finish on the barrel surfaces and semi-gloss black finish on the frame. Barrel length is 3 3/4 inches; and the barrel is polygonal bore like their Heckler & Koch rivals. Caliber is 9mm Makarov, 9x18; these pistols will also chamber .380 ACP ammunition with the correct barrel installed. It will not chamber and fire standard 9mm Luger. Weight on this assembly, after all, is only 8 3/4 ounces. Finished CZ82 pistols hold a standard 12 shot magazine, with 10 rounders available direct from CZ-USA. Surface detractions on this is moderate, with slide bushing contact whitening on the barrels and holster wear on the frames. We rate it as Good, and the photo specimens are representative. Replacement pricing on this assembly will run upwards of $200, and CZ USA doesn’t even offer them this way. Parts, however, are readily available from CZ USA and from a whole host of parts dealers including Midwest Shooters, Numrich / Gun Parts, and Brownells, to name a few. We’re offering the frames in the photos or their substantially identical mates from the photo batch, each for only $ 69.00. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Here are the details:
- Spikes dedicated upper with Midwest Industries full rail
- Milspec AR-15 lower by ATI/Omni
- Sightmark Aimpoint Clone.  This red dot is fairly accurate and I have been impressed considering the price I paid.
- Unopened box of AR tactical CCI ammo
- 3 mags

Price is pretty firm as I have a crapload more money in this than my asking price:  $500

I sent this off to Spikes Tactical last fall and they went through the rifle and its running great now.  Since sending it off, I have only put a few hundred rounds down the barrel.  I average slightly less than one bad round per mag but I think that is pretty standard for these types of rifles and ammo.  I have shot CCI mini-mag and federal bulk ammo through it.

Would like to trade for a 17hmr, 7mm-08 or maybe a nice scope."

The serial number of this gun (V20XXX) places its production in 1942.  The majority of the first 40,000 of these guns were chambered in .38 S&W, so this gun is a rare exception. 

The gun has a 4"" barrel, parkerized finish, case-hardened trigger and hammer.  ""United States Property"" is stamped on the top strap.  Finish is in 90% condition; there is some pitting on the cylinder and slight loss of finish on the right frame.  Performance wise, the gun shoots perfectly, cylinder is tight and the bore is clean.  This gun is build like a brick house and can take some abuse...remember, this is a 70+ year old piece of World War II history!  

The gun does not have the original grips; these were often changed/lost after the war.  The gun currently has an aftermarket Hogue monogrip on it at this time, but original-style wood grips are usually available on eBay for around $30.  This gun is a great shooter and military collector's item all in one!"
