Specs are:- P-Tac lower with PSA internals- Sig Brace and buffer tube- Kerri's Guns upper with KAK brake- Sightmark holo sight This gun was built 4 years ago and functions flawlessly.  No cycling issues with subsonic ammo.  Very accurate with barnes 110gr ( ~1"" 5 shots @100yds using different scope).  Built it, played with it a handful of times at the range (less than 500 rounds through it) and now it's sitting in my safe...  I have a problem of getting guns, playing with them for awhile, then losing interest and trading them off for something different. That's the story with this gun.  Great firearm, but I'm just ready to try something different.  FTF only, must be legaly able to own firearms (CWP preferred)."

I have priced it very fair with the extra magazines and the brand new night sights unlike some of the other Glock ads on here. Hopefully someone will be able to use it as a great home defense/field gun. Over 21, meet in the Carrollwood/Northdale area. No felons, and low ballers will be ignored/sent to the trash bin as the extra magazines and new night sights alone were 130.00 extra. Thanks for looking and have a safe Labor Day."

It operates off of a roller lock bolt carrier system which results in virtually NO recoil. It's a fun and cheap gun to shoot. PTR industries was the only company to receive the blueprints, rights, and physical machines from H&K to make these and the 91s so these are as close to H&K as you can get. They are very solid and tough made guns. I've got the factory manuals, hardcase, pic rail section at the end of the gun for a flashlight, HK style 3 point sling, 11 mags, around 300 rounds of ammo. I also have a Remington 870 Marine Magnum that I bought new in March from bass pro shops. Electro nickel plated finish guarantees no infamous Remington rust, throw the bitch in the ocean and come back in 10-20 years or longer and it'll look brand new. It's had less than 30 shells through it. It has the original factory Allen padded sling and an Allen buttstock shell sleeve.  ***I AM ONLY LOOKING TO TRADE FOR A IWI X95 (5.56)***ASKING PRICE FOR THE PAIR (will NOT separate): $1600 OBO (would prefer to trade for a X95)PLEASE TEXT ME AT REDACTEDI can send any more details and pics of both upon request, armslist will only allow me to upload 1 imageptriwitavorx95remington870marine magnum"

Still supersonic at 1,200 yards, the 6.5 Grendel delivered superior external ballistics to the 7.62 NATO. Utter reliability, superior external and terminal ballistics than the current state of the art, outstanding accuracy in a lightweight M16/AR-15 platform it is what appears to be the pinnacle for what may be achieved in the M16/AR-15 chassis. The 6.5 Grendel is not a series of compromises, but rather the perfect marriage of mechanical function, internal, external and terminal ballistics all working in harmony.
Shooting a 123-grain Lapua Scenar with a ballistic coefficient of .547 and a muzzle velocity of 2,600 FPS delivers outstanding accuracy out to 1,200 yards. At 600 yards, tennis ball size targets are no match for this flat-shooting round. For extreme accuracy, formidable terminal ballistics and long range applications, the 6.5 Grendel is unbeatable.
Compared to the 5.56 NATO, the 6.5 Grendel, with roughly twice the lead mass, gives you the potential for twice the mass of fragments. If maximum fragmentation is coincident with maximum temporary cavity, the terminal ballistics are quite convincing, all in a package that shoots flatter with 50% less felt recoil than 7.62 NATO M80 ball.

This rifle will shoot ¼ MOA at 100 yards! Total weight of rifle is 12 lbs. 12 oz. My passion is building these rifles and getting them to shoot accurately. Once I have achieved that, I get bored with the rifle and move on to another project. I spent over 100 hours developing loads for this rifle. If you are not a reloader, it will still shoot under 1 MOA with Hornady Match ammo. Parts without labor was over $2600.00. The barrel alone was over $700.00. Cash only sale! No trades!
