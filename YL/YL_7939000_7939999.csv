The FAL is known as the right arm of the free world. over 90 countries adopted it as their military issue battle rifle.  The US went with the M14 (M1A1) out of favoritism for th designer, but its well thought that we may have won the Vietnam war if we had went with the FAL. My rifle has the Isreali designed bolt carrier plate you can see the grooves in the picture where the ejection port is. this design allows the weapon's action to clear itself of sand and fine debris which as you know tends to shut down many other types of rifles.  This improvement made the FAL truly dependable for all environments. It will come with 8 x 20 round magazines. The bipod pictured is not encluded but the quad rail allows you to attach what ever lights, lasers, bi pods and fore grips you need. the top rail holds true and zero.  The scope is also not included unless you want to pay for it in addition. sling is included.i have the original stock handguard, and buttstock for the rifle as well. (included)check out this videos of the FAL: search Youtube for:Colion Noir and the FN FALalso to see it shot unburied from a mud pile, and also draged through a swamp water look for FAL the First Black Rifle"

Maybe a firearm for the right one. I would be interested in Aimpoint, eotech, other trijicon’s, and higher end vortex variable optics. As far as firearms I would be interested in “ronin special” type Glock builds, higher end AK’s, Mpx, cz Scorpions, MCX, maybe a zenith clone. AR Pistols in 5.56 only. If you have something that’s none of those, the most I can say is so. Watcha got? Only interested in .308/7.62, 9 mm, .45, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, and 5.45x39 caliber weapons. For the right firearm I can add cash on my end. Please no shotguns. Willing to meet around the Charlotte area."

This is one of them. I bought this for home defense, but I think I'm going to move back towards the 5.56 AR home defense setup. This thing is completely decked out and really doesn't need anything else to be perfect. Tailhook brace kit (They've been sold out for 6 months, highly sought after), HB extended charging handle, Apex grip, Apex ambi safeties (Has the Apex safety on the right side, factory on the left. I have the left Apex safety too it's jut not installed), Inforce WML light, Vortex Venom red dot, CZ Custom Co-Witness mount (Only way to get a co-witness with the low factory sights on these), an Alpha Battle Carrier bag, and 5 magazines. This is one hell of a package.I bought this unfired, and have about 300-400 rounds through it. It's in near mint conditon with no wear, scratches, or dings. All of the extras are only a few weeks old, except for the Venom which I've had on a few different guns but is still in great shape and works perfectly.Below I'll list all of the extras and what they cost. The prices listed are the cheapest prices I could find online:- CZ Scorpion Evo Pistol ($799)- Tailhook Brace Kit w/Factory Folding Mechanism ($250)- HB Industries Theta Extended Charging Handle ($55)- Apex Grip ($30)- Apex Ambi Safety ($45)- Inforce WML ($130)- Vortex Venom ($240)- Cz Custom Venom Co-Witness mount ($80)- UTG Alpha Battle Carrier Bag ($70)- 2-10 round magazines that came with the gun.- 3 Extra 30 round magazines ($20 ea so $60)- Mythosaur Rail Cover ($30)- Factory box, factory grip, factory safety, factory lock, and factory boresnake.As you can see, I have approx $1790 into this gun and that doesn't even include tax, shipping, and FFL fees...so add about another $50-$80 on top of that.Asking [$1200 for this. That price seems MORE than fair (Actually kind of way too low) and it's priced to sell fast, as is everything else I list when I decide to sell. Huge loss for me, huge gain for you.Not looking for trades at this time, trying to fill the massive hole in my pocket for the buying spree the last few days. Keep in mind this is a PISTOL, not a rifle, so paperwork is required. Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy. Face to face only, no shipping.Must be 18+ w/Purchase Permit or CPL.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time. Thanks for looking!~ Mike***Armslist only lets me upload 3 pictures.

This is a sweet piece of history and I'm sure it would have some stories if it could talk. I acquired it through a sale I made, so I do not have any information about it. I've only put about 50 rounds through it to confirm it functions, it's a dead accurate nail driver. The conversion kit that dates for the early 1950's is very easy to install, allowing you to plink with .22lr anytime you go to the range. The serial number dates it for manufacture in 1939, with a match barrel, and I have an Authenticity letter from Colt Manufacturing to confirm. It does have a couple blemishes on one side of the slide, but the finish is well preserved with all original parts. I can provide additional pictures upon request. I’m asking $2,000 or best offer, serious inquiries only please, package will include the firearm, 3 magazines, hard case, conversion kit in the original box and an Authentication Letter from Colt with the serial number and all other information listed. Please text Justin at REDACTED, I am located in Anchorage, AK but willing to ship. Buyers out of state will be responsible for shipping and FFL transfer fees."
