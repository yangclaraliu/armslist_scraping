Just about everything on it has been touched and it runs fast, precise, and flawlessly. It has a full wrap stipple job(Including thumb rest and front strap) with sunburst on the back strap and tree bark on the rest. The grip has been recontoured at the back strap and at the mag release to make it more user friendly and easier to reload. The trigger guard has dual undercute for both hands and is stippled on the front if you want to wrap a finger around. The magwell has also been recontoured and flared to allow easier reloads. The barrel has a full polish on it(Including a mirror polish on the feed ramp) and looks/functions perfectly. The custom slide milling took a significant amount of weight off the slide and aids in quicker cycling. The cerakote is aged bronze and looks stunning in the light! Trijicon HD night sights have a crazy lume at night and are quick to aquire in the day. Every trigger component has been hand finished and polished and the sear has been milled taking the trigger pull down a bit. This is the crispist, cleanest, nicest factory S&W trigger you will have ever pulled. If you want a flat trigger I would install an apex kit for 60 dollars, but I would pull this trigger before making that decision- It is seriously fantastic! I have 1 7 round mag with a base plate on it and 2 8 round magazines. The baseplates are all cerakoted the same color as the slide and the magazines are also polished for a very clean look. Look around. You will never find a shield with this much work for this price. I have around 1800 rounds through it and it runs flawlessly and feeds every kind of ammo. This gun is sweet and will sad to see it go but it's onto the next. Thanks for the read and feel free to ask away! I know just about everything about this fantastic Glock killer!Alex"

After that, it was sent out for Birdsong’s famous Black-T coating (this one has NATO Green-T with Black-T accents). This is the coating that Birdsong put on HK MP5s for the US Navy. It is very corrosion-resistant and naturally lubricious; it does not require an oily lubricant that attracts debris. I do use a bit of Frog Lube anyway, and any appearance of stains in a picture are due to lubricant. I probably haven’t shot 100 rounds through this pistol, and it never had a malfunction. It shoots straight and looks great. It is about 25 years old and has just been sitting in the safe for the last 20 years. Time to go to someone who will use it.  Comes with 3 mags.  Google Birdsong to get more information on his great coatings.  Beautiful gun you won't find another like it.If selling local prefer to transfer through a local FFL, I will pay fee.  Will ship for shipping and handling to an appropriate FFL.If the ad is up, it is available.  Won’t respond to is it still available!Really want cash, but might trade for 22 revolver or pistol plus cash or lever action 22 plus cash.  Or 223 bolt or lever action, and maybe cash depending upon gun.
