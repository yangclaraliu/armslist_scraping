She shot three magazines through the gun. As most of you know she needs to practice practice practice. So she needs a smaller caliber.
The gun was stripped, cleaned and lubricated. No scuffs or wear. Looks brand-new.
Comes complete with box and everything that was included. Smith & Wesson offers a lifetime warranty that is transferable. However the firearm has not been registered with Smith & Wesson yet as I knew she needed to try out the gun first. Also comes with Forbus paddle holster and one box of 50 rounds ammunition. Must have concealed carry permit or or purchase permit along with North Carolina drivers license. If you have a purchase permit we will need to meet at FF L dealer. My cost is $20.

This Core30 features a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a matte bead blasted finish. The 1:10"" twist rate effectively stabilizes the heavier and longer bullets preferred for long distance shooting and defense purposes, while also adequately stabilizing lighter, shorter bullets at closer distances. A mid-length gas system reduces heat related wear to critical internal componentry and reduces felt recoil. The muzzle is threaded and a SureFire flash hider is installed.

In the past, carrying a small handgun normally means making some big sacrifices. Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.

With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.

The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully.[4

That is actually the problem for me... I have smaller hands, and my grip on the weapon isn't great.  Otherwise, it is an extremely reliable, very accurate, and easily concealable high capacity SA/DA gun.  It has a safety that is also a decocker letting you carry loaded, chambered, and safety off with the first pull being a heavy (but predictable) double action, with follow-up shots being a crisp, light single action.  Disassembly and maintenance is simple and requires no tools.  This is a terrific gun...  just read some reviews and watch some YouTube videos and you'll see how loved this gun is.  The wider grip just doesn't fit my hand right.  Same reason I don't like the feel of Glocks and XD's."

The grip feels comfortable. There are grooves cut into the frontstrap and backstrap that seem to lock the pistol in my hands with an ambidextrious safety/decocker. The trigger is excellent, and this could be considered an understatement. It has a trigger that would be at home on a target pistol, if not for the DA trigger pull being as heavy as it is. The DA is smooth, and the SA trigger break is what I would consider a glass rod break. The trigger reset is actually shorter than my Walther P99 or PPQ and Glock, and they have a very short reset.  S&W and Walther are the only companies that I know of that put stock adjustable  sight s on a modern defensive pistol. The adjustable  sight s on these have a metal ear on either side of the  sight   to protect them from impacts."

The system does not touch the barrel.

• The design of the gas piston system and operation rod completely eliminates carrier tilt.

• This design ensures reliability by preventing hot gases and carbon particulates from entering the receiver and fouling the chamber and the action. Diminished heat reaching the upper receiver means that Cleaner Lubricant and Preservative (“CLP”) applied in this area will evaporate at a lower rate and not dry out. The design allows less maintenance and increases the overall reliability of the weapon.

• A newly designed vent cover houses the piston exhaust ports, which protects the operator from exhaust heat and cuts down on the weapon’s signature.

• Mounting the piston on the underside of the rail system allows the barrel to float freely, ensuring greater accuracy of the weapon.

• The lower half of the rail system detaches with a unique tool free design for ready access to the piston and gas tube for operational maintenance and cleaning. The operating system can be cleaned faster than the existing weapon’s cleaning routine.

• The operator in the field can adjust the piston’s cyclical rate to keep the carbine operating within control rate of fire parameters, resulting in less wear on the carbine’s critical parts.

• The piston design is machined with close tolerances so that gas rings are not needed, eliminating another potential maintenance issue for the weapon.




Exclusive Ejection Port Dust Wiper With Cover

• After a typical AR carbine fires, the weapon is susceptible to contaminants because the ejection port door remains open until it is manually closed. Dust, sand and debris can enter the receiver and work their way between the receiver and bolt, potentially jamming the carbine. These contaminants also create wear and maintenance issues.

• Adcor’s design solves this problem with a spring-loaded dust cover mounted on the carbine’s bolt carrier. Each time the weapon fires and the bolt carrier returns to the ready position, the dust cover moves into the ejection port opening, flush with the outside geometry of the carbine. No dust, sand or debris can enter the weapon.

• There is a biasing device, comprised of two springs, between the bolt carrier and the shield for biasing the shield outwardly away from the bolt carrier so that the dust cover shield continuously engages the inner surface of the receiver during movement in the firing and rearward positions.

• The shield is formed of a self-lubricating polymeric material that can withstand extreme heat and cold, and is extremely durable.




Ambidextrous Forward Placed Charging Handle/Forward Placed Assist

• Adcor’s design permits an operator to charge, clear or forward assist the weapon without losing any engagement with the target. The operator reaches forward and pulls back on a handle (which can be located on either side of the weapon for right or left handed operators) without losing sight of the target.

• If the carbine jams, the same handle clears the carbine with a single pull. It is an easy-to-use single mechanism.

• The handle is detachable (without tools) and is ambidextrous for use on either side of the weapon.

• It is equipped with a spring that returns the handle to a locked position once used, where the handle folds forward into a recessed area to keep it out of the way. To use the handle again, the operator reaches forward, swings the handle outward and back in a single motion.

• The handle does not reciprocate when the weapon fires, but only engages when the operator charges or clears the weapon.




Rail System

• The new key locked, highly rigid rail system mounts seamlessly to the upper receiver.

• The upper rail guard and lower rail guard separate using a unique tool-less push button feature.

• The design ensures proper alignment of the rail with a redesigned boss, spline and groove system.

• The rail will not “spread” or fall out of time. The Adcor rail system is compatible with all accessory items such as optical sights, image intensification sights, thermal sights, laser targeting systems, bipods, tactical lights, Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) of the existing AR platform."

Kel-Tec's KSG is a simple and reliable pump action shotgun able to feed
from either the left or right tube, with a manual feed side selector lever
located behind the trigger guard. Each tube holds up to 6 shells for a
total 12+1 capacity. The pump includes a bottom Picatinny rail for the
mounting of a forward grip, light, or a laser, and a top Picatinny sight
rail to accept many types of optics or iron sights. The soft rubber butt
pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and
includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and
stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily
disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when
removed. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is
included.

The gun comes with the original box, paperwork, three mags, the original barrel, a custom threaded barrel and a LaserMax red laser. I have had this gun since new 5 plus years ago. 

The gun is set up to run a suppressor and that is the reason for the custom threaded barrel and LaserMax. The custom barrel is mad by TROS USA and is a 1/28 twist barrel. If you look at the factory threaded Mosquitos you have to buy an adapter to add on their barrel in order for a 1/28 twist suppressor to work. 

I have over over $675 invested into this set up. I am building other projects and since this one gets shot the least it is going to make room for my next build.

In addition, you will also attend the NRA Basic Pistol Course during the first 8 hours of instruction and course certificates will be granted. Our Instructors are NRA Certified. The NRA Basic Pistol Course is included at no additional cost to the students who enroll in our Illinois Concealed Carry program. 

Completing this course will qualify you to apply for concealed carry in Illinois, Arizona, and Florida. = 35 states

All of our Instructors possess multiple Firearms Instructor certifications & licenses. Additionally, our Instructors have significant real-world concealed carry experience along with covert operations experience, Police Officer and/or Federal Agent experience, SWAT Operator & command experience, numerous specialty certifications, and several years experience as law enforcement/firearms instructors. We definitely DO NOT intend to sound arrogant but there is no better way to share the message; we have learned by risking our lives and coming out alive and usually undetected. The lessons learned in the field have been added to our lesson-plan to assist in delivering the curriculum in a unique and beneficial manner. Attending any of our courses will send you out the door with the mental tools you will need to be prepared, ""beat the bad guys,"" and/or stay out of jail. Our Instructors will make sure you receive an education that puts you significantly ahead of other Illinois residents who have the same Certificates, but not the same training.

We've been teaching, concealing, and arresting long before concealed carry became legal.

Thank you for your interest."

Great ccw or range gun! Gets back on target very easily. Upon actually counting rounds I realized I have only shot 250 rounds through it, and you can tell! This gun looks fantastic! Can send it off equipped with hollows to get you started. Has been a fantastic gun, one of the easiest 40 caliber guns to get back on target I have ever come across. This is a solid deal on a very, very well taken care of sidearm. It has been carried maybe 10-15 days and has 4 range days on it. I went to a Sig and need to sell this."
