Got it the beginning of the year and just haven't had time to shoot it. Now things have come up so it's gotta go. 

Made by the same people bringing us the Rock Island M1911's. Excellent customer support and warranty. If something does go wrong (which I doubt) their operation in Nevada will take care of you. 

Six shots not five and hardly bigger than a J-frame.  Accessories for post 1966 Colt Detective Specials fit it. It has an old Pachmayr  grip adaptor on it to help get a better grip on the small but easy to conceal boot grips. 

I'm in Lexington. You can buy these at Bud's or Centerfire for $30-50 more but since the warranty transfers buy mine and save!
$210 cash only. No trades or stupid offers. Worst case I just put it back and forget about it until tines are better. 

Face to face only to law abiding Kentucky residents with proof of residency who can legally own firearms."

I purchased this as certified pre-owned which means before I got it, the pistol was stripped, refitted with original factory parts where needed, cleaned, lubricated, function tested and hand-inspected by a SIG SAUER factory technician. This gun was flawless when I got it and I have put less than 100 rounds through it since then. This gun has NEVER been carried and has no wear on the finish. Any discoloration you see in the photo is just my camera flash hitting excess gun oil on the slide. This is the DA/SA with decocker variant and the trigger is SMOOTH and light in both modes. Normally I am not a fan of pistols chambered in .40 but this is a fantastic shooter that has very little recoil. I am only getting rid of this because I want to stick to 9mm and 45ACP for now.

I am including the following:

* The pistol in it's box with original accessories and paperwork
* 2 factory 7 rounds mags
* 20 rounds of Winchester Supreme Elite JHP's
* Half a box (50 rounds) of Remington ShurShot
* 250 rounds of factory reloads
* A leather IWB holster from ROG Holsters

These guns don't show up on Armslist all that often, but i managed to pick this one up a few months ago. It is a fantastic shooter and I have put about 100 rounds through it since I got it. The 1911 platform is great and the 9mm makes shooting easier (and cheaper) than the normal .45. I got a deal on a Springfield Range Officer which is the only reason I'm selling this one. 

It comes with a plastic Springfield Armory box, 2 magazines, multiple grips (rubberized Hogue grips, textured tactical grips and the original wood grips) and two leather holsters (1 IWB holster and 1 leather belt holster). I'm asking $550 and am open to trades. I'm not looking for anything in particular, so I'll be picky about trade offers, but I'm always polite in my response....even if I'm not interested."

The rifle has never been fired, but bore, bolt, rifling, and finish are all in excellent condition. There is a small chip of wood off of the front, but it is purely cosmetic. I have the original leather strap, and the butt plate still swings open.

It comes with 2 8-round magazines. I also have the rail adapter. I sold the light to my brother so it is no longer available. It just has the standard sights and is DA/SA with a safety/decocker.
I have most of the small stuff for my AR build but these are the things or similar to what I want. A stock, barrel, free floating rail, compensator, gas block, trigger, BCG, and an optic. I am trying to make this a high quality build so I'm looking at the Magpul ACS stock, a good 18"" barrel with a 1:8 twist, something like a Troy Inc Alpha rail (round with a rail on top), a good compensator (spikes dynacomp or similar), low pro adjustable gas block, Nickel Teflon BCG, geissele trigger or something as high quality, and some sort of optic with something like a 1-4x magnification."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple Brand New, factory fresh Kahr CM40 compact pistols! These are fantastic little concealed carry guns, and you can’t beat them for the price. Featuring all the features of Kahr’s CW series, and putting them into a smaller 3″ barrel and body, the CM series is an excellent choice for any shooter interested in carrying.


I only have TWO in stock, and they are on sale and priced to sell quickly for only $389.00 each (cash price).


Kahr CM40 .40 S&W Compact Pistol with 3.1″ Barrel and 6-round Magazine - Available at TooeleShootingSupply.com


The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr’s CW series (3.6″ barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3″ barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1″ barrel and an overall length of 5.47″, with a height of 4.0″. The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr’s PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple engraved markings instead of roll marking; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr’s seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:

- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.

- Kahr’s incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a “safe-cam action” and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr’s two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr’s barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter’s hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.
Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

Really don't want to sell, but need the money for a new house. Before I get all sappy about having to sell her, these are the specs:

Magpul 5 point collapse-able stock. Magpul MOE pistol grip. Magpul trigger guard. Two black matching Magpul Pmags. Magpul Flip Up front and rear sights. Magpul RVG fore-grip (I believe the AFG series is a fad. Better control with RVG personally) UTG Pro Quad Rail, 1/7 chrome lined barrel.

I love this rifle. I have cleaned after EVERY use with All Organic Frog Lube. If you haven't heard of it, it is a petroleum substitute that actually leaves a protective seal on the moving parts as it cools, then greases when hot. The stuff is pricey but amazing. 


I have a seperate Eotech Holographic sight (double A battery for SHTF situations, no night vision) that I REALLY don't want to sell, but would let go for the right price.

Only about 150 rounds through this black beauty. I will not go lower than what I have put in to this rifle, as everything is practically new, but I am lenient on the price as I need the cash for this house.

This is not your run of the mill out of the box AR. I promise you will love her as much as I have."

North American Arms Pug .22 Mag Mini-Revolver, 1″ Barrel, Tritium Front Sight - Available at TooeleShootingSupply.com

The name “Pug” may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (“much in little”) in reference to the small and convenient size.

Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1″ heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark.

Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm “leash” on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple brand new, factory fresh Henry H001M .22 Mag Lever-Action Rifles! Henry lever-actions are known around the globe for their incredibly smooth action and great accuracy, right out of the box. This model features a smooth American Walnut stock and blued finish.


I only have TWO stock, and have them priced to sell QUICKLY for just $399.00 each (cash price).


Henry H001M .22 Mag Lever-Action Rifle - Available at TooeleShootingSupply.com

The tubular magazine holds 11 rounds. It weighs 5 1/2 pounds and overall length is 37 1/2″. With regard to ballistics, in general the .22 Magnum travels twice as fast the .22 LR cartridge and delivers twice the energy. Various types of .22 magnum cartridges are available from all the major ammo makers.

Clair Rees, who authored a Rimfire Column article in GUNS Magazine, had this to say about our rifle, “I’ve done enough shooting with Henry’s .22 Magnum to know it operates smoothly and reliably. Accuracy is good, too. At 50 yards, it produced 5-rounds averaging an even inch center-to-center with Winchester Supreme jacketed hollowpoints. This great looking .22WMR lever carbine delivers. This is a good buy.”

Savage B.Mag .17 WSM Bolt-Action Rifle - Available at TooeleShootingSupply.com

The B.Mag isn’t simply a re-chambered version of an existing platform; Savage designed this rimfire rifle specifically to handle the high velocities of the 17 Winchester Super Magnum with design features typically reserved for their centerfire rifles. In order to maximize accuracy in this long-range shooter, the B.Mag utilizes Savage’s thread-in barrel headspacing system, rear-locking lugs and a cock-on-close bolt capped off with the light, crisp AccuTrigger. It has a flush-fit center-feed rotary magazine. B.Mag also has a soft rubber buttpad and hidden action-screws in a lightweight, black synthetic one-piece stock.

That said look at how many factory glocks are listed for more than or equal to factory pricing... I will be purchasing one... But at the prices people are asking there is no reason not to order directly from glock. Not sure where pricing is coming from... Glocks are one of the highest listed here on armslist that combined with prices just makes one more than a little cautious. So check your $ with glocks are you in the ball park?

These post list their telephone number, or their text number, but will not answer when you reply to the post through armslist.com.
They are gathering phone numbers only, there is no gun for sale.  If you don't believe me, call them and you will probably be told the gun ""just now sold, or sold yesterday""  or they just don't ever answer the call. But  they don't ever take their post down. Well, now your phone number is still recorded and meantime, they now have your number and it will be sold to other scammers.
THESE POSTS USUALLY LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS,,,,LNIB TAURUS OR RUGER $300.00 NEVER FIRED OR BARELY USED. These guys usually list only medium priced guns, never the high end ones like, Colt 1911's or Kimbers, that would be too obvious.

So how this would work is in a written contract signed by both parties for more the buyers peace of mind (notarized if you wish) the sales contract.  At this time  Also, a form 4 would need to be completed along with 2 sets of finger prints, photo and a check made to the ATF for $200.  I would send all the paperwork in, we would then wait 8-11 months.  When the tax stamp comes back to me I would then contact you and deliver the item.  I would prefer to find someone in PA but out of state can work also.
