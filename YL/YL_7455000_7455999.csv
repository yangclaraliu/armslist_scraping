I don't know which sheriff's dept this came from, I bought it in Wright County. It appears to be from the 1920s or 30s. I've heard these older police guns sometimes can't handle +P ammo, I've shot Winchester ""Cowboy Action"" .38 Special lead wadcutters through it with no issue. It fires in double-action only, seems reasonably accurate. It does have some wear and signs of use as you'd expect from a duty revolver. There's some holster wear to the bluing around the barrel and a few dents and dings. There's also minor remnants of yellow paint on the barrel, probably another reminder of its riot-control / prisoner control use.

Which was ordered by the USMC for their Special Operations units for the fight on the ""Global War on Terror"" in Afghanistan and Iraq. After some service in Afghanistan & Iraq it was deemed that the Cerakote finish used on the pistol was not quite durable enough for the Marines. The original pistols were sent back to the factory in exchange for M45A1 pistols with an improved finish. This was a boon to collectors as Colt was then free to sell these surplus pistols on the commercial market. These original military pistols were ""decommissioned"" by engraving an ""X"" through the USMC marking on the left side of the slide. The availability of these guns represents the first time USGI service pistols have been offered to the public since the DCM ceased handgun sales over 50 years ago. Likely to be the only opportunity to own firearms used in the Global War on Terror, and the what is almost certain to be the last Colt 1911 adopted by the United States Armed Forces. With only 1000 let go on the civilian market makes these extremely scarce and desired by the purest of collectors.  It is interesting to note that these are the first new Colt 1911 pistols to be purchased by the United States military since the end of WWII in 1945. Being adopted for the second time, over a century after initial adoption, speaks volumes to the timeless design of the 1911...the greatest battle pistol ever devised. A must-have for the serious 1911 collector.
