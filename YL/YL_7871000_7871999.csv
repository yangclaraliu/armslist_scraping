A standard 5.56mm NATO Nitride chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. Adjustable Gas Valve - An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded 1/2×28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. Ambidextrous Charging Handle and Controls - Whether you’re left- or right-handed, there should be no compromise in shooting performance. The SIG516 features an ambidextrous selector, bolt release, magazine release and charging handle. One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement in the SIG516 rifle. With its Nitride treated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator, the piston-driven SIG516 incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating forend, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle available.

I recently acquired a tan model, so I no longer need it. The exps models are the newest in the EOTech line. They are lighter, tougher, and eliminate the battery terminal issues of the earlier models. the EXPS3-0 is the model used by the U.S. military, and carries an NSN number in the database. This one in particular was sent in to EOTech last year and had a full internal refit. This corrected the fading reticle issues, the fogging on the lense, and the reticle shift issues, as much as they can be corrected on a holographic sight. It is the top of the line model they offer and has Night vision capability and is water proof up to 30 feet under water. It also has the integral QD mount which puts it at the lower 1/3 co-witness on an ar15. Included is the box, a battery, and all the paperwork. I will sell it outright, but would prefer to trade. Let me know what you have. I am a historical firearms collector, as well as a fan of the modern. Maybe we can work something out. Feel free to text: six hundred-fifety six fourteen."

I'm just trying to get my money back as I did not build these particular ones. These are great kits for the person who wants to customize and not pay boat loads of extra cash for brand name parts.. out of 4 or 5 manufacturers all these parts are coming from the same people. The reason why i got these for so cheap is because thereis no name brand on anything, but if you say them next to Anderson parts for example you couldn't tell the difference. Now for some reason I was flagged last post so I'm explaining this in detail this time around. Now about the kits....1 in 7 twist for a 7 1/2 barrel chambered Wylde with a pistol length gas tube and is free float alsoALL PARTS ARE TO MIL SPEC!!!!! MADE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES..... Dust cover, charging handle and flash hide all laser engraved with American flag imagesI will post pictures but if you want more please email me and I'll be happy to discuss any and every avenue about these weapon systems with you and provide detailed photographic evidence of the authenticity of these weapons... I've built multiple of these kits and I will happily send you pictures and updates on those too if you care to know.. Again these are good quality pistol kits for anyone who wants an operational rifle and not some brand name fanboy with zero real world experience... thank you for your time"
