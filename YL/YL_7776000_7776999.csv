The BCG appears to be a commercial product, hence the ""battle worn finish,"" and sits a little looser than mil-spec BCGs. Current setup passes headspace testing for .223 Remington, and the previous owner put 350 rounds through it without an issue. However, when a mil-spec BCG is put in the receiver, the bolt will not lock. I'm guessing there is an issue with the gas tube placement/length.Disclaimer: Must be an AZ resident, over the age of 18, and is required to present a valid DL or state issued identification card at the time of purchase.
