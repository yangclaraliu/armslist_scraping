The suspension is bad, the brakes are messed up, 2 windows are busted (see picture), the power locks don't work right, it has a flat front tire (spare is flat too), tires are pretty rough all around, the front ""push bar"" is busted, the hood doesn't always wanna open real easy... You know, the basic stuff you see in a $500 vehicle.  I had plans to tinker with it, but just never got around to it.

This is known for its excellent accuracy, the Stainless Steel barrel is hand lapped and has a nice thickness to it to keep that accuracy even when hot, even so it’s still nice and light at just a hair under 7 pounds. Also the rail is excellent quality, it’s Jerry Miculeks favorite and he is not sponsored by Barnes to say that. It’s probably the strongest rail on the market as the barrel nut is extra large. It also comes with its original box, QD mounts, QD swivel for bipod. The rifle is barely used and has just a few hundred rounds through it, it looks new and has no major blemishes anywhere. I would consider possible trade for this. I also have a Daniel Defense v11 listed ."
