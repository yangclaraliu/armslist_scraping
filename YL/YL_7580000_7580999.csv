It is a very lightweight, smooth shooting rifle. The muzzle break and adjustable gas block make for almost non existant recoil which leads to very fast and accurate shooting! Every part of this rifle was hand selected to be exactly what i wanted in a competition gun. Unfortunately, i don't have the time to compete anymore. I have kept this rifle in mint condition and has been cleaned and lubed after every time that it has been shot. Some of the features include:-Billet Upper and Lower receivers cerekoted NRA Blue-CMC 3.5lb Flat trigger with anti walk pins-Nickel Boron BCG-Fortis Hammer Nickelene Enhanced Charging Handle-Chromelined Lightweight Contour 16"" Barrel-POF 3 Chamber Muzzle Break-Seekins Adjustable gas block-Hogue Overmold Grip-Magpul SL-K Stock-15' Extra lightweight Keymod Rail-Duel sling attachment end plate-Vortex Stirke Eagle 1x6 luminated scope with SFWA S.S.A.L.T. one piece mount-Bushnell First Strike Red Dot with protective hood(Self regulating brightness adjustment and auto on/off)on 45 degree mount I hate to get rid of this rifle but it just sits in the safe since I don't have the time to compete anymore. If you have any questions please let me know. I have well over $2k in this rifle and have only used it in about 6 competitions and a few practice sessions at the range in the year that i have had it. Please contact me at REDACTED with any questions. Thanks!"

This sexy rifle is both beautiful and lethal. It's like that ex-girlfriend you used to be scared to talk to, but not anymore. You're bound to get any chick in sight and with a 24x magnification, that's farther than Forrest Gump can run in a week.Scientifically speaking, studies have shown that shooting this rifle 50 times per month has on average a 2000% increase in testosterone levels. Measurements have proven this rig to be in better shape than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever dreamed of being. Also, your chances of pulling the best looking babes at the ranges go up so high it's like playing Madden with the Hall of Fame team against the Cleveland Browns: it's not even fair.Anyways, the caliber is the most American round ever, the mighty .308 Winchester. It's killed more bad guys than Chuck Norris has. The scope (Technically a Vortex HST 6-24×50) is as clear as the eye of a bald eagle looking down on the US of A. All accessories on this bad boy are 'Merican quality like your uncle's '69 SS Camaro with no mufflers. No Taiwan knockoffs for this straight shooter. And to make this deal even sweeter than your grandma's sweet tea I'll throw in a few hundred rounds of ammo so you can shoot down anything that opposes your God given freedoms. Oh and did I mention that it has a case with locks that not only means you can't hurt this rifle no matter how many times you throw it in the back of your truck, but when your fat little cousin wants to go show it off you can keep his grubby hands off of it.I can meet in the world famous towns of Camden or Waverly. Price is as firm as a Victoria's Secret model's bottom. You can call me at REDACTED"

I wanted it to look like an older ww1 model but operate like a newer 1911 and i got just what i wanted. I could list all the parts but i think you get the point.. Comes with 3 colt 45 auto magazines 2 are stainless marked with the colt horse and 45 auto 7 rounders. The other is blued. And i have an 8 round kimber magazine.. Also have another pair of grips ivory grim reaper grips..everything in this gun is solid and tight has an original usgi recoil spring/ guid rod and plug as well. Really really smooth slide action smooth as hell!!! this is my 7th build i have other pics of my builds feel free to ask i dont want no trades. Needing cash to get a few more parts for other builds.. I have more pics... I really hate to get rid of this i love this gun it opperates and shoots like a 2000 dollar 1911 but just because its a custome gun and i tell people whats in it .... Makes no difference people dont see real value/ genuine value in a well built custome firearm Exspecially a nice one smoothest/ nicest real deal 1911 your gonna get for the price hell you could make more money into parting this thing out really pathetic i pit soo much money into this gun to find out down the road the resale value of a custom gun is worse then a factory if i known that i Wouldent have built it and spent 56 man hours of Labour and 1100 bucks in parts and tools smh ridiculous but i can say this it works like its supose to and makes me proud to say i built it.. Im just board with it id like to move on to a revolver either S&W or ruger or possibly a cheaper revolver and cash im pretty open to suggestions.

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match. It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace.  There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog. Hard to price history just make a fair offer. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19/17 gen 4/5, Sig P320, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

Looking to sell this MOLLE vest I've had for a while and never used. I believe I got this while I was in the Army and never wound up needing it.

Has internal zippered web pockets on both right and left sides, and rear mesh to help keep the thick cordura off of you. I remember deciding on this one because it has reinforcements on both shoulders, and that was super useful as a M240 gunner.
