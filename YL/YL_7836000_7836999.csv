Very lightly used, less than 250 rounds shot with this kit equipped. All original pieces, manual and wrapping is included. This is a fun and inexpensive way to have yourself a bullpup!
This is the deluxe package so along with the stock assembly it also includes an extended mag release, front tri-rail and I'm throwing in the separate rear sling strap and an adjustable foregrip as well. All of this is $250 together on the SGWorks website before shipping cost and I'm pricing mine for $120.
I'm selling this because I have an AUG to scratch my bullpup itch now and decided to swap and keep my SKS back to its original configuration a few months back. The nice thing about this kit is that it requires no permanent modification to your SKS so you can switch it out as you please. This item is priced to move since I'm trying to free up space in my parts chest. Price is FIRM since it's already HALF of what you would pay from the original manufacturer and again, THIS IS A KIT ONLY, NOT A RIFLE FOR SALE.
This item doesn't require an FFL to exchange, but I would prefer to meet in a public place. Local deal only, so no shipping, sorry! Feel free to message me with any questions."

This isn't your smelly cousins Carl's DPMS which he swears is just as good as everything else. Someone needs to bob that guys mullet. This laser beam shooting rifle is based on an Aero Precision Magpul Stealth Grey Limited Edition Builders kit. Yes, it's actually a limited edition. Are you only familiar with DPMS and Spikes, well my uninformed friend, I suggest you edjumicate yourself with Aero. They make rockets and stuff, that's right... a NASA rifle. It's equipped with a 12"" M-Lok (all hail the M-Lok master race) rail, this bad mama jama is bolted to the enhanced aero M4E1 upper receiver with 8 bolts that were secured with a dab of blue locktite. Under the rail is a Critical Capabilities CHF 416R SS Melonite Middy Barrel. Pounded out by the hammer forged freedom drums and smothered in melonite unicorn snot, this barrel puts your uncle larry's ol armalite barrel to shame. This is 2018, stop pretending your 30 year old barrel is better. It's not. and neither is your drakkar noir musk.This BAMF of a barrel is outfitted with a Super Precision Gizelle super precisionally gas block. It doesn't get more african animally or precisional. The freedom gas takes a nice road trip through the gas tube to find a expansive home in a PSA premium mil spec C158 bolt carrier that's properly staked and all that. If you don't know what gas key staking is, just close this ad and go back to eating glue. The charging handle is used, and has that BFPU look to it. Because this is MURICA. And on that note, if you use two fingers to charge your AR, please stop, put the gun down and go get some training. The LPK and internals are US mfg mil spec, prob PSA cause I went HAM on that stuff in preparation for Crooked Hillary to effectively steal the election. There are some BCM goodies as well, the stock and grip are that gunfighter slick willy stuff only the bearded ones know about. This isn't stuff you buy at academy after eating at cracker barrel with yer overweight family. This is high speed ninja gear. Like hill people gear. The trigger guard is a B5 for either your winter gloves because you shoot in winter like some D-Force guy or, more likely, for your clubbed diabetic fingers. The vertical grip has been painted to match so everything is matching. Your GF will be proud and your mall ninja friends and their 22"" rimmed ""off road"" jeeps will be impressed with your level of color coordination. Bonus points if you have some grey oaklies. The grip is a stubby QD tangodown as the good Lord intended. Also included is ONE grey BCM steel magazine. These are rare as Hillary's emails. But durable as Trumps orange skin. Hell yeah. Lastly, the castly nut is staked using a VLTOR end plate. Yes, staking does matter. LAST BUT NOT LEAST... this baby is unfired."

AK-100 Platform replaced AK-74m (which replaced AK-74, which replaced AKM, which replaced original AK47). It is modular, and shares components across calibers.  So parts from AK-100 will drop into a 103, etc. A bolt from 5.45 will fit into the 223 carrier, etc. This is what the Russian military is using now (chambered in 5.45) Spetznaz, Russian Special Forces, still uses only 7.62x39, a superior round for CQB. Hence this build & conversion.*** installed current FSB/GB combo looks just like the new AK12/AK15 version recently accepted into armed services by the Russian FederationCUSTOM BLUED FINISH - DISTRESSED / BATTLE-WORN LOOK / AGED LOOK. - “almost worn to bare metal” looks like it in some places, yet dark in others. You can see Russian tooling marks and proof marks. And everything they did at the factory that was covered by paint. You can see all of the lettering without outlining them with a “paint pen” like “custom paint jobs” do. Some additional items that “stand out:” (and come with)*** PORTED (Vented) Gas Tube - keep inside of the receiver much cleaner & cooler. LOOKS AWESOME***Izhmash MILITARY 30-round 7.62x39 magazine with Bolt-hold-open follower, MATCHING BLUED CUSTOM FINISH***AK74m muzzle brake  MATCHING BLUED FINISH (for Superb recoil mitigation ).

Almost none of the converted Russian sporting rifles do not have this due to the “PITA” installation factor.—- rifle has 2 distinct looks, as seen in the photos - “modernized” AK103 and RPK.

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cauldryn-cfm1-cauldryn-fyre-mobile-heated-coffee-travel-mug/ Description Cauldryn Fyre Mobile Description: Cauldryn Fyre Mobile combines the Cauldryn Kettle/Mug, Fyre heating element, and Mobile battery to create a system that allows you complete control over the temperature of water or other beverages. The Fyre heating element and Mobile battery provide the power to boil water, or maintain your ideal hot beverage temperature. Features: Cauldryn Kettle/Mug: – The Cauldryn Kettle/Mug is a 16oz, stainless steel, vacuum insulated vessel with a modular base that can allow for use of a variety of bases. The vacuum insulation allows for cold beverages to stay cold for long periods of time, and hot beverages to stay hot even without power to the unit.– The Cauldryn Kettle/Mug has an innovative lid that has two drink openings that allow for either sipping hot beverages from a small opening, or taking large drinks/pouring from a spout. The cap for the spout incorporates a pressure relief valve to make boiling water safer. Fyre Heating Element: – The Fyre heating element is at the heart of the Cauldryn Fyre system. It has five heating modes: Boil (212 degrees), Brew (195-205 degrees), Extra Hot (160-170 degrees), and two Hot modes (135-145 degrees and 125-135 degrees). These modes allow the user to truly customize Cauldryn Fyre Mobile’s usage to their particular needs. Each mode will bring your beverage to the specified temperature and keep it there.– Boil mode can allow you to cook, or sterilize water without the need for fire.– Brew mode is the perfect temperature for brewing coffee or black tea, can sterilize water, and is perfect for many cooking applications.– Extra Hot mode is the perfect temperature for people who like their coffee hotter than most, re-hydrating freeze dried food, and many slow cooking applications.– Hot modes are the perfect ranges for most people to drink their coffee, and can be perfectly maintained all day. Mobile Battery: – The rechargeable Mobile battery is what separates the Cauldryn Fyre Mobile from the Cauldryn Fyre plug in only model. Mobile allows you to access all of the features of the Cauldryn Fyre platform without the need to be plugged in. Mobile truly makes the platform a go anywhere survival option with the ability to boil water from a battery. Mobile packs enough power to keep your beverages at your ideal temperature ALL DAY LONG (Boil and Brew modes cannot be maintained all day long from battery power).– In addition to powering the Fyre heating element, Mobile also provides for charging your essential electronics from two charge out USB outlets. AC Base: – The AC Base allows you to run your Cauldryn bottle and Fyre heating element form AC power. This eliminates limits to the number of boils and heat cycles you can perform. The AC base easily detaches from the Fyre heating element to allow for easy wire free drinking. You never have to battle wires with the AC base."

Not that that’s any surprise. No issues with conversion kit either, although it’s a conversion kit I wouldn’t trust my life with it without a full conversion.  This was bought as a police surplus gun from a guy that was going to butcher it into a ported slide. He did a terrible job stippling it and cut the grip to be a Glock 27 size. Didn’t even take Glock 27 mags as it was cut wrong, so I threw it away in frustration. I paired it with a brand new 3 OD frame. No jams. Works flawlessly. Frame does not match. It’s a Glock, not a collectors piece I will not knock off a bunch since it doesn’t match; however I will not ask more than it’s worth. Both the barrel and slide are in great shape, some holster wear on the slide. Slide and barrel match. Id like $700 for everything listed minimum, as the ammo is worth $180, conversion kit is worth $150, then that leaves around $350 for the Glock and $70 for the mags. Would consider selling without ammo or conversion kit for less, however I have no other 40 SW guns so I’d like to include all of it. I think my price is fair given what’s included.i am in no rush to sell this, and wouldn’t mind keeping it. Its an accurate reliable pistol, I will not take low balls or guns with low trade value, however I don’t mind considering low value guns and some cash. I like almost all guns."

I built it and simply never have time to shoot it. This rifle has never, ever been fired. ADCO Firearms machine shop (The best imo) assembled the upper, barrel and FSB for me. They test fired this assembly (Not including the BCG and Charging handle which are still unfired.) to make certain it functions. Other than that this rifle could be considered new.I have about $1200 into this rifle but since it never gets used I’m interested in trading it for something I would actually shoot. I personally enjoy trades more than sales so I’m tossing the idea out there.All furniture is Magpul and rifle will come with a Gen 2 OD Green 30 round windowed PMAG. (Discontinued and not exactly easy to come by.)I started with an unused early 1990's 16"" 1:9 twist .223/5.56 heavy barrel (HBAR)from Olympic Arms that has been stored since new, these are desirable barrels from when Oly Arms was great manufacturer. This rifle was built because I wanted to get this excellent barrel into action. The upper receiver is a 7075 Aero Precision. The BCG is ToolCraft Nitride and the charging handle is a one piece Blackhawk ambi model with no moving parts. Rear sight is a gen2 Magpul MBUS. The flash hider is from Yankee Hill Machine and one of the best at masking flame belches. Almost forgot, I installed a Strike Industries polymer ejection port cover.Please note; if you’d prefer an unfired EXO (NiB) coated FailZero BCG I would be willing to make that swap for you. I like either of these options equally.The 7075 forged lower is Anderson, always solid. It's filled with a premium NiB coated mil-spec fire control group, Noveske & Magpul ambi 60 degree safety selector and a Magpul extended magazine release. The buffer is a captured spring system in lieu of a standard buffer, captured spring recoil systems are all I ever use. They are quiet, reliable and super smooth.The optic is the latest version, as in brand new, from Primary Arms. It’s the newest gen with a 50,000 hour battery life which is battery expectancy on par with Aimpoint.I will also include a matching OD Green QD sling.If you have one of these pistols and would be intersted in completing a trade please contact me.  Photos and a description of what you have would be great.  If you'd like to me to call you include your number and I will.  If you are interested in simply purchasing this rifle the price is $750.  All trades or sales will be legally performed at a convenient FLL.Thanks for lookingAR15 AR-15 AR 15 .223 5.56mm 5.56mm"

I have an RC 1940 German Kar98k produced by J.P. Sauer und Sohn of Suhl, Germany (nowadays known as Sig Sauer). The Kriegsmodell/Late War stock is quite rare and has no cracks. The action is smooth and the rifling is still very crisp. Blueing (as you can tell in the photos) is excellent. This firearm also features the rare plum bolt/receiver exclusive to J.P. Sauer und Sohn's '39 & '40 models.The production code on the receiver is '147'. All Waffenamts, proofings and Reichsadler's (black eagles with swastikas) are intact and weren't peened off after capture. The only things removed during capture (as usual) were the magazine capture screws (which I replaced) and the small front metal plate of the Kriegsmodell stock.

The Holographic Hybrid Sight I (HHS I) features an EXPS3-4 with a G33.STS magnifier. It has great utility for any shooter, whose target ranges vary from close to mid-range. The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.

The extra mag is actually the .40 cal version, but they are interchangeable for this model. Both mags hold 17 rounds of 9mm. This gun runs like butter, and i had the trigger smoothed out by Spencer at Ravenhead Arms in Bellevue. This is basically a copy of a SIG P226 from that era.
Also up for trade is a Taurus Millenium G2 with the original box, manual, extra mag, and accessories. I've only put about 50 rounds through it and it's been great.I really just want to trade both of these for a stainless Ruger GP100 .357 with a 6-inch barrel and the full underlug. Grip style doesn't matter. If you have a different model .357 then i'm still open to it, but the barrel can't be shorter than 6 inches.I'm also open to trades (partial if appropriate) for the following:1) Remington 870, Mossberg, Savage, or semi-auto 20 gauge shotgun (tactical-style is nice but not required)2) Ruger 10/22, user-modified or any factory model without the regular wood stock3) Smith & Wesson M&P .224) AK47 or SKS (must have chrome-lined barrel)Thanks!"
