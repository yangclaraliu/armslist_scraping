This Shotgun comes in OK, Working, Pre-Owned condition. This shotgun does have some heavy signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to both the age of the firearm, as well as the fact that it was previously owned, and frequently used. The wood stock has a number of nicks and cuts, as well as some minor scraping. It also has a fairly large crack that starts where the stock meets the receiver and works back towards the butt. Additionally, the receiver and barrel show a fair amount of rusting and pitting, both on the outside, as well as on the inside. This shotgun does feature a safety switch, set into the trigger assembly, as well as a rail on the top of the receiver which holds the Tasco Hunting Scope. This shotgun has seen better days, but would still make a wonderful addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

Mfr.: Franklin Armory Mfr. Model: 5550 Type: AR Trigger The revolutionary Binary Firing System will be appreciated by three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Features:  Easy installation. No custom fitting. Better trigger pull. 4.5 pounds, +-.5 pound The release phase now has a positive reset. The design eliminates backup disconnector. Stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow.  Specifications:  Works in every AR application: Ar10, AR15, MPX, etc. Works in the F17 series in .17 WSM WITHOUT modification. Works on .22LR uppers WITHOUT modification. Works on 9mm uppers WITHOUT modification."

The Echo AR-II Trigger allows the shooter to select from 3 different settings:~ Safe Mode: Firearm will not fire.~ Semi-Automatic Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled.~ Echo Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also when trigger is released. The Echo AR-II Trigger is designed with safety being the utmost priority. When the shooter is in the Echo Mode and depresses the trigger one round is fired, if the target moves, the shooter can move the selector to the safe position and a second round will not fire upon release.The Echo AR-II Trigger has several distinct features:PATENTED Design that gained ATF Approval (Patent # US 8,820,211 B1)Technology licensed through HIPERFIRE inside the Echo AR-II TriggerLight, clean, and crisp pull in Semi-Automatic ModeThe Echo AR-II Trigger is packed full of cutting edge technologyReliable function in Echo Mode"

This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw an average amount of normal usage. There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, or discoloration. There are a handful of minor nicks and cuts throughout the shotgun's wood stock, as well as some scrapes on the forearm/slide-action. The receiver is in good condition, with only a very small amount of minor rusting on the outside of the receiver, as well as on the inside chamber. This shotgun features a soft rubber butt-stock for comfortable shouldering, as well as to reduce the shotgun's recoil. It also features a safety switch set into the trigger assembly, and a 28"" Ribbed barrel, topped at the end with a bead sight. This is a wonderful shotgun, that would make a fantastic addition to anybody's collection.

This shotgun comes in Excellent, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It has only VERY MINOR signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only infrequently fired, despite having been previously owned. This shotgun is free of all major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. This applies both to the shotgun's wood stock and forearm/slide-action, as well as its Receiver, and Ribbed Barrel. There are only a small handful of very shallow nicks visible in the stock, and the receiver is free of gouges, scratches, and any signs of rusting both inside the chamber, as well as outside. This shotgun features a soft rubber butt-stock for comfortable shouldering, as well as to reduce the shotgun's recoil. It also features a safety switch set into the trigger assembly, and a 28"" Ribbed barrel, topped at the end with a bead sight. This is a wonderful shotgun, that would make a fantastic addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

This Shotgun comes in Excellent, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It has only MINOR signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only lightly used, despite having been previously owned. There are no major flaws/defects anywhere to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are a small handful of short, shallow nicks and cuts throughout both the synthetic stock, as well as the shotgun's receiver, and barrel. However, these are free of any rusting, discoloration, or pitting, either on the inside, or out. This shotgun features a soft rubber butt-stock for comfortable shouldering, as well as to reduce the shotgun's recoil. It also features a safety switch set into the trigger assembly, and a 28""  barrel, topped at the end with a level sight. This is a wonderful shotgun, that would make a fantastic addition to anybody's collection.

I am fair with my pricing and expect you to be the same , if you feel yours is worth gold and mine is crap then move on. I been doing this 25 years  so been around the block.  If you want to trade  let me know what you have and send a picture, I will drive a reasonable distance to meet FTF and you will need ID and your permit period.  Lets hear some deals !The pistol comes with two mags ,  for the right deal I have holsters to go with it as well."

Great choice for a light weight AR15 build. I have these in black and tan. On sale $39.99Manufactured from a fiber-reinforced Nylon blend with extreme resiliency. Using our patent-pending technology, Marine-Grade Brass inserts are permanently molded into the receivers at the Grip Screw & Buffer Area. These metal threaded inserts increase durability without sacrificing weight savings of the composite bodies. Colors are injected throughout the receiver during molding thus eliminating the worry for a scratched or marred finish.The end result is a sturdy receiver that is light to carry without compromising functionality.
Sporting a redesigned bolt catch area, a repositioned buffer retainer, and all the upgrades from previous models, this design is optimal. Enhancements are from customer-expressed opinions that we valued & then turned back into our product. Our receivers are constructed to accept any quality mil-spec Lower Parts Kit. With an unmatched versatility for parts, customers are pleased when the builds are completed. Tennessee Arms Company is unceasing in our efforts to improve our design for our customers' future builds.
Our AR-15 has the ability to be modified to fit Fixed-Stock Tubes (A2). If you are aware that you will be using this type, please let us know and we will modify the lower for you before shipment. If you are in possession of your lower, and do not wish to send it back, it can be modified at home. .0625"" (16th) needs to be taken off the back for the tube to engage the retainer. (We recommend a belt-sander).
ALL TN ARMS CO Products come with a lifetime guarantee. We stand behind our products 100%. We believe the finest way to show this is through impeccable customer service which includes a warranty that stands firm. We invented the hybrid lower receiver, and we work continuously to keep it second-to-none.

5.6 Ounces Stripped
Federal law requires that you be 21 years or age or older to purchase a stripped receiver or frame. Even if a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun. However, they still are ""firearms"" by definition, and subject to the same GCA limitations as any other firearms."
