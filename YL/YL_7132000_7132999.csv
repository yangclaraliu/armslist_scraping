I purchased this rifle new. The rifle is equipped with a Bushnell illuminated scope with a 1 to 4 magnification with a throw lever. The rifle is in excellent condition, great action, adjustable gas piston, which allows the rifle to function in adverse and dirty conditions. The stock folds and locks for operation in close quarter combat conditions. The rifle accepts regular AR magazines (1 included), and with the quad rail forward stock you can attach virtually any accessory. I’ve had several AR rifles, and without question, this rifle is the most accurate I’ve owned. I’ve probably fired 300 to 400 rounds through this weapon, and it comes with the owner’s manual, original SIG shipping box and gun lock. The gun also has a rotary diopter rear sight.
This rifle is hard to find. But I will part with it for 1750.00. I might consider a partial trade. I don’t really have anything in mind, so if you are interested, let me know what you are thinking."

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Seriesintegrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which alsoprovides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- orright-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide isprotected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorterbarrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels."

Browning-designed water-cooled M1917. Buying a firearm online is simple! The only extra step is we have to ship to another FFL (Federal Firearms License) dealer near you.

I've got a stainless steel Taurus Model 85 .38 Special (+P Rated) DA/SA revolver that I love & really don't want to get rid of BUT since I've sold my other .22LR rifle a while back I truly miss plinking so it's looking like I want a 10/22 more than I want to keep my wheel gun. The lock-up is tight, the action is smooth, & the trigger is crisp on this beauity. It is perfect for packing some firepower IWB on hot days when you may not want to deal with a full size pistol but still want to pack a serious punch! This gun does just that!!! I prefer trading for a decent 10/22 but may consider selling the Taurus out right for the right price. Just don't waste either of our times with ridiculous lowball offers please. Let me know what you have & we will go from there. I may consider .22LR pistols as well. Thank you for looking! If your reading this it means I still have the gun."

It has a very clean uncluttered reticle. They were originally around $400. Burris came out with the C4 Wind Plus and these were scopes were on sale. The only difference I was able to find between these and the new C4 Plus model was a sticker for judging wind hold (something I would never use). No trades.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
