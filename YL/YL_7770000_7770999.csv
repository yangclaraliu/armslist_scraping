The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps.-New (Never Used)-All Original Box & Materials-Still Under Warranty (Was just replaced by Trijicon)-Supporting Documents Of Warranty Repairs"

Tom Gresham worked with Sig Sauer directly to make this unique combination. Though the marking on the gun says 1 of 300, there were only about 150 of these produced. As an apology for delays and issues with manufacturing, Sig Sauer included a 3rd magazine with this collectors edition. There is also a cloth case and extra two mags provided as part of a sig sauer rebate that was going on at the time of purchase. These are included as well bringing the number of mags to 5 total.Here is Gun Talk's original video post about the pistol. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MKrAHGFBn8The only items missing from this is the small pack of grease Sig Sauer included, and the sig sauer ""seal"" they wrap around the grip.This pistol is a laser if you do your part. Its incredibly easy to keep shots in a pie plate at 100 yards with quality ammo and a steady hand.While I have shot this pistol some, I have kept it in incredible condition as I do all of my firearms. As you can see from the ramp picture it is pristine inside and out.Asking $1650, but open to reasonable offers. Sale is contingent on buyer passing a background check at an FFL of their choosing within 50 miles of Lafayette. Buyer pays any and all background check and or transfer fees the FFL charges in addition to any agreed upon sale price. Pictures included, message me if you would like any more pictures since armslist only allows 3.I may be open to trades on one of the following items but at this time, only the following. Benelli R1 300 win mag with walnut stock. Browning BAR in 300 win mag or 7mm rem mag with walnut stock and Boss brake. Any possible trades will need to be in or near pristine condition, and is still contingent on background check. Unless the rifle has a high value scope, I will need some cash in hand after trade."

I'm no expert but it's held up very nicely for the year that I've owned it and I would be hardpressed to tell the difference between it and a DD. The rail is an offbrand (And I have no idea the actual manufacturer) and is slightly longer than the barrel. That means the flash hider is recessed inside the rail a bit. I actually like how it looks better than the real deal but it won't allow a suppressor to be attached- if you're thnking of going that route. The Eotech is in excellent condition and will come with the original box. The weaponlight is an Olight WM25 RM1X. It's 1000 lumens and comes with a pressure switch. I am willing to sell the optic, upper and light seperately for $450, $300 and $75, respectively. I am not looking to trade and I'm firm on the price(s). Let me know if you have any questions."

With both a .22lr and .22 magnum cylinder, its like having two guns in one. Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. The Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot. It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot. If you prefer, if requested via email, I will gladly swap out white or other grips."

Each pistol features the military's Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and Sig's Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military's accuracy requirements - even after 20,000 rounds.
