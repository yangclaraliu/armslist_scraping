Like new with a low round count (less than 200) and very light holster wear.

I personally think that it gives it more character plus the stipple/talon combo has a very nice feel to it. Valued at $950+ with the upgrades and accessories. Asking $750 cash and price is firm.

Not exactly in a hurry to sell. I am selling for $750 or best offer.  It will come with one factory 7 round magazine, 3 Chip McCormick Shooting Star 8 round Magazines, Rosewood/pearl grips, G10 grips, the factory black rubber grips, takedown tool, Kimber hard case and some HST hollow points.I am only open to trading for a S&W M&P 9 (full size, not the one with the 5 inch barrel) WITH THE THUMB SAFETY and I would like some cash on top of that.I am also open to trading for a 1911 in 9mm.

This particular model, looks and functions like an M1 Carbine but is not interchangeable with any GI model M1's. The benefit to this is it's a new manufactured rifle, a blast to shoot. You don't have to worry about dinging up a rifle from the 40's. It shoots just like an GI model. It has a bolt hold open system. It fires fine. The 30 round magazine I believe is GI issue and is an older mag. The 15 round mag is brand new.

The gun is in good condiiton, with minimal wear marks on it. I've only shot trap with it and there have been roughly 700 rounds put through it. It shoots great, but I've had issues with fitment which has made it difficult to progress in trap shooting, so I've swtiched guns. It comes with automatic ejectors, 5 extended chokes, a raised rib, monte carlo style stock.  and a green fiber optic front sight. I'm selling it because I need the money. I'm currently in college and every bit helps. Feel free to make an offer if what I'm asking for seems high, however this gun retails for around $900 before tax, so $625 seems like an extremely fair price. I'm willing to ship for $35 additional to an ffl. Also wiling to take trades. Will send more pictures upon request."

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 10+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.
