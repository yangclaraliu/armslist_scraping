The serial number is 10375 and was manufactured in 1890. Overall condition is very good based on NRA antique firearm condition. The cylinder release, frame, under the barrel and cylinder show the makers mark of 999. The original grips have a crack / missing small piece down on both corners. The top of the barrel has the following markings: Colts PT. F.A. MTG. CO Hartford CT USA PAT AUG 5 84 NOV 6 1888. It is made of unpolished nickel which has frosted nicely. It has a 4.5 inch barrel and hard rubber checkered grips. The nickle-plated finish with fire blued apointments on screws, trigger, and hammer. Manufactured in 1890 based on the serial number. This is a commercial revolver with the action works either in double or single action. When the cylinder is closed it spins in a downward motion but will not spin upward. When the hammer is cocked, the cyliner stays locked in place. The timing of the cylinder seems to work as it should and is locked when the hammer is cocked. This is a real nice piece of Colt history.

It was made sometime between 1895 and 1915. It was made by Hopkins&Allen and was way ahead of its time. The shotgun was made specifically for Supplee Biddle Hardware in Philidelphia, Pennsulvania. This little shotgun has internal strikers instead of outside hammers. It also  has a tank safety on top of the receiver and the barrels are laminated steel and not damascus twist steel barrels. It also has a 3 inch chamber which was unheard of in those days.This gun is over 100 years old and I doubt that it was fired very many times. It is in very good condition and locks up tightly. It is a very unusual firearm to say the least.  I am firm on the price of $500.00 so don't email or call me unless you are serious. My number is:REDACTED so you can call or email me at Armslist. If you can read this post the item is still for sale. Thanks!"

He told me this gun was fired little over the years and it really is in nice shape as you can see. The gun has a 20 round Colt mag and since this is a Pre Ban Rifle I BELIEVE it is Mass and CT legal. IF you are a Mass or CT resident you MUST check with your dealer in Mass or CT BEFORE you buy this gun to make sure they will take the gun in for transfer. Some MA & CT dealers will not transfer AR's in at all so please check 1st before contacting me, your dealer has the most up to date information on MASS and CT gun laws. The rifle is a really cool collector piece and these are going up in value all the time as it is a genuine Colt Pre Ban. No forward assist on this rifle as you can see, it is a early version. Don't waste your $$$ and buy a beat up and all shot out AR-15 pre ban Colt when this one here is so nice. Shipping also available for $50"

The serial number is 18607 located at the bottom of the grip. Overall condition of the firearms is excellent based on NRA Antique Firearm condition. The only problem is that it appears to have been completely restored to like new condition. I am not sure when or by whom it was done. I bought this firearm at an estate sale. The entire action of revolver is like using a brand new one. It has been meticously re-done and has a person's name ""Robert Leib"" engraved into the frame. I am not sure if this was a previous owner or the person who restored the firearm. The wood grips seem to be authentic for the period and it does have US Army Model 1917 stamped on the bottom of the grip. This gun is hard to rate because it is like a new firearm mechanically but has been restored which means from a collector perspective could lower the value. I am not a gun expert but this one is a clean version of the Colt 1917 that could be taken and fired. It has a 5 1/2 inch barrel. The following markings are on the barrel: On one side its marked ""Colt DA 45"", under the barrel is marked ""United States Property"" and on top has ""COLTs PT FA MTG CO. Hartford, CT USA, PATD AUG 5, 1884, June 5 1900, July 4 1905."" The cylinder has different serial numbers than on the handgrip. If you do research this seems to be typical for the 1917 models. The goverment uses the serial number on the grip as the tracking mechanism. The frame and cylinder has 170686 and below that number is 13118. The entire action of the firearms is solid, the cylinder does not turn freely, the action works as it should with the timing.Must have CCP or gun purchase permit."
