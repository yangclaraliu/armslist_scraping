Excellent condition, low round count. Tight action and precision machined like a swiss watch. Using the half-way notch cylinder, the hammer can rest safely away from live chambers without chance of accidental discharge. The holster grip allows the pistol to ride comfortably in a pocket for quick access without it looking like a gun, and snaps open quickly making it easy to grip and control. When the holster grip is folded, the trigger of the gun is completely enclosed making it virtually impossible for the gun to be fired. The .22 LR cylinder will let you shoot .22 shorts, longs, and long rifles. The .22 mag cylinder makes a lot more noise, and makes it an effective option for self defence. Hornady and Speer make defense loads designed for use in the mini revolver that compare to .380acp defense loads in gelatin.If the ad is active the pistol is available. Additional pictures available on request. Trades considered, let me know what you have. Prefer a face to face transaction in North Platte but will ship at buyer's expense.

Power Steering reduces steering effort and foot fatigue, making Ultrex the smoothest, most responsive motor you’ve ever driven. Get instant response with all-day comfort. – Steering Lock: When you take your foot off Ultrex’s foot pedal, the motor head remains pointed in the direction you left it last – so you can keep your heading without loosing your bite. There’s no recoil or readjustment – just easier steering every day. – Ultrex Foot Pedal: The Ultrex foot pedal is like nothing you’ve ever used. Classic heel/toe steering with Power Steering gives you instant response without the fatigue. Steering Lock keeps the motor pointed in the direction you left it last when your foot leaves the pedal. Features Spot-Lock and AutoPilot buttons directly on the foot pedal, so you can lock onto a fishing spot or set a course directly from the foot pedal. – Lift-Assist: Lift-Assist’s stainless steel, nitrogen-charged gas spring makes stow and deploy easy. When you deploy, let go of the motor and Lift-Assist will gradually guide it into the water – quickly, but without impact. And stowing your motor is 50% easier – as easy as lifting your SUV tailgate. – Counter-Tension Stabilizer: Utilizes an integrated spring that applies force whether the motor is stowed or deployed. On the water, that translates to a motor with no play, no give, reduced steering torque and years of silent operation. – Digital Mazimizer: Motors with Digital Maximizer provide up to five times longer run time on a single charge by drawing only as much power as you need, so they don’t waste any energy. These motors are variable speed, so dial in your precise speed and let Digital Maximizer deliver the right amount of power, while conserving your battery – extending your time on the water. – Weedless Wedge 2 Prop: Push weeds away and take on the thick stuff without battery-draining chopping and hacking. Weedless Wedge 2 features swept-back, flared blades for unrelenting, reliable prop performance. – Advantage Minn Kota: Indestructible Composite Shaft: Pound for pound, our composite shaft is stronger than steel. It flexes on impact and won’t break, kink or corrode. – Cool, Quiet, Power:Nothing runs cooler or quieter than a Minn Kota. The extra large windings and commutators dissipate heat, resulting in cooler operation, extended battery power, and longer motor life. And the unique bearing system reduces friction to cut fish-spooking noise. Specifications: – Control: Remote and Foot Pedal – Volts: 24 – Max Thrust: 80 lbs. – Shaft Length: 45″ – i-Pilot Link – Universal Sonar 2 – Speed Control: Variable – AutoPilot: Incl. on i-Pilot Link – Max.

Please click link below to purchase. https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/burris-fullfield-ii-scope-6-5-20x50mm-ballistic-mil-dot-pa-black-matte-200193/  Description 6.5X-20X50mm Ballistic MilDot Mat Description: The Burris Fullfield II scope is an enhanced model of the Fullfield version. It boasts a more forgiving sharpness and eye clarity for positioning fore and aft, and left and right. Using modern alloys and machining techniques the weight has been reduced by 20%-25% without affecting durability or optical performance. Most scopes have three or four potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area. The Fullfield II has but two. These leak paths are sealed with special quad seals rather than low-tech O-rings. To change magnification, turn the entire eyepiece, which is now integral to the power ring. A European-style adjustable eyepiece is easy to use and requires no locking mechanism. Burris has moved the adjustment system rearward to better accommodates mounting situations. Also, the eyepiece is shorter, allowing even more mounting flexibility. The Fullfield II has also improved long-range marksmanship. The lower part of the crosshair has ballistic lines that compensate for bullet drop from 100 yards to 500 yards for many common hunting cartridges-it’s called the Ballistic Plex. This is an ultra-bright varmint/target scope or for long-range big game hunting. -Power: 6.5X-20X -50mm Clear Objective Diameter -Reticle: Ballistic Mil-Dot -Color: Matte -Field of View 100 Yards: 17 feet (Low) 6 feet (High) -Exit Pupil: 7.2mm (Low) 2.6mm (High) -Click Adjustment Value 100 Yards: .25 inches -Max Adjustment 100 Yards: 30 inches -Weight: 19 ounces -Length: 14.5 inches -1″ Tube"

I love the crimson TRACE LASER Grips because they are top of the line and they will work with any holster plus they are one of the brightest and strongest beams out there. But at this point I don't have a use for it and willing to part with it it's not even 3 months old and has been just sitting and they are not cheap because the quality and warranty and free batteries for life they offer.

This grip beam fits a lot of models not just the 26 27 and 33 because the glock frames are the same size on the grip and where the pin lines up to fasten it on so keep that in mind.

This piece is in very good condition with some 400 rounds fired through it. Includes 3x 8 round magazines. A rubber combat grip is installed which greatly enhances pointability and control. Being a single stack design it is thin and easy for smaller hands to grip onto. The low recoil of the 9mm combined with the all steel construction and ergonomic grip make this gun a soft shooter. A locked breech single action design similar to the Browning 1911 makes it strong enough to run NATO spec +P+ 9mm. With the proper barrel and magazine it can be easily converted to the original 7.62 chambering, and conversion barrels in .38 super can be found as well.The feed ramp and rails have been polished to smooth operation and aid feed reliabilty. This version is one of the later imports and uses the dedicated ""skinny"" type 9mm magazines. Standard 7.62x25 Tokarev magazines can be used by removing the spacer within the magazine well. A short grip heel and slim profile make it a viable carry option. Asking $285 or trade.If the ad is active the pistol is available. Additional pictures available on request. Trades considered, let me know what you have. Prefer a face to face transaction in North Platte, a Nebraska purchase permit or CHP is required. Please don't waste your time if you don't have one.

The two 20 round Magazines are Tapco brand, and are a dark OD Green. 
The single is a 30 round Magazine, and is ProMag brand, and is black. 
I've fired a grand total of maybe five rounds from either of these magazines, I am just attempting to restore my rifle back to its original condition, so these are being sold. Open to offers and local pickup in the Twin Cities, MN. 
These magazines, and the ""SKS Drop Free"" bolt modification will bring your rifle into the 21st century and is a lot of fun when used as a sporting rifle."
