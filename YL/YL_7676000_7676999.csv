It’s chambered for 5.56 so it can fire either 5.56 or .223. I’ve only put about 200 rounds through it with consistent 2 inch groupings at 100 yards with the scope I have on it. I’ve kept it very clean and stored in a case whenever I wasn’t target shooting with it. Here are the specs as far as I know them:
Anderson lower/upper receiversTwo-stage triggerHogue comfort gripMagpul CTR Mil-spec stockBurris AR P.E.P.R. scope mountVortex Crossfire II 4-12x scopeMbus flip-up sights (the rear sight is installed already)16″ barrel with a 2″ Ares compensatorRadian Raptor charging handle
Looking online at the same components, it looks like this build would cost about $1,200 right now, which is more or less what it cost me 2 years ago. My list price also includes 265 5.56 rounds, 3 Magpull magazines (two 20 round capacity & one 30 round capacity) and a Cabela’s soft carrying case, all of which can be seen in the pictures. I’ll also cover the cost of transferring it to your name if that’s something you’re interested in. Feel free to call or text me anytime with questions or if you would like to come and take a look at it, my number is REDACTED and name is Alex."

It has a mat blue finish, beavertail grip safety, skeletonized hammer and trigger, magazine well, Patridge sights, and extended slide release, all from the factory. It now wears Hogue rubber grips and feels great in the hand. It comes with two Chip McCormick (not the four pictured) Flying Star magazines.I've been collecting firearms for forty years. This is a pistol I've enjoyed owning for almost half that time, but as I grow older I'm starting to downsize my collection. It's for sale to legal, Minnesota buyers only."

Without going into the full details, go to Buds Guns.com and look up this marvelous non plastic shotgun.  The details when manufactured exceed most shotguns costing far more than this piece.I've nevr had a shell through it as its been in the carrying bag since day one.  This firearm comes with a gun belt that allows for spare 12 ga shells. I've also purchased a heavy duty carrying bag that has several pockets for addtional shells and other equipment or maybe a sandwich.I've left photos out but at Buds you'll have a full image and the accessories (less bag) included.  What I've found, most dealers are out of stock on this model since they are so popular. You pay the transfer and its yours for noted price.  Sound Loan in Everett has the lowest transfer price I've ever seen."
