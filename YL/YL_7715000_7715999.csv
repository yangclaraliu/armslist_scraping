I would be willing to pay for access to the property or would be willing to provide training to the owner/owners family. I'm current military and spent the majority of my career as a Sniper, among other specialty positions. I will gladly provide valid forms of identification and credentials to confirm my experience and proficiency. I've also been an instructor for the last 6 years in various forms of personal defense, long range shooting, and small unit tactics.
    I am not looking for property that will be used to run my own business nor will I be hosting any classes or such, this is simply for myself to maintain an area in which I can continue training. Since moving to Northern Virginia options have been short to say the least. I would also be happy to work for this priveleges, grounds maintenace and farm care are certainly within my repertoire.
    If you're in the Northern Virginia area and own property that ranges from 25 yards to 1000 yards and would be interested in discussing more to determine viability, please let me know by sending a PM.  I carry my own insurance and would be of no liability to the property owner either.  Thanks for reading!"

I used this gun to shoot in bullseye pistol competitions for a season. This gun dissassembles and reassembles very easily without any tools or a hammer. Includes the pistol, two magazines, rail with screws, box, papers, soft case, lock, safety key. This model has a threaded barrel for a compensator or silencer, it has a Cobalt colored barrel, it looks silver. I have added a hammer bushing to allow for dryfiring without the magazine in the gun. This is a great first gun to work on your shooting fundamentals, but it can also be used for hunting and pistol competitions. 22 Long Rifle ammo is about 6 cents per shot, this pistol is cheap to shoot. This is the lowest priced Ruger 22/45 for sale in Illinois on Armslist!Volquartsen competition trigger kit is for $100, tandemkross compensator is available for $35.Asking $350 OBO. All Illinois laws apply, must have an FOID, must wait 72 hours from FOID processing."

Thought by many to be the best .357 ever made, most beautiful, most rugged, most classic. This is the big Dirty Harry frame size except with the perfect barrel length and in a caliber that is affordable and fun to shoot.

The gun has custom “firewood” grips and comes with 1 magazine. It takes down exactly like a 1911. It was manufactured in 1943 and certain parts of the firearm are stained red from Russian cosmoline such as the extractor, the contact piece between the slide spring and barrel, and the trigger has a very light red tint to it. The finish is around 75% due to some holster wear but is still pretty good for a firearm that is 74 years old and has been possessed by both the Spanish and Russian armies. I field stripped it recently to clean it and it was in great condition. It was blued at the Star factory and when the Russians captured it, it was dunked into cosmolene. After who knows how long, it was turned over to a dealer who then reblued it and sold it on the civilian market to the 1st owner. All stamps are still intact and look great! This is a great collectors item. Stars that can be bought today are generally from the 70-90s era so WW2 models are not nearly as common so that is why the pricing is different. This particular pistol has a story behind it due to a eagle holding a swatztika on the grip. The original dealer who had a crate of stars knew that some stars were sold to the nazis during the war. So he attempted to sell mine as Nazi owned due to the selling price of originals being 3-4 times the price of a normal WW2 Star. It’s a pretty cool conversation piece even if it is a fake!The last picture, the Ñ, is the Spanish proofmark for 1943. Beside it is the verification stamp placed by the proofhouse in Spain. Star has an official website and they show all the dates for every proofmark ever stamped on a Star product. All numbers match. If you are knowledgeable about the Model B you will know that they are known for stovepiping, this is not a range master it is a safe queen that will accrue in value.This is a great piece for Spanish collectors or just someone who wants a WW2 1911! I can send additional pictures of the inside, bore, and what not. If you have any questions just ask! I do not ship and I would be more than happy to send pictures of the bore upon request! Price is firm"
