Based on the lack of cycling wear on the rails and on top of the barrel, and the lack of erosion on the breech face, the pistol appears to be unfired ex-factory. It is all original as shipped by Swiss Arms, except for the extra factory magazine that I added to replace the missing spare. The long slide unique to this model is fitted with factory micrometer adjustable sights. The late pattern heavy frame features the final factory modification comprising a lateral magazine catch and an extended and raised tang complemented by a hammer with its tang slightly rounded in the lower rear corner. The original factory matte blue finish rates better than 99%, with no discernible wear other than a hint of an “idiot scratch” visible only in the right light ahead of the slide stop, and slight finish loss around the magwell and on the magazine. The action operates correctly and exceptionally smoothly in cycling and lockup. All numbers match on the frame, slide, and barrel. The pistol bears 2004 German Ulm nitro proofs date coded AE. The slide is marked by a Jaspo logo in a rectangle; Simpson Ltd importer marks are laser engraved on the butt above the magwell in lieu of the ugly SIGARMS logo missing from the slide. The numbered factory box also contains a correct spare magazine, a factory magazine loader, a factory test target dated 6 December 2004 showing five shots going into a vertical string measuring 44x14mm, a German retailer tag from Eduard Kettner of Cologne, a correct late white cover Swiss Arms factory manual, a 2004 Swiss Arms mini-folder, and an unmarked and unused ERLA Swiss centerfire cleaning kit."

As the title suggests, the rifle is a Saiga Izhmash AK-47. These are a little hard to come by because of the ban; I bought it in 2014 from Classic Firearms. I have put a few hundred rounds through it (not quite 500) and I have never had any feeding issues from any of the magazines or the rifle itself. It eats through any ammo you give it, and it is very accurate. It was my first rifle that I bought and I did my best to take very good care of it (cleaned it after every use). It is very fun to shoot, has virtually no recoil (probably due to the weight), and I made sure to set it up over the years for any type of use from self-defense to hunting. It comes as seen with gun bag, 6 magazines, and about 200 rounds of ammo. Parts list below: - 7.62x39mm caliber- Izhmash manufactured receiver- 16"" Hammer Forged, Chrome-Lined Barrel- Comes with 6-30 round magazines - 1 Tapco, 2 Romanian Steel Surplus, and 3 Russian Steel Surplus- Adjustable Rear Ghost Ring and Front Tritium night sight (I was able to hit 6"" diameter targets at 300 yards using these sights).- Collapsible Tapco T-6 ""BLACK"" stock with sling attachment point. - Stamped steel receiver with black finish.- Tapco trigger (has about a 3 lb pull).- Hogue's rubber Overmolded grip- Chaos Saiga Rifle AK Titan hinged dust cover rail. - Carolina Saiga/VEPR Rifle Tactical Billet Quad-Rail.- Modified muzzle - I removed some of the muzzel cap (the job was clean) and threaded 14x1 LH threads. - Phantom Flash Hider.If you want more detailed pictures I am more than happy to provide them."

Don’t waste anybody’s time trying to argue about it. This beats the $600-$1,000 they’re going for on GunBroker.The reality is NOBODY HAS IT IN STOCK. There’s an 8 week lead time which is only getting longer. Most online shops are saying they are “unsure if they will be restocking.”Sure you can try and buy it and wait, who knows if they’ll get banned before you get it though. That’s why people are getting away with selling these for as much as $1,000, because people are willing to pay the extra amount to get them before they’re banned (they probably will be, sadly). The ONLY “partial” trades I will consider are Geisselle High speed national match and Super Dynamic 3 Gun triggers. Not as fast as the binary but I don’t really care about shooting full auto fast, I’m looking for a little more precision in my trigger.

The rifle comes with a detachable 7 round magazine and is equipped with an extremely precise diopter rear sight that lends itself to a fantastic (and accurate) shooting experience at the range. As it was used for a U.S. training rifle during WWII, the rifle is marked ""U.S. Property"" on both the receiver and the barrel. According to the Certificate of Authenticity (which is obviously included with the rifle) the rifle was purchased from the Civilian Marksmanship Program (fantastic organiztation!) in 2008 and the serial number of the certificate matches that on the rifle (140,000). I will also include the CMP Rifle Safety Manual for good measure. This gun is a pleasure to shoot, look at, and own as a piece of history.
