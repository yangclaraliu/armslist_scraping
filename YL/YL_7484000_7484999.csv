These were produced for a short period of time; however, they were discontinued due to the fact that the grips were so aggressive they wore holes in uniform shirts. Most other people have altered their RTF2 grip ruining the original stippilng. Mine is all original. I would really like to trade into a 1911. I am not wanting to add any cash to this deal, so don't offer a Kimber or a Sig unless you're willing to trade straight across.

Which was ordered by the USMC for their Special Operations units for the fight on the ""Global War on Terror"" in Afghanistan and Iraq. After some service in Afghanistan & Iraq it was deemed that the Cerakote finish used on the pistol was not quite durable enough for the Marines. The original pistols were sent back to the factory in exchange for M45A1 pistols with an improved finish. This was a boon to collectors as Colt was then free to sell these surplus pistols on the commercial market. These original military pistols were ""decommissioned"" by engraving an ""X"" through the USMC marking on the left side of the slide. The availability of these guns represents the first time USGI service pistols have been offered to the public since the DCM ceased handgun sales over 50 years ago. Likely to be the only opportunity to own firearms used in the Global War on Terror, and the what is almost certain to be the last Colt 1911 adopted by the United States Armed Forces. With only 1000 let go on the civilian market makes these extremely scarce and desired by the purest of collectors.It is interesting to note that these are the first new Colt 1911 pistols to be purchased by the United States military since the end of WWII in 1945. Being adopted for the second time, over a century after initial adoption, speaks volumes to the timeless design of the 1911...the greatest battle pistol ever devised. A must-have for the serious 1911 collector.$3600.Email if interested. If you want to text or talk, please email phone number.Cash only, and local face to face transactions only.

802,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7484802,For Sale:  1842 Springfield - 69 Caliber - $530 FREE Shipping,"NE, Portland, Oregon",$ 530,"Listed On: Thursday, November 23, 2017",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"I have three for sale, all smoothbored 69 caliber. All brand-new, and ready to spit lead. Two are Harper’s Ferry Editions (steel barrel bands) and the last is a Palmetto (brass bands as pictured). The 1842 was the final hurrah in America’s love affair with the 69 caliber roundball. As early as 1844, Springfield was discussing the change to .58 caliber, at first for roundball and later for the infamous Minie ball.
 
If you are reenacting, Palmettos are far, far rarer to see in battle than Harper's Ferry.
 
 
275,000 Model 1842 Springfield muskets were produced by the arrival of the 1861 Springfield rifle-musket, and they saw action all over the world. In 1865 Denmark imported thousands of American muskets to halt the Prussian invasion, and many 1842’s wound up fighting off Prussians in northern Europe, as well as being used by Union and Confederates both. Confederate soldiers were especially fond of using “buck and ball” to make their '42s even more deadly; a combination of buckshot and a .65 caliber lead ball, almost guaranteed to land a hit on your target.
 
 
For clarification, MVTCO sells this at the moment for $600, with no free shipping. Prices are very firm, you will not find a cheaper new 1842, period. These are manufactured by Rajasthan Manufacturing, same gentlemen who supply all the shops like Loyalist, Veteran, etc. The only differences between me and them:
 
 
-I don’t stain your stock-I don’t clean the factory grease off-You save $100-200 per gun.
 
 
Bayonets are coming soon but are not available yet for this model. Anyone buying a musket from me has the right to claim a bayonet at-cost when they become available. All bayonet models (with obvious exceptions like the Baker) are $40 and include scabbards."
