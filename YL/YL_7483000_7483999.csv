It comes with five 10-round magazines. It has a regular barrel and a threaded barrel. Caveat emptor -- the pistol is boringly reliable with either barrel and the right ammunition, however I have tried numerous types of ammunition and can not get it to reliably function with a suppressor attached. You may have better luck than I do.
This pistol loves to eat Remington Golden Bullets, CCI Mini-Mags, and Winchester's new M-22 ammunition. The pistol will not eat a single bite of Federal bulk pack ammunition or Winchester Wildcat, as stated in the manufacturer's instructions.
I have included a wrench for removing the ""step-up"" from the barrel's threads to the 1/2x28 threads required for suppressor use. No wrench is necessary for the non-threaded barrel.
My Investment:The Glock lower was $140 + shipping & FFL transfer.The conversion kit was $275 each + shipping.The threaded barrel was $130.The 3 extra magazines with each kit were $25 each ($75).Total investment:  $620 + plus shipping and FFL transfer.
I am selling the complete G26/27 package for $ 500 firm.I prefer to sell the complete kit + lower. I don't wish to separate the Glock frame from the conversion kit. Willing to trade either pistol for a Gen 2.5 or Gen3 Glock 19 or 26 (original parts and condition).I can ship to your FFL at your expense.Person to person sale in Georgia requires Georgia driver's license.  Ga CCL preferred."

In Excellent condition; only 150 rounds through it. Comes with case, 2 magazines, 3 backstraps & assorted height front sights. This is the AS model, or ""Anti-Stress"" trigger designation, referring to the first trigger pull being Double Action at a long 9.5# pull, and all succeeding trigger pulls being a short, Very Crisp 4.5# pull, followed by a short, very tactile reset. There is a de-cocker on top of the slide to safely drop the trigger from Single Action, back to the Longer, safer Double Action. 4"" barrel with polished feed ramp, and the Lever-style magazine release on either side of the trigger guard, which are actually easier to use than a standard magazine release button. This gun is VERY accurate in Single Action mode, and is a favorite of many military and police units around the world.       As such, the 9mm model is made primarily for those units, and are RARELY found in the U.S., unlike the .40 caliber models which are common here in the States.  This is the rare and very sought-after 9mm model, and is an excellent Example of Walther engineering. It is also the primary design that spawned the current PPQ model from Walther, that is getting rave reviews, but while the PPQ has a very light trigger & NO safety, the P99AS with DA/SA & decocker, and is very safe to carry loaded.      I'm an empty-nester now, and need to thin out the gun cabinet.    Bluebook on this 2-year old model is $485.00. But life has been good to me, and I just need to find it a good home, so I'll let it go for $400.00 + $30.00 shipping/handling from my FFL to your FFL.    That's a very good deal for this rare 9mm model with hardly any miles on it. Take me up on it!    Thanks,   TimMSR: $629.00            98% excellent condition Bluebook value= $485.00           Sale Price= $400.00, to a good home......Listed locally & on several sites; don't wait too long...."

Last Christmas my wife and I bought one for each of us! We were looking at another brand small frame, but I wanted her to shoot one first. So, we went to a retailer in Greenville that has an indoor range. We planned to rent one of the other brand's and shoot it. Unfortunately, they did not have one in stock. So, we decided to rent one of these and we were both AMAZED by how this thing shoots! There is almost no recoil! My wife selected the black one and I went with the flat dark earth color. Flat dark earth is very difficult to find and is pricier than the normal black weapon! So, get it while you can! It's perfect for pocket carry or concealment in tighter clothing..3806+1 RoundsDoes not come with any bullets / concealed carry accessories (as we still have another bodyguard)."
