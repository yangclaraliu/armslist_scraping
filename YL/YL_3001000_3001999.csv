This gun is built like a tank! $650 O.B.O.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

Gun comes with box, papers, cleaning rod, etc, 2 original CZ 18 rds. magz and 2 aftermarket 19 rds magazines, as well.

 This listing is for one pistol; FFLs, Law Enforcement, and collectors, however, may take any number of extras, subject to our stock on hand, at the same per-pistol price and with no additional shipping charges. The PT-911 shows Taurus innovation and German influence at the same time. Taurus took its Beretta Compact type frame and installed a shorter, sturdier slide with looks akin to the German Sig Pistols. Here is Taurus’s PT-911 in blue steel and black anodized finish, with a straighter, thinner grip frame on the order of Beretta’s Vertec frames for shooters more comfortable with a pared-down grip frame compared to the relatively fat feeling 92 variants. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Type is compact traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a matte finished alloy frame; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft. Height is 4 15/16 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate; and 6 15/16 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut. Minimum frame thickness is .740, with a maximum slide thickness of 1.07 inches. Frame is equipped with an integral Picatinny or Weaver type rail for optical, laser and light accessories. Magazine capacity is 15 rounds, 15+1 total capacity. Barrel length is 4 inches according to the box label, but 3 3/4 inches by our own measurement. This pistol comes furnished with two blue steel finger rest floorplate Taurus factory magazines; and any Taurus 92/99 magazine will fit into this pistol with some protrusion. Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry. Current replacement pricing on the PT 911 is upwards of $500 per unit in our area, if a person can even find one. We’re offering the PT-911 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 369.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement, we will sub One Factory Taurus PT-911 Ten Rounder for the two 15s, or $25 off with no magazines, buyer’s call. Affected jurisdictions include Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, and New York.

Here is the pistol that began the revolution in semi-auto handguns 25 years ago. There were reasons for that, and the reasons are evident on close inspection of this specimen of the 92FS Pistol. Until 1985 or so, Colt and Browning 9mms would not handle hollowpoints. Smith & Wesson 39 and 59 series pistols would, but the Smiths did not capture the market's imagination, perhaps due to the boxy feel of the 59. The Beretta 92 was a pistol that looked good, felt good, and would handle sharp-nosed Federal and Smith & Wesson Hollowpoint ammo. It was, and is, extremely simply made, very easy to field strip and clean. Photo specimen is the Commercial variant of the Military M9. It comes with two factory 15 shot magazines. Barrel is 5 inch Government size, and sights are conventional three dot. Specs on the 92FS / M9 are traditional double-and-single action semi-auto pistol; semi-gloss anodized lightweight alloy frame; semi-gloss steel slide and black matte barrel and steel parts; extreme overall length 8 5/8 inches from the muzzle to the back of the grip frame strut; weight empty 33.8 ounces; ambidextrous safety levers that also serve as decockers; ambidextrous reversible magazine release; Beretta logo black checkered high impact polymer grip panels secured by Allen screws; 5 1/4 inch height from the magazine base plate to the top of the rear sight; slide thickness 1.15 inch; grip frame thickness 1.03 inch with taper to 0.73 at the frame front; type two serrated face trigger guard. Photo specimen and any of its identical mates we offer under Beretta sku number J92M9AOM will be brand new in their boxes, with all their papers and a California Compliant cable lock. Initial contract price on the M9s to the Reagan Administration was $179 per, we are told. Resupply pricing is still under $300.00. We just can’t match those FET Exempt prices, though. We’re offering the M9 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for $ 539.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Massachusetts. For any civilian buyers in California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Chicago Cook County IL, Hawaii, Maryland, or New York, we will be glad to sub one new unissued factory or Mec-Gar Beretta 10 shot 92 magazine for the two 15 rounders.

**REDUCED PRICE**  $325 need to sell by this weekend. A steal at this price.

Own a piece of history! Same size frame and almost the exact inner workings as the coveted Colt Python. For a 78 year old revolver, it is in pretty damn good shape. It has some cosmetic pit marks, bluing loss along the barrel and normal wear but functions fantastically. Bore is perfect. Locks up real good and the cylinder gap is very tight. Incredibly light single action trigger pull. Asking $400 with box and extra hogue grips, or $450 w/ all of the above & a very nice vintage leather Bucheimer holster. Not interested in trades. Located in Burlington VT. Thanks!"

I have at LEAST $750 Into this gun overall! And about 800rds through it total. (400rds through the sporter barrel, and 400rds through the Bull barrel) 
I've owned this firearm for less then 2 months... Its in great shape and I haven't had one issue what so ever!

This Gun is Bad A$$! 
Asking $630 OR BEST OFFER. 
***NO LOW BALLERS***
Cash is King! I may entertain trades that are in my favor.

The scope power is adjustable from 3.5-10X and the objective diameter is 50mm. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. The optics are beautiful and crisp. The condition of the rifle is mint. No scratches that I can find on the laminate wood stock either. The laminate wood stock has nice checkering on the grip and forearm, a rubber butt pad, and a raised cheekrest. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. This rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

I will sell the rifle seperate from the scope, mount, caps, and rings for $650.00. For the Leupold scope, rings, caps, and mount, I am asking $425.00. For the whole package, I am asking $1000.00. You can keep the sales tax! Shipping is available for a marginal amount. Face to face transaction is possible.

This rifle is for sale in Rockfield, located in Carroll County."

XTP pistol bullets continue to set the standard as the bullet of choice for hunters and law enforcement officers who understand the value of a pistol bullet which will perform over a wide range of handgun velocities. Most pistol bullets are designed to work only at a factory specified velocity and a specific range. At these predetermined specifications, the bullets work just fine. But when bullet velocity begins to change, surprises can happen. Many factors cause velocities to change-gun type, barrel length, distance to target, barriers and more. That's why you need a bullet that you can depend on to perform over a wide range of velocities. You need the XTP."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

    Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single CR123 battery.  With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or Night Vision mount.   Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.
    Features:
        Single transverse CR123 battery to reduce sight length
        Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space
        Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
        Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours

I have fired about 200 rounds through her for testing and to do my research and review of this gun for my ICRT group.

These have not been used at all... The gun comes with everything in the box which included 3 mags. So you will be receiving 8 mags :) The biggest issue one faces is finding a store with these in since they seem to be hard to come by but, well worth the wait I suppose :) I am asking $1400 that is 1250.00 for the gun and 150.00 for the mags and no, I will not sell the gun without the mags so don't ask :) It is a package deal for the right person. Preferable a sell only deal but would consider a Sig 229 with threaded barrel... in desert or black...thanks! Location: Hot Springs, AR.
