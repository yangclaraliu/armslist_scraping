Let's play ""Who is the moron"".  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons).With both a .22lr and .22 magnum cylinder, its like having two guns in one.  Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. The Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic laminated grips, or white grips,  makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot.   It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot. What are you waiting for.....   Free layaway option available. Here is a short video I put together on this revolver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjuGXzchMx4"

My wife was fantastic in being a grouse.
“There will not be a Sig MPX for you!”
“Until you liquidate a pistol or two.”
So I went to the garage in quite a clatter,
to see which sidearms that didn’t matter.
and what to my wondering eyes should find,
But a S&W core, chambered in nine.
The Apex competition trigger called to me,
and the Trijicon RM08 I could see.
and KKM threaded barrel said to keep it,
But with all of my guns I just could not see it.
So I am willing to bode “Hey sexy, see you later.”
“With your factory barrel, 4 mags, and compensator.”
So here, for your review, I present my firearm,
for a very fair price, it could be your new sidearm.
Just shoot me and email, or send me a text,
the owner of this firearm, could you be the next.I will knock of 300 if you don't want the Trijicon.Text REDACTED. Las Vegas resident, I just kept my Oregon number. Must be over 21 years of age and present valid state or federal ID to purchase. Will not ship."

New these pistols sell for $699 and this one is almost as good as new.  There are a few very minor wear spots, but other than that it is like new.  I paid $475 for this one.  The problem is, I was excited to be able to buy one this nice, and got caught up in the moment.  However, I sold my last .380 two years ago because I was simplifying my collection, and now I have this.  I shot it 50 times, cleaned and lubed it, and now I am selling it at a great price.  This really is the finest .380 out there.  It can be yours for only $399.  Text me at 717-eight eight 9- six 674.If it is still listed it is available."

I set it up to be a hunting MSR type rifle, for coyotes and I thought I’d try some of our smaller whitetail with it. After taking it to the first range trip I quickly found out that 16” is my favorite barrel length. It’s not overly heavy, but the extra length is noticeable and for me a 16” is where I need to be. I’ve already built the replacement rifle for this one, so it’s time to offer it up for sale or trade. On to the details of this one...it’s an Anderson lower with a PSA lower parts kit in it. Magpul MOE+ black rubber grip and a Magpul BAD lever installed. The upper is a keyhole forged flattop upper, the barrel is a PSA CHF (cold hammer forged) 20” government profile that is 1:7” twist and chambered in 5.56. It’s pretty well known that FN makes the CHF barrels for PSA, so this is a reputable barel. Low profile gas block and of course rifle length gas system, with a StrikeIndustries J-comp morning muzzlebreak on the end. Upper is all held together by a 15” keymod freefloat handguard. On top of it is a Nikon Buckmasters 4-12x40mm scope with BDC reticle and it sits in a Burris PEPR one piece mount. I will include one 30rd magazine with it. I can offer this a few different ways. If you are interested in it as it sits described above and in the pics, I’m asking $750 for it. Without the scope and PEPR, I’d take $550 for it."
