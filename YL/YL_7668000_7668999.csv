After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US army demanded more 1903 rifles than the companies could produce, which led to the birth of the 03a3, a 1903 rifle made with stamped parts and a fixed weaver sight-base with improved battle sight, rather than the milled parts of a typical 03. The move by remington allowed for some 707,000+ of these rifles to be produced. Of those 707,000+ rifles, many were hand picked for their accuracy to be turned into the 1903a4 sniping rifle.This 1903a3 is in near-pristine condition. I do suspect the previous owner had ambitions to convert this into it's sniping counterpart, the 1903a4, as the standard and less-accurate two-groove barrel has been improved with a replacement four-groove barrel, and the front sight hood has been removed. This rifle does not show any signs of wear and tear, rust or pitting what-so-ever, and it is highly likely that it never actually saw combat, but remained unissued and sitting in a military stockpile until it was finally released to it's previous owner. There is a very minor surface rust imperfection on the rear-most sling hoop. The type 13 stock, which was seldom seen on war-time production 1903a3's, has the proper cartouches to prove it's originality: the circled ""P"" (proof) stamp on the pistol grip, the assembly markings in front of the trigger guard, and the Ordnance Wheel stamp in front of the boxed ""FJA"" (Lt. Col. Frank J. Atwood's inspection stamp--Remington only). This stock type was most common on rifles that were to be converted to 1903a4's but never finished.Overall, this is a great addition to any collection. It resembles a time of turmoil, when America was forced into a world war for the second time and had to scramble to arm its freshly-drafted young men. Unissued guns like these will command a premium in the future, so make your investment now and enjoy owning this sliver of American history.

Three-texture handle ensures a solid, comfortable hold
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
The most recent evolution in the XD lineup, Springfield Armory's Mod.2 Handguns are even more compact, concealable and easy to grip. The slimmed-down construction and three-zone textured handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish over the tough steel barrel and slide. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. Fiber-optic front sight and low-profile rear combat sight. Includes one stainless steel flush-fitting and one full-size XD Gear® Mag X-Tension magazine."

The metal shows some wear, although the bluing is largely intact - it has a lot of character. If the gun has been reblued, I would not be surprised, but the safety retains the plum blue (the other small parts do not). I was the first owner after importation, so any refinishing would have happened while the gun was still in service. The bore is bright and shiny, and the trigger is really smooth. Out of all the Makarovs I've owned, this one feels like it's the best made. Includes original red bakelite grips.Interesting note: The importer (PW Arms) imported the handgun through Bulgaria, so the slide was etched by the importer ""Arsenal Bulgaria,"" even though the frame has the Russian (Izhevsk) ""split triangle in a circle"" arsenal mark, not the Bulgarian ""circle 10"" arsenal mark.No trades.

Since then I've only ran about 1000 rounds through it, leaving it in fairly pristine condition. What makes this AK special is the upgraded furniture ($150), the flash hider/comp ($30), the bolt carrier polishing, and the matte black duracoat that I added to the gun. While most AK's have that rugged black/iron colored coating, this AK has a beautiful matte black coating on it.  While this is indeed a WASR-10, if you want to make it look half this good you're going to need to spend quite a bit more than this for the furniture upgrade alone. The AK comes with two 30-round P-Mags and a Steel Korean mag that I duracoated the same color as the gun. The combination looks great.  (Here is a link to a few more pictures of it: imgur.com/a/Og3j6)If you're interested in taking a look, shoot me a text at REDACTED."

Correct, this is the CZ Scorpion, but in a carbine format with a built-in faux supressor (flash can). I bought it about three months ago and since then I have put about 300 rounds through it. It shoots flawlessly, it's a CZ, what can I expect. I have taken great care of the rifle after ever time I've shot it, I've properly cleaned and lubed it. The rifle comes with TWO 30-round CZ mags as well as TWO 10-round mags. I've also installed a safety delete which, in my opinion, is an essential upgrade if you are a right-handed shooter. It's not super easy to find these online, and when you do, they're pretty expensive. I'm selling one that is in GREAT condition for a great price.

It also has a fully adjustable rear site that I do have the original hex for (it's a VERY small size).Comes with the original case and 12-round magazine. Like ALL .22lr pistols that have full slides the gun will occasionally fail to eject when you run standard velocity ammo because it doesn't have the force to fully cycle; though I used the federal bulk box with very minimal issues. CCI is by far the best ammo to use for .22lr handguns so I'll throw in a 100 round box of CCI so you can try them out."
