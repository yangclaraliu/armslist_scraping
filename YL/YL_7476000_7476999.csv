Overall a nice collector piece from 1968-1969. The history of the Daisy is as follows: In 1961 Case Hough, the president of Daisy Heddon division of Victor Comptometer, purchased the design of a new firearm system. The new system was developed by a Belgian Chemist named Jules Van Langenhover. The new gun would be known as the Daisy V/L rifle.[1] The V/L ammunition consisted of a .22 caliber bullet with a small cylinder of propellant on the back, and no primer.[2] The rifle resembled a typical spring-air rifle, but the 2000° hot, high pressure air served not only to propel the projectile but also to ignite the propellant on the back of the V/L cartridge. The rifle uses a small, unique and well designed part called an Obturator (obturator/ignitor) to compress the air as it is pushed through a tiny hole. This air is heated as it is pushed through the small hole enough to ignite the powder of the caseless round.[3] The V/L guns and ammunition were discontinued in 1969 after the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled that they constituted a firearm, and Daisy, which was not licensed to manufacture firearms, decided to discontinue manufacture rather than become a firearms manufacturer. About 23,000 of the rifles were made before production ceased. FTF in Graham NC 325.00 or buyer pays shipping."

This 25 year old revolver is from the days when Smith and Wesson made handcrafted firearms, before the use of MIM parts, and long before the days of the ridiculous internal safety lock of current models.This excellent revolver belongs to my best friend who has owned it since he bought it new in 1992. He doesn't really want to part with it, but some vehicle repair expenses make it necessary. The revolver comes with Hogue rubber grips, a pair of custom wood grips, and a nice leather belt holster. This model in this barrel length is very hard to find these days, and would be equally at home on the firing range or as part of a collection. I owned this revolver briefly in 2014, and sent it back to the factory for a thorough cleaning and adjustment, so it is in excellent condition. I'm handling the sale for my friend because his work schedule makes it difficult for him to show the pistol.The revolver can be seen by appointment only at my office just outside of Homestead. Please be aware that since I am listing this for my friend and do not own it, I have limited flexibility on price, and am unable to consider any trades on this firearm. Sorry about that. Face to face transactions only, no shipping. All laws complied with in this sale. Thank you for looking at this listing."

It is the Speed-Six model .357 Magnum with round butt grip frame and a 2.75 inch barrel. This is a blue finish revolver with a very smooth action, and is quite accurate. Ruger discontinued this model in 1988 shortly after the GP-100 revolver was introduced. It provided serious competition to the Smith and Wesson revolvers of the day, and fits in most holsters made for Smith and Wesson K-frame revolvers. This model was issued to U.S. Customs Agents as well as the Postal Inspectors back in the day, as well as to agents of the Naval Investigative Service, which later became N.C.I.S.
The gun wears a pair of Herrett's wood grips, but also comes with three other sets of rubber grips of different styles, so I'm sure you can find something you like. It also comes with two new Safariland speed loaders as well.This revolver may be seen by appointment only at my office just outside of Homestead. I will listen to best offers and suggestions for trades, but please keep it reasonable. Cash always speaks loudest. All laws complied with in this sale. Thanks for looking at my listing."

This lead is what I was using to cast bullets, and it runs a consistent 12.5 hardness by the Lee hardness tester listed above. 12.5 is the hardness Elmer Keith used to make his reputation over 5 decades of shooting. It runs just fine with that lube and any fouling comes right out of the barrel with just a few brush strokes and a good bore jag, unlike so-called ""hardcast"" which can take severe measures to get out. This lead has been smelted down into biscuits (cupcake size), that run 2 pounds or a little more each. Photo is the one with six buckets.196.5 pounds pure lead. This is lead I got from job sites that came in sheets. We were putting up lead backed drywall for x-ray rooms. Would be great for muzzleloaders or cap and ball pistols. It's also in biscuits. Photo is the one with two buckets.27.5 pounds pure Linotype. I got this in a big bar like they used in newspaper printing years ago. I broke up the bar and poured it into biscuits running about 1 pound each. Photo is the one with the single white bucket.Total amount of lead 824 pounds. That's 5,768,000 grains of lead, or enough to cast 46,516 (124 grain) 9mm bullets, 32,044 (180 grain) 40 S&W bullets, or 23,072 (250 grain) 44 magnum Keith bullets. Just to give you an idea.....Lead runs $2 a pound. $1648.00 value. Total for all this at any store that had it all would be $3,359.00 and that's BEFORE tax. I'll let it all go for $2,400.00. That's a $950 dollar discount, even before they tax the piss out of you and slap on the extra $350 bucks in this commie state. I would consider selling all the lead in one shot for $1250.00, or all the gear for $1300.00. I might do a partial deal on lead or gear, I just don't want to be selling 10 pound here and thirty pounds there. I'm getting rid of this stuff because I flat don't have time for it, so I don't have time to be trucking small batches of stuff all over bejesus either, you guys understand I'm sure. Also have a bunch of cast bullets (from these molds) in 9mm, 38/357, 44, and 45-70 and a bunch of casting safety gear (gloves, face shield, leather apron, arm sleeves) that I'll throw in for free, along with a Lyman Cast Bullet Handbook (4th edition), and a copy of ""From Ingot to Target"" by Glen Fryxell (best casting manual there is)."

I have two excellent quality handguns on offer for sale or trade, individually or two-for-one.First is a Sphinx SDP Alpha Compact in 9mm, made in Switzerland and imported by Kriss USA. If you know Swiss firearms like the Schmidt-Rubin K31, you know the Swiss reputation for craftsmanship doesn't stop with their watches.  The gun resembles a CZ P-07 with the internals of a CZ-75B, but most of the receiver is of alloy construction. I purchased this new back in the summer. I am very impressed with the workmanship and the function of the gun, but the sights are just a little too ""European"" for me. I like a six-o'clock hold, and I'm not willing to carve up an expensive gun like this just to change the point of aim.  It is, without question, the softest-shooting 9mm I've ever handled. Sphinx is known for high-end competition pistols costing several thousand dollars, so the soft recoil, negligible muzzle rise, and clean-breaking trigger in this production model are undoubtedly owed to the company's competition heritage.  Included with the gun are two 15-round magazines, a full cleaning kit, magazine loader, and three interchangeable backstraps. I'm offering the Sphinx alone for $700.Second is a Sig Sauer P239 SAS Gen 2.  The SAS designation stands for ""Sig Anti-Snag"", which simply means that some of the harder angles were rounded off at the Sig custom shop to prevent the gun from catching on clothing when carrying concealed. This model includes the short-reset trigger (SRT) and Siglites factory night sights.  This has been my carry gun for a couple of years now, and it's the 2nd one I've owned. I was initially drawn to the P239 for its size, all-metal composition, and the elongated trigger guard which is more accommodating to larger hands or gloves. This gun also comes with two 8-round magazines, the factory case, and a cheap rubber Hogue finger groove grip. I have an Alien Gear IWB holster for it if you'd like, all for $600 out the door. I have additional factory 10-round magazines available for $30 each. I'm cool with trades, as I have listed below. I'm getting a little too heavy on handguns, and there isn't a whole lot that I haven't owned at some point or another. I'm not looking for non-firearm items, and I'm not looking to give these guns away. Bud's sells these two for $1,848 together, so here's a chance to get a couple of reputable guns for reasonable prices.  I've been working a lot lately, but I usually have one day off per week. I'll do my best to work with my buyers' schedules. I travel to the Shelby/Mansfield/Ashland area occasionally on weekends off to visit family; I'd be happy to bring them along if you live between there and Columbus, but time doesn't often permit me to travel too far out of town otherwise. Buyers must be over the age of 21 and show a valid Ohio ID.  Thanks for looking!"

This particular example is the double stack .45acp nicknamed the ""Hebrew Hammer."" It is the two tone stainless model which was the top of the line model. It has a 10 +1 capacity in a compact frame. I got this pistol in a trade and the cash is more important to me right now I'm not sure if it's history but it looks like it's in mint condition. If it has been fired it was very minimal. There are absolutely no wear marks on the slide or frame. I have one mag and no box. I have seen this model sell for 550+ on internet auctions. And they were in worse condition. I am asking 350 obo. I will also add a box of Winchester Ranger T-series self defense ammo(50 rounds) if the price is right. I will only consider face to face transactions in the Dublin/Worthington area. And I will only accept cash offers. NO TRADES OF ANY KIND WILL BE CONSIDERED. Buyer must have a valid Ohio identification.

This was one of his favorites because of its accuracy and the trigger is like no other trigger I have ever felt. Almost  creep at all and what he always called a “hair trigger”.Gun is older and somewhat rare. I am not desperate to sell at all.Price is $650 for the Supermatic Trophy with 2 grips & 3 magazines.Look at the prices for this model on gunbroker.comI am also selling a Ruger 44 magnum Carbine rifle. These are highly desirable hunting rifles because of there shorter length good for hunting deer here in Michigan. I have killed over 10 deer with one of these. Wood is in very good condition with only 1 small chip of wood on top behind the breech. The rifle overall looks great! The bluing is in excellent condition. Comes with a 3x9x40 Tasco scope mounted in Weaver mounts.  If your not familiar with these rifles the mounts are 2 different sizes, so you cant just use any mounts.  Price is $750. Serial # 102-63653I also selling a Ruger New Model Blackhawk 45 Long Colt with a super high gloss finish like I have never seen but it is much more impressive in person, these pics do it no justice. I actually bought this from my mom when he passed away. It has a jeweled hammer. I don’t think this gun has been fired much if at all. It has a slight turn line and ivory grips. When my step father was alive and had his collection of guns this one always stuck out as the nicest looking one of them all. I have never shot it. I have 111 rounds of new ammo that I will include. These are expensive rounds so there is some value there. I’m having a hard time coming up with a price for this one because I can’t find any other New Model Blackhawk that looks like this one or has the beautiful finish like this one. A gun dealer said the finish is called a super high polished finish and was probably done by a gunsmith. Either that or this is such a rare gun that I can’t find any with the satin extractor finish. Also included is 112 rounds of 45 Long Colt ammo.  Price is $550Since I can only put 3 pics, text me for more pictures and specify which gun your talking about.Call Dan 734threezeronine-nine2fourtwoI am downriver in Allen Park and always Home.Please don’t bother me thinking I am desperate with ridiculous offers.  I don't need your cash!  If you are looking for something I have I will gladly sell it to you. Not selling because I need money.Handguns require a purchase permit or CPL. Rifle a signed receipt with copy of your DL for my protection."
