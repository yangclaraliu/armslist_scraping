Gun is in good shape, some minor wear on the edges of the muzzle end. The Jericho is the full size steel frame version, about a year old.  Only seen maybe 200 rounds.  Has rubber hogue wraparound grips which feel awesome on this gun.  Can come with a owb belt mount orpaz thumb release polymer holster and dual mag carrier and black owb leather belt holster.  Gun is in great shape except for where one of the holster wore a little along the slide on both sides, nothing horrible but noticeable in the right light.  It'll only let me post one pic so I can get you more pictures of either gun if you want.  Email or text me at REDACTED.  I'm in maqouketa iowa.  Would also consider trading both for a cz shadow 2 but I don't see anyone giving up one of them."

Its super lightweight, small, and easily carried, which is why its great to carry not great to shoot, its FAR MORE PLEASANT than 357 J-Frame though. The Trigger is a long double action which is good for avoiding unitended discharge for those with poor trigger discipline, but may be off putting for the guys that have Custom 1911's. That's pretty much it I suppose if you have questions please feel free to email.Transaction will occur at Eagle Armory in O'fallon MO, I will cover the $15 FFL Fee."

This is the Skeet Model 12 gauge. (the more desirable and harder to find model) with the 26 inch vented rib barrel. The 28 inch barrel, Model Trap is selling for $750-900 on GunBroker in good-excellent conditon. Let me first start by saying this piece is in EXCELLENT condtion. All original parts, wood, barrel, etc. Wood is beautiful and still holds it's shine as it did from the factory back in 1974. The receiver and it's engravings are in EXCELLENT shape as well. The barrel has no pitting or rust! This also takes Colonial chokes. CAN SEND DETAILED PICS IF INTERESTED.-----I will also include an original Garcia Magainze AD from back in the early 1970's advertising the line of Bertta AL-2's. Still sealed in packaging. If you are looking for an amazing Collectors Semi-Auto Shotgun that will only go up in value, then this is it.  I am asking a safe $800 on this shotgun. I know the market is down so the price is OBO. But I feel that is a fair price considering what others are selling for and this is even harder to find. Please do your research before messaging me if needed.
$800 OBO. Cash only. NO SHIPPING. Local only. FTF only. Any ""still available"" or ""what's the lowest you'll take"" will be ignored. Thanks."

By far the most concealable and comfortable handgun to carry that I have owned, the only reason I’m posting it is that it’s too small for my larger-than-average hands. It performs like a Glock should and has had less than 500 rounds through it, I have kept it well-maintained since purchasing it. If you have smaller hands than I do or are looking for a carry pistol for your lady, this would be an excellent choice.Onto the upgrades, I have installed a ZEV fulcrum trigger assembly, Ghost connector, Strike Industries +2 EMP, and a green Crimson Trace Laserguard Pro which has four settings and a great adjustable sighting system. Truly a formidable weapon for this small of a package, it comes with the Bladetech IWB holster compatible with the light/laser and the Black Raven Morrigan IWB should you decide to carry it without the Crimson Trace unit. Altogether I have put  well over $1,000 on this setup, as everything is in excellent condition and I don’t need the money for financial reasons, the price is firm. Not looking for trades unless you have an Urban Grey CZ P75 SP-01 Tactical in at least as good of condition, can’t seem to find one in stock anywhere right now. Message me with a good phone number to reach you at if you are interested, transfer will be conducted at Bend FFL if your choice and we will split the fees. Thanks for looking!"

Full disclosure, this mag has issues feeding 124gr gold dots when filled to 10 rds. 9 rds and it's fine however.Original case, and everything that came from the factory (as far as I know, it's been 6 years, so I maybe have misplaced something and not realized it).The pistol shoots very well. I am not the greatest 25 yd shooter, but standing unsupported with Federal Lawman 124 gr FMJ it will do under 4 inches. The internal extractor is probably due to be re-tensioned or replaced. The only complaint I've ever had with this pistol is that the extractor seems to loose tension faster then other 1911 I've owned. There is minor holster wear on the pistol, as I didn't carry it much. The slide near the muzzle has to streaks where it contacted the inside of the Hillsman holster. I can try and get better pictures if you're concerned and want to see them. I am the original owner of the pistol, and I'd estimate it has approximately 5,000 rounds or so through it.  Feel free to get in touch if you'd like more pictures or details about anything.I'm asking $650 for everything, and buyers pay actual shipping from my FFL. If you are in the the Central Texas region (call it SA to Temple, Johnson City to College station) I'll do a face to face, if you're real close (or will drive to me, I'll take some off the top since I'm not spending a bunch on gas).

It comes ready for trouble with a new lightweight polymer body frame. clockwise cylinder rotation for fast loading, fiber optic front sight and a generous profile hammer. Truly, the new DT is the best revolver in its class.Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."
