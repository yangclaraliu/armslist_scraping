It has aftermarket grips and is a solid shooter- basically zero wear in the barrel etc. It has sat for a while and if you look for it you can find some very minor cosmetic rust... VERY MINOR.  There is also wear around the grips- I'm sure from being carried in a holster. This is shown in the pics. What you see is what you get- no box etc.If you want a basic gun to go make holes in things this will do it.Willing to consider reasonable offers...Thanks!

During filming, the Seattle Police Department officer assigned to the Department's Industrial Relations Division responsible for coordination between the Department and Batjac Productions became acquainted with the Duke. They met socially on several occasions and had many interactions during the shoot. At the end of the shoot, the Duke presented this gun to that police officer, Vince. It was eventually handed down to another family member who is the owner of this consignment. Shown in the photo is the Duke with members of the Seattle PD used as extras in the movie and Officer Vince (in civilian clothes). The photo is also stamped on the back by the official photographer. Also included is the Colt factory letter showing the gun shipped to the Salton Sea Armament Company in 1968. The Salton Sea Armament Company is the Dealer that provided real firearm props to the production company. Included in the photos of this item is a screen shot of John Wayne retrieving the Colt from his trunk, the Colt is seen a few other times as well in the movie ""McQ.""  As far as the firearm goes, it is in excellent shape with only a few very minor marks from handling. The photos show a good depiction of overall condition and only a very small mark is seen on the cylinder. It can be fired and is about 99%.

I put less than 50 rounds through this gun, cleaned it, and never carried it. It’s been a safe queen. It’s a great gun, but I just don’t use the .45 round enough to carry it. It needs to go to someone who prefers .45ACP. No thumb saftey on mine. Also comes with the factory 6 round and 7 round mags. Asking $900 obo. Email me if interested. Might be open to trades depending on what you have, but cash would sell faster."
