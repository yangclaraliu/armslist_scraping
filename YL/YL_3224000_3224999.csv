First is a B-Square scope mount.

This mount was included in a box of gun stuff I ""inherited"", so I have never seen it mounted.

Next is a side mount style mount. Came with my new Saiga.  I do not know what other side mounts it will fit. This one sits pretty high on the receiver, so you can disassemble with it mounted.

Might consider trading it for a handgun (9mm, 40mm, 45mm) but I don't have my permit so I honestly wouldn't know how to go about that, but maybe you do!

Offered for your consideration is one (1) French Fusil MAS Mle 1936 chambered in the French 7.5X54m/m caliber. Prior to the adoption of the Fusil MAS Mle 1936 the primary French battle rifles were the Berthier and the problematic, and expensive, Mle 1886. Both of these rifles were chambered for the 8X50m/m Lebel cartridge. 
After the Great War, (World War I), the French sought to develop a new, and more powerful, cartridge and newer weapons to fire them. As a result, the Fusil MAS Mle 1936 became the standard battle rifle in 1936 and continued this role until 1956 when it was withdrawn from service, except for those designed for sniping. It was arguably the easiest to maintain weapon of its type. Like the British Enfield, it was a good enough design to survive into the beginning of the automatic rifle era and was popular with its users both as a rifle, and as a platform for launching grenades.
The script “L” prefix to the serial number indicates that this rifle was manufactured between 1945 and 1946. All serial numbers, with the exception of the bayonet, are matching. The bore is bright & shiny with strong lands & grooves and shows no signs of excessive wear or corrosion. It comes with the standard 13 inch spike bayonet which is stored in a tube under the barrel when not in use. There is a very tiny importer mark on the bottom of the barrel, near the muzzle. One has to look hard to see it. This Fusil MAS Mle 1936 is in great overall condition and would make an excellent addition to a collection of military small arms, and a fun rifle to shoot. Ammunition is available on the surplus market and from a few ammunition manufacturers. Additional Pictures upon request.

These are brand new in the box, made a stupid mistake and bought the wrong ammo and Cabelas won't take it back.

Offered for your consideration is one (1) New Haven 250C semi-automatic .22 caliber rifle. The New Haven brand was manufactured by O.F. Mossberg & Sons as their economy line of rifles and is the same basic rifle as the Mossberg 350KA. 
The New Haven brand of rifles mainly differed from the Mossberg branded rifles due to the lack of some embellishments such as having plain walnut stained hardwood stocks rather than the high grade checkered Monte Carlo stocks. There were also other cost saving options used such as sights which were not quite a costly to produce as the ones used on the Mossberg branded rifles. However, the main components, such as the barrels, firing group, etc. were the same quality as the ones used in the main line of the Mossberg branded rifles.
This New Haven Mossberg is complete and feeds, fires, and ejects properly. It will make an excellent choice for a beginning shooter, as well as an excellent utility rifle. Additional pictures upon request.

I am dowtown Orlando during days and Oviedo, nights and eves.
I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

 DESCRIPTION
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I am Selling my Sig Sauer P224 SAS 40S&W. This is an ideal concealed carry weapon. Essentially, the P224 was designed as a scaled down version of the full size Sig P229, one of Sig's most popular guns. 

This version of the P224 is the SAS Edition, which stands for ""Sig Anti Snag"" meaning that the edges are all slightly rounded off, reducing the incidence of snagging when upholstering your Pistol in a hurry. An added benefit of this is it looks AWESOME. I’ve fired it about 200 rounds, 100% reliable EDC.

WHAT’S INCLUDED IN THE SALE:  Sig P224 Pistol, (3) 10 Round Magazines (1) 12 Round Extended Magazine, Mil-Comm TW25B® Lubricant, Cable Lock, Owner’s Manual and Sig Sauer E2 Grip Tool. *Test Fire Date 13 Feb 2013

The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. You will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.

If you don't know what this product is, you need to Google or YouTube it - just look up ""Slidefire AK Video"".  This product allows true select fire of the rifle using the same principle as bump firing, allowing a rate of fire to nearly match a fully automatic AK, while allowing accurate, controlled fire from the shoulder.  If you want to make 20-75 rounds of 7.62 ammo disappear very quickly, this is what you have been looking for!! Totally legal, comes with a letter from the BATF stating as such, but it may as well be an automatic for rate of fire and accuracy... quite a product!!

This new in the box FN15 is ready for any task. It has a new TRIJICON TRI POWER sitting on top of a new LARUE Tactical LT150 QR mount. The weapon light is a new Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens light. This is the brighteset weapon light you have ever seen Elzetta calls it the scorcher! Its sitting in a new Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. The laser is a Aimshot LS8300. These are only sold to SOCOM and other elite SOF on military POs only no longer sold to LEAs. You can verify this with Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta. This is one baddass little laser you can follow the beam even before dark and after dark the beam and dot look like something out of STAR WARS. This one was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO serving in Afghanistan. Yes it will definitely get you in trouble!! Comes with zero tool and two tail caps one pressure and one click. This gun is all new never fired with all boxes and manuals. Thanks so much for looking and have a great weekend.

Wrapped in a smaller package, at 4.9 ounces, this ACOG is perfect for fast-moving tactical teams operating in close quarters or for speed-oriented competition venues. This very compact model provides weapons like the M16/M4 with excellent fire control capability. Targets are easier and quicker to acquire through the 1.5x16 models because of the larger field of view (7.4 degrees) and eye-friendly design…

And my description:

This unit is 8 months old and I have everything it came with 1 Carry Handle Screw and Washer Set (TA30)1 Compact ACOG Scopecoat (TA62)1 LENSPEN® (TA56) 1 Manual 1 Warranty Card.

This is a Savage 24 A with a date code of 3N, meaning it was made in 1962.

This gun can take 3"" shells. The receiver is case colored. The barrel selector is a button on the right side. The buttplate is from a Remington gun. The scope mounted is a Weaver D4. This was a working gun and has some honest wear on it but nothing catastrophic in my opinion. Shows its age but isn't beat to hell.
