Still in the plastic and cardboard.  Comes with manual(s) and one 30 magazine.

Why a Dissapator? The long smooth handrail allows the shooter to slide the support hand forward for longer shots (accuracy).  The front sight is further forward and this creates a longer sight radius, making it a faster pointer with a better sight picture (accuracy).  When resting on cover, the handrail can be pushed/pulled further for more options on the improvised rest (accuracy).  Dissapator is the way to go.

Retail on this is $1,100.  This AR is on a completely different level than the DPMS puppy mill rifles, for example.  You can buy a DPMS (or equivalent quality) off the shelf now for about $650.  There is a quality difference.  DoubleStar makes their own barrels and other functionally critical parts in their own factory.  Additionally, DS has an incredible customer service policy.  They are 100% behind their rifles.  The accuracy and function of DS rifles compared to low end rifles is notable.  You get what you pay for and that is the difference.  For illustration, type in ""DPMS AR"" on a gun sale search.  See the going price.  Then type in ""DoubleStar AR"" and see the value difference.

I am a serious AR shooter, so if you have any questions about function or features... let me know.  The attached picture is an example/stock photo that gives you the idea of the dimensions/features.  Visit star15.com for actual specifications.

Must be 18 years old and will physically hand the box and rifle to you.  I am willing to ship it via FFL for a fee of $50.  I know a local FFL."

Pws primary weapons systems:The PWS MK107 Upper was developed specifically for CQB requirements and as a replacement option for the MP5 style weapons. The short compact design retains lethal capability out to 200 meters and has been proven highly effective in the military and law enforcement community.

Designed from the ground up to be 7"" barreled Upper, the PWS MK107 is a dream come true for those looking for the shortest possible package with reliability of a full size Upper. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 7"" handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

You can see that the gun was treated in the same way as my ""Movie Gun"" as far as the internals go and I changed the outside rail system.

Here is a list of what has been done.
First the FCG has been moved forward and a US Made FCG with a polished and re-profiled FCG has been installed for a smoother action and better reliability with low brass.
br> Bolt and Carrier were ground, reworked and polished as well.
In addition the extractor has been modified, the rails polished, the extractor ramp modified, the BHO modified, the internal spring for recoil has been changed and the BHO spring modified.
The gun has a Chaos Titan Quad Rail System that hinges up out of the way for easy access to the dust cover.
It also has the Chaos HK Style sights installed. These sights will co-witness with the Burris FastFire sight-optional
It has a Custom barrel shroud that has been designed so that a brake such as the Tromix shark brake which is included, can be used with the shroud."

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty
features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally trigger
system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses
fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to
choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a
manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design
of the Duty and a sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock)
reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

I offer it on the last weekend of the month, and I have another instructor that is going to be getting certified with my curriculum and will have his class on the second weekend of the month.  Of course many women are more comfortable having a female instructor, and I'm looking for a woman that is NRA certified for the Basic Pistol course that I would like to get certified with my curriculum to offer classes on either the first or third weekend.  I have a storefront and materials, and what I would offer is a split of the course fee.  Right now things have been slow going getting students enrolled, so for the summer months I'm running a special price of just $80.  For now the split would be $50/student for you, and $30 ($20 towards the cost of doing business + $10 for course materials = $30 for me).  My curriculum is unique in that it teaches students about Dry Practice and teaches them some drills to do to better their skills with a handgun without spending a bunch of money on ammunition, and I would expect you to get approved by the State Patrol to offer my curriculum so that the location stays consistent with it's mission.  If you're an NRA Basic Pistol Instructor I'd love to talk about what we can do for one another.  Once we get things up and going we can raise prices and each of our shares will increase based on the same percentages.  I'm trying my best to drum up business, but admit I've been struggling to put butts in my chairs.

Again, this rifle has never been used and has spent its life stored in its original box since purchased. It comes with the original leather sling and instruction folder. The beautiful laminated stock was a water resistant design and is in excellent condition. We cannot emphasize enough how great of a condition this firearm is in. It is quite literally an old rifle new in the box! This is the most perfect example of a Model 600 Magnum we've ever seen. Happy Bidding!"

Includes a $700 NIKON M-308 4-16x42 Scope that's made specifically for the .308 platform with an incredible 95% light transmission rate.  It's fully waterproof, fogproof and shock proof and holds zero perfectly.

I also added a very expensive Magpul PRS Precision Tactical Sniper Stock which is an absolute necessity in a gun of this build.  I further complimented it with an aluminum monopod made specfically for the PRS that in combination with the Harris Bipod allows the gun stand to be integrated into the gun for ultra precise long range targeting.

I didn't stop there and added a precision machined bolt-on Kahntrol Solutions Heavy Muzzle Brake designed for the .308 round.  A bolt on brake is the best option since some states like California have made some threaded brakes illegal without a stamp.  You can simply unbolt and remove this from the bull barrell.  This muzzle brake along with the heavy bull barrel makes this AR-10 recoil lighter than most AR-15's.

Also added a tactical rubber coated grip with hand relief perch.  Excellent comfort and trigger control.

This is a beast of a gun and in one of the pictures you can see the size difference between it and an AR-15 sized HK 415 I have chabbered in .22.  This AR-10 get's a lot attention anywhere I've taken it including a couple of trips to the range.

Includes 3 steel magazines and about 20 rounds."

I bought this at a gun show about 10 years ago, I dont know anything about the company that makes it but it is a unique gun you dont see many around like this. The gun has been well taken care of and cleaned after every firing. I would guess over the years I have put 200-300 rounds through it but I havent fired it recently. It has 2 mags and if i remember correctly they hold 10-12 rounds but im not sure and dont have any 9mm laying around to test it.


It is in good shape, it shows some signs of wear but nothing significant. Im willing to listen to trade offers."

The camo on the call is ""Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity."" I purchased the call in April before my birthday and my father unknowingly purchased another foxpro as a present. I just don't need both. The call has never been used!! The caller came with 50 original sounds for any predator and other animals. The sounds cover coyote, fox, raccoon, rabbit, deer, crow and turkey. You cannot get any better than the Foxpro calls. I paid 400.00 plus 15.00 shipping, I'll sell it for 325.00. I can take any and all pictures needed of call. I will even as a courtesy place about 10-12 more sounds from my other call on this one before purchasing if you want. I have killed 6 coyotes using my Foxpro Fury on 4 nights. I hate I have went without e-calls in the past after using these. Email with contact information if your are interested or ask any and all questions. This call is extremely loud and perfectly clear!!!!

I have a like new Trijicon ACOG 3.5x35 with the green chevron and 223 ballistic drop reticle for sale. I found that I prefer my Eotech for 3-gun, and I already have an ACOG on my other rifle, thus I am selling this to free up some revenue for another toy. I have the original box and paperwork, and you are welcome to inspect and confirm it is real (lots of clones out there, can't be too careful, but I'm not going to mount a fake to a $2K rifle). I'm happy to send any photos or answer any questions you may have. My loss is your gain. $1000 OBO (cheapest price locally is $1300+tax at Point Blank). Thanks for looking."

Other than that it's the same M&P you've come to know and love scaled up to handle a man's caliber. Now this was the model with the thumb safety, but thumb safeties on striker fired guns (much like arguing with a glock fanboy) are pointless. However it will still be included with the gun and upon request I can put it back on. The gun is in excellent condition, kept very well maintained, and has a low round count. Comes with all factory stuff (case, paperwork, 2 10 round mags, backstraps, etc).

It was thoroughly cleaned after each time I took it out. It's honestly not even broken in yet. 

The gun has functioned well for me and did experience the last round hold open issue that these are known for. I sent it back to Sig early one and they replaced the slide stop. It has worked well sense. If you ask me there is currently no better value in a 1911. This gun has all the features you want at a fraction of the cost of most 1911's in it's class. Plus it's made with outstanding Sig quality. My loss is your gain! 

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today‚Äôs shooters demand. The SIG SAUER¬Æ 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote¬Æ coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Z-Medica Corporation and they explained that the active ingredient is inorganic and except for it being very hydroscopic is relatively inert. Nothing to age out. Other than the packaging which with prolonged exposure to UV light and or constant molesting could damage it. The contents will last 10 years or better. The FDA requires an expiration date on ALL medical devices, medicines and supplies. And thinking about it, it also helps the manufacturers bottom line.... Making money.

Bought it from a gun show a while back and putting it out there to fund another project. Comes with two 20 round and a 40 round plastic promag, all of which feed flawlessly.
