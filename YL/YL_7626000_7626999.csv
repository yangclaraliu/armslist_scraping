Leonard Wood, Springfield, Missouri",$ 150,"Listed On: Monday, December 4, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Yes, 30 Gauge. I am stumped with this gun and have exhausted my research efforts.  I picked up this shotgun about four years to do further research on it.  The Miroku Model 100 or BC My Luck, was an early version single shot shotgun.  I have seen this gun in 12 gauge but never a 30 gauge.  In fact this is the ony shotgun I have seen in a 30 gauge. From my research I have found that the 30 gauge was a brass shotshell that was orginally used with blackpowder.  The chamber is shy of 3 inches as denoted by the 75mm marking under the barrel. There are some companies that are making brass shells however, I am not a gunsmith and would dare not make a determination if this was a shooter or not.  The lock up is tight and trigger, safety and action all work as intened.  Japan did make 30 and 32 gauge single shot guns for citizens to have as house guns when the Americans would invade.  These were junk guns and not Mirokus.  If you are intersted please shoot me an offer or if you have some info and would like to share please feel free to do so.  FYI there are Proof Marks visiable however, I cannot find them in my book.  I would estimate the date of manufacture around 1950s?

I'm thinking as they become less available the original ones will be worth more. This is New in the box! When these first came out they were at $499.00, and now that they're out of production the price will jump in the next few years. Trust me on this!Im only selling mine to raise some money for a Mossberg Shockwave. If you have a shockwave, let me know and maybe we can trade.The Doubletap is the perfect pocket carry gun in my opinion. Small, thin, light.

The aluminum and polycarbonate construction stands up to the drops and bumps that can happen when open field hunting. The open design and single plane focus means that all available light is captured so you don't lose sight of the target in low light.Tritium material draws all available light to fill the optic with a fluorescent green to illuminate the reticle and enhance its use in low light situationsPrecision two-point alignment means that precise eye position is not needed, just align the crosshair and shootAttaches easily with a quick detach system onto either a Weaver or Picatinny rail and secures into positionAdjustments vertically and horizontally can be made easily with the hex wrench includedDesigned for use with both eyes open with a maximum range of approximately 100 yardsGot it for a month.

982,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7626982,For Sale:  Suarez Kompressor Compensator for Glock,"Garner, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 55,"Listed On: Saturday, December 16, 2017",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Used but not fired while Mounted. Perfect condition. Includes Allen key for tightening to barrel. Works for Gen 3. Will work on Gen 4 if you purchase adapter from manufacturer. Would recommend changing your recoil spring to 12-15lbs. $55 FTF in Garner only.from Suarez:SUAREZ PISTOL KOMPRESSOR FOR GLOCKS - BLACK MELONITEThe Pistol Kompressor is designed to allow its user to fire hyper accurate shots, in succession, with minimal muzzle flip and recoil. In the tradition of the Carry Comps of the 1990s, the profile of the compensator closely follows the contour of the Suarez Match slide. When installed on a Suarez 319K slide, the clean and refined package looks like a complete Glock 34 slide, and will fit in most Glock 34 holsters.The Kompressor includes two ports on top, and an additional port on either side, for a total of four ports to stabilize the muzzle of your pistol during extended firing strings. In our research we found that aluminum compensators tend to wear out with extended use. To alleviate that, our Pistol Kompressor is made out of 17-4 stainless steel, and comes in black melonite finish. Ready to install as is or refinish to match your slide.Thread size is 1/2 x 28, and the unit is secured with one set screw. Installation instructions are included. Fits Gen 3 and Glock 17, 19, 34, 17L. ** Gen4 units will still require a Gen4 Recoil Adapter for use with a Gen3 Guide Rod**Please note: Adding the Kompressor to your Glock may require some fine tuning. Since the Kompressor (and any compensator) is designed to reduce recoil, your slide may not be able to cycle completely if using low powered ammunition. Make modifications after consulting a qualified Gunsmith. We suggest the use of lighter recoil springs from 10 pounds to 15 pounds. You may have to test various weights to see which functions best with your pistol and ammo. The fit of the Kompressor will vary depending on the characteristics and specifications of your particular threaded barrel, but when assembled on a Glock 19 will give a weapon about the same length as a Glock 34 and will fit open bottomed Glock 34 holsters."
