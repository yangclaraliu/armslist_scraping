This compacted version of the Walther P99 is modeled after the gun used by special forces as their back-up pistol. This popular CO2 powered BB air pistol captures realism with its BLOWBACK, semi-automatic action and features a Picatinny mount to allow easy installation of accessories such as a Walther Laser Sight. A 12g CO2 cylinder loads in the back of the grip and the BB magazine releases with the push of a realistic magazine release lever. The recoil action made live by the power of CO2 kicks the slide back giving you that oh-so-realistic feel. A great pistol for target games and owners of the P99 Compact or similar firearms.

Fortis REV™ Free Floating Rail System - 14"" FDE
Description:

Fortis REV™ is an extremely lightweight yet robust free floating rail system. When designing the REV™, we didn't want just another rail system, we wanted a better, lighter, feature rich handguard that was robust and within budget. We've managed to reduce as much weight as possible while maintaining strength by utilizing a 1 piece body design. Key Mods were added at the 6 & 9 O'clock positions for modularity and additional weight savings. It's unique mounting system captures a standard AR15 barrel nut for easy installation. Check out all the features and see for yourself why the Fortis REV™ beats the competition.

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. 

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pullúeven and smooth. 

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare. 

This particular pistol is in excellent condition. Looks like it has been shot very little, if at all. Great for concealed carry. Includes one magazine and Hogue grip sleeve. Buy it now while it lasts!"

  Story behind the handgun is:

In the spring of 1945, the 3rd Infantry Division was approaching the end of their involvement in WW2. My father was  ranger in the division's 7th regiment and he was sent to blow up a RR tunnel that connected to Berchtesgaden which was Hitler's summer home. After they blew the tunnel they took the train and there was a German civilian engineer and coalman on it. They said that the train was otherwise empty but that the caboose was Herman Gerrig's personal car. He was the commander of the German Air Force. In the desk drawer was this F-N 9mm Luger.

1958 Colt Python up for grabs. I've wound up with two of the same year and am letting this one go. The weapon came fitted with rubber pachmeyers which I've replaced with some nice aftermarket rosewood grips. There is moderate holster wear and some minor areas of surface oxidation. I've cleaned it up and coated it with Renaissance Wax. Smoothest action of ANY snake in my safe. This is a killer wheel gun and a highly collectible Colt. These four digit Pythons fetch a large premium these days. This one is going cheap to get my mitts on the next prize

 This listing is for a Winchester Model 62A pump action 22lr rifle. Serial Number 372645 manufactured approx 1957. FEATURES: 23"" round Barrel, and exposed hammer. CONDITION: Excellent this is one of the nicest we have seen. Minor wear on the slide areas, a couple of marks in the stock all of which are shown in the photos. Original owner was elderly and did not know it was a valuable gun we will provide the history we know about it with the rifle. Box has been authenticated by numerous collectors is in nice shape showing age dated 55, tape is old that is on it, it has a price hand written on the outside which looks like it could be removed if wanted, paperwork is also nice. We have seen plenty of reproduction boxes, they are fairly easy to identify and rarely have the correct base markings and show the correct aging, if this one is not correct its fooled a lot of guys, this rifle has been displayed at two collector shows and not one person has claimed an issue. If you have been looking for a collector grade Model 62 they just do not get much nicer than this.......................

Restrictions apply on ammunition orders, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for a full factory case of 25 Boxes, a total of 500 cartridges or rounds; buyers, however, may take any number of additional cases we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping charges. Since we have sold so many SKS Rifles locally, the hunting round has become a staple for us. Here is our better grade of 7.62 x 39 Hunting Ammunition, the Silver Bear 125 grain Soft Point made by our erstwhile friends in Russia at their prestigious Barnaul Factory. It is absolutely non-corrosive, laquer coated, zinc plated steel case, and we have had no adverse reports from it at all from our local customers, no misfires, and no lost deer. Factory ballistics figures show over 2400 fps velocity from 20 inch barreled rifles. Any SKS is tough enough, even tailor made, for steel case rounds, because that’s what all the Communist Bloc Countries have always used; and the Ruger Mini Thirty is every bit as tough as they are. We're offering this fine ammunition in factory case lots only, total of 25 boxes at case price $6.76 per box. Own a case of 500 rounds for only $ 169.00.

The bore is pristine and the shiniest bore of any gun I own.The sig pro's like this have the beefiest steel slide rails I have ever seen on a gun and are built like tanks. I don't think you could wear one out and I would dare to say they would outlast an aluminum frame sig because the anodized frame rails wear much more quickly than steel on steel. $385 firm   These guns were much much more when they came out, they only lowered the price because the die hard sig people hated polymer guns. Its every bit as good as the metal guns and better than the p250 series of guns by far. You have to hold one of these swiss made models to understand how well they are built, they dont even feel like a polymer gun in the hand."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Any SKS is tough enough, even tailor made, for steel case rounds, because that’s what all the Communist Bloc Countries have always used; and the Ruger Mini Thirty is every bit as tough as they are. We're offering this fine ammunition in factory case lots only, total of 25 boxes at case price $6.76 per box. Own a case of 500 rounds for only $ 169.00.

Restrictions apply on ammunition orders, please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for One Carton or Brick, 10 Boxes, a total of 500 cartridges or rounds; buyers, however, may take any number of additional 500 round lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and no extra shipping charges. >>>>>>>>>> The Remington model 591 and 592 rifles chambered in 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum caliber enjoyed a production run of some 50,000 rifles during the Nixon Years. Thompson / Center Arms manufactured a good many Contender barrels up until the mid 1980s. Those three firearms are durable enough, and well enough prized, to sustain production of 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum Ammunition, the abortive Taurus 590 Tracker revolver aside. This is 5mm Remington Rimfire caliber. It is designed for Remington Rifles model 590 or 591 only; for Thompson / Center Contender barrels chambered in 5mm Rimfire; and for Taurus model 590 Tracker pistols chambered in 5mm Remington caliber. This ammunition Will Not Work in any other caliber or firearms. We have sold hundreds of boxes of Aguila ammunition now for over 10 years with no complaints whatsoever from our local customers. It is brass case with excellent components throughout. It matches performance of its US Competitors, and exceeds them on leaving less powder residue. Aguila ammunition is produced by our good friends just south of Mexico City in Cuernavaca, right here in North America. This is Aguila’s Centurion series load in 5mm Remington caliber. These rounds exit 20 inch barreled rifles at 2300 fps speed with muzzle energy at 350 foot pounds. Here was the rationale for the cartridge anyway, an improvement upon the .22 Winchester Magnum caliber. Aguila's connection with Eley with its superb priming system gives us great confidence; and we have just as much confidence in Aguila's accuracy, both from personal experience and from positive test reports plastered everywhere on the Net. For many years, we’ve sold and traded Remington factory ammunition in the $35 per box vicinity. We’re selling these Aguila Centurion cartridges, however, in 10 box factory cartons at $21.90 per box. Own a brick of 500 rounds for only $219.00.

This is a CZ 2075 Rami in 9mm with safety. It is in excellent mechanical and cosmetic condition. The guide rod and recoil assembly was replaced with a CZ factory kit earlier this year. The original is also included and would only need new springs (available from CZ or Midway) to have a ready-to-go backup. 

This is a great pistol and would make an excellent daily carry piece. I just am not able to conceal a double stack pistol of any kind. Since I can't CC it, it just sits in the safe. I think I'm going to let it go this time.

Restrictions apply on ammunition orders, please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for FIVE Boxes, a total of 250 cartridges or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots at the same per-box price and with no extra shipping. Manufacturer is Sellier & Bellot of Vlasim, Czech Republic, a 200 year tenured company. Importer is Magtech of Minnesota, a CBC Brazil & Germany conglomerate. For well over 40 years, we have sold Sellier & Bellot ammunition from our store with excellent accuracy, reliability, and customer satisfaction. The company has two centuries of expertise. More than any other associated company, S&B is responsible for the excellent reputation that CZ firearms enjoy; after all, the CZ's rely on quality ammunition for their accuracy. S&B has even manufactured several runs of centerfire pistol ammo for Winchester in the past few years, we had one lot of USA .45 that was S&B manufacture. Note the lacquer coating on the primers. This is universal for S&B centerfire handgun ammunition, and it enhances the already-long ammunition storage life. Here is S&B's standard Military & Police load in 7.62x25 Tokarev, one of the most popular and most efficient rounds in the world. Its clean-ignition components produce impressive ballistics, and S&B's brass quality is second to none. This load uses an 85 grain Full Metal Jacket bullet. In a 5 inch barreled Tokarev, it develops an incredible 1647 feet per second velocity, and 511 foot pounds of muzzle energy. It is too hot, the manufacturer warns, for .30 Mauser pistols. We're offering this fine ammo in Five Box, 250 round lots at only $24.90 per box. Own five boxes, 250 rounds, for only $124.50

Hey everyone, I have up for sale or trade a used but in great condition EAA ""Windicator"" 357/38 special revolver. It is in great cosmetic condition and shoots flawlessly. I put roughly 50 rounds of 38 spl and 20 rounds of 357 mag down the pipe of this. It is a very stout gun and shoots great. I is a 6 shot and has is the 4 inch barrel model. It also comes with the factor plastic container and I can include ammo or other extras for the right trade. Mainly interested in trades for a Glock 40 or 380 (obviously with extras on my side) or possibly a 44 mag revolver, or even a 38 revolver plus extras. Would consider cheap 1911’s or other pistols in 45, 9mm, and 40 as well. Would even trade for a huge lot of 45 auto brass ammo. Would also trade for a good SR22 with some extras. Honestly, just shoot me a text and we can go from there. worst I can say is no! Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can try and get something lined out. I would also consider partial trades for cobra derringers, mainly in 38 spl or other large bores. Even shooting this in double action it is very easy to keep on target and the trigger pull isn’t bad for being a factory job. The grips also make it very comfortable to shoot even with the 357 mag rounds. For any more questions or pictures just drop me a line and wel go from there! Simple BoS required on this one."
