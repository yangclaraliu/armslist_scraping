Rear sight is adjustable and dovetail milled into the slide (white outline style).  White SQUARE style front sight.
This ISSC 22LR pistol looks and feels just a Glock.  Chambered for the affordable 22 round in a true target gun.
Gun is like new (I cannot promise for sure, but I don’t believe I ever fired it and see no signs of wear).  Comes with original plastic carry case as pictured in the ad.
PREMIUM FEATURES:Practice tactical drills like a Glock, but shoot the less expensive 22 ammo.  Like its sister Glock, it was made in Austria with the well-known quality and workmanship of arms makers in Austria.  Excellent condition – almost new (used at the range only one time).
A rugged, reliable pistol that’s outfitted with premium features found on many larger-caliber tactical handguns. The M22 has an Austrian-made precision match barrel, ensuring excellent accuracy along with the 4-lb. trigger pull. 
Magazine is heavy duty steel made in Austria (not the cheap plastic 22 magazines commonly seen elsewhere) that fits perfectly into the gun.  Magazine release is sure footed and quick just the Glock.
Packed with convenience and safety features:  ambidextrous hammer decocking lever, safety tab on the trigger like the Glock, magazine disconnect safety, loaded-chamber indicator. 
Use the Weaver-style rail in front of the trigger guard to install a light or laser sight.  A 10-round factory magazine is included.
The frame is durable black polymer with a textured grip and subtle finger grooves.

This is identified as the ""Pre War"" or ""First Generation"" of the model. Calibers, at least thirty in all, ranged from .22 rimfire through .476 Eley, with approximately half, or 158,884 (including Bisley and Flat Top Target variations), chambered for .45 Colt. The next most prevalent were the .44-40 Winchester Center fire (WCF) at 71,392; 38-40 (38 WCF) at 50,520; 32-20 Winchester (32 WCF) at 43,284 and, the 41 Colt at 19,676.2nd Gen: Second Generation Colt Single Action Army revolvers were produced from 1956–1974 and carried serial numbers in the range of 0001SA to 73,205SA. About 400 of the Second Generation Colt Single Actions were factory engraved by Colt's, the factory engravers of the period were Alvin Herbert, Earl Bieu, Dennis Kies, Robert Burt and Leonard Francolini. One of the most sought-after engravers who have worked on Colt revolvers was Alvin White and the shop of A. A. White Engravers.3rd Gen: The Third Generation began in 1976 characterized by a change in barrel thread pitch and a solid cylinder bushing replacing the removable/replaceable part from the first and second generations. This Generation ran until 1982 as a limited-issue product with the serial number range of SA80,000 to SA99,999. In 1994, production resumed with the increase in popularity of ""Cowboy Action Shooting"". These models are known either as ""Late Third Generation"" or sometimes Fourth Generation with the serial number convention changing yet again starting with S02001A and continuing with the ""S"" prefix and ""A"" suffix to 2009. Colt currently offers the Single Action Army in one of two finishes: either an all-nickel or blued with color case-hardened frame; in the traditional three barrel lengths: 4¾"", 5½"" and 7½""; and six chamberings: 32-20, 38-40, 44-40, .38 Special, 357 Magnum or 45 Colt; a total of 36 variations.Colt Single Action Army HistoryThe Colt Single Action Army (also known as the Model P, Peacemaker, M1873, Single Action Army, SAA, ) is a single action revolver with a revolving cylinder holding six metallic cartridges. It was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1873 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company, today Colt’s Manufacturing Company, and adopted as the standard military service revolver until 1892. It is perhaps the most copied, fraudulently modified to replicate an original Colt SAA, than any other revolver made. The Colt Single Action Army has been offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths. Its overall appearance has remained consistent since 1873. Colt has discontinued its production twice, but brought it back due to popular demand. The revolver was popular with ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike, but current models are mostly bought by collectors, shooters participating in Cowboy Action Shooting and re-enactors. Its design has influenced the production of numerous other models from other companies. Bound by the Rollin White patent (#12,648, April 3, 1855) and not wanting to pay a royalty fee to Smith & Wesson, Colt could not begin development of bored-through revolver cylinders for metallic cartridge use until April 4, 1869. The Colt Single Action Army was designed for the United States government service revolver trials of 1873 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and adopted as the standard military service revolver. Its original moniker was the ""New Model Army Metallic Cartridge Revolving Pistol"".The very first production Single Action Army, serial number 1, thought lost for many years after its production was found in a barn in Nashua, New Hampshire in the early 1900's.Colt Single Action Army General SpecificationsMake: ColtModel: SAA - 1st GenerationCaliber: .45 ColtDesigner: William Mason and Charles Brinckerhoff RichardsDesigned: 1872Produced: 1873–1941, 1956–1974, 1976–PresentFinish: Factory Original NickelBarrel Length: 5.5""Capacity: 6Weight: 1,048grCondition: 1st Generation ClassicGrip: Genuine Mother of PearlRear Sights: Open Line Of SightFront Sights: Fixed BladeAction: Single ActionSerial Number: 347324Manufactured: 1925 - Hartford, Conn.We have the honor of listing quite a few high end firearms in outstanding condition this week, feel free to check out our other auctions @ diamond1210 We've listed some fine iron for your consideration.

She comes as photographed.Colt Single Action Army Generations1st Gen: From 1873 through 1940 (with small numbers assembled during and after World War II, the so called ""Pre-War, Post-War"" model), production of the Colt Single Action Army reached 357,859. This is identified as the ""Pre War"" or ""First Generation"" of the model. Calibers, at least thirty in all, ranged from .22 rimfire through .476 Eley, with approximately half, or 158,884 (including Bisley and Flat Top Target variations), chambered for .45 Colt. The next most prevalent were the .44-40 Winchester Center fire (WCF) at 71,392; 38-40 (38 WCF) at 50,520; 32-20 Winchester (32 WCF) at 43,284 and, the 41 Colt at 19,676.2nd Gen: Second Generation Colt Single Action Army revolvers were produced from 1956–1974 and carried serial numbers in the range of 0001SA to 73,205SA. About 400 of the Second Generation Colt Single Actions were factory engraved by Colt's, the factory engravers of the period were Alvin Herbert, Earl Bieu, Dennis Kies, Robert Burt and Leonard Francolini. One of the most sought-after engravers who have worked on Colt revolvers was Alvin White and the shop of A. A. White Engravers.3rd Gen: The Third Generation began in 1976 characterized by a change in barrel thread pitch and a solid cylinder bushing replacing the removable/replaceable part from the first and second generations. This Generation ran until 1982 as a limited-issue product with the serial number range of SA80,000 to SA99,999. In 1994, production resumed with the increase in popularity of ""Cowboy Action Shooting"". These models are known either as ""Late Third Generation"" or sometimes Fourth Generation with the serial number convention changing yet again starting with S02001A and continuing with the ""S"" prefix and ""A"" suffix to 2009. Colt currently offers the Single Action Army in one of two finishes: either an all-nickel or blued with color case-hardened frame; in the traditional three barrel lengths: 4¾"", 5½"" and 7½""; and six chamberings: 32-20, 38-40, 44-40, .38 Special, 357 Magnum or 45 Colt; a total of 36 variations.Colt Single Action Army HistoryThe Colt Single Action Army (also known as the Model P, Peacemaker, M1873, Single Action Army, SAA, ) is a single action revolver with a revolving cylinder holding six metallic cartridges. It was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1873 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company, today Colt’s Manufacturing Company, and adopted as the standard military service revolver until 1892. It is perhaps the most copied, fraudulently modified to replicate an original Colt SAA, than any other revolver made. The Colt Single Action Army has been offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths. Its overall appearance has remained consistent since 1873. Colt has discontinued its production twice, but brought it back due to popular demand. The revolver was popular with ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike, but current models are mostly bought by collectors, shooters participating in Cowboy Action Shooting and re-enactors. Its design has influenced the production of numerous other models from other companies. Bound by the Rollin White patent (#12,648, April 3, 1855) and not wanting to pay a royalty fee to Smith & Wesson, Colt could not begin development of bored-through revolver cylinders for metallic cartridge use until April 4, 1869. The Colt Single Action Army was designed for the United States government service revolver trials of 1873 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and adopted as the standard military service revolver. Its original moniker was the ""New Model Army Metallic Cartridge Revolving Pistol"".The very first production Single Action Army, serial number 1, thought lost for many years after its production was found in a barn in Nashua, New Hampshire in the early 1900's.Colt Single Action Army General SpecificationsMake: ColtModel: SAA - 1st GenerationCaliber: .45 ColtDesigner: William Mason and Charles Brinckerhoff RichardsDesigned: 1872Produced: 1873–1941, 1956–1974, 1976–PresentFinish: Factory Original NickelBarrel Length: 5.5""Capacity: 6Weight: 1,048grCondition: 1st Generation ClassicGrip: Genuine Mother of PearlRear Sights: Open Line Of SightFront Sights: Fixed BladeAction: Single ActionSerial Number: 347324Manufactured: 1925 - Hartford, Conn.We have the honor of listing quite a few high end firearms in outstanding condition this week, feel free to check out our other auctions @ diamond1210 We've listed some fine iron for your consideration.

This is identified as the ""Pre War"" or ""First Generation"" of the model. Calibers, at least thirty in all, ranged from .22 rimfire through .476 Eley, with approximately half, or 158,884 (including Bisley and Flat Top Target variations), chambered for .45 Colt. The next most prevalent were the .44-40 Winchester Center fire (WCF) at 71,392; 38-40 (38 WCF) at 50,520; 32-20 Winchester (32 WCF) at 43,284 and, the 41 Colt at 19,676.2nd Gen: Second Generation Colt Single Action Army revolvers were produced from 1956–1974 and carried serial numbers in the range of 0001SA to 73,205SA. About 400 of the Second Generation Colt Single Actions were factory engraved by Colt's, the factory engravers of the period were Alvin Herbert, Earl Bieu, Dennis Kies, Robert Burt and Leonard Francolini. One of the most sought-after engravers who have worked on Colt revolvers was Alvin White and the shop of A. A. White Engravers.3rd Gen: The Third Generation began in 1976 characterized by a change in barrel thread pitch and a solid cylinder bushing replacing the removable/replaceable part from the first and second generations. This Generation ran until 1982 as a limited-issue product with the serial number range of SA80,000 to SA99,999. In 1994, production resumed with the increase in popularity of ""Cowboy Action Shooting"". These models are known either as ""Late Third Generation"" or sometimes Fourth Generation with the serial number convention changing yet again starting with S02001A and continuing with the ""S"" prefix and ""A"" suffix to 2009. Colt currently offers the Single Action Army in one of two finishes: either an all-nickel or blued with color case-hardened frame; in the traditional three barrel lengths: 4¾"", 5½"" and 7½""; and six chamberings: 32-20, 38-40, 44-40, .38 Special, 357 Magnum or 45 Colt; a total of 36 variations.Colt Single Action Army HistoryThe Colt Single Action Army (also known as the Model P, Peacemaker, M1873, Single Action Army, SAA, ) is a single action revolver with a revolving cylinder holding six metallic cartridges. It was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1873 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company, today Colt’s Manufacturing Company, and adopted as the standard military service revolver until 1892. It is perhaps the most copied, fraudulently modified to replicate an original Colt SAA, than any other revolver made. The Colt Single Action Army has been offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths. Its overall appearance has remained consistent since 1873. Colt has discontinued its production twice, but brought it back due to popular demand. The revolver was popular with ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike, but current models are mostly bought by collectors, shooters participating in Cowboy Action Shooting and re-enactors. Its design has influenced the production of numerous other models from other companies. Bound by the Rollin White patent (#12,648, April 3, 1855) and not wanting to pay a royalty fee to Smith & Wesson, Colt could not begin development of bored-through revolver cylinders for metallic cartridge use until April 4, 1869. The Colt Single Action Army was designed for the United States government service revolver trials of 1873 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and adopted as the standard military service revolver. Its original moniker was the ""New Model Army Metallic Cartridge Revolving Pistol"".The very first production Single Action Army, serial number 1, thought lost for many years after its production was found in a barn in Nashua, New Hampshire in the early 1900's.Colt Single Action Army General SpecificationsMake: ColtModel: SAA - 1st GenerationCaliber: .45 ColtDesigner: William Mason and Charles Brinckerhoff RichardsDesigned: 1872Produced: 1873–1941, 1956–1974, 1976–PresentFinish: Factory Original NickelBarrel Length: 5.5""Capacity: 6Weight: 1,048grCondition: 1st Generation ClassicGrip: Genuine Mother of PearlRear Sights: Open Line Of SightFront Sights: Fixed BladeAction: Single ActionSerial Number: 347324Manufactured: 1925 - Hartford, Conn.We have the honor of listing quite a few high end firearms in outstanding condition this week, feel free to check out our other auctions @ diamond1210 We've listed some fine iron for your consideration.

There are 0.90 carats of inset round diamonds and another 0.95 carats of baguette diamonds. And one round brilliant cut center diamond 1.01 carat.

I have shot about 800 rounds through it and have decided I want a 17 mos.  The reason for the lower price is because the stipple job is a little messed up with the dremmel work around the trigger guard and along the back strap. If your handy with a dremmel and a soldering iron you could probably fix the stipple job. Comes with the original Glock sights. Not the night sights  you see in the pictures. I have cleaned and properly lubricated this gun after every use. All the internal parts are polished Glock parts that came with the gun. The stipple job may not look the best but it is very functional in that it is very grippy and has a really deep under cut making it very easy to handle the recoil.

This is an officially liscenced copy of the venerable worldbeater of a submachine gun, the Heckler and Koch MP5. It's a hell of a hoot to take to the range. At 15 yards, it shoots right where you point it. Also very easy to handle, very simple to operate. If you've ever handled a real MP5 or a Zenith clone, this model is as close to those as you can get. Puts a smile on your face whenever anyone shoots it.Just to be clear, this is a legally billed rifle, with a barrel length of 16"". The false supressor does indeed come off, if the user so chose to shoot it that way.
