The Rifle:

1939 Izhevsk 91/30.  It's a Molot refurb, no cosmoline.  The bore is in excellent shape (see pic below).  Not counterbored.  All numbers match--there is an Arsenal strikethrough/renumber on the floor plate but bolt/receiver/butt are all original.  The wood is beautiful, but shows a couple of relatively fresh minor scratches (poorly packed bayonet in the import shipment). Comes with bayonet (packed in bubblewrap in the pic--I've never taken it out), oil can, cleaning bits, and manual (a Molot manual translated into English ... with sometimes entertaining results).

The Ammo (not pictured):

*A full case (two 440 rd. spam cans) of Romanian surplus Ammo.  One can has been opened, and a couple of rounds have been fired (what? I was curious ... and yes, they went boom). Opener is included, as it the cool wooden box.
*40 rounds of loose surplus FMJ (bought in 20 rd packets)
*20 rounds of Wolf FMJ
*20 rounds of Prvi Partizan SPBT

The Extras:

*Otis ripcord in .30 (it works well, but it's barely long enough for this monster-you have to push it as far down as you can, and then screw a brush into the muzzle end to get enough of a grip to pull it through.  This barrel ain't short)
*3 new .30 bore swabs
*One extra wooden stock (no handguard or metal bits), and an extra recoil crossbolt to fit it.

It's a fun shooter. I've only had it to the range twice, however--it is a fairly recent purchase, and I was hoping for a long and beautiful friendship, but then my wife got pregnant with our third, and our car only has four seats.  The new math says new car, and thus the hobby takes a hit.  So it goes.

FTF only, 2 forms of ID and all that.  I'm willing to meet in Richmond, Norther Va, or in the Piedmont, generally."

Black Grey color NIB $250 cash 

The C.U.B. fighter is a mid-size belt knife that is small enough for everyday tactical use but big enough for most larger field and tactical chores. The matte bead blasted 154-CM USA made stainless blade steel is an excellent choice for a knife to be carried close to the body as it is rust resistant yet holds a superb edge. 154-CM was originally designed as jet turbine blade material and it handles the rigors of everyday knife use extremely well.

The machined 3D G-10 handles come in your choice of Black, Green, or Black/Gray in the Wilson Combat Starburst pattern with double inset medallions from Woods and Wilson. The aggressive Starburst pattern locks your hand in a firm grip even when wet or oily. The C.U.B. is as effective as it is handsome. 

The C.U.B.’s practical tactical drop point blade shape is useful for all belt knife tasks and thin flat grind zips through most tough materials with ease and is easy to re-sharpen in the field.  

A custom kydex sheath with Tek-Lok universal belt attachment is included.  

Steve Woods has made tactical fighting knives for military and special operations teams for many years-now is your chance to try his latest combat-utility blade, available only from Wilson Combat."

There will not be to many chances to own one of these very rare hitoical rifles. See the story from The National Firearms Museum below;

The Model 720A was produced between 1941 and 1944, with a total production of approximately 2500 rifles. Of these, nearly 1000, including the example seen here, were purchased in 1942 by the Navy Department and were awarded as trophies to winning Navy and Marine Corps personnel in a variety of competitions. These trophy guns can be identified by the Ordnance crossed cannon and inspector's proof marks on the stock.



The Remington Model 720 bolt action rifle, intended to compete with Winchester's popular Model 70, was produced in limited numbers until Second World War military requirements forced its discontinuation. Even some knowledgeable collectors and firearms historians may not be familiar with these rifles. Introduced by Remington in mid- to late-1941, the Model 720 was billed as an improvement over its predecessor, the Model 30S. The Ilion, New York arms maker offered these in .270 Winchester and .257 Roberts chamberings, as well as in .30-Ô06; and with barrel lengths of 20-, 22-, and 24 inches.



Other features included a semi-beavertail stock with checkered pistol grip and fore end; checkered steel butt plate; hinged floor plate; swept-back bolt handle, and speed-lock firing pin which cocked on the opening of the bolt. Remington intended to phase out the Model 30 shortly after this new design hit the market, but the Pearl Harbor attack and the subsequent U.S. entry into the



Second World War threw a wrench into Remington's plans. Production of the 720 was soon discontinued as military ordnance contracts for the Model 1903A1 and the later M1903A3 took over the company's production line. Following are serial numbers and production totals by year for the Model 720: Year Serial Numbers Production Total 1941 40000 - 40427 427 1942 40428 - 41449 1,022 1943 41450 - 42422 973 1944 42423 - 42427 5 _______ 2,427 Eventually, existing Model 720 inventories in .30-Ô06 caliber, as well as various incomplete sub-assemblies, were ""drafted"" into military service by the U.S. Navy. These rifles are easily distinguished by the ""crossed cannon"" Ordnance proof mark and inspector's cartouche on the stock. These rifles would never see combat service; instead, they spent the war in storage at the Navy's Crane, Indiana Ammunition Depot.



There they would remain, until an order for their destruction as surplus property was issued in 1963. Fortunately, Major Kam Hayden, U.S.M.C., who had just finished a tour as commander of the Marine Corps Marksmanship Training Unit at Quantico, Virginia, heard about the proposal to destroy these rifles. Maj. Hayden suggested that they be awarded as trophies to top Navy and Marine Corps competitive shooters.



This plan was approved, and beginning in 1964, the Model 720 was designated as the ""Secretary of the Navy Trophy."" A few rifles exhibited ill-effects from their long storage and were subsequently used as a source of parts, while the remaining inventory was divided between the Navy and Marine Corps to be awarded to winners at the National Matches at Camp Perry, Ohio, and at various divisional and inter-service matches. Presented in their original shipping cartons, these Secretary of the Navy trophy rifles feature an engraved magazine floorplate identifying the competition for which they were awarded. Some shooters won as many as seven of these rare trophies before steps were taken to limit the awarding of a rifle."

I purchased this rifle many years ago at an Ohio Gun Collector's show. The seller had little information about the builder, but the quality of workmanship speaks for itself. The 5-digit serial number dates the action to 1940. The trigger appears to have been upgraded. There is a Neidner butt plate and grip cap, both well fitted. The stock is a beautiful piece of walnut with a rosewood forend cap. The stock multi-point pattern checkering is very well done. The one-piece Buehler mount & rings hold a vintage Weaver 1.5x-4.5x variable scope that is clear. There are some light safe induced handling marks, but overall I would rate the rifle at 98+ condition; however please view the pictures carefully, and judge for yourself."

252,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3040252,For Sale/Trade:  I'll Trade my MIG Welder for Your Rifle (Good Brand Name Machine),"Austin, Austin, Texas",$ 700,"Listed On: Thursday, May 8, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Hello there! This machine is a 220V Hobart Handler 187 MIG Welder. It operates on a dryer plug and can weld 1/4"" Steel, or can weld 1/8"" Aluminum. 

I bought this machine brand new in early 2011 (I *might* be able to dig up my original reciept) and only used it for a short while before I was offered a much larger machine for a deal that I couldn't refuse. This has been my backup machine ever since.

Anyway, it was $700 new + tax. I've added the following upgrades:

Flex Head MIG Gun (Highly durable and the nozzle moves in any direction. Great for exhaust welding, auto body work, etc). Cost $180

Flowmeter... Better quality and more precise gas measurement than the stock regulator. $50.

(Upgraded ground clamp, jar of nozzle gel, and a few extra nozzles... $30 retail for all)

The total new cost of this setup is $960, so I'd give it a lightly used trade value of about $700ish (+ or -). I'll throw in a mostly full 10 pound spool of wire, and a pair of gloves and safety glasses for you. You'll still need a gas cylinder and a welding helmet tho (sorry, I dont have extras of those). 

If you've never welded before, I could give you an afternoon long lesson to sweeten the deal. I have 5 years of fabrication experience and 5 different welding certifications. 

Not really looking to sell, just wanting to trade for something to add to my collection."

A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 16.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with black rubber grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations and SIGLITE® Night Sights. This new pistol for SIG SAUER comes equipped with a red tactical laser that integrates with the pistol trigger guard. It features single push button operation, and is removable with enclosed tool.

I have for sale a Romanian Sar-1 Ak, the gun is in great shape internally and shoots fine. The are scratches on the outsize but they are just superficial, just scrapes on the finish. 

Extras, 

-Complete ATI ak furniture. Quad rail, Padded adjustable stock, pistol grip.
(Stock was put on using a different screw then was given to put it on, works fine just being honest)

-Tasco Red Dot sight. (Is missing cap for the one adjustment knob, never used the scope to shoot but i seems to work just fine)

-NC Star Dust Cover with picantany mount

-No name foregrip/bipod combo ( works fine but feels sort of cheap)
or
-Another no name foregrip, that feels very solid, but has no bipod.

I don't have the original furniture or I would throw that in, I bought it from someone else.

PRICE
Overall im looking to get 700$ obo. Feel free to check around, you will find that this gun with not extras goes for around that price. The ATI kit alone sells for over 100. 

Overall a good gun, I have 5 aks though so I just want the money to put towards something else.

Transaction
FTF somewhere in Bucks County, will travel further for the right deal. Will do a bill of sale if you want. But I just need to see a PA ID. (would be great if you had a lctf as well}

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

I recently moved to Washington state and no longer need this ""grandfathered"" California legal pre ban.  Since moving to WA, I have built my dream AR (Mega Arms billet) and have two other ""projects"" to complete.     

Originally purchased as a ""Dissipator"" model (SN: L053xxx) but replaced the upper with a factory new V Match carbine flat top in 2000 (16 in HVY barrel 1 x 9).  In 2011, Rainier Arms in WA installed the Viking Tactical VTAC rail and pinned low profile gas block.  All documentation (gun store receipt, bushmaster receipt, bushmaster invoice, California DOJ assault weapon registration), available upon request.  The lower has less than 1000 and the upper maybe 400 rounds.  

I would prefer to sell the rifle complete ($2,500 OBO) but am willing to sell just the complete lower...minus the stock ($1,000 OBO).  If you are interested send me an offer (complete or lower only).  No low balling please…I know what it is worth.  Best reasonable offer by May 31, 2014 will take it.  

What ever the case may be...this sale will be from my FFL to your (verified) FFL…PERIOD.  We can verify FFL's via:  https://www.atfonline.gov/fflezcheck/

For mutual security, we suggest we broker the transaction with an FFL in my area that YOU can even pick (brick and mortar gun shop).  Once you select…call them and get the name of a person I can meet with.  I will meet with them and present the rifle for inspection.  Once you verify and agree to the sale:    

1.  You send the FFL (you choose) your money order.
2.  I pick up money order and give the FFL the rifle to HOLD. 
3.  Once the money order clears…I tell them they can ship rifle to your FFL.

Paint on lower is just nail polish and can be easily/safely removed with non-acetone nail polish remover.  

UPDATE:  Complete rifle purchase will include 10 PREBAN 30 rd aluminum magazines, Burris 3-9x40 30mm, and Plano case in picture.  Three reasonable offers received so far (2 for lower only and 1 for complete) so this lower will be sold in 6 days!

The barrel is the shortest possible length (a true 16.1""), while still being NFA compliant. It is a 14.7"" hammer forged barrel that is manufactured by FN which is commonly referred to as ""machine gun"" steel due to its use in the M249 and M240 machine guns. The barrel is also double chrome lined, 1:10 twist, with a pinned/welded A2 flash hider which brings it to the legal length of 16.1"". 

The upper has a chrome BCG and fixed front sight.   Comes with a 25 round magazine AND flip up rear sight. Will also come with PSA box. 

This will make  a very nice rifle once pinned to the lower of your choosing.. I have yet to fire this one, I'm moving it to clear a little space in the safe. I figured I didn't really need 5 AR 15's. I could use some of the trades listed below or will sell for cash price too.
