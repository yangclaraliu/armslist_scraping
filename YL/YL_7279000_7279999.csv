Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Pistol includes 2 15rd magazines.Black Rifle Firearms1326 Harding HWY EastMarion, Ohio 43302Store Hours:WED-FRI : 11am-7pmSAT: 10am-6pmSun: 12pm-6pmClosed: Monday-TuesdayPhone: 740.914.6652"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Pistol includes 2 18rd magazinesBlack Rifle Firearms1326 Harding HWY EastMarion, Ohio 43302Store Hours:WED-FRI : 11am-7pmSAT: 10am-6pmSun: 12pm-6pmClosed: Monday-TuesdayPhone: 740.914.6652"

This pistol features extensive floral scroll engraving on both sides of the slide & frame, as well as additional coverage on the dust cover, trigger guard, and top of back strap. Overall condition is very good and more than 95% of the original blue finish remains. The original black plastic stocks are in good shape with only a few light handling marks, no cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent...mirror bright with sharp rifling. This pistol comes with one 14-shot factory magazine as well as the S&W factory letter which verifies it is one of the 20 factory engraved pistols.FOR ANY OTHER INFORMATION FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME.

If you don't want the holster and magazine pouch subtract $50..so $700. The only trade I'm interested in is an HK P30SK. This is a person to person sale, must have a valid Tennessee drivers license, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

It's a 9mm, ""c"" for compact, with thumb safety. I'm the 2nd owner, but it was hardly used before I aquired it. Nearly perfect condition. I've only put a hundred rounds through it, and based on the lack of any signs of wear, it wasn't shot much before I got it. So this thing is in great condition! Oh, and it shoots awesome too. I really like this gun, but just don't have a need for it right now.It's a great all around gun: home defense, concealed carry, or camping/outdoors open carry. The M&P line are great guns and great alternatives to Glock, but just as accurate and just as reliable, with a more comfortable (for me) grip angle.It comes with a few extras: a grip extension for using with a fullsize (17rd) M&P magazine (pictured, fullsize mag not included), a stippled medium backstrap for max grippiness without modifying the gun, and an extra finger mag baseplate on the 2nd 12rd mag (normally only 1 of the 2 mags has this). Plus it comes with all the original accessories: box, 3 original backstraps, ""flat"" mag baseplate, 2 12rd mags, gun lock, and a chamber flag.Save $50+ over buying new, and get some great extras that would cost an additional $50 if bought separately.Please call or text: 801-eight-nine-one-3324 (UT number, but I'm ID resident). Cash, in-person only. Please have concealed carry permit, or other proof you're legal to own a gun. Alternatively, we can meet at Joe's Pawn in middleton, and they'll run the check for $10. Scammers will be mocked and reported. See my other listing: Ruger 10/22."

Condition is excellent and I'd grade the overall condition at about 98%. There are couple of light handling marks but no rust or any pitting. The stocks show very minor wear with just a couple of small handling impressions. The wood has never been sanded or refinished. The serial numbered parts are all properly matching. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. Upon disassembly I did note a small amount of corrosion to the tip of the gas piston which will not affect function of the weapon. It comes with the original/excellent condition bayonet & scabbard, two original Poly marked 30-round chrome follower mags, a Poly marked 5-shot mag, the original sling, oil bottle, cleaning kit (in butt trap), and the original Kengs/Legend owner's manual. Of the highest quality and imported for only a short time (1988-1989), the Poly-Tech Legend is among the most desirable of all the AK variants."

York used in WW1.  Even though it's not the same rifle that was used in the movie with Gary Cooper, it's a fact that his regiment was issued this rifle.  There are people who would be glad to debate me over this, and that's okay.LOCAL AND CASH ONLY SALE.  PRICE IS FIRM.  This is as low as I can go on the price.  I would take $600. cash and trade for the following hand guns:  Beretta 92 FS or M9 9mm, or, S&W double-action 357, or, Ruger single-action Black Hawk 357.  They can be used or new, but if used they would have to be in excellent shape, because for $400. you can pick up one of these almost anywhere.  This would be of help to someone who wants this rifle and is short on cash and has one of these to trade."

When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.
