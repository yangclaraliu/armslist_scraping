Because the magazine is fixed, it is not classified as an ""Assault Weapon"". Because of this, it allows every feature that a normal AR can't have (by law); this includes a threaded barrel, collapsible stock, vertical grip, bayonette, etc. Chambered in 5.56/.223, this amazing rifle has 150 rounds through it without a single issue. Has a tiny bit of wear on the forward brass deflector, as shown in pictures, but that is typical with use. For half of the price of a pre-ban, this rifle is unbeatable. At $1,100 I will include everything you see in the pictures. If you would like to buy it with the original Magpul forend instead of the upgraded quadrail, I will work with you on the price. CASH ONLY, NO SHIPPING. Must have valid CT Permit. All Laws will be followed. Will include:UTG low profile front and rear flip-up sights (1) PMAG 10 round magazine(1) HEXMAG 10/30 magazine.

Built from the ground up, this rifle has been engineered to help you harvest that trophy with the precision and dependability you expect from Daniel Defense. At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both rights- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. The Ambush is fed with an optimized bolt carrier group featuring a redesigned geometry and a new extremely slick, low-friction coating to ensure smooth, reliable feeding. As a sportsman, you have an obligation to take clean shots on your game, and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger gives you the advantage you need to deliver a precise, on-target shot that’ll bring down that elusive trophy you worked so hard to get in your sights."

HISTORY:April of 1994, the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) released RFP 6564 with the specifications for a ""45 caliber, single action, high capacity, semi-automatic pistol"" shooting 2"" ten shot groups at 25 yards. The FBI/HRT specifications for the prospective HRT pistol contract specified that each entrant submit five pistols by June 7, 1994. Initially each pistol would be thoroughly inspected, and then two of the five would be randomly selected for accuracy testing. A third pistol would be selected for the abuse testing and the remaining two pistols of each submission would undergo a 20,000 round endurance test utilizing 230 gr. Federal Hydra-Shok ammo.In addition to building his specialty high capacity pistol on a Para frame (based on HRT's RFP 6564 specifications), Les included a complete Mag-na-flux inspection of the entire gun and its parts.In addition to the submission from Les Baer Custom, Inc., two other top custom shops, Wilson Gun Shop and Bill Laughridge's Cylinder & Slide, submitted pistols. The Les Baer HRT pistols submission was the only entry that passed every aspect of testing and was the only submission that passed the 25 yard accuracy tests with groups hovering right at 1 1/2"". September 1994, the FBI announced that Les Baer Custom, Inc., was selected to fulfill the HRT contract. Their Browning Hi-Power would be replaced with the Baer HRT custom pistol built on the Para-Ordnance P-14 frame. The ""Swift Response Pistol"" (SRP) was spurred by the interest and demand of the civilian gun enthusiasts' market for an HRT pistol. This high capacity pistol built on the Para P-14 gunsmith frame was identical to the HRT pistol, including the Mag-na-flux process. The Swift Response Pistol had ""S.R.P."" laser etched on the right side of the slide whereas the HRT pistol did not. Otherwise, the two pistols are identical. With the Swift Response Pistol being offered through the Baer catalog, SWAT and tactical teams as well as special units of the U.S. Army, Marines, Navy, and Coast Guard, along with the civilian market now had access to a pistol that was identically built to the HRT pistol. Even though he is best known for custom built competition pistols, the HRT or SRP is often considered the most superb combat pistol offered by Les Baer.In 1996, the SRP was now offered in the high capacity Commanche 4 1/4"" length. The high cost of high capacity magainzes along with problems obtaining acceptable high quality gunsmith frames led Les to introduce the SRP built on his 1911 single stack steel frame and Commanche frame. The single stack SRP pistol was built to the same specifications as the HRT pistol plus included the Mag-na-flux process.Production: 5"" Para with WG prefix: 225 for FBI/HRT; 272 SRP civilian versions"

I ran 2 mags through it, cleaned it, then back to the safe it went. Sale includes everything in the picture; the rifle, optics, foregrip, 2 factory mags, manual, and HK tool....Here's the info from the HK website:The H&K556A1 A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating &#8220;pusher&#8221; rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. Info on gun from Heckler & Koch website..... The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 &#8220;Picatinny&#8221; rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch&#8217;s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately &#8220;swagged&#8221; with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product."
