With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability. The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

You won't find a better Christmas gift than this!WARTIME FIREARMS, LLC -- WE SHIP!!!The M1 Garand saw extensive service from WW2 and the Korean War, all the way up to the beginning of Vietnam, just before the M14 was introduced to service. Throughout the years, almost every M1 Garand was either scrapped for parts, or rebuilt to be put back into service. Very seldom will you touch an M1 Garand that wasn't held by a young man in an unfamiliar place, fighting for his life and his country. This Garand is no exception. It, too, went through the US Army's recycling program after WW2 and, judging by the date of the barrel, was likely used early on in Vietnam before it's retirement. The reciever is in immaculate condition, showing very little visible wear. The rifling in the 1962 Springfield Armory barrel is perfect, and it even boasts a Boyt rifle sling from the year 1942. The replacement stock fits snug and feels great in your hands.Overall, this is the M1 Garand to buy if you're a collector that occasionally likes to shoot his or her firearms.

NO COMMUNIST GUN HATING PAYPAL!!LayawayI will also layaway for 60 days with 20% down and a 7% layaway fee. You pay 20%, you have 60 days to pay it off, all funds nonrefundable.Local PickupAll firearms on Gunbroker are available in store. If the item is purchased through Gunbroker then picked up locally, we still add the shipping charge to cover the associated processing and customer service costsGun ShippingPistol Shipping is 25.00 USPS Priority Mail. Long Gun Shipping is 30.00 Fedex Ground.We happily ship to our friends in the blue states like California, Illinois, and New York, but it must be legal there. We will not accept returns for items that were shipped where they aren't allowed.This is for contiguous US only. Guam or Alaska or somewhere, contact me for a shipping estimate. If you bid/win, and you missed this line, you are obligated to pay. Dont come tell me “I didn’t expect shipping to be higher”.Ammo ShippingAmmo shipping varies based on weight, caliber, and quantity. Quantities of ammo listed in these auctions are almost never all of it that I have. If the auction is for 1 box or 10 boxes, it doesn’t matter, feel free to contact us to get larger or smaller quantities. Shipping wise, it is advantageous to buy larger quantities because shipping can be combined. One box of ammo may be $10.00 to ship, 2 boxes may be $15.00 or more, but after that, shipping costs drop off dramatically. I can often ship 1000 rounds of ammo for about the same price as 3 or 4 boxes.REPEAT - This is for contiguous US only. Guam or Alaska or somewhere, contact me for a shipping estimate. If you bid/win, and you missed this line, you are obligated to pay. Dont come tell me “I didn’t expect shipping to be higher”.TermsIf you live in Texas, and I ship to a Texas FFL, I have to charge 8.25% sales tax. Local pickup is fine, also, but If you pick it up locally, there will be a sales tax charge of 8.25%. You can use credit card if you pickup at my place of business, also, but the auction price represents a 3% discount. Credit card negates this discount and will be an extra 3%If you bid on a gun and win, you are required to purchase it. Otherwise you owe a 20% restock fee. Ammo sales are final. No returns whatsoever. New guns aren’t always the same exact serial in the picture. We hold inventory, so the pictured gun may be representative of item for sale. Used guns are almost always the one pictured. Occasionally a gun may sell in store before we can take it off of gunbroker, or we may inadvertently leave an auction open. Items may sell in store at any time, we will do our best to get it off Gunbroker. Should this happen, you agree to not leave negative feedback. Layaway and ammunition sales are final. You may send items back that are indicated in the auction as having a 3 day inspection period, but we charge a 10% restock fee. Regardless of fault or issue.If you order a gun that isn’t legal in your state or you can’t pass the background check, there is a 20% restock fee. We do our best to accurately describe items, but if we error, as in listing comes with 2 magazines and it only ships with one, we arent responsible for reimbursing the buyer. We will not pay for return shipping for any reason. Obviously we want pleased customers, so we will almost always be able to come to an amicable agreement."

Long Gun Shipping is 30.00 Fedex Ground.We happily ship to our friends in the blue states like California, Illinois, and New York, but it must be legal there.

If you bid/win, and you missed this line, you are obligated to pay. Dont come tell me “I didn’t expect shipping to be higher”.Ammo ShippingAmmo shipping varies based on weight, caliber, and quantity. Quantities of ammo listed in these auctions are almost never all of it that I have. If the auction is for 1 box or 10 boxes, it doesn’t matter, feel free to contact us to get larger or smaller quantities. Shipping wise, it is advantageous to buy larger quantities because shipping can be combined. One box of ammo may be $10.00 to ship, 2 boxes may be $15.00 or more, but after that, shipping costs drop off dramatically. I can often ship 1000 rounds of ammo for about the same price as 3 or 4 boxes.REPEAT - This is for contiguous US only. Guam or Alaska or somewhere, contact me for a shipping estimate. If you bid/win, and you missed this line, you are obligated to pay.

Credit card negates this discount and will be an extra 3%If you bid on a gun and win, you are required to purchase it. Otherwise you owe a 20% restock fee. Ammo sales are final. No returns whatsoever. New guns aren’t always the same exact serial in the picture. We hold inventory, so the pictured gun may be representative of item for sale. Used guns are almost always the one pictured. Occasionally a gun may sell in store before we can take it off of gunbroker, or we may inadvertently leave an auction open. Items may sell in store at any time, we will do our best to get it off Gunbroker. Should this happen, you agree to not leave negative feedback. Layaway and ammunition sales are final. You may send items back that are indicated in the auction as having a 3 day inspection period, but we charge a 10% restock fee. Regardless of fault or issue.If you order a gun that isn’t legal in your state or you can’t pass the background check, there is a 20% restock fee. We do our best to accurately describe items, but if we error, as in listing comes with 2 magazines and it only ships with one, we arent responsible for reimbursing the buyer. We will not pay for return shipping for any reason. Obviously we want pleased customers, so we will almost always be able to come to an amicable agreement."

Few more years and he can get out there :) It has the adjustable LOP stock to grow with the youth, or would make a great woman's showgun if she wanted a smaller framed shotgun.
