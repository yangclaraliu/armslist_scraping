This rifle comes in OK, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have a moderate amount of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular usage. There are a handful of small shallow scratches, scrapes, nicks, and cuts throughout the rifle's wood stock, as well as both inside and outside of the rifle's receiver, and chamber. There is also a moderate amount of rusting inside the receiver, and both the receiver and the barrel show rusting, and pitting. However, this rifle has been tested, and was found to be in fireable condition! It does NOT come equipped with a scope, though it does still feature its original iron sights, as well as a safety switch that is set directly behind the bolt. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this rifle, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

Feel the difference the second you pick it up! The Polymer80 PF940v1.5 features a rock solid pistol frame, injection molded from a fully automated system that was two years in the making.
 
This system is designed as a complete kit. There's NO expensive jig kits and parts to purchase - Polymer80's PF940v1.5 system is a COMPLETE, all inclusive package in one price!Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard Glock styled pistol grip. Even better, this pistol grip includes a built in flared magwell for speed loading. This feature will surely be a favorite amongst competition shooters who require speed and accuracy.
The jig is included. The kit comes with drill bits and the end mill bit that's required to finish your Glock project the right way."

This pistol was in the last 20,000 produced during the war. It has a Type III slide, perfect markings, serrated MSH/slide-stop, checkered trigger/hammer, bakelite grips, and original HS barrel. For a WW2 example, this pistol cannot be upgraded. Also included will be 3 General Shaver (Remington Rand contract) seam backed magazines with original 1942 magazine pouch. I will also be including a high end reproduction holster from At The Front. I also have a really worn box of steel cased .45ACP I can toss in for display purposes if desired. 
Overall, the condition of the pistol is very good. It retains nice casae hardening and parkerization with typical handle and high edge wear. The bore in the barrel has deep lanes/grooves and is shiny. It holds in the 10 ring at 30 yards. 
I am wanting to trade this A1 example for an early M1911 from the WW1 era in similar shape. I am getting out of WW2 stuff and more into WW1 and want to swap this one out for another more relevant to my interests. My pistol isn't junk so yours shouldn't be either. The value is close enough from both eras now that I don't expect to put any cash towards anything and it would be great if you had a holste or any accessories to go with yours as well.

Feel the difference the second you pick it up! The Polymer80 PF940v1.5 features a rock solid pistol frame, injection molded from a fully automated system that was two years in the making.

 

This system is designed as a complete kit. There's NO expensive jig kits and parts to purchase - Polymer80's PF940v1.5 system is a COMPLETE, all inclusive package in one price!Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard Glock styled pistol grip.

This is easily one of KelTec's greatest innovations. It is a bullpup style rifle that feels like an SBR despite having a rifle length barrel that shoots 223/556. The feel and weight of the stock RDB trigger is hands down far better than any other stock bullpup trigger on the market. One of the greatest innoivations of the RDB is the downward shell ejection system which makes this rifle truly ambidextrous. The charging handle can also be very easily configured to either side of the rifle.It has exactly 100 rounds through it without a single malfunction. I just don't shoot it enough to justify keeping it cooped up in my safe. It was meticulously cleaned after each of the two times I shot it. It looks and feels new but you get it for well under the retail price.Contact me with any questions or for more pictures. Transfer in Snohomish County."
