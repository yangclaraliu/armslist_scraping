This 9mm has had 50 go through it. It has the custom desert tan polymer lower. Smooth shooting gun. Only reason I'm selling it is I want to purchase the smaller version of this firearm (VP9sk) to carry IWB.just recently purchased less than a month ago. Also comes with a custom fit alien gear OWB paddle holster with vehicle mount. Slide parts included as well in case you want to slide your belt through instead of clipping the gun over the belt. Can easily go from hip to mount in your car. Valued at $70 Only issue sue is the actual case the gun came was cracked at the dealer so I declined it even though they offered to order one for me seeing it was the only one of its kind in stock. No use for those anyways so it would've ended up collecting dust.

If you do some research you'll find that these rifles were made by Maadi using Russian tooling by Egyptian workers trained by Russians. So the Maadi is the closet thing there is to a real Russian military AK. This particular rifle is the post ban model with the laminated thumb hole stock that has a dark brown color. I bought this in 1998 stuck it in a safe, forgot about it and never used it. So it's literally New and Unfired although stored for the last 19 years. I split open the plastic bag the rifle was packaged in from the factory for pictures but have never actually removed it from the box. It comes with a factory 5 round magazine, sling, instruction manual and certificate of authenticity. Also the guy who sold it to me in 1998 had a couple of nice used 30 round Egyptian mags and a few boxes of real Egyptian 7.62x39 AK ammo so I bought one of each and they are included with the rifle. Today these Maadi rifles and the Poly Tech Legends are the two finest AK style rifles ever imported into the USA. Price is $900 picked up in the Brandon area by a Florida resident who is at least 18 years old. I'm not set up to ship firearms and will not do so. Also I'm looking for a sale only and not trades. Thanks for looking."

I highly doubt it though because this gun is a blast to shoot with the Slide Fire stock attached. Basically shoots full auto legally with a bump style action. I have shot it around 200 rounds and it preforms flawlessly. The received does have the legal case number written with a metal marking pen.

I'll also throw in the non-sticky camo scope tape that matches the current color pattern of the rifle (fde and OD)  I have about 120 rounds through the rifle, no hiccups, with consistent 4"" groups at 250 yards (I'm not that great of a shot either). I had a gunsmith assemble and test the rifle, real thought and attention was put into the build, so please no lowball offers.  Local buys with CCW or local FFL transfer only.

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left-hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.The New Reinforced Under-Folding StockThe SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged ReceiverEach SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision, and durability.SAM7UF-85 | SAM7UF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left-hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet / accessory lug, reinforced under-folding buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel heat shield, cleaning rod, one 10-round magazine (accepts any mil. spec. magazine), sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

I literally only fired about 2-3 boxes of rounds through it to sight it in and see which load grouped the best. I bought it to coyote hunt and I think I have actually hunted with it 2 or 3 times. I have never even fired at a yote with it lol. Been in a case in the back of my truck almost the entire time. It is topped off with a Scheels ICON scope that is a 6x18x42 I think. I don't have the original box anymore and I am not 100% sure how big the objective lens is. This is a really good set up. I just do not use it at all. Comes with the sling and I have it partially wrapped in a snow camo gun skinz thing that just peel off if you don't like it. I really don't know it's worth but it has to be worth at least $300 so that's what I am asking for it. I am located in Council Bluffs but from NC Iowa and willing to meet if you are serious about buying it. Thanks.
