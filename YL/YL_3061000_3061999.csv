Selling for $1000, which is the most I'm willing to lose on this for deciding to walk out the door with it.  This 1911 is still brand new.  I took it home, sat it in the safe and that's it.  Has not been fired yet.  Only selling to help pay off the credit cards or buy a jet ski.  I pretty much fell in love with this gun a couple months ago with the intention of concealed carrying it.  I've found that I much prefer carrying a smaller gun though.  It has some very nice features for a factory 1911, the best of which is probably the bobtailed grip.  The scalloped checkering is very nice and this 1911 is light!  Has to do with the Scandium alloy put in it, but the difference is very noticeable.  Also has Trijicon tritium night sights.  The finish is perfect - there are no idiot marks on this one.

Willing to consider partial trades.  Particularly interested in a nice small carry gun like a Glock 26 or 27 or similar, compact Ruger or Keltec.

This is a great AK and I am going to miss it - children need braces.  Fired 200 rounds with 0 miss - meticulously cleaned and oiled - original furniture is very nice for stock - sights are true - groups nice.  No stock cleaning rod (I use a kit purchased for $20).  Anyone that knows a WASR knows its all about the individual gun itself.  I picked this out of a crate of 20 and my only regret is having to sell it.

I'm putting my FNP 45 FDE frame up for sale/trade as I just acquired an FNP Tactical.  If you are looking at this you know what they are.  Great guns and shoot like champs.  Comes with 1 15 round and 2 14 round mags, holster, mag holder, training barrel and case.  Purchased new and shot very little (probably less than 200 through it).  I like it, but find I shoot my 1911's MUCH more and I don't need 2 FNPs.  I'm keeping the one I prefer.  This one was a bedside gun for a while, but has recently resided in the safe almost exclusively.

Here is a specimen of Smith & Wesson's Military & Police series, the MP40 Standard 209200 variant with one 15 round magazine, and magazine safety. Photo is representative, but buyer will receive a very similar pistol from the same Department. Dealers, Collectors, and Law Enforcement may take any number of extra M&P 40s we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. Each pistol served with the distinguished officers of the Policía de Puerto Rico, La Uniformada, the Puerto Rican State Police. All were manufactured and issued in 2009. Weight empty, no magazine, is 24 1/4 oz; weight fully loaded will be a bit over 35 ounces. Overall length is 7 1/2 inches; 5 1/2 inch height; and very nice thin 1.2 inch width. Barrel length is 4 1/4 inches with a 6.4 inch sight radius. Sights are three dot combat type, dovetailed into the slide. This pistol, like all M&Ps, is full time double action, striker fire action, with a very consistent 6.5 pound trigger pull that only travels .300 inches from rest to fire and resets in only .14 inches. It has a firing pin safety, a trigger safety, and a magazine safety. It will NOT fire single shot with the magazine removed. Frame is Zytel Polymer, and barrel and slide are Black Melonite finished stainless. The frame incorporates a Picatinny Weaver type rail for light and laser mounting. Backstrap piece on the grip frame is interchangeable. The M&P series takes all comers for ease of handling, positive feel, and reliability and consistency under the most adverse field and combat situations. Each pistol is well maintained. Surface detractions are minimal to moderate, principally edge whitening and occasional inconspicuous finish freckling on the slide. We rate them as Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, 85 to 90 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate each pistol has been fired fewer than 400 times, no rounds at all for an M&P 40. This M&P .40 209200 variant commands retail prices in our area of $800 or more. We're offering the M&P 40 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates from the same batch, 	 	for only	$ 329.00	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Any ammunition showing in our photos is Not included; at press time, we had some excellent pricing on Prvi 180 grain Jacketed Hollowpoint like the rounds showing in some of our photos. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the 15 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement, $15 off but no magazines, includes Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, and New York.  Ask about our 50 round Boxes of .40 S&W Hollowpoint. Add any number of extra mags, $29 per.

The NcStar Riflescope is infused with a Quick Release for a standard Weaver style/picatinny rail. Professionals and Enthusiasts will agree that the Mark III Tactical Series 3-9x42 Compact Riflescopes are designed to do the job no matter what gets in the way!

Decided to put my BPM Patrolman's Carbine up for sale.  This is the 16 inch version but is the earlier version that does not have the NiB BCG.  Have fired maybe 100 rounds out of it (yup, you guessed it, that's why I'm selling it...been a safe queen and have no patience for that).  It's a great rifle, but I'm shooting my others more.  Would like to free up funds and safe space.  May have some marks from the safe, but nothing significant.  Also has KNS anti rotation pins.  Following is the website.  GREAT rifle, Great NC company, just don't need it right now.  Needs to go somewhere it can run!

Please inquire. This an original MAC .380 M-II. It is not an RPB parts gun. Nor is it a common gun like the .45s and 9mms. It is the smallest machine gun ever made. Comes with an SWD .380 suppressor and 3 magazines. Needs to be transfered on a Form 4. Registered in Ohio. It's .380. MAC marked the first 50 or so guns they made in .380 as 9mm Auto. They made few of these guns and sold them just as marked. This issue of gun was made in a failed attempt by MAC to interest the CIA in these because of it's extremely small size. The mags only hold .380 and 9mm will not fit. I have been involved with Machine guns for nearly 40 years and have only seen 2 genuine MACs like this. Years later RPB bought a bunch of incomplete frames from MAC and made a similar gun that had their name on it. This is the smallest and rarest machine gun ever made.

This listing is for One Set of Grips. Buyers, however, may take any number of additional small light similar items on the same order and it will not add anything to your shipping costs. Most Smith & Wesson Revolvers manufactured after 1996 have Round Butt Grip Frames. If you aren’t sure which yours is, please see the comparative photo. Photos show representatives of only a handfull Italian Walnut grips we found in an old Southern Warehouse for any Smith & Wesson J frame revolver with a round butt grip frame. These include models 34 and 36, and their stainless counterparts models 63 and 60. These are excellent grips, and we sold lots of them during the 1960s until 1980s. These were imported by distinguished New York Importer Sile, Inc., and all of them are new, just occasionally with some slight signs of shelfwear from their years in the warehouse. They are in their boxes, but the glue is dry and the boxes show some separation. Their interior wrapping paper is old and brittle, but the grips themselves are pristine, never opened. What these do, shooting wise, is to increase the size of the grip on a J-Round and give the shooter better control, whether for target shooting with a round butt 4 inch Model 34-1, or in Combat situations under stress for concealable revolvers. These grips’s heyday in the 1970s and 1980s saw them compete favorably with the much pricier factory Smith & Wesson grips that were hard to get at the time for any price. This was before the days of boot grips, but with a set of these Magna style Service grips and a Tyler T Grip adapter, a person had an excellent means to hold a revolver that current production boot grips simply cannot match. Some of our photos show the grip frame of a 1968 Airweight Bodyguard with a set installed. We strongly recommend inspection and fitting where the revolver’s grip frame makes contact. These are all genuine diamond pattern checkered Italian Walnut with nickel plated screws and screw escutcheons. These grips are period correct for any Smith & Wesson manufactured from the late 1960s through about 1995, and we consider them collectable in their own right. They will fit all current production variants of the J Frame Round Butt revolvers. We’re offering these fine grips well below what similar bizarre looking competitors sell for. Own a set, the ones in the photos or a set of their identical mates for only $ 39.00.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).
This model of Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of 9mm pistol magazines, including that of the 92 and Px4 pistols.

Restrictions apply on HK91 type rifles, on 20 shot magazines, and on ammunition in many jurisdictions, so please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for One Rifle, total of 4 magazines, factory HK adapter, and 2000 rounds of .308 caliber ammunition. Winning buyers may take any number of similar packages we have on hand at the same per-package price, and with no additional shipping charges.  This isn't an HK91, but it's awfully close. Here is an outstanding package deal. Star of this show is the best quality clone of the Heckler & Koch HK91A2 rifle. PTR 91 Inc. is a Connecticut manufacturing firm in business since 1997. This is their PTRGI variant, factory product code 915300. We are including a conversion bolt and 2000 rounds of German Army Practice ammunition. The PTR 91 was developed with the tooling from the H&K licensed G3 arms plant in Portugal, and retains the major design features of this well engineered popular rifle. With most major parts manufactured in the US, the current rifle models feature a retarded blow back system, .75 inch diameter Match Grade 4 groove barrel with 1:12 right hand twist, OD green furniture and powder-coated barrel. Other specs are: Semi-Automatic rifle, caliber .308 Winchester; 18 inch barrel with flash hider / muzzle brake; capacity 20 + 1, standard trigger, lever safety, overall length 40 inches; weight empty 9.17 pounds; black finish with black synthetic stock and forend. Package includes the original new factory magazine plus three extra German Army surplus mags that we are including.  All of them are 20 round capacity. Ammunition is German manufactured practice ammunition that the German Army and Security Agencies use in their G3 Rifles, that we know and love as the HK91. Manufacturer is Deutsche Angestellten Gewerkschaft, DAG, of Germany. Cartridge construction is one piece molded thick polymer case with a 10 grain polymer bullet that detaches during firing. Ignition system is Berdan priming in a steel case head. Since its case head measures .445 diameter, compared to the normal .469 for .308 ammo, we are including a factory HK rollerless replacement conversion. HK91 rifles with this kind of equipment and ammunition command prices upwards of $5,000 apiece. We're offering our package for half that. For math purposes, $889 for the rifle; $13 per on the 3 extra mags; $3.00 per 20 round box equivalent price on the ammo; and $41 for the conversion kit.  Own it all for only $1269.00 plus $35 ship lower 48 only. Not for sale to civilian residents of Alaska, Aurora IL, Colorado, California, Chicago Cook Co Il, D.C., Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, or any jurisdiction where HK91 rifles or 20 shot Magazines are restricted, or where we can't ship ammo. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $35 flat fee lower 48 states UPS Ground on 2 packages with full insurance coverage.

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, however, may take any number of virtually identical 461s we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. Any ammunition showing in our photos is Not Included. Most of the Rossis we sold in the 1960s were model 31 series; there were only a few of the medium frame model 51s that came through. While the Brazilians used Smith & Wesson Hand Ejector milling equipment during that period, and their mechanical designs were close to Smith & Wessons, the model 51 had a Colt Influence as well. This descendant of the model 51 is close to the Colt D frame Detective Specials of the late 1960s and early 1970s, with 6 shot cylinder and shrouded ejector rod. Here is the model R461 that is .357 Magnum capable. Manufacturer is Amadeo Rossi of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, a Taurus affiliate; this .38 is marked Made In Brazil By Taurus on the right side of its frame. Type is double action only revolver. The hammer does not stand in a cocked position. Construction is entirely blue steel with the exception of the hardened stainless steel hammer nose firing pin and rivet. Frame is D Size small frame, with Round Butt Grip frame and 3 screw side plate. Barrel is 2 inch heavy full lug type, with matte finish verticals and barrel-integral serrated blade front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Cylinder capacity is 6 rounds of .357 Remington Magnum and .38 Smith & Wesson Special calibers. Note the cylinder yoke’s detent latch, a Taurus inspired mechanical improvement that prevents cylinder wobble. Trigger is .380 smooth faced combat semi-target, with factory bobbed .265 smooth hammer. Weight empty is a well balanced 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the trigger. Double action trigger pull is smooth and consistent, 10 pound vicinity. Safety system consists of a transfer bar that prevents the firing pin from touching a cartridge primer unless the trigger is fully depressed, and also Taurus’s innovative internal hammer lock. Note that we have installed a set of Sile Italian Walnut Banana Style Grips for Smith & Wesson J Frame Round Butt, modified and fitted to this Rossi. The Siles were production mates to the ones still found on many Smith & Wessson J and Colt D frame revolvers manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. Note that an H.K.S. DSA Speedloader Will Not clear the left panel’s recess. From its letter G serial number prefix, this 461 was manufactured in 2012 or 2013. This revolver is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or showgirl from Firearms Industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show held in Las Vegas. Serial number’s X prefix designates it as such. It is in its original overlabeled factory box with instruction manual, two keys for its hammer lock and its never executed factory registration card. Note that the box top is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means that if this Rossi develops mechanical problems, Braztech will repair it at no charge, but they will not give a freebie refinish. It does not need any refinish anyway. Surface detractions are negligible, only faint occasional edge whitening and cylinder rotation marking. We rate this R461 as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. The only comparable Blue Steel 2 inch 6 shot revolver on the market is the Taurus 605 series, with their prices usually approaching $500 per unit; and two times that for a Colt Detective Special. We’re offering the Rossi R461 Blue 2 inch in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only	$ 319.00.   Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

Galco Inside The Pant Holster For 1911 Style Auto w/5"" Barrel 

The open top, combat style Scout is rough side out to provide additional stability. This design also provides a smooth leather holster pocket for a faster, smoother feel on the draw. The Scout carries the handgun in a vertical orientation, with no cant or angle, so it can be used strong side, crossdraw, or in front of the hip (appendix carry). Additional features include stitched leather sight rails and a Generation II injection molded nylon J-hook that locks onto the belt. Constructed of premium saddle leather, the Scout fits belts up to 1 1/2"".

537,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3061537,For Sale:  Winchester 1894 Made in 1908 Rare 25-35 WCF,"Carlton, Oregon, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Wednesday, May 14, 2014",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,no type,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"An elderly lady friend who belongs to my church, and is on a very fixed income, has decided it is time to part with some of her late husbands treasures.
I am not a gun expert so I will tell you all I know from research.
This is a very nice vintage Winchester Model 1894 saddle ring (missing the actual ring) carbine in the hard to find 25-35 WCF caliber. 
Made in 1908 it has the standard 20 inch carbine barrel.
It has (I believe) the original rear sight, but had a “Marble” tang sight added with the matching copper blade front sight.
The bore has good rifling with some wear/frosting/slight pitting, but the gun smith I had clean it up said it should not really effect shooting it.
The gun has been re-blued at some point during its very long life and looks very good, but there is slight pitting on the barrel. 
The receiver is mechanically excellent, feeds chambers and ejects properly. The action is extremely smooth and slick when you cycle the bolt, one of the great features of these old pre WW1 Winchesters! 
The screw head slots are all clean and sharp, they do not appear to have been turned. 
The buttstock and forearm are tight and solid, no cracks, chips, extra holes or other damage, just honest wear and minor dings from over 100 years of use. 
The metal butt plate has some rust pitting from where it sat in the gun case.
The wood does not appear to have been sanded, although at some point someone decided to add, what I would call “folk art” to the butt. 
Overall I would say this is a good tight 1908 carbine that has seen honest use, but not abuse, and was enjoyed by her late husband.
He also seems to have been a reloader. It comes with 70 shell casings, 2 actual rounds (the 20 round ammo boxes have a price tag on them of $5.59 and $6.27....oh the good old days!!!)and a box from RCBS Gun and Die shop with two ""reloading dies""...I guess that is what they are.
I will be glad to send any additional photos that you may want to see.
As I said, I am no gun expert, all I have done is research what I could find online that are similar to this rifle. What I have found is, I cannot find one exactly like this. 
For one thing it seems 30-30 is pretty common. 
25-35, not so much.
1908’s not too many. 
Saddle ring, not too many. 
With Marble tang sight? Very few. 
Prices of course vary from one to the other.
So, I am going to start out asking $2,000.00 for this gun. I do not want to lowball it and lose money for my friend. If you think that is too much, let me know. 
I am not 100% firm on that price!
Feel free to let me know if you do not think it is enough too! 
Right…I’m sure that will happen."

I have many photos that I send, just ask.

This is a beautiful weapon as you can see.  LOW serial number which means it is a good casting unit.  Pristine Riffle.  I have one sealed can of 1360 rds of nato ammo that goes with it.  I may have a small box of ammo if I can find it.  I have never shot this riffle.  Purchased it for my elderly father to enjoy in his gun cabinet.  He owned it for over 30years and just passed away several years ago.  Gun was only a show piece and the barrel bore is also super clean.  I will take any trade, up or down.  Would really like a 338 lapua.  No black powder or archery or junk.  I value the riffle at about $1200 cash and the ammo at about 50cents a round.  I will separate gun from ammo but will not open the ammo can.  I would be glad to make someone a great deal on this.  I would prefer to add cash to my gun and ammo than to trade down.

$1200 IS FOR THE GUN ONLY OR WILL MAKE A DEAL FOR GUN AND AMMO.  
Sorry for the confusion."

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. Dealers, Law Enforcment, and Collectors, however, may take any number of virtually identical specimens we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. Few of us will ever own a blued steel Smith & Wesson model 36 Chief’s Special of any description, now discontinued since 2006. This Taurus model 85 represents Taurus's leadership, and others' following, to use technological advances in steel work and investment casting to bring the Chief's Special class of revolvers to a state of withstanding .38 Special +P proof loads. Smith & Wesson itself lagged for almost 10 years before following suit, and that only under pressure from its Brazilian offspring. This is the steel frame blued finish Model 85 Snub. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Construction is entirely steel except for the grips. Finish is bright blue lateral surface, with matte verticals atop the barrel and frame for reduced sighting glare. Barrel is 2 inch full lug with integral .132 serrated ramp front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Hammer is MIM type .325 short serrated spur, case colored finish with matching .300 smooth faced combat trigger. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, including +P loads, like the Remington Golden Saber in some of our photos. Ammunition is NOT included. Ignition is flat faced hammer against floating firing pin. The Taurus 85 has a transfer bar internal safety device, as well as Taurus’s innovative hammer lock that is not conspicuous like the ancestor company’s. Weight empty is 21 ounces, with center of gravity at the cylinder stop. To increase its similarity to the classic model 37, we have fitted this revolver with a set of 1970s production Sile Italian Walnut Combat Grips. Some of us call them Banana type. The grips will not accommodate a speed loader. This revolver is what we call a Factory Demo, one of Taurus’s showgirls that served on display with the company’s sales reps at trade shows like the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas. It is in its original issue factory box with two keys for its internal lock, instruction manual and protective packaging. Surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only occasional faint edge and cylinder face whitening, but really no more cylinder rotation marking than brand new specimens one might see on display in a gun store. Note that its box is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means, as the label states, Taurus will repair it if it has problems, but they will not perform a free refinish. It does not need refinishing anyway, as we have noted. From its serial number prefix, it was manufactured in 2013. Pricing on a bright blue Smith & Wesson model 36 often approaches $1000, and it was not rated for +P ammunition. We’re offering the 85 Blue Steel Snub in the photos,  however, or one of its identical mates 	for only	$ 329.00   Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, however, may take any number of virtually identical 85 Ultra Lites we have on hand for the same price and with no additional shipping charges. In the mid 1980s, after years of following their Smith & Wesson Chief’s Special ancestors, Taurus began taking a leadership role. This Taurus model 85 Ultra-Lite represents Taurus's leadership, and others' following, to use technological advances in steel work and investment casting to bring the Chief's Special class of revolvers to a state of withstanding .38 Special +P proof loads. Smith & Wesson itself lagged for almost 10 years before following suit, and that only under pressure from its Brazilian offspring. This is the lightweight, stainless and alloy frame Model 85 Ultra Lite. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Construction is lightweight alloy frame with a coated satin finish, with stainless steel barrel, cylinder, thumb latch, trigger, hammer, and internal parts. Steel parts finish is satin stainless. Barrel is 2 inch full lug with integral .132 serrated ramp front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Hammer is MIM type .325 short serrated spur, satin finish with matching .300 smooth faced combat trigger. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, including +P loads, like the Remington Golden Saber in some of our photos. Ammunition is NOT included. Ignition is flat faced hammer against floating firing pin. The Taurus 85 has a transfer bar internal safety device, as well as Taurus’s innovative hammer lock that is not conspicuous like the ancestor company’s. Weight empty is 17 1/2 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger. Grips are factory combat finger groove boot type, pliable recoil absorbent rubber textured surfaces, and they do not exceed the length of the grip frame. This revolver is what we call a Factory Demo, one of Taurus’s showgirls that served on display with the company’s sales reps at trade shows like the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas. Surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only occasional faint edge and cylinder face buffing, but really no more cylinder rotation marking than brand new specimens one might see on display in a gun store. Note that its box is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means, as the label states, Taurus will repair it if it has problems, but they will not perform a free refinish. It does not need refinishing anyway, as we have noted. From its serial number prefix, it was manufactured in 2013. It is in its original, factory issue box with two keys for its internal lock and instruction manual. Label constitutes the warranty statement. Taurus service, the few times we’ve used it in the past four decades, has always been excellent. Pricing on a Smith & Wesson model 637 often approaches $600, and the 637 does not have a full lug barrel. We’re offering the 85 Ultra Lite Stainless in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only	$ 339.00 2% Discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & not credit card.

I am looking to sell or do a partial trade on my HK USP .40 compact (black in color, variant with manual safety/decocker). The gun is lightly used and in excellent condition, 100% reliable and a true pleasure to shoot. The gun has nice meprolight night sights which work great; there is a small ding/scratch mark on the meprolight rear sight (the only blemish of any sort on the gun, it doesnt affect functionality in any way). The gun also comes with a lightly used safariland ALS OWB holster and a almost brand new bladetech IWB holster for which I just paid over $75. The gun also comes with three 12 round magazines and a new $50 GG&G light rail adapter for the hk usp compact which allows you to mount standard weapon lights to the gun.

I also have some .40 ammo that I would like to sell together with the gun. Ammo consists off : 2 or 3 x 50rd boxes of assorted FMJ, 50-70 rds loose .40 FMJ, and approximately 70-80 rds of Hornady critical duty which is my carry ammo for the gun.

I am asking a firm $800 in NOVA for the pistol with 3 mags, the 2 holsters, and light rail adapter. I know that this is a fair deal so please dont send me ridiculous low ball offers.

If you want the gun with the accessories as well as the previously mentioned ammo I would like a firm $920 for everything.

I am currently out of town doing military training until Friday night but can email or text additional pics starting this weekend. 

My preference is to sell the gun to fund a project but my partial trade interests which I may consider include:

CZ 452 .22LR + cash 

Ruger 10/22 + cash (looking for either the target model or custom 10/22 configured for longer range shooting)

Smith Wesson M&P.22 pistol + cash

Feel free to shoot offers/questions my way via PM.  If you buy the gun we will do a BOS and I will need to see our good guy VA IDs.

Thanks"

2.HK 416 .22lr- This is a really cool and fun gun to shoot. Comes with original box and paperwork, removable front and rear sights and 1 mag...$375.00.

3.Kimber Ultra CDPII- This was was my everyday carry gun when I lived down south so it has some signs of wear but does not affect functionality at all.  This is a fantastic gun if you have ever shot one you know the quality of Kimber. Comes with original box and paperwork. I have a couple holsters for her too. Only about 250-300 rounds downrange so she's still being broken in...$950.00.

4.HK P30 9mm- Probably one of my favorite guns in the collection. This is the standard model not LEM. One of the smoothest guns I have ever owned and is dead on accurate. Comes with original box and paperwork and a Fobus OWB holster. Only about 100 rounds shot...$750.00

7.Walther P22- Really nice little 22 has the factory red laser attached. Great for a carry piece or tucked in the car. 100 rounds shot. Comes with box and paperwork...$300.00

8.Rossi .357 Magnum- This was used as my backup gun only put about 175 rounds through her. Out of all of the revolvers I have owned this is one of my favorites, super accurate super smooth light pull. No box or paperwork with this one bc the guy I bought it off of didn't have them...$325.00

Like I said all items are OBO. I am open to trades as long as they are good pistols or AR/AK type rifles, no shotties. Don't waste my time with lowball offers as I will not respond.

In the past, carrying a small handgun normally means making some big sacrifices. Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.

With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.

The Smith & Wesson Bodyguard .380 is also the first in personal protection featuring a built in laser sighting system. Insight is a world leader in the design, development and manufacture of tactical lasers, and they have teamed up with Smith & Wesson to specifically produce an integrated handgun laser for the Bodyguard series. Located in the dust cover of the Bodyguard .380, the laser features both strobe and constant on modes.

The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.

Includes 5 & 7 rd magazines, case, lock/muzzle brush, RH Versacarry holster, fiber optic replacements and operator's manual.

I have 280rds of high quality hollowpoint ammunition I am trying to sell along with the gun.  This includes:

120rds of DRT Frangible 150gr - worth $110

60rds of Remington Ultimate Defense 230gr JHP - worth $75
40rds of Federal Hydra-Shok 230gr - worth $60

100rds of the Frangible ammo are in a MTM plastic case, and the Rem/Fed are in another box.  The others are in their original packaging.  For the ammo alone (no gun), I believe $200 is a fair price.  Might trade for equal value .22lr/mag or 9mm.

I value the gun and accessories at $500, and the ammunition is worth $300 easily not including tax.  I see similar XDS selling for $600 now.  I really want to get rid of the ammunition with it, so my price on the gun alone is $500 making the ammo a really good deal.  I am open to trade for any compact 9mm of equal value or partial trade of some sort.  Not in a rush to sell, please no low ballers.

 The popular Bobtail Commander is now available in the Valor series. Both the original Valor and the new V-Bob are available in our black duty finish over stainless steel, or a matte stainless finish.

 These guns are the realization of all of their desires in a defensive style 1911. They offer everything you need and nothing you don’t.

 The Valor series features a forged frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back and undercut trigger guard, Heinie Ledge Straight Eight night sights and slim line G10 grips as well as billet alloy steel fire controls and all the other premium small parts you have come to expect from Dan Wesson. While the components are the best available, the components alone do not make the gun. We believe the Valor series is the best built production 1911 on the market.

820,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3061820,For Sale:  Silencerco Osprey 9mm Suppressor,"Ellisville, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 850,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 16, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Silencerco’s Osprey family of pistol suppressors is a perfect blend of form and function. With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length. 9 OSPREY CALIBER: 9MM Luger .300 BLK Subsonic WEIGHT: 9.8 OZ DIMENSIONS: 1.30”W × 1.75”H LENGTH: 7.0625” SOUND LEVEL: Dry: 125 dB (tested with a Sig 226 with American Eagle AE9FP 147 Grain Ammunition) FINISH: Hard Coat Anodizing Black Oxide MATERIALS: Core/Caps: 7075 T6 Aluminum Tube: 6061 T6 Aluminum Piston/Mounting System: 17-4 Stainless Steel, Heat Treated, Mount:Threads FEATURES: Interchangeable pistons Unobstructed sight picture Patented cam lock Mounting system Lifetime warranty MSRP: $849.95 (with piston)

Full auto ejector block. it appears as many parts as I took off to clean are Hebrew marked. The only thing I can tell that's not Israeli is the charging handle. It's a standard unit with an aluminum knob.

Barrel is marked 2-70 and the bore is extremely bright. I don't know how much it's been fired, but the gas system was really clean. A lot of the gun was covered in cosmoline. 

Finish is so-so on the UR and LR. The worst part of the rifle is the bipod coupler. I don't know if they all look like that, but it's so so.

I ran 75 rounds through the gun, and it ran like a top.

Sig Sauer, then Sig Arms, commenced setting new standards of excellence in handguns as early as the 1970s. By now, their innovative double action pistols are traditional classics. In 2004, Sig Arms launched their Revolution series descendants of John M. Browning’s Colt 1911, traditional pistols with excellence and innovation that we expect from the company. Recently, Sig has gone to using the conventional 1911 name. This is Sig’s 1911 XO variant, Sig’s counterpart to the Colt Government O series. The 1911 XO, writes the SIG SAUER® staff, is an all business full-size non-railed 1911 made for those that want a rugged shooting pistol. Outfitted with contrast sights and Ergo Grip™ XT extreme use grips, the 1911 XO features SIG’s durable Nitron finish designed for rugged use ... The all stainless steel frame and slide of the XO are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the new 1911 XO pistols contain only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. For safety the 1911 XO features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch and ships in a plastic gun case with cable lock. As far as other specs, manufacturer is Sig Arms of Exeter, NH. Caliber, of course, is .45 ACP, .45 Automatic. Construction is black Nitron finished stainless steel but with serrated face coated alloy trigger with overtravel adjustment. Trigger pull is 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. The 1911 XO has dovetailed black anodized sights in three white dot configuration, both of them dovetailed into the slide. Grip frame is checker serrated fore and aft; extended magazine release and main safety with beavertail grip safety and serrated top skeleton Commander style hammer. Barrel is 5 inch stainless. Weight empty is 41.6 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger guard to frame junction. Magazines with the photo specimen are factory 8 rounders, polished stainless body with slot style black polymer floor plates and blue steel cartridge followers. The followers, interestingly, bear a Check-Mate patent number. This pistol will accept any 1911 Government type magazine that fits a full size grip frame. Similarly equipped Colt Pistols command prices upwards of $1500 apiece in our area. We’re offering the Sig 1911 XO in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 749.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States.

873,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3061873,For Sale:  Huntertown Arms Kestrel 556,"Ellisville, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 20, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up until now, user serviceable centerfire rifle suppressors have been longer and heavier than their sealed counterparts. That's changed with the introduction of the Kestrel 5.56. Engineered from the ground up to maximize serviceability while not compromising on weight, length, or strength, the Kestrel 556 provides the most user friendly centerfire rifle suppressor in existence. Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, ease of maintenance, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Kestrel 5.56 has the features you are looking for.

Suppression

The Kestrel 5.56 had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.

Maintenance

Cleaning the Kestrel 5.56 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors. With the Kestrel 5.56 full user servicability is truely a reality. The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core. Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity

There are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime. Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part. We are huge proponents of stacked baffle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair. Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel will allow up to five times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.

Safety

The Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.

I got this through a trade not too long ago. It has about 300 rounds through it. I've made a couple upgrades to it and it functions perfectly, but I'd rather just sell it and get something smaller for concealed carry. Here are the things I've done to the gun:

- Polished Glock factory minus (-) connector (slightly lessens the trigger pull weight and smooths out the trigger a little)
- Grip Force Adapter
- American flag slide cover
- Gen 4 Slug Plug (plugs hole near mag well)

The gun also includes 1 factory 15 round magazine. When I received the gun through the trade, he couldn't locate the original case, but this never bothered me because I use soft cases to save space anyway. I also have a nice kydex holster by Armordillo Concealment that I can include for extra. Price is firm. Not really interested in trades sorry. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see any more pictures. Thanks for looking."

If you have this powder, then I will come to you if you are in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and if you live in MT then we'll work out a place there to meet.  First offer over $3200  gets it if you are buying.

I live in the Medford area but will leave to go to Portland for a day or two around the 29th /30th of May.  I have the rifle with me if you want it.  Also, if you email me I can send you more pictures of it. 

This is a top tier AR-10 made by LWRC International. It is chambered for the hard hitting .308 Winchester / 7.62 x 51mm NATO and is designed to be accurate to 1,000 yds or more. It is call the REPR, which stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle, and it is a sub-MOA rifle. It is NEW IN THE BOX. It sports a 20 inch barrel, the best gas piston in the industry (LWRCI is known for that), it has a non-reciprocating left side charging handle that means you don't have to break your cheek weld to chamber a round, which means you can keep your eye on the target, just reach out and pull the charging handle from your shooting position whether you are right or left handed, it works! I have tried it both ways.  The upper and lower receiver are all billet construction and has a Magpul PRS fully adjustable buttstock and a fully adjustable Geisselle 2 stage National Match trigger  (preset at 4 and 2 pounds) that can be adjusted down as low as 1.5 pounds on the front pull (initial pull on the trigger) and .5 (or maybe it's .7 pounds, but it's no more than that)  on the 2nd stage. Also, the rifle is balanced quite well with the Mag-pul PRS buttstock. Shotgun News did an article on this very rifle and got 0.3 MOA using Federal Gold Medal Match Ammunition and a Nightforce 5.5-22x56mm scope. This  new rifle comes with the original box and accessories, including a 20 round Mag-pul magazine. 

This is a rifle for those who demand top accuracy and reliability in a rifle designs to put accurate rounds down range out to 1,000 yards or more, and to be able to engage multiple targets in short order much quicker than with a bolt gun. 

This is a truly great rifle that won't let you down!
