The Tokarev pistol was originally designed and produced by the Russian military during WWII.  It has a 4.5"" barrel, windage-adjustable front and rear sights, slide and magazine releases, thumb safety, plastic grips, and two 9-round magazines.  The Tokarev, as well as its variants in 9mm, is renowned for its simplicity, power and accuracy.
This Tokarev M70A comes with the factory plastic fitted carrying case, cleaning brush, instruction manual and proof-house certificate.  The grip panels are a darker forest green, but I'm including another set of grips in black.  I'm also including a correct military holster, with shoulder strap and extra magazine pouch.
This Tokarev is new, test-fired only.  It's a lot of gun for the money, very reliable, perfect for home or auto protection.
You can own this piece of Russian military history for only $350 cash.  Reply to this ad so we can get together and let you inspect this Tokarev.  You won't be disappointed.  You must show me your Oklahoma Driver's License as proof of residency."

With readings displayed to the nearest 1/10th yard, DNAs third generation signal processing significantly increases dependability on soft, non reflective targets and provides superior ranging consistency regardless of target color. Smaller, and markedly brighter than previous range finders, the RX-1200i is less than 4 inches long and features multiple display-intensity settings. A newly redesigned Quick Set Menu uses on-screen prompts for exceptionally intuitive and easy use in the field. All RX-1200i Compact rangefinders are completely weatherproof and feature multicoated optics, selectable reticles, measurements in yards or meters, and fold-down rubber eyecups to accommodate users with or without eyeglasses. Pocket-sized and packed with features, Leupolds new RX-1200i with DNA makes all other range finders dim in comparison. : A major advancement for the RX platform is the significant improvement in light transmission and resolution. Leupold developed a platform to support an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display. Instead of looking through a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) as with traditional rangefinders, where the LCD film reduces image quality by stripping out light and reducing the resolution, the OLED display is reflected into the light path of the RX optical system leaving a crystal clear image. When in early morning or late evening low-light conditions, the 3x greater light transmission over competitive LCD rangefinders will give you that extra advantage. Features: – CR2 Lithium Battery– 6X Magnification– Choose from three different reticles:– Fully Multiple coated (RX)– Clicking Fast-Focus (RX)– Rugged Construction (RX-1000)– Scan Mode (RX)– Fold Down Rubber Eye cups– Line Of Sight Distance RX Specifications: – Actual Magnification: 6.00 x– Objective Clear Aperture: 22.00 mm– Max Range (Reflective): 1215.00 yd– Max Range (Trees): 900.00 yd– Max Range (Deer): 800.00 yd– Min Range: 6.00 yd– Min Range: 6.00 m– Linear Field of View (ft/1000 yd): 320.00 ft– Linear Field of View (m/1000 m): 98.00 m– Angular Field of View (degrees): N/A– Twilight Factor: 11.50– Weight: 7.80 oz– Weight: 221.00 g– Length: 3.80 in– Width: 1.40 in– Height: 3.00 in– Exit Pupil: 3.60 mm– Eye Relief: 17.00 mm"

It has some weaver 6 hole rings and butler creek caps as well as a scope level. This gun is extremely accurate. I reloaded for it with some 168 berger classic hunters and 41.5 gr of XBR at 2.810 inches long, I ran a bore snake through it 3 times, sighted it at 200 in 2 shots, shot a 2"" three shot group, shot a sub 4"" three shot group at 400 yards. Did a 3 shot group at 900 yards and it measured 5 7/8"" (5/8 moa). It also shoots remington 150 gr core lokt psp at 1-1.5 moa out to 400 yards. You will not find a more accurate gun/scope combination for less than this. Was planning on selling before I shot the reloads because I want a 6.5 creedmoor. Have been hesitant to sell it because it shoots so good . . . but I still want a creedmoor :) I have owned the gun for 3 months. I felt it was a great buy to use as a backup hunting gun for friends that come with me hunting. I have a video I did that shows the shooting. It was a lot of fun getting it all set up, but now I want to do it with another. I am selling for less than I am into this rifle. $650 which includes rifle ($330) scope ($299) rings ($35) Butler Creek Caps ($20) scope level ($20) and I have a few rounds of the reloads and the remington 150's if you want to come shoot it. I will pay the transfer fee locally or ship it to a FFL. Please call or text with any questions 208 821 504five"
