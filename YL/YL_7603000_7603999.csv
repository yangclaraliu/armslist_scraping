I got into the 6.5mm stuff this last summer (two custom 260AI barrels came in the mail this week).  So I'm selling this 243 to someone who is going to love this gun (and help me finance my NEW ""260 Ackley Improved"" customs this winter!). The scope in the pics stays, sorry.  I just put it on to test fire this build.  If you need a scope, I do have a decent, new 3x10 (x 50mm) I could sell with this gun for another $120 (what I paid for it) and I'd mount it and bore site it for that.  But that scope is a touch heavy and I expect whoever buys this gun might want to put some REAL good glass on it-- since it can shoot well out there if you can do your part.  This gun looks like new (and except for the receiver it basically is).  With the very slightest of wear (only found around the receiver), your average buyer would see this gun in the ""custom"" section of the gun store and not know it wasn't new without looking very hard at it.  I've seen prices come down some (finally) and so I'm pricing this right for what is is.  Go look-up some NEW Savage Model 10 guns to see what I mean- the good stuff starts at $900 and up new (and customs like this can go for more).So there is time to get it ready for deer season here if you get it scoped up and out to the range.  My scope or yours- this rifle will be a keeper for someone who wants a smooth, accurate, (darn good looking)... higher-end rifle with the custom tweaks I've listed (which you can not get under $1k at a better gun store)."

All local sales will be done at an FFL, as per legal restrictions. Do not ask if the gun is still available, you're reading this because the gun is still avaiable. Regarding trades, my interests are pretty narrow, but go ahead and offer. Please don't ask what I'm into, just send a list of what you have and I'll let you know. Cash sale is preferred. Thanks."
