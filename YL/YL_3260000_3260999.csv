Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™, “Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs."

The Coonan Classic .357 features a linkless barrel in a 1911 frame. That means it field strips more like a modern auto-pistol than like a 1911. The barrel still comes out the front like a standard 1911, with the front barrel bushing that turns so you can slide the barrel out, but the link you have to line up when you reassemble the gun is not there. This is a pure recoil operated gun, like a standard 1911

ALG Defense Trigger (QMS Trigger) 
The ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) trigger is an enhanced Mil-Spec type AR-15 trigger. The QMS is very similar to Mil-Spec units in pull weight, but the honed sear surfaces and polishing result in a smoother than standard pull. The honing of the sear surfaces does not change the geometry of the stock trigger, so the high reliability of the Mil-Spec trigger is maintained. The pull weight is 6.5 pounds, which falls within the Military specifications of 5.5 to 9.0 pounds.

The GAP Enterprises Finger Rest Extension's profile is one-half-inch slimmer than “grip extensions”.  The Glock’s ability to be concealed is retained as originally designed. Additionally, when the Finger Rest Extension equipped weapon is much easier to draw because the plate gives one a natural hook to help to grip the pistol.

It's a straight pull Swiss k1911 similar to the K31 in design, but slightly older.  The rifle was most likely sporterized by Golden State Firearms in the 1960's and rechambered to .308 at the same time.  Makes a good shooter or cheap hunting rifle, it's drilled and tapped for a scope mount that can be found online for these rifles.  

I had it checked out by TJ's Gunsmithing in Aurora after I bought it to be sure that this older rifle was still in good condition, and they said it's good to go.  

I bought a Remington 700 to hunt with, and just don't shoot this enough to justify keeping it around.  

Price is firm, not interested in trades.  Because this rifle qualifies as a Curio & Relic (anything over 50 years old does), it does not require a Colorado background check to transfer.  Cash and Carry to the first person to come pick it up.  Must be over 18 and able to meet at or near my place, can't deliver.  

If interested shoot me an email with a time and date that you would like to stop by to see, as well as a phone number so that I can call you back and confirm.  

If the add is still up, I still have the rifle.  Emails asking if it is still available will be ignored."

About 2 foot longer than a Suburban. This 2005 Hummer is the SUT with the pick up style back with mid gate similar to an Avalanche. It was stretched about 60 inches giving it a third row of seating along the side and a bar with refrigerator and storage on the other. This vehicle is the only Corporate length Hummer stretch SUT I have ever seen or can even find on google image search. The 4x4 system works perfectly and unlike most of the monster stretch hummer sit has not been disconnected. It has a full towing setup with electronic trailer braking controls. 

It does not have electric dividers as this was designed to be a personal family transport vehicle. It would make an awesome company advertising truck or a killer rig for a boat hauler or landscape crew vehicle. Or like a Soccer Mom / Dad car. I have used this vehicle and never had anything as much fun to drive. It handles easy, looks remarkable, mad parks almost as easy as a standard Suburban would. 

This vehicle has been built to last with only the finest in stamped body panels unlike some fiberglass or sheet metal poor quality limo extension panels. Hummer interior designed to seat 7/8 like the not SUT HUMMER DOES EXCEPT HAS MIDGATE DROP BACK. 

Check eBay and online and see stretch bummers with 100000 miles are selling from 45/70k and this one is an approx 70k miles truck and I am asking $39,900 for it. I have other cars listed for sale to try and make room for some incoming vehicles. If other cars sell first I will keep this one for myself.  VERY COLLECTIBLE DUE TO RARETY AND bummers no longer made.

About 2 foot longer than a Suburban. This 2005 Hummer is the SUT with the pick up style back with mid gate similar to an Avalanche. It was stretched about 60 inches giving it a third row of seating along the side and a bar with refrigerator and storage on the other. This vehicle is the only Corporate length Hummer stretch SUT I have ever seen or can even find on google image search. The 4x4 system works perfectly and unlike most of the monster stretch hummer sit has not been disconnected. It has a full towing setup with electronic trailer braking controls. 

It does not have electric dividers as this was designed to be a personal family transport vehicle. It would make an awesome company advertising truck or a killer rig for a boat hauler or landscape crew vehicle. Or like a Soccer Mom / Dad car. I have used this vehicle and never had anything as much fun to drive. It handles easy, looks remarkable, mad parks almost as easy as a standard Suburban would. 

This vehicle has been built to last with only the finest in stamped body panels unlike some fiberglass or sheet metal poor quality limo extension panels. Hummer interior designed to seat 7/8 like the not SUT HUMMER DOES EXCEPT HAS MIDGATE DROP BACK. 

Check eBay and online and see stretch bummers with 100000 miles are selling from 45/70k and this one is an approx 70k miles truck and I am asking $39,900 for it. I have other cars listed for sale to try and make room for some incoming vehicles. If other cars sell first I will keep this one for myself. VERY COLLECTIBLE DUE TO RARETY AND bummers no longer made. 
PLEASE NOTE I AM NOT A DEALER. I AM A COLLECTOR. I DO NOT BUY TO RESELL. I BUY BECAUSE I WANT IT AND OCCASIONALLY I RUN OUT OF STORAGE ROOM AND HAVE TO PART WITH A FEW NEW SPACES. NOBODY BETTER TO BUY FROM THAN SOMEONE WHO LOVED IT ENOUGH TO BUY IT FOR THEMSELVES.

Factory Part # PC9107LP The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional.

Converted from 7.65x53 to 7.92x57 (8 mm mauser) in 1935 in Ankara.  This conversion required cutting a notch in the receiver for the longer cartridge and cutting a notch on the side for use of stripper clips.  Most markings were scrubbed during the conversion but this one retains the Turkish script and original date of manufacture 1312 on the Islam calendar or 1894 by ours.  I also am including the bayonet with the matching Turkish script and shipping for $250 or best offer.  This is an antique so no FFL transfer is required.

It has a TRW barrel and bolt and many other GI parts.  The serial number puts it's DOB somewhere around 2001, so they still had reasonable stockpiles of GI parts back then.  The stock and handguard are USGI fiberglass that have been stripped, primed, and given a low key Krylon Camo paint job.  It's held up well, but it's not pristine anymore. It doesn't really look ""camo,"" but it disappears in the woods. 

The rifle has had around 4500 rounds through it, but never very fast.  Most of them were shot at a piece of steel armor plate at 250 yards. Lots of good shooting left in this barrel.  At this price, the rifle will come with 5 20 round mags and enough SA surplus ammo to fill them.  

Additional mags and ammo available to the buyer.  Also have some fair to poor wood stocks and some spare parts available separately.

Here are the specs :
The Hornady Custom Grade New Dimension 2-Die Set is a great die set for the avid reloader. This die set includes a Custom Grade New Dimension (CGND) Full Length Sizer Die and a CGND Seating Die. The Full Length Sizer Die features a Zip Spindle, with a series of light threads cut on the spindle and spindle collet. This eliminates spindle slippage, and makes tightening the spindle lock a breeze when making adjustments. The floating bullet alignment sleeve and stem in the CGND Seating Die improve bullet seating and accuracy by pre-aligning the bullet and case before seating. The seating die also applies a roll crimp to secure the bullet in the case. The CGND die set comes packaged in a plastic storage box, and includes two Sure-Loc rings. Shellholder is sold separately. Comes with lifetime warranty."

We picked up a couple of AK pattern rifles last year and with two babies, full time school and work, we haven't even had time to go shoot them.  The more expensive of the two was the M+M Company M10-762, an awesome rifle of which I own another from the same company and which I've shot quite a bit, and never once had a failure.  They are very well built rifles and accurized from the factory, out of the box I was hitting 6"" steel plates at 100yards in the standing shooter position with no problem.  Like I said we haven't taken either of the two new rifles we bought from last year before the CA law change (reason for purchase) out shooting yet, SO THIS RIFLE IS BRAND NEW CONDITION, NEVER FIRED!!! :)   I guess it's not so hard to buy rifles in CA now though, rifles are just treated like handguns now, so you have the whole safety cert to pay for at your dealer (of course that is if you don't have one already).  The only probs we still have out here in CA are the availability of rifles in the legal CA pattern.  This AK has the mag-release lock as required here in CA, and was shipped to Santa Cruz Armory in Ben Lomond, CA just last year where we purchased it.  So, you're good to go.  The lock is easily removed with a couple of allen-wrenches if you were to ever move out of state, and of course the rifle accepts regular 30rnd AK mags.

Here's a couple of links with info on the rifle.  One to the company website and and another to a rather lengthy third party review:

http://mm-industries.com/m10-specs/

http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/10/joe-grine/gun-review-mm-m10-762-rifle/

We're asking $650, a total steal for this rifle.  The rifle will come with one Tapco 10/30 mag (is a CA legal 10rnd mag that is the size of a 30rnd'r as is blocked off inside).

This rifle is truly a blast; you can shoot it all day and it just stays fun to shoot from dawn to dusk. The 22 mag has plenty of zip to shoot targets at considerable distance, and you can take any small game with it. Prairie Dogs are a hoot to go after, and the lever action enables you to get several shots off before the dogs know you're shooting. You can even take a deer with this rifle, you just need good shot placement, which the Henry gives you without any problem probably out to 100 yards max. 
You can also learn to speed shoot this rifle; by working the lever and trigger together, you can shoot this rifle almost as fast as an AR-15. It takes considerable practice to get the skill, but once you have it you have something to show off that will delight and surprise others.
This Henry has seen only very light use, and is in excellent condition. It has one little scrape on the top of the receiver that is easily fixed with a little bluing; otherwise, it's perfect.
They go for $500 new, and about $460 discounted.
I'm selling this one for $400 firm. If you want it, please text me on my cell at REDACTED. Please, no calls unless you are darned sure you're coming my way to pay cash and you don't have text. No offers; the price is firm: come with $400 cash or don't contact me.

Made at Jianshe Arsenal, The serial # 129XXX indicates late 50's manufacture - possibly 1957 but unsure, so FFL required. I bought two of these, and paid a hand select fee to get all matching numbers, which this one has. It has the blade bayonet and a cleaning rod and it also comes with a free 30 day supply of cosmoline ! The one I'm keeping cleaned up very nicely and had a very good bore, and I believe this one will be the same. Any discoloration in the photos is not rust, but cosmoline. The wood has no splits or cracks, and from what I can see under the goo, it should finish up quite nicely. A little TLC on your part will get you a nice SKS at a very reasonable price. $350.00+ $15.00 shipping to your FFL. REDACTED or 3855HL(at)gmail(dot)com for questions, info, or more pics."

Here is some info in the listing used by the party from whom I had purchased the rifle:

Years of production are 1956, 1958, or 1959, we will honor requests as best possible. Here is an eminently serviceable specimen of the Chinese type 56 infantry rifle chambered in 7.62x39 caliber, that we call the SKS. Manufacturer was Jianshe Arsenal in the People’s Republic of China, on Russian milling equipment and under Russian supervision. From its number 2 prefix onto a 400000 range serial number, it was manufactured in 1958, when the ARVN Army mobilized its commando training school at Nha Trang. Importer is Century Arms International, so marked on the right side of the barrel. Type, of course, is gas operated semi-automatic rifle. Construction is milled blue steel barrel, receiver and parts; and Asian Hardwood stock. Barrel is standard 20 inch, calibrated military rear sight and elevation adjustable front sight, with drift capability for windage – on the well hooded front sight. Bayonet is period correct blade type. Surface detractions are moderate to extensive on this specimen. It shows some substantial original bluing, but perhaps majority gun metal gray. Buttstock has extensive scouring and dinging, but no outright cracks. Trigger group, magazine, bolt, cover, and receiver serial numbers are all matching. Stock cartouches match as well, so this rifle is entirely original. We rate this type 56 as Good, 60 percent vicinity by our estimate."

It comes with XS Big Dot Sights (installed) and I also have the old Meprolight Night Sights too. The big dots are brand new (1 month old, receipt to prove) and are bright and shiny. The Mepros are dim, but still glow. The gun has been carried and does show wear. Nothing terrible, but it isn't perfect on the slide. But hey, it's a Glock.

What just sits in your safe?

This is Para Ordnance G.I. Expert that was customized to my tastes a few years ago. Do not be fooled by the movie prop appearance. The compensator on the front is fully functional, all the aftermarket hardware is from Wilson combat and the pistol is quite accurate. The compensator (in theory- I've never tested this) Would keep the action locked up a split second longer and allow the gun to run hotter loads without beating up the frame. 

I was speaking to a former gun smith the other day and he liked the trigger, although the set screw does need to be replace. He said that he'd value the pistol around 700-750 bucks. That sounds about right since the G.I. Experts are going for about 650 stock. Now with this I am also including the hard case, three magazines, the guns original hardware, a mag pouch and holster, 50ish rounds of ball point, and possibly RCBS reloading dies as well as 50 rounds of unfired brass (depending on the deal).  


I'm more interested in a trade than cash; I'll list a few things I had interest in:

-Magnum Revolvers 
-Glock 20
-AR-15s - I know this would only be worth a very entry level one
-Kel-Tec Sub 2000 that accepts Glock mags 
-.30-.30 lever gun+....?
-I would conciser a pair of lower dollar guns- like a 20 gauge Mossberg and a Revolver 

The point is, I haven't shot this weapon in over a year. I would like it to go to someone who will use and enjoy it safely. So just shoot me an offer, it worst I'll just say ""no thank you"".

typical heavy double action trigger ,but very smooth.

single action trigger pull is very smooth with a very crisp break.
it is better than any of my stock cz triggers that I have had

it is a pre 88. 

serial number starts with h 03 

I believe it is a first year model, and is a collector item among tanfoglio enthusiast.

this pistol appears to me to be possibly unfired after it left the factory.
if interested you will be able to inspect it,and I believe you will agree with this assessment.
it has no wear that I can see on the extractor. it also show no wear on the barrel ramp.
also the recoil spring guide shows virtually no wear

the pistol is in my opinion to be 99 percent. I am rating it that high because it shows only wear from mayby the factory test shooting. and racking the slide and cleaning over the years.

the machining on this pistol is as good or better than most newer pistols being manufactured today. 
I am asking 450.00  for it
sorry no  trades

The MK 116 is a very nice piston driven system chambered in .223 Wylde and using the PWS proprietary piston design. This rifle has a 16"" barrel, a 13.5"" PWS keymod rail system, and the rifle weighs less than 7 lbs. As noted in the title, one of the key upgrades is the Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced two stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and then a crisp 1 lb. second stage. In addition to the trigger upgrade, I've added 45 degree rapid transition backup sights, a competition muzzle brake/compensator that significantly reduces muzzle rise and allows the shooter to take full advantage of the trigger for accurate rapid fire and follow-on shooting, and a 1-5x tactical scope and offset mount. 

I'm the original owner of this rifle, which was purchased in November of last year. I've shot the rifle a few times but it has had no abuse and I estimate the number of rounds fired would be no more than 500 rounds. In addition to the items discussed above, a Drago rifle case is also included with your purchase.

Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for looking."

One such improvement is a brand new 16"" 1:7 twist DRD hammer forged chrome lined barrel that I had installed in place of the original barrel in early June (poor timing on my part but at the time I had no plans to move abroad). In any event, the rifle has been taken to the range twice since installing this new barrel with roughly 100-200 rounds having been fired. I had originally purchased the rifle in October of 2013. A hard case is also included with the purchase of this rifle.

Other upgrades include the Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul Pro Sights, a Fortis compensator/muzzle brake, and a Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced Flat two-stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and a crisp 1.5 lb. second stage (Note that the Geissele trigger is not pictured as it was just installed and the trigger shown in the pictures is a Timney). The rifle originally came with a shorter 13"" rail, but I had this replaced with a new MI Gen 2 quad rail when the new barrel was recently installed. In addition to these upgrades that greatly improve the function, accuracy, and aesthetic of the rifle, a Weaver 1-5x tactical scope with offset mount and a Sight Docter mini red-dot sight is also included. Another nice feature is the upgraded BCG which is a Titanium Boron (TiN) Bolt Carrier Group. You can see the gold coloring of this BCG in the photos and in addition to improving the look, this bcg is very tough due to this coating, quite easy to clean and maintain, and functions flawlessly. 

As I'm preparing to move abroad where I will not have any use for my weapons, I'm selling two rifles, including this one, and one 1911 handgun. This rifle had originally sold for just over $1600 when I purchased it last fall and the value of the aforementioned upgrades has been well over $1,000. Any offer below ask will require no optic and a JP trigger.  I'm really not willing to move much on price but will entertain any offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!"

I purchased this complete rifle 4 years ago from Sacramento Black Rifle for $1500. I’ve put less than 1K rounds through it and have upgraded several components including the trigger components so it is a mere 5lb pull with no creep, breaks very crisp! I’ve also added the FDE Eotech 512 and changed out the Spike’s trigger guard and grip as well as fake Spike’s silencer and T2 heavy buffer. This is not a home built AR15, this was a special order and limited edition model directly from Spike’s Tactical. The color of the upper and lower receiver is a really cool dark bronze from Spike's directly, not FDE. Includes Magpul CTR stock, Magpul ASAP sling plate, Magpul B.A.D. lever, Magpul AFG, Magpul logo custom stippled 10/20 PMAG blocked to 10 rds with ranger plate and magazine eject button installed. It also has a Raddlock and Yankee Hill Machine EZ Take-down pins. It also has a Rainer Arms Ambidextrous Raptor charging handle and KNS Anti rotation trigger and hammer pins. Gun is in excellent condition with very minor signs of wear.

Greetings!

Up for a sale is my beautiful Colt CR6724.  This National Match rifle is a sub-MOA rifle chambered in .223/5.56mm.  It's made for long range target shooting and/or for varmints.  77gr payloads have good impact at 800yds and are frighteningly accurate.  I mean SCARY accurate.  100yd groups of Federal range ammo are considerable less than 1"".

* Highly regarded Colt 2-stage trigger with blue springs (never pulled out like some)
* Full Floating Fore-end
* Magpul PRS butt stock

I'm particularly fussy and this rifle is in NEW condition.  I've put less than 200 rounds downrange with it, and you can tell by looking.   Asking $1250 + the ride to your FFL.   Will consider a trade deal for an M1A or M14.
