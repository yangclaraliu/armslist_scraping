Other than that I would rate this rifle at about 95-96% original condition. Has original finish on both the stock and metal. Barrel blue is near perfect with only one small spot of wear on the bottom of the barrel where it looks like it rested in a gun rack in a safe. The wood, other than having a recoil pad installed, is in excellent shape with crisp sharp checkering and nice original finish. It has a few light surface scuffs and scratches but noting major. If this rifle hadn't been fitted with a recoil pad it would be a real home run. If you have been looking for a transitional model 70 in 30-06 it would be hard to beat this one."
