81,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7551081,For Sale:  Beautifull .22 short Smooth Bore  Parlor Rifle,"Skagit, Mount Vernon, Washington",$ 160,"Listed On: Monday, May 7, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have the really nice example of an antique Flobert parlor or gallery gun in very nice, working condition. It has a nice walnut stock, 23"" octagon barrel, brass bead front and buckhorn leaf rear sight. The gun functions as it should, and is fun to shoot! I would recommend that you only shoot low-pressure ""CB"" shorts in it, as even these rounds probably exceed the original black powder proofs for that rifle. That being said, the barrel is quite thick with no flaws that I can see. What makes this rifle unique is the firing design. Basically the rear of the ""bolt"" that closes over the round has the firing pin cast in it, and it fires the round when it closes (when the trigger is pulled). It's very interesting.   At short distances (indoor shooting ranges, etc) it is very accurate.  .22 Shotshells can also be fired from it with a nice pattern (like a shotgun, NOT like a rifle, where all the shot is thrown to the outside of the pattern).It's been a great little keepsake, but now it's time to move it to someone else who can cherish it. I live near Mt Vernon, Burlington, Sedro-Woolley, and can meet you near I-5. This gun was made prior to 1898, so it can be sold direct without any transfer. I will need to see ID though. Sorry, but I'm not really interested in any trades (never hurts to ask though!), and the price is firm.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

It is chambered for 5 shots of .38 S&W. The ejection works as it should, upon opening the action, and the gun retains about 75% of its Original Nickel Finish. It has Nice Original Grips as well.  I have a Schofield in .45 Russian, and this looks like a smaller version (minus the trigger guard of course!) It's been a great little keepsake, but now it's time to move it to someone else who can cherish it. I live near Mt Vernon, Burlington, Sedro-Woolley, and can meet you near I-5. This gun was made prior to 1898, so it can be sold direct without any transfer. I will need to see ID though. Sorry, but I'm not really interested in any trades (never hurts to ask though!), and the price is firm.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

This large training aid was originally used by the military to teach the inner workings of the normal sized M1 Garand to new recruits. This is not a firing model and cannot be converted to fire ammunition. It measures 7ft. 2.5 in long and has a ""US"" Navy marking on the left side of the receiver. A brass plate with the manufacturer's name ""National"" is mounted inside the rifle. The operating rod, spring, bolt, and follower assembly all function just like the real version of the rifle when the action is cycled. The gas cylinder lock on the end of the barrel is removeable. There are several cutaway sections in the rifle to show how different parts operate. There is wear on the stock, which is also removeable and is held in place by three screws. The rifle is missing the trigger assembly, which is common with a military item of this age. These cutaway rifles are rare and don't come up for sale very often. This would make a great addition to anyone's military collection, man cave, or gun shop. It always draws a crowd and complete versions of these training rifles typically sell for around $1,500.00. I'm asking $400.00 OBO for the rifle as is. I can e-mail any additional pictures if needed. Thanks"

It is practically a must-have for any freedom-loving, bacon-eating Patriot so pounce on this while you can. I've also got some extras included that give this classic battle rifle a modern-day facelift. They are as follows:•Schuster DCM Adjustable Gas Plug (Allows you to shoot the ""hotter"" modern commercial 30.06 ammo as opposed to being restricted to standard M2 Ball.)*Do your research and you'll find that firing normal commercial ammo without an aftermarket gas plug can cause damage to the receiver and stock due to excessive velocity of the operating rod**The factory gas plug will be included as well.*•Kensight Trijicon Front Sight Post w/ Tritium Insert*The factory front sight post will be included as well.*•Champion Black Synthetic Stock Set (Ordered and installed after I purchased the rifle in order to prevent unnecessary damage to the original wood furniture.) *The factory wooden furniture will be included*•Amega Ranges M1 Garand Scout Picatinny Rail (Replaces the top portion of the stock/dust cover and allows for the mounting of optics/lights/etc. just like a normal Picatinny rail system.)•USGI Correct M1907 Leather Sling •USGI Correct Cleaning Kit (Unused, fits in the butt stock of the rifle.)•USGI Correct USMC-Issue En-Bloc Clip Bandolier •USGI Correct USMC-Issue Rifle Bag•15 Eight-Round En-Bloc Clips•60 Rounds of 30.06 Hornady Superformance 150 Grain ELD AmmoAll-in-all, this setup allows you to have either an entirely ""correct"" WWII M1 Garand or a modern-day versatile & accurate ""battle rifle"".I am asking $1800 OBO for the entire package. I will not part anything out; I'm not hurting for cash so it either all goes or all of it stays with me. I may be interested in trades or trades + cash on your end but please do not come to me with lowball offers or anything other than firearms (I really don't want your power tools or golf carts). I am located in Denton and will meet anywhere in the DFW area. Buyer must present valid ID/LTC and sign a Bill of Sale. Please text REDACTED for fastest response.

The shotgun's receiver and barrel are in good shape, with only minor signs of rusting, and no signs of pitting. There are only a small handful of shallow nicks and scrapes throughout the rest of the wood stock, as well as the ribbed wood forearm/pump-action. This shotgun features a safety switch set into the rear of the shotgun's trigger assembly. This is a nice, older shotgun, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection.
