If you would like to sub out any of the following for the Strother-branded sight, I will do so at no charge:  ""IQ"" brand 4-pin sight, scope mount (picatinney) which mounts on the draw-loc arm for mounting a traditional scope, or a picatinney rail which goes on the riser in place of a regular front sight, which allows you to mount any red dot sight or similar that you want.So, ready to shoot. Note that I will install the sight and re-install the anti-dry-fire device for you if you want; your choice as to each one. If you put your fletching *WAY* back on the arrow, or use FOBs, you will want to just leave the anti-dry-fire device off - but it will still be shipped. Note that if you're not familiar with the large advantages of Hickory Creek Draw-Loc-based vertical crossbows over others, they:-Let you draw manually and very quickly, without any cocking device, and de-cock without having to shoot an arrow or have the weight and bulk of a crank mechanism. This allows you to hunt on the move, going quickly between your serial ambush spots / stands.  [Note that I know MT does not allow Xbows for hunting; I moved here from a state which does, 2 years ago].-Give you just about the same amount of velocity / energy as a much-higher draw weight traditional crossbow, due to greatly-increased powerstroke and efficiency. For example, this XS Rush has a 342 IBO with a very long powerstroke and efficient cams, so these 80 lb limbs really sling 'em. The 80% let off and H.C. trigger design allows a very nice trigger pull too.-Allow you to stalk hunt more easily and lean left or right up against a tree for stability for a shot, which horizontal limbs impede.Of course, if you're pretty stout, you can also use this Strother 80 as a regular manual bow.  It's got a 30"" draw length in case you want to do that.I have over $1,100 into this rig. Your price is $810 FTF or $845 SHIPPED. Shipping is FedEx, insured (signature required vs. not required is up to you). If you live east of the Mississippi, and/or south of the Mason-Dixon, add $10 since FedEx is going to charge me more.Also please note that I have been buying, selling, and trading on the honor system for about 22 years without problems on various sites including ArcheryTalk, Thefiringline, Thehighroad, rimfirecentral, gunbroker, gunsamerica, ebay, Armslist, graybeardoutdoors, and several others.Thanks for looking. Text or call REDACTED to buy -  I can text more and better pics.IMPORTANT EDIT:  i just realized I made a huge mistake in taking the pictures and then also in my descriptions since I unthinkingly made the descriptions from the pictures. I put the wrong Draw-Loc arm on the wrong bow on my two listings here today, as follows. --The BULLPUP Draw-Loc arm, though pictured on this Strother rig, actually goes with the other one for sale - the Hickory Creek made rig.--Conversely, the REGULAR (non-bullpup) Draw-Loc arm, though pictured on the other one listed for sale in this forum., actually goes with this Strother rig.The draw lengths of each bow are specific to the arms, so they cannot be switched. This also makes sense as the other Hickory Creek inline rig is for holding in your hands, shooting free hand, stalking and such (well facilitated by the bullpup arm); whereas this Strother rig is larger and meant to be used (at least as far as how I used it) with a tripod supporting the rig via the stabilizer - the draw length is too long on that rig to comfortably reach the handle on the front riser anyway, so I shoot it with the bow suspended on a tripod, holding only the draw loc handle, with no hand at all on the bow riser. The prices listed are still correct, taking all into account. Sorry for all the confusion. I will add the new, corrected pictures later tonight as soon as I get a chance."

It is reminiscent of the SIG-Sauer slides, but with a very narrow line, considering that its guide is on the inside of the frame.

Ready for anything. Kimber Tactical pistols have the performance-enhancing features demanded by law enforcement professionals. Available in a range of configurations, they cover everything from tactical response to concealed carry.
Meprolight night sights are standard. Front strap and trigger guard checkering are standard. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety are standard. Kimber Tactical pistols are no-compromise, purpose-built pistols that leave nothing out, and Kimber quality brings it all together in five different platforms. Three full-size versions exceed all traditional and tactical law enforcement requirements. Compact models cover everything else. Like all Kimber pistols, each has rounded and blended edges to prevent snagging, along with match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. No other pistol design equals the 1911 for true tactical performance.

Really fun to shoot but I've found I've not got the time to shoot it as much as I'd like. Shoots 22LR so you can spend all day at the range shooting for only a few bucks of ammo. Bought new less than 1 year ago from a dealer. Every time I've taken it to the range, I clean it promptly afterwards and keep it lightly oiled and in a case. Comes with the case, lock & keys, and 2 clips. Works great, no hangfires. Have had some stove-piping occur, but I think that has more to do with the ammo than the gun itself. I've had a Ruger shoot the same ammo but stove-piped almost once a clip. Hadn't changed the ammo I used on this (Federal bulk) but noticed very infrequent stove-piping.Actual picture. Beautiful handgun. Love the trigger pull, weight, and grip. You will enjoy shooting this, guaranteed.Price negotiable but I think I've set a very reasonable price, and have already dropped it. If you buy this gun used at a gun store you're still looking at just over $300. If I try to sell it at the gun store I'll get maybe $100, so the price point is a win for you & me.Serious inquiries only in the Jacksonville area. If you would like to buy, you will need to bring exact cash- no checks or Paypal or bitcoin or anything else. You must also bring a copy of your unexpired driver's license and unexpired personal carry license. If you don't bring a photocopy, I will take a picture with my phone. I will also ensure to you that you see that the serial numbers on the case and the gun match correctly. You & I will sign identical copies of a letter drafted as a bill of sale. All this is to protect both of us in the deal. No photocopy of driver's licence or you won't let me take a picture for record keeping, or you don't have a conceal carry license, deal's off."

It has no serial number, so it was manufactured sometime before the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968. The rifle is tube-fed and fires Shorts, Longs, and Long Rifle cartridges. It's in beautiful condition; I would rate it at 95%. The bore and mechanicals are perfect. The checkered walnut stock and fore-end have a few very minor nicks, but there are no chips, gouges, or cracks. The buttplate and grip cap are accented with a white spacer. The bluing is solid, with no fading, scratches, or rust. The gun has front and rear factory sling swivels. The receiver is grooved for a scope, it you choose to mount one. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage (by drifting it) and elevation (via an elevator and an adjustable rear sight blade). As far as I know, the gun is all-original. Not too many of these around, especially in this condition. Asking $325 shipped to your FFL. Paypal is preferred. No trades. Any questions, please ask. Thanks."
