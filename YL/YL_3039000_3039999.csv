I have three of these and they all are the same rifle. They will have had one round fired through them only to test fit and function and will come with spent casing. Ive had these parts for awhile and recently decided to assemble them and sell in order to fund some other projects. Dont bother asking what brand the upper and whatnot is because honestly ive had them stored so long I cant remember. Theyre all milspec except stocks so Interchangeability is not a problem. Same gun on the shelf in the every-day gun shop. Nothing special and nothing cheaply made or junk by any means. Just a few good rifles that should last a very long time. Two of them do have consecutive serial numbers. Something thats desired by some and doesnt matter to others. Just kind of neat having one that was made directly after another I guess. All three are optic ready meaning they have no iron sights on them currently. The price for each is $675 to be paid in cash only. That is a firm price. Non negotiable. Dont bother making any other offer. I do have another build in progress with a mag tactical 35% lighter and reinforced lower receiver and stainless 16"" spiral fluted barrel that im not sure ill let go or not. PLEASE TEXT.

2013 Upgrades for TRG22/42

Recoil Pad
 2013 upgrade introduces an improved recoil pad. Our proprietary pad is a combination of a new material and construction which significantly reduces felt recoil. The new recoil pad provides better recoil management and adds to the comfort allowing extended sessions at the range, even with the heavier calibers.

Bolt Release
 Newly constructed bolt release adds to the overall ruggedness of the TRG platform. Care-free and reliable operation is guaranteed even when extreme force is applied on the bolt release while cycling the bolt. The new bolt release is featured in all TRG 22/42 configurations

Trigger Mechanism and Bolt Handle
 New fully adjustable two stage trigger mechanism featuring newly designed and ergonomically positioned and ambidextrous safety lever allowing easier access and use. Trigger guard is now milled from high grade aluminum, providing ruggedness and more positive magazine attachment. Bolt handle and it's attachment to the bolt body has been redesigned to withstand rough handling more than ever before. And as usual, the new trigger mechanism as well as all other 2013 upgrades are compatible with all TRG 21/41 and TRG 22/42 versions."

2013 Upgrades for TRG22/42

Recoil Pad
2013 upgrade introduces an improved recoil pad. Our proprietary pad is a combination of a new material and construction which significantly reduces felt recoil. The new recoil pad provides better recoil management and adds to the comfort allowing extended sessions at the range, even with the heavier calibers.

Bolt Release
Newly constructed bolt release adds to the overall ruggedness of the TRG platform. Care-free and reliable operation is guaranteed even when extreme force is applied on the bolt release while cycling the bolt. The new bolt release is featured in all TRG 22/42 configurations

Trigger Mechanism and Bolt Handle
New fully adjustable two stage trigger mechanism featuring newly designed and ergonomically positioned and ambidextrous safety lever allowing easier access and use. Trigger guard is now milled from high grade aluminum, providing ruggedness and more positive magazine attachment. Bolt handle and it's attachment to the bolt body has been redesigned to withstand rough handling more than ever before. And as usual, the new trigger mechanism as well as all other 2013 upgrades are compatible with all TRG 21/41 and TRG 22/42 versions."

Comes with all factory accessories, 3 mags, and Trijicon RMR02 (also comes with its box). 

Due to the hardness of the Glock slide, there was some bluing that occurred as a result of heating up during the milling process. This does not affect functionality in any way, shape, or form. I can refer you to a reputable painter who does excellent cerakote work, or I can have the slide painted the color or your choice for an additional 80 dollars. Or just leave it as-is, and shoot the heck out of it!

For sale: Stoeger 12 ga. Over/Under 12 ga. Shotgun. Bought this gun about 7 years ago for bird hunting but no longer use/need it since I purchased a Remington 870. Firearm has less than 100 shells through it. At this point it takes up space. Sent it back for warranty repairs 5 years ago- have the slip from Benelli USA and have had no issues since. It was having issues with the lockup (it is a takedown model) when firing. Again, zero issues since. This model has a manual ejector and auto safety that engages between each shot. I'm told this can be fixed easily. It has a 3"" chamber and measures 26"" total. The original box, packaging, action lock, choke key and paperwork is all present and part of the deal. The shotgun comes only with the choke the firearm originally came with (this is an economy model). Price is $200 firm no trades. Sale must go through FFL dealer of my choice (I have one I do regular business with). Upon speaking with my FFL, the fees on their end is $20 ($10 for the background check and $10 for their services) so the total would be $220 for everything. Once money is handed to me, I will transfer the weapon to my FFL- if you fail the background check your money will not be returned until firearm is back in my possession. If interested, contact me so we can hammer out the details."

 2013 Upgrades for TRG22/42

Recoil Pad
 2013 upgrade introduces an improved recoil pad. Our proprietary pad is a combination of a new material and construction which significantly reduces felt recoil. The new recoil pad provides better recoil management and adds to the comfort allowing extended sessions at the range, even with the heavier calibers.

Bolt Release
Newly constructed bolt release adds to the overall ruggedness of the TRG platform. Care-free and reliable operation is guaranteed even when extreme force is applied on the bolt release while cycling the bolt. The new bolt release is featured in all TRG 22/42 configurations

Trigger Mechanism and Bolt Handle
 New fully adjustable two stage trigger mechanism featuring newly designed and ergonomically positioned and ambidextrous safety lever allowing easier access and use. Trigger guard is now milled from high grade aluminum, providing ruggedness and more positive magazine attachment. Bolt handle and it's attachment to the bolt body has been redesigned to withstand rough handling more than ever before. And as usual, the new trigger mechanism as well as all other 2013 upgrades are compatible with all TRG 21/41 and TRG 22/42 versions."

Round Count is UNDER 50
FULLY CONVERTED
Comes with all of the ORIGINAL PARTS PLUS LOTS OF EXTRAS; I am a gunsmith and have 12 years of experience in that position as well as working as an Armorer for a local PD.  
I purchased three of these rifles approximately 3 years ago from FIME Group in Las Vegas for the cost of $1000 per rifle. At that time these guns were just the base rifles. First, I stripped each rifle and used a file on each of the receivers and took off just a little bit of metal, here and there, which tightened the tolerances. Then I removed the gas tubes and built ones slightly smaller in diameter and slightly shorter. This allows for better bolt cycling even when using smaller and less powerful loads. Next I sent the barrels for each rifle to a local metal shop, who acid washed them and dipped them each 3 times to ensure proper Chrome coverage on the insides of the barrels. Then I removed the trigger mechanisms for each gun. I replaced the factory slap triggers with Vortex trigger kits. These trigger kits are two stage triggers. They have very little Play and ZERO slap.  I then added G&G Aluminum Quad Rail Forends and G&G Vertical Forend Grips with ""Out - the - Bottom"" Bipods. Then I replaced the factory pistol grips with Hogue composite flat dark earth grips.  On this Rifle only, I added a composite rear trunion and tube and a MagPul or UTG 6 position stock.  The plastic trunion and tube could easily be switched out for aluminum versions, but at the time, it was all I could find. I replaced the recoil spring with a homemade double looped version which is much smoother than the originals. I made some other modifications here and there but these are the main ones. As you can see, I converted this gun far beyond what many shops do. I sold one of the others, that had a little more into it, plus a Trijicon Reflex Scope, for $2700 last fall. I have, on several occasions,  with surplus ammo, shot sub-3 inch groups at 400 meters with my other rifle that is the same as this one, with the exception of a little bit better scope.  That is NOT something that most AKs can accomplish. Also, recoil is very light. I have also dumped the 30 round mag in less than 6 seconds without the use of a slide fire stock. This Rifle also has a side mount and removable rail assembly with a Bushnell 6-9x40 illuminated scope. Lastly, I'm including 4 Mags and a sealed spam can of FMJ ammo (640 rds)
This Rifle is REALLY NICE and WELL MAINTAINED. It has Fired LESS THAN 50 TOTAL Rounds in It's Life.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple Brand New, factory fresh and very hard to find CZ USA 85 Combat 9mm Pistols! CZ has yet to make a bad firearm, and these are some of our favorites. The 85 Combat model features some much-appreciated improvements over the standard model, such as lack of firing pin block safety and overtravel adjustment of the trigger. This allows you to fine-tune the already fantastic triggers to competition levels.
Do yourself a favor and go shoot a CZ handgun if you haven’t yet. Then give us a call!


I only have TWO in stock, and have them priced to sell for only $579.00 each.


CZ 91210 Model 85 Combat 9mm Pistol, 4.7″ BBL, SA/DA, Black Finish, 15+1

The CZ 85 Combat version was created as an extension of the CZ 85 B with some additional features. The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.

The rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage, and the trigger for overtravel regulation. An extended magazine catch, elimination of the magazine brake and ambidextrous controlling elements directly predispose this model for sport shooting competitions.

Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple Brand New, factory fresh Glock 17 Gen 4 9mm Pistols! Incredible shooters right out of the box, the Glock 17 is the full-size 9mm Glock handgun. The Gen 4 model comes with 3 magazines, as well as an interchangable back strap system allowing you to change the grip depth to fit your specific hand size.


I only have TWO in stock, and have them priced to sell for only $539.00 each (cash price).

Glock PG1750203 Model 17 Gen 4 Pistol, 9mm, 17-Round Magazine, 4.49″ Barrel, Matte Black

The GLOCK 17 Gen4, in 9×19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the world’s most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter’s hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 9x19mm pistol also retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.
The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.
The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap.

The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

I originally purchased this rifle when it was put together on a different plastic stock. I purchased it for 400. I installed a bullpup stock that I bought just over 200 and added a buffer recoil pad (to reduce recoil). The barrel still has a lot of life left in it. Shoots very accurately and flawlessly.

The upgraded bullpup stock shortens the SKS about 5-6 inches from the previous length. I originally built this because I enjoy learning the different weapon platforms and I thought this would be a great shooter. Absolutely no surprises, this rifle shoots beautifully. The few times that I took it to the range, there is always a small audience behind me trying to figure out what I'm shooting. If you have friends or family that shoots, or you just want to show someone up that is different from what everyone else has, then this is the rifle for you. Or if you just like to have fun and blast away with inexpensive steel ammo, then this is also for you.

Replacement parts for the Norinco are cheap and are plentiful because of U.S. companies making compatible parts between all of the SKS platforms for all the different countries who manufacture it. The overall recoil is very manageable, if you wanted to take someone with a small frame to range they would have a blast without any concerns of injury.

I figured that whoever wants to buy it will have to pay for the transfer and background check fee. So I cut the price down from 800 to 700 to help cover the cost of those transaction fees at whichever local gun shop we commit our transaction.

What is in this packaged deal?

1 Norinco SKS with a custom bullpup stock

800 rounds of ammunition (40 rounds of PDX1 Defender, 40 rounds of winchester white box brass, and the rest of the ammo is Tulammo steel cased)

5 20 round magazines
3 30 round magazines
2 40 round magazines
(all magazines are reliable)

20 stripper clips (for quick ammo loading)

1 steel ammo can with 7.62 markings.

NOTE: Magazines will be disassembled and provided to purchaser as parts kits, exactly how the gun shops in Colorado sell the magazines. This rifle is 922r compliant the entire stock kit is made in USA as well as the magazines and buffer pad that I installed.

Based on the serial number this rifle was made in early 1944 by ROF Maltby in Yorkshire, England. It then went back to the factory sometime between 1948-1950 for parts repair/replacement post-war. Hence the FTR on the receiver (Factory Thorough Repair). We know it had to be between 1948-1950 since it is still an all original No4 Mk1 instead of being upgraded to the No4 Mk1/2 or Mk1/3 which started in 1950 and continued through to 1954. That is about all the history I know about this particular rifle. As you can see in the pictures it has seen its fair share of use post FTR but is in good shape for its age. Clean barrel and still very good rifling.

It comes with one 10 round factory original magazine, two rounds, and a leather sling that is missing a snap button.

This gun is in excellent shape, no box or papers though. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I also have more pictures I could send, I could only fit one on here with a free account. I am asking $1400.00 OBO I am not interested in trades, I'm not an firearms enthusiast. 

I'd prefer to sell it locally, I'd be willing to meet halfway for someone located in the central Ohio area. I guess I would ship, but a USPS money order would be required as I am not a dealer and can't take credit card payments."

Have you been looking for a lightweight easy to swing over under for your wife, a grandchild or even for yourself? This is a light over under with the quality you expect from a Browning. 

This shotgun has the Invector choke system and will come with three chokes and the Browning choke wrench. Barrels are clean and mirror bright. The metal is still extremely good at a 95+. The wood has some hunting dings in it and would probably grade 80+. 

The English stock also lends this shotgun to having a very thin wrist and would really be ideal for a smaller shooter that cant get a firm grip on a bigger stock.

These are among the rarest rifles in the country. First year Chinese models produced on Russian equipment, under Russian supervision. Exported to Albania in the 1970's and sent ""elsewhere.""

This gun is known as a ""Ghost Gun"" because it is not registered in any way with the government. AKA Sterile / Spook Gun amongst the online forums.

This one was made in Factory 26, which is the best of the best.  Has the triangle 26 stamp. The serial number A5xxx means it was one of the first produced, making this is quite possibly the rarest SKS for sale in the nation. 

All numbers match and this gun is exquisite for being made in 1956.

To be clear, this is a clone, and NOT an official EOTech optic.  Honestly, it's a pretty well built sight. Fired a few mags with it mounted. The LED reticle is bright, but has a solid image which is strange when you're used to the laser reticle of an EOTech.  Anyway, I'd really like to get some .22lr for it.  The gentleman I purchased the rifle from was very forthcoming about it. He stated he paid $80 for it last year.  It's a very decent sight compared to my former TRS-25. Pretty much the same brightness, and clarity as my former Bushnell TRS-25, just with an EOTech style reticle.  No battery will be included. Takes a standard CR-123A battery.
