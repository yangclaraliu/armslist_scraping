If not, then just go to Google or SigTalk and read my articles or listings of “P320 X5 and Leupold DeltaPoint Pro”...In any case. Like I said, this is my second completed X5 mounted with the DPP. I had the space for the optic extended to accommodate for the Leupold DeltaPoint Pro. It was done with a mill for a perfect cut. My first one was done by hand. But this second one was machined to exact spec. The DeltaPoint Pro fits perfectly into the slot. Why did I choose the Leupold DPP instead of just mounting a Romeo 1, because the DPP allows me to install a rear iron sight so I can cowitness. The front sight is a Dawson precision. The internals were also taken down and polished for a VERY smooth trigger pull/break. What all was done and what comes:-Sig Sauer P320 X-Five-Original Case, documents, everything from factory-4 magazines. I actually have one extra mag, so I’ll include it to make it FIVE total. -Dawson Precision fiber optic front sight -Leupold DeltaPoint Pro red dot-Leupold rear iron sight-Complete FCU/internal polish-Grayguns PELT straight trigger and spring kitI’ve gone thru about seven P320 X5s and a few P320RX since the release of the X5. This was the most perfected one, hence why I’ve kept this for awhile. But, to tell you the truth, as much as I love the gun, I’m not a fan of shooting it. During the time, I also customized a S&W M&P and I’m actually loving that gun a little more. So after awhile, I’m deciding I think I’m ready to let the X5 go. My price is probably going to be a little ridiculous because I’m leaving everything in there and there’s a lot of sentimental values. Which you don’t care. But I’m up for trading for a nice 1911, Ed Brown, Wilson Combat, maybe STI, Q5 Match, etc, and I’m willing to put cash out to make up the difference. The gun has LESS than 100 rounds thru it. I will tear it down to the FCU for you to see how clean and how new the internal of this gun is for you. I’m sure you know it’s a modular pistol so it’s very easy to take it down to the FCU. The rounds were fired to sight in the rear sight and the red dot. I bought it to run competition hence why I got 5 mags. But I have way too many CZs and I can’t put down my TSO to give this any chance to run. So when I say this gun is in very excellent condition, it’s literally new condition when you see it.

I bought it impulsively when it first came out and just never used it. I did send it to the factory to fix the feed ramp issue that the first guns in production had and after that it ran flawlessly. I also had the factory install the green front sight instead of the red sight it originally came with. I also have the red sight that can be installed if you want. I originally paid 1200 for the gun and I think now they are selling for 1000-1100 brand new. I am selling for 900 OBO.  Please do not email me with trades unless you have high end walleye fishing gear that is worth around what I am asking for.
