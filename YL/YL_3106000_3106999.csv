The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch."

He also installed a rear detent spring capture screw.  He said it makes it much easier to take the stock off if I ever wanted to change it or the end plate for a sling adapter.
I took the gun out for one range session (~200 rounds) and haven't shot it since.  The group you see was 20 rounds shot with a carry handle sight at 50 yards.  I've since taken the carry handle off for another project (spud launcher for the kids, lol), so it'll need a rear sight of your choice.  The gun includes one new aluminum 30 round magazine.

Lightly used Remington 700 SPS Tactical in .308 with 20"" target-crowned bull barrel (non-threaded). Comes with Hogue rubberized stock, X-Mark adjustable trigger, bipod, Blackhawk cheekpad (w/ammo loops), and Weaver 4-16x42 V-series scope (w- 1/4 MOA dot, fine crosshairs) sitting on Weaver bases. I've taken the time to smooth out the bolt, and my rifles are always well-maintained. 

Accurate enough at this point (if I do my job) to punch a single ragged hole at 100yds, and sub-MOA at 200m w/ Federal Gold Medal Match 168gr. Benchrest style shooting just isn't for me, and I don't fancy myself a sniper. It HAS been deer hunting, and took a nice doe. It was a little surreal to pick which eyeball to send the bullet through.

$800 firm. I'm in Saint Paul and Anoka daily, will travel for the right buyer. Buyer must be MN resident with .gov issued photo ID. I'd like to see a MN PTP/PTC as well. I'd be happy to setup a test shoot out at Oakdale Gun Club for a serious buyer."

 FABARMSAT-8 shotgun (S.A.T.-8 stands for Semi-Automatic Tactical, 8 shots)was specially designed for security / police / self-defense applications, as well as for practical sport shooting. These shotguns are manufactured in a wide spectrum of models, with different stocks and options, but all are based on same action with patented features such as Tri-bore barrel profile and Pulse Piston gas operated action. FABARM SAT-8 shotguns are gas-operated, semi-automatic weapons. Gas piston is of ring type, and is located around the front of the magazine tube, below the barrel. The patented Pulse Piston system consists of a polymer brake ring which is compressed between the gas piston and operating rod, which is connected to the bolt group. Upon discharge, this brake provides constant velocity of recoiling parts (regardless of the power of ammunition used) through the self-adjustable friction between the polymer ring and outer surface of the magazine tube - the heavier the load and the higher is pressure in the barrel, the stronger the ring will be compressed and the more friction will be added to the whole operating system. Barrel locking is achieved by single swinging locking piece, which is installed in the top of the bolt.

Hey everyone, 
I have an old Blackpowder for sale or trade. It is a American Eagle Arms Corp 45 caliber. It is almost an exact clone of a thompson center hawken rifle. It is made in Italy and is in pretty good shape for its age. I have been told by 4 different people that it was probably imported in the 70's or so from the italian company who also makes the guns for hawken or lymon. This was proofed in 1977 due to the stamping it has on it. It isstamped made in italy and has the proof marks as well. It looks to be an originally ""browned"" gun instead of the regular blued. If not, then the patina is really good and gives the steel that ""browned"" look. The only thing this may need is the brass jag on one end of the ram rod is missing. I looked and you can get a replacement for pretty cheap (literally like 5 dollars on some sites), but overall this is a really good gun that mainly just needs a really good cleaning and oiling down. This is actually a pretty decent gun and would be a great setup for someone wanting to be more traditional that all these inline muzzleloaders out there. I would keep this for myself but I already have a Lymon 50 and a Thompson 54 and really dont want to have to make a bunch of rounds for this gun as well. So I am passing it on to yall to play with!

Description:
The Duty One has long been a great seller for STI but in 2013 they took the opportunity to incorporate Customer suggested changes into the model before expanding the line to include the 3” & 4” versions. The new Duty one line is a unique evolution; STI went out and redesigned their light railed guns to surpass the design and quality of any railed 1911 style on the market today. Changes include new ‘grid’ serrations and matching front strap which are as stylish as they are functional, abbreviated front cocking serrations, a redesigned tactical rail, smaller engravings, and new G10 mycarta grips. All 3 versions are built on forged steel, standard width frames with STI’s innovative new picitany rail system. Flat checkered mainspring housing with a matching ‘grid’ pattern provides an excellent hold and the controls are STI International’s singled sided thumb safety and STI International high-rise beavertail grip safety. The Duty One features include traditional 1911 styling with lowered and flared ejection port, STI fixed Ledge style rear sight and the STI ramped front for an easy sight picture. The barrel is a 5.01” fully supported STI International ramped barrel with match grade bushing. The Duty One 5.0 comes standard with STI International commander style hammer and patented STI International trigger system.

Condition / Background:
This handgun has about 900 rounds through it, and the vast majority of those are in competition. When not used in IDPA competition, this is truly a safe queen. Anyone who has shot STI knows their reputation for high level performance. The Crossbreed holster and mag carrier are incredible, and these are horsehide which means they will not absorb moisture nearly as much as cowhide. This holster does have their ""combat cut"" for additional speed and grip purchase.

It has a few very faint scuff marks, so I won't say it's LNIB, but it is in excellent condition with maybe 200 rounds through it.  The slide is stainless, and both slide and frame have the Sig Sauer Nitron finish.  I've never carried it in a holster, and only shot it at the range a few times.

I installed a pair of Hogue wrap around grips with Hogue grip screws, and also have the original Sig grips.  I also had the gunsmith at 2A Shooting Center replace the front sight with a SigLite night sight about a year ago.  The single action trigger is a crisp 3.75 - 4#; the DA trigger is very smooth, and I'd put it at around 10 - 11# (my gauge only goes up to 8#).

Included are three 8 round Sig factory magazines and one 10 round Sig factory magazine; two of the 8 rounders are brand new and still in original packaging.  The 8 round mags sell for $40 apiece at MidwayUSA.  The 10 rounders are discontinued and very hard to find; on eBay they are selling for over $100.

I'm also throwing in a beautiful unused OWB brown leather holster from UBG holsters in Utah.  UBG calls it the Bonneville, and here's a link:  http://www.ubgholsters.com/owb.htm

Don't have the box or papers, but I am including the pictured Boyt handgun case.

Everything I'm including with the pistol adds up to about $400, so I am going to be firm on the price.  Also, I don't want to ""part it out"".  If trading, cash may be included one way or the other based on the value of your firearm.  Trade value is $900, will sell for $725.

I had the trigger reworked by a local gunsmith giving it a smoother pull and better break. The gun can be carried in the cock and locked position or the double action position. The pistol comes with a fiber optic front sight and plain black rear installed for competition shooting. I also will include in the purchase Mepro night sights (a $100.00 value) if the buyer would prefer that type of sight.  I will trade for something of EQUAL VALUE. The costs of the gun and upgrades are in the $800.00 range. If you have something in that price range then a possible trade might be in-order. Do not waste our time by offering something that you bought for $400.00 and expect me to trade a $800.00 gun for it.

Can I actually get a good deal, let's see.

I want to get started back into reloading, haven't done it for a while. Thought about just buying everything I needed, but then the cost saving bug bit me.

I want to TRADE FOR a complete progressive reloading set-up for 38/357. I'm hoping it's not necessary to explain the word, COMPLETE.
I Am willing to offer for trade, a Colt Commander model 1911, LNIB, less than a box of ammo down range. Original cost was $1100, average used value $800-$850.

So that's your target range, can anyone offer a reloading set-up equal in value? Oh, and in case an unsavory individual reads this ad, I do know and understand what I'm looking for.

Please plan on sending me a complete write up on what your offering, including part numbers. To my negative friend in Columbus, if this is too much work for you, please pass me by.
Pictures of the set-up will help me get a full idea of your offer."

First the safe is a winchester not sure about capacity but it probably is 29 or something according to winchester but we all know how that works. I have 5 long guns on one side and all my ammo on the other side might could squeeze a couple more on the one side and of course with the ammo gone it would open the other side up the safe is electronic. 
the guns
Remington 870 home defense- 18 inch barrel extended mag, collapsible stock, shell holder, stuff that makes it look cool. I have the original parts for it as well, unsure of round counts, but I don't shoot much so I am sure less than 200 
Saiga 410- Bought for the wife have maybe two boxes through it one mag cleaning kit etc no mods 
Yugo SKS- ok this one I got modded and had to redo some stuff, po had removed teh bayo lug, launcher sight and welded a flash suppressor on in, I had the suppressor removed and barrel re crowned install a left hand timbersmith stock on it. It shoots well no malfunctions and it's as accurate as you would expect an sks to be. 
Lastly is a marlin model 60 got it in trade so unsure of rd count and I have only had it out twice, but it shot well has a little scope on it. 
Ammo at least 1500 rds of 7.62x39 for the sks maybe 100 rds of twelve gauge a couple of boxes of .410 and some .22.  
Would like to sell it all as a package if you are serious we can set up a showing
