This gun does not appear to have ever been shot. If you are not familiar, the FEG R9 was made by Hungarian Arms. On the outside, it looks almost dead on to the Browing Hi-Power. Inside, the action is more like the S&W 59, double action. These are nice, reliable weapons that have a bit of a following. This particular one was originally imported by Interarms of Alexandria, VA. Note that this is a 9x19 and comes with 2 14 round magazines both of which appear unused as well. Comes in its original plastic carrying case. If I were a collector I'd keep this as it is unused and in mint condition but I prefer user pieces and prefer my HK VP9 to this gun. Trades possible.You must be willing to provide valid ID and sign a bill of sale.

This gun has 700-900 rounds fired through it and feels as if it is just getting broken in and smoothing out. Although in those rounds fired I've had about 3-6 malfunctions. Just basic rounds getting stuck coming out and that was due to sun sonic ammo anyway. It's flawless condition not a scratch can't even tell it's been used. Been cleaned inside and out after ever time It was taken out to shoot and lightly oiled. Rust and corrosion free looks mint. The green and red fiber optics were a upgrade and the sling studs. Also I have a factory made 25 round magazine I got made for that exact gun by mossberg along with the ten round factory mag it came with. The gun shoots amazing it actually really surprised me with its accuracy out to 100 yards. I love it just need the money.

I bought the remaining lot from him a few years back. The Yunker 3 is an AK74 style semi auto BB rifle that was made at Izhmash and given to students for training purposes. The gun itself is co2 powered by a 12g cartridge inside of the pistol grip. I was told that more than 80% of the parts are real AK parts, which is why this was banned from entering the US few years after this was brought in. Field stripping the rifle is identical to the real AK. The handguards, stock, gas tube are all interchangable, as well as the recoil spring. The gun does not come with a magazine. However, any AK74 mag should fit. It would be for dummy purposes anyway. This does shoot on semi-auto only. Reserve price is set at $600. Since this is not a firearm, this could be shipped directly to your house and no FFL is necessary. This exact gun sold at a local gun show for $1200 few years ago. Expect this to go up in value since it's no longer imported to the US. All Izhmash markings are intact and authentic. The material is the exact same as the real one. This is NOT some Chinese clone made out of pot metal. Payment via Google Wallet, USPS MO, or discreet Paypal (you pay the fees) FREE SHIPPING WITH BUY IT NOW!!"

The rifle was appraised today in excellent condition, FMV of $3,500. The rifle was used very little for hunting deer/elk in the '50's, but has been in the gun safe since I was born in 1957. The lettering and engraving are still sharp and legible, the checkering is sharp and unblemished. The blueing is in good condition, faded slightly in some places like the barrel end and sharp edges, and there a couple of very small impressions (dings) in the stock, but overall a very nice looking piece. No repairs, no re-blueing or wood refinishing, no broken or missing parts. I'm willing to ship, buyer pays all fees. Feel free to contact me with questions. Paypal or cash only. No checks, money orders, no trades. I'm in no hurry to sell, so I won't respond to low-ball offers. Thanks for reading."

Optically, it is outfitted with a wide and versatile zoom range and an objective that has excellent low-light capabilities for accurate target identification at dawn and dusk, or under a heavy canopy. Index matched, multi-coated optics further boost the low-light abilities while also improving color rendition and contrast. The laser rangefinder accurately ranges targets from 50 to 1200 yards, and is complemented with a built-in inclinometer that measures the upward or downward angle relative to the target. A bullet drop compensation system that uses the measured range, angle, and the user-inputted information on the cartridge in use, to activate and illuminate a adjusted aim point on the reticle. The scope can be programmed for hundreds of commercial loads or, if shooting custom rounds, users may choose a commercial load with specs most closely matching the custom rounds. Designed to withstand the rigors of the wild, the housing is made of durable and lightweight 6061 T6 aluminum with a scratch and corrosion-resistant matte-black anodized finish. Its one-piece main-tube is nitrogen-filled and O-ring sealed to give it waterproof and fogproof performance. For a solid connection, the scope mounts on standard Picatinny/Weaver rail systems. This version of the Eliminator has ergonomically-placed activation switches on both sides of the housing directly behind the objective bell. This enables easy activation with a simple movement of the support hand.

Save time, money and ammunition with the new and improved LaserLyte® Laser Bore Sight. Incorporating LaserLyte's patented one-piece design and caliber-fitting systems the new Laser Bore Sight is fifty percent smaller than the previous model. This easy-to-use product can get a shooter within three to four inches of the bull's-eye at 100 yards in about three shots.
 
Constructed from tough T6 aluminum, the Laser Bore Sight comes in a sleek red finish and works great on any weapon with at least three inches of barrel length. The Laser Bore Sight makes sight-in sessions a breeze for scopes, lasers or iron sights on any firearm from .22 to .50 caliber with included adapters.
 
For maximum versatility the system also works with new accessories (sold separately), including a shotgun adapter for .50 to .75 caliber and improved scope leveler. The Laser Bore Sight activates with a roll switch and is powered by three 393 batteries that provide one and a half hours of continuous use.  This unit is also excellent for modern rifles and its modest design works great with most flash suppressors and muzzle breaks.
