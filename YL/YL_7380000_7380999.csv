The Caracal® Enhanced F – Limited Edition is a striker fired semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. The pistol is comprised of a Caracal International frame and a Caracal USA slide, and is assembled in the United States. Only a limited number of these pistols will be placed into the market, commemorating Caracal’s commitment in the industry and Caracal USA’s first consumer product release. 
 
The Enhanced F – Limited Edition pistol features a redundant safety system consisting of an integrated trigger safety, firing pin safety and a drop safety. 
 
The ergonomically designed contoured polymer frame, with its intuitive grip angle, incorporates a rail interface system for mounting lights, lasers and other shooting accessories. With an 18mm (0.71”) distance from the center axis of the barrel to the apex of the tang, the low slide profile puts the recoil axis close to the shooter's hand, which greatly reduces muzzle rise and felt recoil. The trigger shoe, trigger safety and trigger bar have all been designed in conjunction with a one-piece multi-function unit ----- comes with 2 mags,case & paperwork-  $575.00 -- may consider trades -- thanks, Michael

Specifically designed for the Ruger 10/22 Takedown host and compatible with virtually any stock that accommodates a bull barrel (.92” outer diameter), the Mist-22 Takedown silencer is a perfect way to keep your rifle compact without adding the extra length of a standard can. To that end, it is match-grade 22LR for optimal accuracy and features a 1:16” RH twist for use with commercially available bull barrel stocks. The monocore baffle unit measures 8”, while the barrel portion is nearly 9” in length. This cutting-edge silencer’s absolute sound level is an amazing 114 dB. Impressive, right? Idaho-headquartered Gemtech designed this suppressor committed to create a lightweight, easily maintained, and shockingly quiet silencer that doesn’t add extra components to your rifle system. Utilizing their own G-Core Technology merely added to the sturdiness of the unit. Considering the positive feedback the Mist-22 Takedown has generated thus far, we feel Gemtech has yet another direct hit in their arsenal. *Perk Alert* If concerned with disassembly/cleaning pitfalls, don’t be. With a simple push and twist, the Mist-22 Takedown quickly and easily separates from the stock. Moreover, Gemtech treats this suppressor’s core with C3 Technology, resulting in a smooth finish that prevents lead buildup. Simple enough. Amazingly, the Mist-22 Takedown only weighs 1 ounce more than its counterpart, the Integral Mist-22.

It'd be hard to find an example of this vintage firearm in finer condition, barely a turn line on the cylinder. I am located in Newland (Avery County) but travel the area with frequency for business (Spruce Pine Boone Morganton Banner Elk West Jefferson sometimes down to Hickory or out to Asheville) I'm willing to meet in a mutually convenient location. Buyer must have NC Carry or Purchase Permit. For those interested parties from out of state I'd be glad to ship it to your FFL for the price plus shipping costs. The pictures do not do this wheelgun justice, (any swirling discoloration is from wiping down with a silicone cloth-the finish is shiny blued perfection) It truly is a gorgeous revolver in beyond excellent condition. It would be a nice addition to any collection, these are now commanding a premium and they are only going to rise in value as time passes."

This Sig 716 DMR has perfect color Match up with the Upper and Lower receivers and the receivers are tight with no play. I have put only 30 Easy Slow fired rounds down the pipe of this Sniper Rifle with a cleaning after each 5 shot group. This rifle is shooting 1/2"" MOA groups at 100 yards with 5 shots. This thing is a Tack Driver and you will be very happy with it. It is Like Brand Spanking New. 99.99% I also tested some 155 grain Hornady TAP AMAX and 175 grain Lapua Match ammo with great results.. You will be very happy with this Sniper Rifle. It is in .308 caliber and all Black in color. Only $1550 Shipped to your FFL Dealer. No trade offers."
