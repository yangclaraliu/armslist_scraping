Selling Czech made Vz-58. 

Comes with 
- Israeli made collapsible recoil reducing stock 
- railed forearm 
- US made highly ergonomic Ronin grip

This one is available here for ~$1100

Furnitures are available here for $185, originally $200+:
http://www.zahal.org/products/vz-58-cz-858-conversion-and-accessory-kit-basic?path_parent=218961

US made Ronin grip is available here:
http://shop.roninsgrips.com/Czech-vz58-Israeli-Galil-Ultra-Style-with-Screw-Czech-vz58-Israeli.htm

Fit and finish, as well as quality of build, is far superior (night and day) to US made ones (Century Vz2008, quite often sold as Vz58).

These right now these go for $1065-$1165 just for the rifle ALONE and prices have being going up over the years, despite it still being made and imported. I think the cost of Israeli/US furniture was north of $200 but they make it far more user friendly.

So basically new, it was $1,300+. So it doesn't make sense for me to trade it for a Glock or a $400 Cz pistol that can be easily found new or used.

If you looked at the price of Czech made Vz-58, not US made Century Vz-2008 masquerading as Vz-58, it appreciated steadily even though it's still being made with items being periodically sold out.

They are THAT good! Compared to an AK or US made Vz-2008.

https://www.czechpoint-usa.com/sa-vz58-rifles

Compared to an AK/AK47/AK74, it mounts and shoulders much more quickly and much more naturally. 

No mags (can't find it but they are widely available and inexpensive). 

Vz58 mags are extremely well made BTW. They put AR mags to shame and in fact, I prefer them to AK mags (lighter with super robust feed lips)."

This gun has 400 rounds through it.  It has flawlessly fired 3 varieties of range rounds, as well as the following varieties of HP's:  Hornady XTP custom 124 grain; Federal Premium Hydra Shoks; Speer Gold Dots; Winchester Defend.  It seems that it will eat anything.  I have a flush 7 round mag, as well as two extended 8 round mags.  It has a Viridian R5 green laser (constant or strobe memory settings) which activates instantly upon drawing from the ECR holsters.  It is incredibly bright and visible.  It is visible to 100 yards in bright sunlight, and up to two miles at night.  The laser came with a soft, semi-structured, ambidextrous IWB holster, and I also bought an ECR ready DeSantis MiniScabbard for it, which fits very well, and puts the gun very close to the body.  Neither have been used for carry.  I have an extra package of batteries for the laser.  I also include a new Ramora for use with the laser detached.

Finally, I have just had XS big dot tritium night sights installed, and they are dead on.  Everything shows and operates as new.  I have over $1,000 into the gun and accessories, and it is all essentially new.  I will also include 150 rounds of fresh Hornady Custom 124 grain XTP ammo.  (Original boxes, paperwork, shop warranty, accessories also included.)  If you don't have a 1911 (preferably a carryable model, Commander sized, etc., but will consider all), I will consider offers to buy it, but please, no lowball offers.  I will consider adding cash (or even a 357, 3"" Ruger SP101) in trade for the right 1911.

I cannot travel far to make a deal, so a local deal is preferred.  Also, I will not ship, and require a FOID and birthdate to get approval from the Illinois State Police prior to making any deal.  A purchase is subject to the 72 hour waiting period, and I cannot sell to out of state residents.

Thanks."

Because of this, the BLR can be chambered for rounds with pointed tip bullets that would be inappropriate for the tubular magazines more commonly used in lever-action rifles. Another difference is the geared lever and bolt design that can accommodate high-pressure modern magnum rounds. Another notable feature is that the trigger moves with the lever when it is operated, which prevents the shooter's trigger finger from being pinched between the lever and the stock when the lever is closed.------------The .308 Winchester (pronounced: ""three-oh-eight"" or ""three-aught-eight"") is a rimless, bottlenecked, rifle cartridge and is the commercial cartridge from which the 7.62×51mm NATO round was derived. The .308 Winchester was introduced in 1952, and introduced it to the commercial hunting market as the .308 Winchester. Since then, the .308 Winchester has become 1 of  the most popular short-action, big-game hunting cartridge worldwide.[1] It is also commonly used for civilian target shooting, military sniping, and police sharpshooting. The relatively short case makes the .308 Winchester especially well-adapted for short-action rifles. When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of high terminal performance"

Hello, this is a new in the box, never fired SAS M-7 Classic Underfolder that cost me over 2k new back when it was available @ K-Var Corp. This is the best, and most sought after AK47 that Arsenal ever has and or will produce. It's as close to an SA93 Bulgarian AK as you can buy with the correct 45 degree vented chrome lined gas block, and a heavy duty chrome lined barrel for combat action. These were made in limited production and are hard to find, much less in this condition"

Spikes lower with spider logo, spikes lower parts kit, Spikes T2 buffer, Spikes buffer tube and spider logo M4 stock. The only thing on the lower not Spikes are the take down pins which I swapped out for Yankee Hill EZ pull pins. These lowers are currently on an 8-12 month backorder according to Spikes' website. The lower has just recently been mounted to the upper but not yet fired.

The upper was purchased from BCM. Its a BFH upper with a 16"" cold hammer forged midlength barrel, BCM comp mod 0 compensator, VTAC TRX extreme 13"" rail, Spikes BCG and mil-spec charging handle. Also has the VTAC rail mounted QD attachment. Round count 200-300. Not a single mark on the upper. BCM sells these uppers for $715 plus shipping WITHOUT a bolt carrier group, WITHOUT a charging handle and WITHOUT the rail mounted QD attachment. 

I'll include all the BCM gear shown in the photos, the TRX barrel nut wrench, a 30 round pmag and a brand new soft case. Price is $1250, firm. I may also entertain selling the upper and lower separately.

Looking to sell, or trade for AR platform rifle, high-quality handguns, or others.  Willing to sell, but please don't offer me a low-ball price as this is a brand NEW gun. Also, the Tactical model is higher priced than the standard hunting configuration. I've had the gun for a while, but have decided to thin out my shotguns. Got a great deal on it, but just never used it. The tactical model does not suffer from the problems that plagued the earlier 887s. Ive cycled dummy shells perfectly by hand.

If you you want a great deal on quality AR to make it your own, this is the AR for you.
I have a brand new in box complete Spikes Tactical AR for sale. I have bought a couple things that I have added to it already. My intentions was to make it my own with upgrades, but priorities have changed and need the funds for another reason now. I have upgraded the the mag release button with the Spikes solid billet mag release button, Magpul black forward grip and bought a new PMAG for it because Spikes does not ship their rifles with mags because of different state laws. The rifle sells for $950 on the Spikes website. With the 3 things I bought for it and added on I have over $1100 with the taxes included. I have the original mag button and Spikes M4 stock that will go with it also that came with it. This is a complete ALL Spikes rifle from Spikes with hard plastic Spikes Tactical carry case. It is brand new never fired in the box except by the factory. $900.00 cash firm, NO TRADES please.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

BAI-IZH-94MP 

This new model is a revival of inexpensive and light combination gun - concept of IZH-56 Belka which was produced by the end of '50s - early '60s. Owing to compact receiver and ribless barrel unit, IZH-94 has a reduced weight. This property makes it attractive for those who like long walking-tours. 

The combination of gauges and calibers, including .410 (slug rounds), makes the gun most suitable for various hunts - from small to medium-size hoofed game. Single trigger double-action firing mechanism is equipped with a single hammer. Trigger unit has a tang-mounted barrel selector. Non-automatic safety button located at the rear of trigger guard locks the trigger. Open sighting device features a windage-adjustable rear sight and elevation-adjustable front sight. Provision to mount a scope.
