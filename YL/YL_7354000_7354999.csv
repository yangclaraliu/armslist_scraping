The Vickers Tactical edition includes two Vicker's baseplates, Vicker's Extended Mag Release, Vicker's grip plug with take down tool, and Vicker's Extended Slide Stop all by Tango Down. The sights are the Wilsom Combat Vicker's gold bead front sight. The gun also of course comes with the well sought after RTF2 Frame and two standard glock mags. Also comes with a Concealment Express IWB kydex holster with adjustable cant. I have fired about 500 rounds through it. Well taken care of, cleaned and lubed with Ballistol after every range trip. Because it was my carry gun on and off for 5 months, it has some slide wear and the front corners. A little wear on the hood of the barrell, but nothing on the barrel. If interested, please shoot me an email and I can sent you more pictures. Other than that, the gun is stock and just as it came from the gun store.I'm asking $575 which is a fantastic deal seeing as a new Gen 3 Glock 19 goes for about $500 and the sights alone are priced at over $100 not including installation. If you know what an RTF2 frame is, then you know why this just makes it an even sweeter deal. Reason for selling is the RTF2 frame is just too rough on my skin for my IWB carry. I tried putting a bit of Talon Grips on it but when it gets warm, it just slides off. Buyer pays FFL.obo. shoot me an offer.No shipping."

Recently sent it to SCCY to have several upgrades done to it. They installed a CPX-2 slide, new barrel, CPX-2 recoil spring and guide rod and replaced both manual saftey levers and adjusted it to work flawlessly. This being said the gun is better than new since it has not had any rounds put through it since the upgrades and is much better than a standard CPX-1 could ever be now. It's basically a CPX-2 with a manual saftey.-Includes original box and manuals. -Trigger lock and 2 keys.-2 10 round magazines with extended and flat plates. -Concealed carry holster (can be adjusted to wear on left or right side)***Private cash only sale. Must be 21 years of age or older, must be legally allowed to own a firearm, must have valid ID showing you are a Virginia resident. Will provide a bill of sale including the make, model, serial number and signed by both parties.***"

From my research these were made in the early 50's for Morocco. Overall condition is fair. Most of the bluing is still there with some parts having patina. The wood shows handling marks but there are no cracks or chips missing. There is shallow pitting in a couple of spots below the wood line but nothing deep enough to effect safety. Lands and grooves of the bore are sharp. Also all the serial numbers I have found are matching.  I've fired this rifle plenty of times and it is accurate and probably one of the smoothest Mausers I have fired. If you have any questions please ask.
