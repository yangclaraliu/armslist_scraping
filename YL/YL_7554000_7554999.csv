This Colt Commando is a 2 inch  Heavy Snub Nosed 38 Special. Only 3400 total number built with the Stubby 2 inch Barrel out of a 49000 guns produced for WWII. Weapon of Choice for the OSS Approximately 49,000 Colt Commandos were purchased by the U.S. government during World War II. Based on factory results, the U.S. Army directly procured more than 16,000 Commandos, while only about 1,800 went to the U.S. Navy in the early war years. The remainder of the manufactured Commandos was purchased through Army Ordnance contracts. A total of 12,800 Commandos were issued to U.S. Military Intelligence, the Counterintelligence Corps, the newly formed Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and other intelligence organizations. About 3,450, of the roughly 49,000 Commandos produced were in two-inch snub variants that were commonly termed Junior Commandos. These short-barreled revolvers would primarily serve overseas and behind enemy lines among the espionage agents and military intelligence liaisons of the OSS.Â  Only a few shipments of two-inch revolvers were made for stateside civilian use, and these were produced late in the war. Regular production of the original two-inch barreled Junior Commandos began in March 1943. These revolvers had a round front site and bore the marking â€œCONNâ€ abbreviated for Connecticut, since the handguns were manufactured in Hartford. The American officers of the OSS Special Operations (SO) branch had the primary missions of gathering military intelligence, conducting sabotage, and training local resistance fighters, while avoiding direct contact with the enemy. These operatives often carried just a small pistol for self-defense. Since detection of these handguns was immediately incriminating, the stronger desire was for these agents to carry the shorter and more compact two-inch barrel Commando concealed in a pocket. In addition to the Colt Commando of both two- and four-inch barrel lengths, the Colt M1903 and the M1911A1 semiautomatic pistols were also employed by OSS personnel. Using the two-inch barreled Junior Commando was not problematic for gunfire accuracy since British intelligence operatives of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in 1940 began learning the Fairbairn-Sykes method of pistol shooting. William Fairbairn and Eric Sykes were both former pistol experts on the Shanghai Municipal Police Force. As described by military and espionage historian Terry Crowder, an intelligence operative would assume a forward-crouched stance with â€œone foot placed in front of the other as if running or stooping. The handgun was to be fired from the hip level with a crooked arm. This method was contrary to the orthodox military-type target shooting style of holding the pistols rear sight at eye level with the arm fully extended and then taking aim.MN Buyer Needs MN Photo ID and Permit.Out of State buyer pays $30 shipping to local FFL."

Gas block is a JP Enterprises adjustable, also stainless, with Odin Works gas tube (stainless)- Bolt carrier is an Odin Works brand nitride and bolt is an Alexander Arms ""hard use"" bolt with .136 bolt face (Type II chamber if you use BHW terminology)- Upper and lower are both billet Cross Machine & Tool brand with the lower parts kit from CMMG and an ALG ACT trigger installed with a Seekins Precision billet magazine release button- BCM Mod 3 Gunfighter charging handle with ""large"" latch- Handguard is a Samson Evolution 12.37"" with QD sling attachment point installed- Scope is a Leupold Mark AR Mod 1 1.5-4x20 with duplex recticle, Butler Creek flip caps and clear glass on both ends. I have the original box and paperwork for this as well. - Receiver extension is a VLTOR A5 with a B5 Systems Bravo buttstock- Flat dark earth BCM Mod 0 pistol grip- Muzzle device includes both of the following: Smith Enterprises Vortex flash hider (currently installed) and a Primary Weapon Systems FSC30 flash suppressing compensator that is a SCAR take-off. Both are threaded 5/8-24 and the PWS includes the jam nut. - Also includes one 10-round ASC magazine, no ammunitionI built this for deer hunting and long-range target shooting. I recently built a pistol-waiting-on-a-stamp-to-build-an-SBR in this same caliber and I no longer have a need for this one, as I've gone to a 12.5"" setup and that one gets all the use anymore. Not sure on the exact round count but judging from the empty brass it is less than 200 rounds total. I have only ever shot factory brass-cased ammo through it, primarily Hornady with some Nosler for good measure. No steel case has been put through this and this setup is extremely accurate at any range, provided you do your part. Overall condition is very good with a few areas of note: the barrel has a few spots where the cerakote has some chips (none are very large at all, but noting them nonetheless), the handguard has some rub marks in a few areas, the receiver extension/end plate were both painted at one time and still have a ""patina""/residue on them from the krylon, the brass deflector has smears and an area on the underside where the anodizing has been scarred. Function is perfect and it hits what it's pointed at, just noting the cosmetic issues as I know of them.  Only trade interests would be partial value with cash added, please. Trade interests would be for a very good to excellent condition Glock 19, Gen 3 preferreably in factory original or close to it condition or factory cased ammo of 5.56 55 grain XM193 from Prvi Partizan, IMI or similar quality up to 1,000 rounds if sealed in original case, no loose pack please unless it's in the original packaging. Not interested in .223 or handloads, please. Thank you for looking and please feel free to contact with any questions or for additional photos, as I wasn't able to upload all of the photos I have available. Thank you."

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.FEATURESM1913 Steel Optics Rail, Parallel With Bore, 13.75 IN Long (35 CM)Unitized Barrel And Aluminum ReceiverDetachable Bipod With Adjustable LegsSPECIFICATIONSModel: Black Model 99 Rifle SystemCaliber: .50 BMGOperation: Single Shot Bolt ActionRail Length/MOA: 13.75” (34.92 cm) 27 MOAWeight: 23 lbs (10.4 kg)Overall Length: 47” (119 cm)Barrel Length: 29” Fluted (73.7 cm)Rifle Twist: 1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm)Magazine Capacity: Single Shotfirearm will be shipped to and also insure"

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.FEATURESM1913 Steel Optics Rail, Parallel With Bore, 13.75 IN Long (35 CM)Unitized Barrel And Aluminum ReceiverDetachable Bipod With Adjustable LegsSPECIFICATIONSModel: Black Model 99 Rifle SystemCaliber: .50 BMGOperation: Single Shot Bolt ActionRail Length/MOA: 13.75” (34.92 cm) 27 MOAWeight: 23 lbs (10.4 kg)Overall Length: 47” (119 cm)Barrel Length: 29” Fluted (73.7 cm)Rifle Twist: 1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm)Magazine Capacity: Single Shotfirearm will be shipped to and also insured."
