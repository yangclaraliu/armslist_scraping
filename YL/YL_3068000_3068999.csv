 SIG SAUER has taken the proven features of the SIG516™ and applied them into a potent AR-based rifle chambered in 7.62 x 51mm. Utilizing the short stroke pushrod operating system, an M1913 Mil-Std rail, free-floating barrel, aluminum quad rail forend, telescoping stock, and Magpul PMAG, the SIG716 is the rifle of choice when you require the power of a larger caliber carbine. Has a 16"" barrel with a 1:10 twist. Includes (1) 20 round Magpul magazine"

Or to have a contest with friends, well this is the answer.  I made this myself. The paddles are 3/8'' Ar500 steel and so is the vertical post. This will withstand shots up to .308 winchester. Has two leaning settings for smaller and larger calibers. Paddles, base and vertical tower all disassemble for transportation. If you do your research this is worth about 1100 or 1200. Im selling this one for 800 bucks. Most trees don't even have the tower armored, so one shot to that part and your tree is junk. I built this tree to last, don't be dissapointed with the ebay or china crap, buy American/locally made products.

The bluing on it is better, but there is significant pitting on the barrel and a little on the cylinder (nothing colt can't take care of with a factory refinish).  The other doesn't have as much of the original bluing, but has a lot less pitting on it.  They're both mechanically perfect and ready to hit the range.  These aren't safe queens - they're meant to be appreciated for what they were made for: shooting.  Maybe after a few good sessions you can send it off to Colt to get a new finish."

To be clear, this is the NEW Heckler & Koch version of the full-size .45 acp, about 300 rounds through the pipe, cleaned and lubed after each of about four or five uses. It is in a nice shade of FDE and is the DA/SA version and can be converted to LEM. Two 10 round mags included, along with extra back strap, box and papers. Nothing whatsoever wrong with this piece, just decided to thin the herd a bit.  It's actually a really cool gun!  Full FDE is kinda unique, too.  PRICE IS FIRM, CASH, NO TRADES - thanks.  I can do FFL to FFL shipping to conus for $45, insured.  Anyhow, keep reading if you have the cash to buy.  Also, all laws followed, i.e. 72 hr. wait from time an intent to purchase is made, ISP FOID check. Thanks

Here is what HK has to say:

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull."

The PF-9 retains the best features from the P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes.

The P229® was the first pistol to be manufactured in Exeter, New Hampshire.The P229 is one of the most popular SIG SAUER® pistols and carried by thousands of law enforcement professionals throughout the country. The compact size of the P229 makes it ideal for concealed carry. Not only is it non-railed like the traditional P229s, but it also has the classic P229 slide with the half-height rear cocking serrations. 

This gun comes NIB with the original ergo grip not installed. It currently sells on eBay alone for up to $75. I added the Sig panels with $13 stainless hex button head screws from TJ's Custom Gunworks. The older style panels fit my hand better. Sig ergo grip tool, Sig owners manual, and cable lock come with the sale. Also included are two new Sig branded factory 12 rnd. mags. I also have (hard to find) 3 more new factory 12 rnd. mags for $45 each if needed. This is a great configuration if you don't require all the tacticool features of a TacPac or railed model. Not alot of these non railed models floating around NIB. Checked Buds.com and several local dealers prior to this listing so I'm aware of whats out there currently. No trades, and cash gets the deal done! Buyer will need to meet me at a local FFL for the transfer. Buyer is responsible for his/her state background fee and any associated dealer transfer fees. Gun is for sale locally only. Sorry, no shipping or out of state sales at this time. $700 firm!

I purchased the AR-15, that this barrel came from, to be a long range varmint gun, hoping to luck out with a tack driver but got the typical 3-4 inch groups. So off it came for a more expensive barrel. It only has about 50 rounds thru it, properly cleaned during break-in. This is a nice barrel for a blaster with easy install.

831,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3068831,For Sale:  .223 or 5.56 ammo for $7.50/box CHEAP,"Wauwatosa, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 75,"Listed On: Friday, May 16, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 1,100 rounds of .223/5.56 ammo, in 55 twenty round boxes. It was all purchased from Cabela's or Palmetto State. I have Federal American Eagle .223, Federal 5.56 M193, Independence 5.56, and PMC Bronze .223 - all are FMJ 55gr.

I stocked up on range ammo awhile back, and now I'm shooting more match grade ammo for longer range target shooting. Don't need to get rid of this stuff, just figured if I could unload it, I can buy more match ammo. I paid $8-10/box for this stuff - a common price at Cabela's or Palmetto State, plus tax/shipping.

I am asking for $7.50/box, that said I would prefer to not sell less than 10 boxes at a time, as it wouldn't really be worth my time. 

So 10 boxes, 200 rounds, $75, do the math (and please search this site, Cabela's, anywhere else - you'll realize this is a great deal).

If someone wanted to buy the all of it, 1,100, I'd let it go for $400 (that's under 37 cents a round). 

Again, there's nothing wrong with this ammo, just not match grade which is what I am mostly shooting these days. If you're familiar with match ammo it isn't cheap so to feed that hobby I figured I would see if I could unload some of this range ammo.

In all honestly, I have shot about 1.5"" groups at 100 yards out of my 1:7 twist AR with each of the 4 types of ammo, however, each one does shoot slightly different. So that comes into play for me shooting longer range targets as well, 4 types of ammo is a pain. But for practice, plinking, or Zombie Apocalypses this stuff should do great. Again, search around, you'll be hard pressed to beat the price.

For those who care the 1,100 is roughly:
360 Federal American Eagle .223
360 Fedeal 5.56 M193
240 Indepence 5.56
140 PMC Bronze .223
Not exact on that, if you want to know and are serious I will let you know.

The barrel assembly includes the factory installed barrel nut, factory installed gas block with flat top rail, and hand guard cap. To complete the installation you will need carbine length handguards & gas tube, delta ring, & muzzle device.

I purchased the AR-15, that this barrel came from, to be a long range varmint gun, hoping to luck out with a tack driver but got the typical 3-4 inch groups. So off it came for a more expensive barrel. It only has about 50 rounds thru it, properly cleaned during break-in. This is a nice barrel for a blaster with easy install.

I think that the Series 70 pistols ended with the 1980s. The pistol has nearly 100% of the blue finish, but has some spotting ( you can see it in the pictures ). My guess is that it was cleaned repeatedly with something like WD-40, which is not kind to bluing over time. I did fire 2 magazines thru the pistol at 10 yards, offhand, and was impressed at the 2"" ragged hole that it made. No telling what it would shoot from a rest, or from someone that knew how to shoot.  The only obvious features on this pistol are adjustable rear sights, Colt national match throated barrel,lightweight nylon checkered mainspring housing, and an adjustable aluminum trigger. Bore is bright and shiney. Asking $895.
A very nice pistol overall. Please feel free to ask questions. Might consider other 1911 trades. Thanks for looking."

This gun is an unfired Colt 1911 Series 80 Government Model .45 Auto. Bought it new last summer, so it's a 2013 model. Perfect condition, just like it left the factory. No scratches, no blemishes, no rust. Perfectly maintained and oiled. Barrel is polished stainless steel and perfect. Bluing is top notch (even by Colt standards) and also perfect. The gun is tight, yet smooth. It has been stored in a gun safe. This fine pistol also comes with 2 extra 8-round Wilson Combat Mags, and an extra heavy duty Wolff recoil spring, along with an extra Wolff heavy duty firing pin spring. The gun comes in it's original Colt factory case, and has such features as raised 3-dot sights, lowered ejection port, and extended trigger.

This gun is essentially a ""new"" gun, as it's just the same as the day it left the Colt factory. There is $1080 total invested in the gun. It's as good of an example of a Colt Government Model as you will find. The first $925 takes this pistol, and this price includes all the extra items listed above ($100 in value). I can meet any potential buyer either in Owensboro, or at a reasonable distance from Owensboro, as long as it's in the state of Kentucky. Buyers must be 21 or over and Kentucky residents. Cash only.

I also have around 300 rounds of .45 ACP ammo that I will sell below my cost.

Which means the bullet flies farther, straighter, truer, greater velocity, high energy, and less recoil. It is ballistically far superior to the .308.
