It will come with one p-mag. It does not have a rear sight, as I had run a scope on the rifle, so that is something you will have to add.

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

They where bought at the same time last year (6 months ago) and have been to the range 2 twice with approximately 120 rounds through either. Just not my cup of tea and would really like to get into a Ruger American 9 or their Security 9. They just for better. Both have an extra magazine and are in like new condition. In a perfect world I would like to trade one or both for a Ruger and make up the difference in cash but ready to sell one or both out right. Asking $300 for either one and open to any trade offer but not looking for shotguns at the moment. Thanks for the look.

NO EXCEPTIONS!!!The Omni-Hybrid lower has been specifically tested to withstand all sorts of use and abuse. The folks at ATI put it through all the pressure and weight-bearing tests, similar to the US Military's testing, and found it to function flawlessly, even after supporting up to 250 lbs. and being run over by an 800-lb. forklift. Then, they ran 2,000 rounds through it without a hiccup.Both the upper and lower are built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sectionsFully patented inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system, prevents movement during firing"

Sauer und Sohn of Suhl, Germany (nowadays known as Sig Sauer). The Kriegsmodell/Late War stock is quite rare and has no cracks. The action is smooth and the rifling is still very crisp. Blueing (as you can tell in the photos) is excellent. This firearm also features the rare plum bolt/receiver exclusive to J.P. Sauer und Sohn's '39 & '40 models.The production code on the receiver is '147'. All Waffenamts, proofings and Reichsadler's (black eagles with swastikas) are intact and weren't peened off after capture. The only things removed during capture (as usual) were the magazine capture screws (which I replaced) and the small front metal plate of the Kriegsmodell stock. I simply never got around to replacing it but there are plenty out there. If you would like more photographs, let me know.My end of the trade would include the rifle, a reproduction leather sling, a reproduction leather ammo pouch and ten stripper clips."
