Most parts are original except for the springs, barrel link, barrel pin, trigger, hammer, and grip safety.  I have the original hammer and grip safety, but they are still blued and bit my hand every time I fired it. It has a WWII ""HS"" barrel and WWII brown plastic grips.  It is smooth and has a good trigger pull.  Not a collectors piece, but it is a good looking, 96 year old, shooter.  No trades.  Also, if it isn't worth $900 to you, please do not contact me.  Lastly, if you don't live in MO, I won't sell it to you without an FFL.

GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this 15-round .40 caliber pistol.

PLEASE NOTE that this scope comes with everything a new-in-box NXS would EXCEPT for the box itself.  However, it has never been used or even mounted and I've taken many high-quality photos from various angles to demonstrate that it's both new and authentic; basically it's cosmetically and functionally perfect.  Unfortunately Armslist only allows uploading 3 low-quality photos so feel free to message me if you want to see the full set of HQ photos for it.

All original accessories are included (sunshade, bikini cover, cleaning cloth, paperwork, CD, and stickers).

I have this Nightforce currently listed on eBay too but would prefer to sell it directly to save on seller fees so I have the item priced very low here (as of 6/8 they are selling for over $1750 on Amazon).  If the item is bid for on eBay then I will have to take this listing down so don't hesitate if you're currently in the market for this scope.

I currently live in Chino, CA and prefer a face-to-face transaction (cash only please) but can also ship it to you if you trusted me enough with an upfront Paypal payment + $20 for USPS Priority shipping (or $40 if you want it insured too).  Also, NO REFUNDS if shipped; I consider myself a trustworthy person but it just comes down to if you also believe so.  If you are considering to buy though then I wouldn't mind talking with you over e-mail or phone first, if you'd like.

The gun shot really good. Without malfunctions and issues. Started as a brand new M92 AK-47 pistol, and converted to a fully legal carbine. With 16"" extended pinned barrel/permanently attached muzzle device (as per BATFE Rule if you install a full stock, or folding stock so won't be a Class 3/SBR gun). I double (BATF only requires just one pin) blind pinned and silver soldered the extended barrel/fake suppressor. I double blind pinned the barrel extension to make sure it stays on. Overall, the barrel and all is 16 1/2"". With a U.S. Machinegun brand stock adaptor installed (pictured). The wood stock set (upper & lower handguards, and pistol grip - is a copy of the famous Yugo ""fat"" wood pistol grip) are finished with amber shellac stain. In addition, I installed U.S. made compliance parts; which includes extended barrel, Tapco trigger/fire control group (hammer, trigger, sear, hammer spring, and has a G2 Tapco trigger), and wood pistol grip. Installed the U.S. made parts for 922r compliance. You must be at least 18 years old, or older and a Kentucky resident with a valid KY driver's license (KY CCWL preferred) to buy/trade this gun. No shipping. Local sale/trade only. I like this gun a lot, but I need a handgun, and can use some vacation money. Thanks for looking.

Will throw in a PRP spring kit if I can find it as well.

This has been carried as an OC piece but doesn't have any noticeable wear.

Looking for $625 with the storm lake barrel or $525 without.
Be prepared for me to take a peek at your CPL/WDL etc, just to cover my ass (which is constantly hanging in the wind).

ONLY trade I would be interested in entertaining would be an XDS in 9mm, post recall with the extra mag or more.

Located in Olympia, would prefer transactions to take place somewhat near? I  may be headed down to PDX for a day next week, will be in Bremerton on the 27th and up in Seattle/Woodinville on the 28th or 29th.  I think that covers the spread pretty much!"

The target model has the wooden laminate stock with black/grey swirls, ambidexterous thumbhole, 22"" Heavy stainless barrel. The gun came factory with a harmonic turner on the end of the barrel that lets you ""dial in"" whatever load/grain of shells you use. Really tightens up the groups. Also has inserts for the butt-plate that lets you adjust LOP. This is a very accurate gun. Check out the videos on youtube of this gun being tuned and fired. Ruger stainless rings also came with it. Ruger made this gun to compete with the accuracy of the high-end AR-15's and it had a MSRP of $1149.

Shot only 160 times give/take and shows it. Very nice condition. Comes with the scope in the pic. Not a leupold or anything really expensive,but a decent Bushnell Trophy XLT. 

According to Ruger, this gun only shoots .223 rounds. I looked around the net and people have shot the NATO rounds, but I wouldn't. I can round up some shells for it too.

Quality	
I have owned two of these for about 3 years now. Easy to conceal, easy to carry, easy to shoot. I have had two friends of mine look at them that are both long time gunsmiths. They were both impressed on how well they were built. The cost is very reasonable. You can pay a lot more and not get better quality. All my grandkids, nieces and nephews kids have fired these with 158 grain 38's and they all love the pistol.
Shooting the Range 
Review by mike on 2/15/14
Quality	
Took the Windicator .357 to the range today and fired 100 rounds. First 3 of 6 hit dead center of bulls eye center.This revolver is well balanced, with very little recoil. and accurate right out of the box. I plan to paint a white dot on front sight post to help me see and aim better, but it is accurate and fun to shoot. EAA has sold me on their quality for the money!"

The Aimpoint P.R.O. was purchased at the same time as the ACR and is in excellent. I did reverse the mount because the knob interfered with the manipulation of the charging handle. Here's the link to Aimpoints website. http://www.aimpoint.com/us/products/all-products/product-singleview/product/PRO/

The Surefire M962 weapon light kit was purchased in November. The light has not been installed and comes with a complete kit.

I have received a few guns from my Grandfather who was in WW2 stationed in England.

I dont know his story on this pistol and its too late to get it.

Hi-Standard Model B .22LR

This gun has been used and spent its life in and out of a holster.

31xxx serial number tells me it was shipped in 1937 according to my research.

It is not stamped with ""Property Of US""   However I heard the early training models for WW2 soldiers were not stamped.

It does have finish wear but not too bad.  Still a presentable piece.

I havent fired it but all the action seems good. Im sure it will operate fine.


Im just looking for cash or trade offers.   This might be a good chance to get this model with out a bidding war.

Thanks"

Other users on Armslist warned me, in general, about wiring money or sending payment online. Thanks. I already was aware but it's good to know.

(3)
The seller, glockperfection, *may* have sent me sexually explicit messages to me as well. I filed a complaint against the services which he may have used to these send vulgar messages to me. 

(4)
Glockperfection23 was supposed to contact a FFL before getting back to me about transferring the TASER. Instead, he claimed to Armslist that I made a low-ball offer and never returned with the follow up information. In previous sales, I never had to go through a FFL for a TASER. 

(5)
Other sellers on armslist have provided me with photos of the *actual* items for sale (not stock photos) and in some cases they have even provided me with videos to prove that *their* items for sale work as advertised. ""Jay G"", glockperfection23 has not provided me with any photos or videos. Why not?

When I first got it, it was defective (would not chamber shells), and so it was returned to Mossberg for repair. I got it back a couple of months ago. I have since cycled several shells through it to verify that it functions correctly, but I've still never gotten a chance to take it out to shoot.

I bought it as a home defense weapon, and it would be excellent for that purpose - short barrel, pistol grip, Mossberg 500 reliability/customizability. I'm just not comfortable using a weapon for defense that I haven't practiced thoroughly with - so this one has sat unloaded on my shelf, waiting on me to take it out and practice with it.

The shotgun will come in the original box, with manual, lock, etc., just as it came from Mossberg originally. I will also include the small amount of ammunition I have for it - 25 rounds of birdshot, 10 rounds of 00 buck.

This sale will be done in compliance with all state and federal laws:

    You will be required to show proof of residency in the state of Georgia.

    While the state does not impose an age limit on shotgun ownership, I will not sell the gun to anyone under 18.

    You will also be required to either show a carry permit or sign a bill of sale attesting to the fact that you are not disqualified from owning a firearm.

Asking $350 OBO. Willing to take cash, or will trade for gold/silver coins and bullion.

We offer a wide assortment of services to improve the performance out of your rifle.

All metal work is performed on precision lathes and not with hand tools.  We can handle any job from a deep clean to a full blown custom build.

Complete builds are guaranteed to shoot 1/2 MOA groups and many have reported 1/4 MOA with hand loads.

We offer many more services and can customize your build for your needs.  Feel free to send a note and let us know what we can do to help.  If you have an existing action you'd like to build we can help with that...  Using your existing action we can blueprint and install a match grade barrel starting at 800.  You tell us the contour;twist;caliber; and length and we can build it!  I have plenty of more pics if needed...

We are now offering Model 7 small bolt face builds.  Pricing will start at 1,000 for a blue printed barreled action with a match grade Shilen chrome barrel.  You choice caliber (small bolt face only - the .222 parent case family); contour and length.

I have for sale my Sig 516 AR Pistol with 7.5"" barrel. This gun has less than 20 rounds through it. (Iâve only shot it once to zero it and the Eotech.) Itâs been a safe queen ever since and Iâve got a project Iâm tying to fund around the house, so itâs time to let her go. 

Price listed is for the *Gun and Magpul stuff I put on it, ambi-safety and anti rotational pins, the SB-15 Brace, and one 30 round PMag and the factory 10 rounder it came with ONLY.* If you are interested in the full set up in the pictures (Eotech, Surefire X300 Ultra w/ tail switch (not pictured), and Haley Strategic Thorntail Offset Mount) the price will be $1900. Not really interested in trades at the moment, but if you think what you have is worth the trade let me know, particularly if it is an AK!  I'll also entertain all serious offers for purchase.

Iâm willing to met with a potential buyer within a reasonable distance from Mt. Vernon and a peek at the good guy cards is a must. If you do not possess those, i.e. a CPL/WAC card, WA issued Driver's license, or a badge; a bill of sale is a must. Thanks for looking."
