While I have not fired this shotgun, the lever action is smooth and crisp. The bore is nice and clean free from any rusting or pitting, the metal is in excellent condition with a nice patina with no pitting or rust. There are a few shiny spots and a slight scratch on the barrel, again, no rust or pitting. The front sight looks like most of the gold coloring has been worn off. The stock and forearm look to be original and are in excellent condition, including the finish. It does have a name lightly carved in it on the left side of the stalk. Since there are scratches on the frame and some damage to the screw heads it is apparent that someone worked on the gun at some point in time. Based on the overall condition the gun I suspect (but don’t know) that it was refinished (after the screw damage had occurred). Please write me with any questions, requests for more pictures or to make an offer.
I am a private seller, not a firearms expert, dealer or FFL holder. This gun has been described to the best of my ability and knowledge.
This is being sold AS-IS, with no warranty expressed or implied.  All sales are final and no trades are accepted. The preferred payment is cash at the time of pick-up and no FFL is required.

I'm the original owner and the pistol has approximately 1300 rounds through it with ZERO malfunctions. The pistol comes with two factory H&K barrels, .40S&W and .357 Sig. The pistol, barrels, and magazines are all made in Germany and the German .357 Sig Barrel was very difficult for me to find, but the quality is second to none. In addition, I sent the pistol to renowned H&K gunsmith Bill Springfield to further smooth and refine the LEM trigger for accuracy and consistency. This is a VERY accurate compact carry pistol. With .357 Sig, I can easily tag steel targets at 50-75yrds which makes for an ideal woods or hiking gun. Here's what's included:- P2000SK V2 Pistol with custom Bill Springfield gun smithing- Two barrels: .40S&W and .357 Sig- 3 German made subcompact magazines and 2 German made extended magazines - Tritium night sights- H&K compact laser aiming device- Two IWB holsters, one from Theiss and the other from Peter's Custom Holsters- One OWB Serpa holster - Carrying case with documentation and multi size backstrap.- I think I have a set of spare sights I'll toss in if I can confirmFull disclosure: the pistol has some holster wear marks near the muzzle (see pics).Price for the package is $550 or best offer. TRADES CONSIDERED: Classic WWII rifles (Garand/Mauser/Enfield), 10mm pistols, quality 1-6 or 1-4 variable power optics, HK or CZ pistols, CMMG Mutant rifle, nice AK rifles, or a CZ 527 rifle in 7.62x39. I shoot lots of different weapon platforms from combloc pistols and rifles like 5.45x39 AK74's to Noveske Recce rifles to lever actions, so make me an offer. Of course it goes without saying, but +\- cash is expected to offset a lopsided trade on either side. Please no offers for lawn mowers or non-working hot tubs, lol.tags: P30SK VP9SK"

I'm open to traveling north to Bellingham, south to Marysville. Buyer pays transfer at FFL of your choice in that area. At the moment, I'm not looking to ship the gun anywhere.In the interest of disclosure, there is writing on the book from a previous owner that indicates the handgun may have been sent in to Beretta USA for service relating to the hammer drop lever/thumb safety. The thumb safety currently functions as intended in all positions (fires when not engaged, drops the hammer, disconnects the trigger, and rotates the rear half of the firing pin when engaged)Because of a growing number of flakes and people who do not maintain contact, I will not be holding this for anybody.
