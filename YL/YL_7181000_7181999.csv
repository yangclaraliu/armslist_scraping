There are a few tiny nicks in the bottom edges of the slide, and multiple tiny dings scattered over the sides and underside of the slide, with light handling marks scattered over the frame. There are also wear marks through the finish on the bottom edge of the frame on the left side just above the trigger. The serrations on the slide are sharp except for a tiny ding in one of the edges on the right side. The hammer and recoil spring plug checkering shows light wear. The safety checkering shows moderate wear and the slide release checkering is sharp to the touch. The screw heads are sharp except for the upper screw on the right side, which is distressed. The markings are clear except for the proof mark on the barrel, which was lightly struck. Overall, this handgun rates in about Good to Very Good condition."

It can sometimes be difficult to carry very many extra magazines without taking up a lot of space. We developed these mag carriers to solve this problem. We also made the two screws on the side adjustable so the user can configure their desired retention. These mag carriers also feature an enlarged opening for easier re-insertion of magazines under stress. They are not tuckable. Contact Information: PM herePictures: attached"
