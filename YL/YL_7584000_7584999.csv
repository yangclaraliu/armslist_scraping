I borrowed the sights but i can either include them or trade a used Troy Viking tactics hand guard with adjustable rail sections that I swapped off another rifle. This rifle is never been fired and still has all factory lube on it. If I don’t get what I want for it which is a loss for what I paid I will keep it as a long term investment I have only seen one lt6720r for sale lately and they want $1300 for it and it isn’t the limited batch with the Rogers super stock. This could be my mistake but I want a 9mm carbine right now. Text or call at REDACTED. I’m dropping the price from $950 to $850 for Christmas after New Years I will be removing listing and building something different. I might be willing to sell upper by itself for right price it has light weight 16” barrel free float 10” hand guard low pro gas block. Make offer."

I purchased this pistol brand new from my local FFL and have not done anything with it and prefer other firearms that I own over this one. On that note I will say I do not need to sell this but am testing the waters. Worst case scenario I put the pistol back in the safe. Again, the pistol has not been holstered, fired, or even loaded. Included with the sale are the following items: Glock 17 Gen 4 FDE, four factory FDE backstraps, extended trigger pin for said backstraps, three 17 round factory Glock magazines, Glock “Speed” Loader, Glock hard Case with lock and paperwork, new in the box Wilson Combat/ Vicker’s Tactical Battlesights with a black Rear and Tritium front, a Bastion custom slide plate that reads “Veritas Aequitas”, a full box of Hornady Critical Duty +P ammo, a carbon fiber kydex right hand holster from SAS Custom Holsters that has adjustable retention with a fixed 20 degree forward cant and can be switched between inside and outside the waist wear, a Uplula Speed loader, a TruGlo Glock front sight tool, and a MGW Glock Rear Sight Pusher Tool. All in all I have roughly $1,000 in all of the above but like I stated previously, I have not found a use for the 17 and I’m starting to move away from Glocks. My price is 100% FIRM and more than fair at $700 cash. I will consider selling the pistol and holster for $460 cash firm. If you don’t like my prices, be an adult, keep scrolling and move on with your day. Buyer must meet in Mason as no shows seem far too common on here, cash only, you must present an Ohio Driver’s License at time of sale (fellow CCW holders take priority) and all local and federal laws apply. If you are seriously interested please reply to ad and I will contact you ASAP. Thanks *** TRADES WILL NOT BE RESPONDED TO*********Prices listed are NON-NEGOTIABLE*****"

All you'll need to finish is a drill press, barrel of your choice and the internals that go along with it. The frame is marked, but as it's not completed, it's still is not considered a firearm per the ATF, and no FFL is required. Thank you!Edit: On a side note, this stuff is brand new, I took it out of the mailing package to inventory it and that's it. That being said, I don't NEED to sell it, it'll just sit until I can get the required tooling. Low ball offers will not be responded to.
