Comes as seen with one modified and one improved choke tube. Both are extended tubes.  Also includes a 3.5"" to 4"" ""extension"" that includes a Skeet choke and Improved Cylinder choke, vent rib and bead.  Not sure what the purpose of this custom addition was.
 
$800 cash in Round Rock or Pflugerville. Despite the low prices, this shotgun is not beat up junk and is priced based on what I paid for it.  This is a very good price for a Beretta O/U.  A new one is close to 3 times and a newer one in a little bit better shape would be at least 1.5 times what I'm asking.  Not interested in any trades.

Kick-off recoil reduction system plus Microcore recoil pad. 6.6lbs unloaded. New ""S Grip"" checkering. GunPod2 From Beretta: ""The Beretta A400 Lite Synthetic is a hunting shotgun that does it all--and that doesn’t mind playing hard and getting dirty. After a demanding day upland hunting in the tall grass, waterfowling in the marshes or breaking clays at the range, the A400 is just as happy being tossed in the back of the truck for the drive home. It is not simply a black synthetic version of the A400 family, as it incorporates a boatload of special features like cross-tube piston giving you a 4+1 shot capacity, a new checkering pattern for better gripping, advanced recoil reduction, light weight, Optima HP choke system and the revolutionary smartphone-compliant Gunpod 2 to keep track of (and share!) your shooting activities. It is a workhorse--but a workhorse with an impressive pedigree. Fast, Versatile, Light and Low-Recoiling With its Blink gas-operating system, the A400 is the fastest semiauto action on the market, capable of delivering 4 shots in less than one second. Just as importantly, its 3” chamber will reliably feed and fire different-purpose shells (2 ½” or 3”) from heavy-hitting rounds to light target loads. And as an all-purpose shotgun, it combines low weight (6.6 lbs) with low recoil, so that it can be easily carried around on the most strenuous adventures without ever being punishing on the shoulder. This is because it sports two advanced recoil-reducing devices--the Kick-Off system within the buttstock (which absorbs up to 50% of recoil) as well as a super-soft, no-snag Micro Core recoil pad. Easy and Low-Maintenance In the hands, the A400 Lite Synthetic feels like an extension of your body. Beretta has researched and created a new “S Grip” checkering pattern that gives you a wonderfully-positive hold (even with gloves) while being much easier to wipe clean than conventional checkering. An adjustable shim system also enables you to customize the fit for drop and cast, while a highly-visible fiberoptic sight at the end of the gun’s ventilated rib helps you keep your eyes on the target. The A400 action is self-cleaning, so it requires much less maintenance than any other shotgun you’ll ever own; but when you take this gun apart you’ll be amazed by the intuitive simplicity of the tool-free field-stripping process and by what little maintenance the A400 Lite Synthetic requires. GunPod2: Your Digital Hunting Diary The A400 Lite Synthetic comes with a built-in GunPod2 unit, a Bluetooth-compliant electronic unit that transmits all the information you want about your hunt to a smartphone app (included). This cool device lets you create a map of your hunt, drop a pin where you took your best shots, help you remember where the game was and immortalize each shot with a photo, video, or note. You can also instantly share any part of this on Facebook and other social-media venues, so that your buddies who stayed home can see what they missed. In all, the A400 Lite Synthetic is a modern, dynamic, sporty do-it-all that is eager to share your adventures and help you brag about them."" Comes new in box with: 3 chock tubes w/ wrench, LOP extension shim, cast/drop shims, sling swivels, oil, manuals. contact me if you are ready to buy now, and i will ship once payment is made."

Lever on it for quicker reloads.  This gun will also come with a new 30 round gen3 P-mag.  If shipped I will only send to FFL licensed dealers in the area. I will not send it to a scammer trying to claim they have their own FFL license.  I am in no rush to sell the gun and not hard up on money so no low ball offers.  Only selling because I have more ARs that I use.  Thanks.Will also listen to trades.
