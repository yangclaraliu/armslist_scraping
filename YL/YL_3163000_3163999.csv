 The only reason I'm selling it is because my SR-22 doesn't like the stuff out of the bulk pack so keep that in mind when buying. My 10/22 and my buddy's revolver shot it just fine but at least 1 out of every 10 rd mag shot through my SR-22 was a misfire. Have not tried to shoot  the others because I found some CCI. Unfortunately I paid about 10 cents rd so if I can't get that I will just shoot them anyway."

142,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3163142,For Sale:  Dan Wesson ECO .45 ACP,"Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, United States","$ 1,250","Listed On: Wednesday, June 11, 2014",Handguns,Dan Wesson                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed. 

This is a lightly used in  great condition .45 ACP by Dan Wesson. It comes with  2 mags  but I have extras I will include. It will also come with a Crimson Trace Laser grip model LG-404-P9 and original grip as well. Feel free to ask about my other guns I am  selling as well. I have 2 other .45 ACP pistols and 2 rifles along with ammo for all. I am selling everything I own in the gun and ammo dept.

It hung out beside my bed for the last 5 years and made some trips to the range but never saw any hard use.  Comes with the factory forend and the nut to secure it with.  

The short action tubes (6 1/2"") are a little cheaper and easier to come by.  I was looking up prices for the long tubes (without forend or nut) and they were ranging from $65 to $75 (before shipping) for just the slide assembly tube.

Everything is as it came from the factory except, I did add a, still unused, Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic (as shown in the pics). 

This is not an ""economy"" or entry level AR. This was custom made by PSA per my specifications. It has only the best components and various high up upgrades typically found in top level AR platforms (like POF, LWRC, etc.). 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of the best AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests? 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rG8xXfDbg

This is the premium model, meaning it has such components as the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged) barrel, chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made by FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a Colt and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint. This AR has many upgrades, making it that much more reliable, easier to clean, etc. 

 To recap, here is everything included in this package:
 - Premium Model Carbine, chambered in 5.56/.223
- CHF (Cold Hammer Forged) barrel with chrome lined barrel and chamber (1 in 7 twist – can stabilize any available 5.56//223 round out there).
 - Upgraded ACT trigger group (makes the trigger pull much smoother and crisper for increased accuracy and rate of fire)
- Upgraded NiB (Nickel Boron) complete BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) – NiB is self-lubricating and much easier to clean than standard chrome lined BCG’s. 
 - Upgraded MagPul hand guard and rear BUS (Back up Sight)
 - Upgraded VLTOR BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle (Extremely well made, durable, and much easier to charge the weapon in adverse/stressful situations)
 - Brand New Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic. Mounted and co-witnessed with sights
- New BlackHawk modular carrying case – plenty of room for extras, like mags, ammo, etc. 
 - Everything was fully installed and tested at the factory, with the exception of the optic which I added later, but never used.
- Owner’s manual and original box that it came in from the factory


 Price for the entire package is $995 OBO. No trades.

Everything is as it came from the factory except, I did add a, still unused, Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic (as shown in the pics). 

This is not an ""economy"" or entry level AR. This was custom made by PSA per my specifications. It has only the best components and various high up upgrades typically found in top level AR platforms (like POF, LWRC, etc.). 

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of the best AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests? 

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2rG8xXfDbg

This is the premium model, meaning it has such components as the CHF (Cold Hammer Forged) barrel, chrome lined pretty much everything, etc. The barrel for this firearm is made by FN (the same barrel that is used for the S.A.W. fully auto machine gun that the US Military uses. You can't find a more dependable and quality AR, with this many high end features, anywhere near this price point...period! I have a Colt and a Daniel Defense AR15 as well, and this PSA is easily on par with both these rifles from a quality standpoint. This AR has many upgrades, making it that much more reliable, easier to clean, etc. 

 To recap, here is everything included in this package:
 - Premium Model Carbine, chambered in 5.56/.223
- CHF (Cold Hammer Forged) barrel with chrome lined barrel and chamber (1 in 7 twist – can stabilize any available 5.56//223 round out there).
 - Upgraded ACT trigger group (makes the trigger pull much smoother and crisper for increased accuracy and rate of fire)
- Upgraded NiB (Nickel Boron) complete BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) – NiB is self-lubricating and much easier to clean than standard chrome lined BCG’s. 
 - Upgraded MagPul hand guard and rear BUS (Back up Sight)
 - Upgraded VLTOR BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle (Extremely well made, durable, and much easier to charge the weapon in adverse/stressful situations)
 - Brand New Vortex Strikefire Red/Green dot optic. Mounted and co-witnessed with sights
- New BlackHawk modular carrying case – plenty of room for extras, like mags, ammo, etc. 
 - Everything was fully installed and tested at the factory, with the exception of the optic which I added later, but never used.
- Owner’s manual and original box that it came in from the factory


 Price for the entire package is $995 OBO. No trades.

This gun takes a .308 cartridge. The scope has a minor default in manufacturing, at 6.5 zoom there is a TINY black spec in the upper left of the scope, when you change the zoom it shifts out of the scope. Leupold covers manufactures defaults and said they could fix it but it was never big enough issue for me to send it in. The gun also comes with a padded sling and bipod and buttstock round sleeve.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corp, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator

Just a quick down and dirty this is a semi auto only civilian version of the military MK series aka SCAR series in 5.56. It is gas piston with an adjustable gas regulator, adjustable and folding butt-stock, flip up iron sights, all controls are ambidextrous with the exception of the bolt catch/bolt release, the charging handle does reciprocate but may be swapped to either side, and has a 16 inch hard chrome lined barrel. 

http://www.fnhusa.com/l/products/carbines/scar-series/scar-16s/

The above link will take you to FNH's page for more details on the SCAR 16. 

I personally really enjoy this rifle, the SCAR series to me is extremely versatile and well built. I have two other ARs both in 5.56 and it is for this reason that I am currently on the hunt for a SCAR 17 in FDE. Full disclosure, I am trying to sell this rifle so that I can get my hands on a SCAR 17 by hopefully only spending a little bit of money. 

I will trade for a SCAR 17 in FDE with a little extra cash on my end, otherwise this rifle is $2,300.00. Face to face deals only and I am willing to travel a bit if it is within reason. Thank you for checking this out.

All are in excellent to absolutely mint condition.

The Western is in very condition and used little. The Uncle Henry has been used very little it is in excellent condition with only one real blemish on the back of the grip by the guard. The Buck Kalinga Is in excellent condition and was used very little. The Kershaw 1030 is brand new in original box never used with a lifetime warranty, the Kershaw 1050 was used only once and sharpened once on a camping trip and also has lifetime warranty. The sheaths do show scuff marks from being stored together in a box and moved across country a few times. The Kershaw’s are all out of production and increasing in value every day. The Western is a pre Coleman- Western which has now been bought out by Camillus knives the photo of the blade shows the worse of the imperfections. although it does have some imperfections this knife is still in excellent condition and retains over 99% of original blade. It has not been ground down like many you see out there. The buck Kalinga is USA made and I believe the new ones are also made in China. Here is your chance to get 5 very collectable knives all in one place. I am only selling these knives to thin out a huge knife collection, running out of room in my safe. I will consider an offer but don't insult me with some insane low price. These knives are worth much more than i am asking for them. All for $400.00 OBO. Make a reasonable offer you never know.
