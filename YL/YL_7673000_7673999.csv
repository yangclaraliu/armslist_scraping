The generous, parallax-free, sight picture and forgiving eyebox gets shooters on target effortlessly--even in high-stress scenarios.Rear facing power and illumination intensity controls are easy to access, simple to operate, stay visually present from the shooting position and are protected from incidental contact. Twelve intensity levels let you adjust to perfectly match ambient light conditions. Runs off a single, common, AAA battery. The DRT (Dual Ring Tactical) reticle is etched directly on the prism to assure consistent point-of-aim at all times-- regardless of whether or not the illumination is engaged. An additional yardage-marked turret cap (ballistic-matched to the 5.56 cartridge) allows the shooter to swap out the factory-installed cap for rapid dialing of known-distance shots out to 700 yards.At 11.2 ounces, the lightweight Spitfire AR excels in close to medium range shooting applications where speed is of the essence, making it the ideal choice for AR shooters who needs to get on target fast.

The P226 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P226 SAO variant brings the same feature set to the table in a single-action only package. The addition of the SIG Master Shop Super Match Flat Trigger provides exceptional feel and consistent trigger pull regardless of finger placement. The SAO is available in 9 mm."

Its not for tiny people...its easily handled, but will make an inexperienced shooter jumpy.

It also will shoot 38 special once you finish the break in period. Ive only used FP10 oil on it for cleaning. Its an amazing weapon folks. I waited 3 months to get this, and its not even a year old. You can get one today! No trades, no low-balling. Serious folks only. Im Pricing this for all tha add ons as well, it originally cost me $2200 to have made this way. I will also throw in a leather holster and all the 357 ammo I have (I think its around 100 rounds, will check tonight and email whomever messages me) as part of the sale."

Agency Arms remove the finger grooves, add ""Accelerator Cuts"" to the front of the frame, and bevel out the inside area of the trigger guard on a mill. Accelerator Cuts, an after-market weapon customization service, offer enhanced traction on the pistol. With the Accelerator Cuts, muzzle rise is dramatically decreased and follow up shots are faster. They do a non traditional double undercut and dock the front of the trigger guard for aesthetic purposes. They finish the frame off with full stippling.

This rifle has around 100 rounds through it, and everything is perfect working order. The rifle also comes with a trigger job I got done at Briley (3 lb. pull)… sorry can’t remember off the top of my head, but I think it may have been a Jewell Trigger; but it was done by Briley, so whatever they used, I’m sure it was quality parts. Rifle barrel is 26” long, stainless/fluted and free floating. More details can be found on Weatherby's website.For the cherry on top, I have mounted a Scmidt & Bender - Klassik 4-16x50mm hunting scope. The scope comes mounted with a quality two-piece base (0 MOA) and rings; again, purchased and installed by Briley. The reticle is A8 and is seated in the first focal plane and will change in size according to magnification. The scope has been bore sighted and dialed in for a 200 yard zero. This scope is truly the best of the best. If you have never used or looked through a Schmidt & Bender, you’re in for a real treat, if you have, you understand….More info. can be found be found on Schmidt & Bender's website.I am also including several boxes of factory ammunition I have used over the years. The Federal-Barnes 180 gr. MRX bullets are a special treat, they are a bonded, ballistic tip bullet with a Tungsten core. This translates to extreme penetration for even the toughest hides, and awesome knock down power. These rounds were $75 a box new, and are no longer made due to cost.This setup has been my go to hunting rig for the last several years, and as such I have babied it accordingly. After every hunting season, it has been cleaned and stored in a climate controlled gun safe. Everything is in perfect working order, and while it has been used, it has not been abused, so you will NOT find scratches, nicks, etc. I am reluctantly giving up this amazing combination to help fund a new lover affair in a different caliber.New, the rifle (in right-hand only) runs right around $2,000. The scope also runs right at $2,000 online. Also included: trigger job, base & rings, ammo. Price is 2,800.00 OBO.Please feel free to contact me with questions or for more detailed pictures."

With the light weight and short barrel, this feels and handles more like an AR15 than the vast majority of longer, heavier FALs out there, yet has waaay more stopping power and knockdown ability with the .308/7.62 cartridge. Early serial numbers indicate this was produced in the early 2000's, when LMT (Lewis Machine and Tool) was manufacturing high quality FALs for DSA with only the best parts and attention to detail. It has been well documented that since DSA took over, quality has suffered and finding a good functioning and accurate rifle is hit or miss.

Very few early .32 Autos survive today with any real condition to speak of, this rare and desirable example retains most of the factory blue finish, including the fire-blued trim parts which have great clarity and color. The slide shows the majority of wear with some thinning to the sharp edges, scattered handling marks and light-strike roll markings.
