Has barely even been touched and is still like brand new. I have more pictures I can send in an email. It comes in the original case with the wrapping plastic, price tag, warning tag, manual, SIG sticker, cable lock and two eight round magazines. Would make a perfect all around 9mm for EDC but I usually prefer a revolver for that role so I'm just listing it for trade to change it up since I don't use it but I would definitely have no complaints about keeping it if nothing comes along. I will be using one of my personal transfers only for mine since I have them to use plus its not on the list anyway but I have no problem still meeting at a FFL if you need one and can use one for your transfer. All Federal and MA laws will be followed. If you have any questions just ask. Thanks."
