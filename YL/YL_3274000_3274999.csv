Here is a Romanian contract Model 1934 Beretta military pistol assembled in 1941, as indicated by the markings on the left side of the slide, and with two original WWII Beretta magazines. The back of the right side of the frame displays Romanian armory mark, ""CM"". 
NO import markings!
CONDITION: Excellent, with 97-98% of original blue still on the metal. All matching serial numbers (frame, slide, barrel). Fine bore with strong and shiny rifling. Very smooth action. Difficult to find pistol without the import marks! Caliber: 9 mm Short (.380 ACP, marked on barrel). Two WWII Beretta magazines with thin metal floor plates and no other markings, both in like new condition (as is the pistol!).

This Beretta model 1934 pistol offered here was manufactured for the Romanian military in 1941. In August of 1940, the Romanian military placed a contract with Beretta for 61,000 model 1934 pistols. This contract specified that the pistols were to be delivered within seven months. The first of these pistols was not delivered until February of 1941 due to the shortage of steel and Romania's failure to send Beretta the entire fund amount for the pistols. Beginning in February of 1941, Beretta delivered 10,000 pistols with the promise of 5,000 more per month until the total contract was filled. By August of 1941, Beretta had sent a total of 40,000 pistols, but the remaining 21,000 were never delivered. This means that there are less then 40,000 of these pistols in existence today. The first of these Romanian contract pistols can be identified with a 0(zero) at the beginning of the 5 digit serial number. The Romanian contract pistols are identical to the Italian model 1934 versions except that the slide is marked 9 SCURT instead of 9mm Corto as seen in the pictures below. These Romanian model 1934 pistols were normally issued to the Romanian officers 
during WW2.

The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.



This one was bought a few years back.  I didn’t have a lot of budget to practice with .357 Sig back then so it just sat around in my safe.  I never carried it (even though that was what I bought it for).  I shot it recently, and put some nice trijicon sights on it about a month ago, and put about 2 boxes through it. 


I realized it just isn’t my favorite gun and since I don’t carry it and go the range pretty rarely these days, I didn’t need it taking up safe space.  


Includes the original box, I have a holster for it that I would put it in inside the safe and one mag (all it came with). 


These are pretty rare birds to come across in .357 sig from the Sig factory (not just a .40 with a conversion barrel dropped in).  I love the caliber but I have a few other larger guns in it that I prefer to shoot at the range.  This is one to the .357 Sigs with the German made frame, and Italian magazine.  


So I’m going to let this one go, I do really enjoy how smooth and well made the gun is, it is also extremely easy to break down and clean.  The single stack setup is really very nice and something so thin is very easy to control with full power .357 sig rounds which is a pretty difficult balancing act.  

I just want it to go to a home where someone may use it more than I do.  

I'm not interested in any trades at this point.

Please email me with any questions/offers, etc. 

Thanks for looking!"

Used is ok, but dont want abused, no bent blades, broken tips, broken handles, resharpened poorly, nothing like that would interest me. Would like a good sheath but that is not a deal breaker.

I bought this a few months ago, put a few boxes of ammo through it, and then upgraded to the very nice Heinie Straight Eight night sights as soon as they came out (this is one of the first sets available, ordered directly from Heinie and the sales person told me it was the 2nd set they had ever sent out).  The sights are $150 installed, they are not cheap in anyway.  Put a few rounds through it to see the point of aim and have had it sitting in my safe since.  

It is a very, very nice gun, and the size is about perfect for a carry gun.  The .380 round is also extremely nice to shoot, it shoots like a much bigger gun (easy to control and low recoil) and you can put about as many shots into a dinner plate sized group as fast as you can pull the trigger.  I simply don’t carry it and wanted to see if someone else was interested in picking it up who may carry it.  

The sights really make the gun much better, I replace all of the plastic Glock sights with metal ones and I have been using the Heinie’s pretty much exclusively for the past few years as they are some of the nicest sights available.  I also have a nice inside the waistband holster I will include, I test fit it and put it in the safe along with the 42.  

I prefer to sell this one locally so I’m going to have to see your permit, etc.  I don’t mind shipping it at the buyer’s expense if I must, I have had many successful transactions on Armslist doing so.  Local deals just take less time is all.

It has little plastic pieces you can cut out for belt size.  I cut out to accommodate my belt that is 1.5 inches.  If you have a belt that is 1"" this would be too loose now since the cut out.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER:

P2000

The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a ""closed"" accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.

Available in 9 mm and .40 S&W."

But I decided to buy it anyway (AND also have them ship a 22-250 right away-- for $30 off ;).  So I decided to get the 22-250 WITH the factory Axis scope (even though I have another scope I am using for the 22-250) so I could take it off, and put in on this 223 for my nephew (I thought).  I then offered this 223 to my brother for his son and he said ""no""- (nephew isn't into rifles.)

So this is new in the box (with everything that came in the box), and it now has the SAME Kaspa 3-9x cope they sell as a package deal (with the newer Axis II models all the way up to the 30-06).  $310 gets me my cost, FFL fee and $40 for the scope (that cost $100 new).

I already have an Axis 223 (and love it) so I don't need another 223.  Savage sells the same rifle with this exact scope (for the entire line of Axis rifles).  So this is a standard model with the Kaspa scope added by me.  And the attached picture is the group I shot last year with this exact SAME 223 model at 175 yrds (with factory ammo).  These barrels are AMAZING.

This was the LAST Saddle Ring Cabine EVER MADE by the US Military, and only have of the 60K models have the saddle ring. From the research I've done, This Rifle definitely saw action in both the Cuban Revolt and the Philippine Insurrection. Also, according to Springfield Armory Research (I have the doc umentation) the rough riders that requested (after the war) to buy back their Krag Carbines ran From Serial Numbers 
23000 - 38000, with a few of the reservists who were in the unit but did not see action being issued later models in the last 60,000 serials produced. This Model is the MOST RARE of all the Krags, Especially given its serial number and the fact that it has the original Saddle Ring. Also, indicative of the Earliest releases of this Model, they were not roll-marked ""Model 1896"", just ""1896 Springfield Armory"" because they had literally rushed to get these out to Roosevelt under his political pressure. While Springfield has no ABSOLUTE proof of serial number issuance, except for those soldiers (some 100 or so) who wrote in requesting their specific (by serial number) rifle to buy after the war, this rifle falls right in the middle of the range of serial numbers issued to The 1st Us Volunteer Cavalry, 3rd US Cavalry, and the 10th US Cavalry........The Units Present and Engaged in action at the Battle of San Juan Hill.
Asking $3500 or best offer.....will also accept partial trade, specifically looking for an M1A and $2000 would take this home.
This rifle, its bore, furniture, and metal finish is in as pristine condition as can be expected for a rifle that saw action in TWO major wars, and is over 110 years old. It is chambered in .30-40 Krag or .30 US, the FIRST standardized Smokeless Powder US Military Cartridge (10 Rounds Available with Rifle for Display or shooting) and is a true part of both my Families, AND The History of the Early American West, The Us Military, The ROugh Riders, and a True American Hero, Theodore Roosevelt.

I was hesitant to do so but I fell in love with it INSTANTLY. For a .45 bullet, it barely had any recoil considering the size of the gun and the caliber of round. I let my Marine buddy shoot it (he only carry's .45 1911's because that's what he used in Beirut in combat and he swears by them due to his 1st hand knowledge of their knock down power). When he fired the 1st 2 rounds out of my XDS .45 he immediately dropped the magazine out and removed a round to verify that it was indeed a .45. That's how impressive the lack of recoil is!

Now, when the 9mm versions came out I still had to have one. Fantastic gun! No complaints! It is identical in size to my other XDS but slightly lighter in weight. It has less recoil than my Glock 26 9mm. The .45 holds 5 + 1 unless you get the extended magazine, if so it's 7 + 1.

The 9mm is a standard 7 + 1, unless you get the extended mag which makes it 9 + 1. I am a Glock die hard until the day that I die, and I will ALWAYS own my G-23 .40 cal, but when it comes to carrying concealed, you CAN NOT beat the comfort of the XDS' single stack magazine! For regular every day carrying I will always carry my XDS .45! A wise man once told me that when carrying concealed, ""The gun should be comforting, not comfortable"". I have always carried with that in the back of my mind but after owning both of these XDS' I know that I can have the best of both worlds.

I love both weapons, but I will continue to carry my .45 (new personal preference). Therefore I'm selling the 9mm version. It is brand new, in mint condition. I only put 2 mags through it to verify accuracy and reliability. 14 rounds all on paper from 15 yards, and all kill shots. I'm selling for the same price that I purchased it for. Reason being, you are saving on tax, AND it's a private sale which means that Uncle Sam can mind his own business. It is a wash for both of us, and it's private. Best of both worlds. I will require proof of a Washington Drivers License, and your WA Concealed Carry permit to verify that I'm not selling to a felon."

Completely ambidextrous and capable of converting to 7.62x39 with only a few interchangeable parts. I encourage you to check out the video ad SIG put out of the rifle for a better description if you haven't already seen it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdTuJ27vEeQ

I purchased the rifle new a few months ago and have put about 200 rounds down the barrel. Very accurate, easy to operate, and reliable.

Uses a 16 inch barrel w/ 1/7 twist
Swiss style folding stock w/ removable cheek riser
Folding back up iron sights
Uses standard AR/M16 GI mags
Gas piston operation--feels like a perfect marriage of the best of AR and AK attributes.

As a side note, one of the torx screws on the top rail is slightly stripped due to me being dumb upon initial disassembly and using the wrong sized wrench. I later found out that this screw (1 of 4) doesn't do anything but hold the top rail on and isn't even a part that needs to come out unless you are doing serious mechanical work on the rifle (i.e. gunsmithing). Easy fix (10 cents maybe?), I just haven't got around to it.

Other than that the rifle has been meticulously maintained and kept in a safe. The deal will include the original box, 1 magazine (negotiable based on the deal), single point sling--everything it originally came with. Let me know if you have any questions!"

The Lighting is all American muscle as well its a new Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens weapon light. This is the brightest light you have ever seen mounted to a weapon. Check out Elzetta on the web and this light on you tube. The light is sitting in a new Elzetta ZSM mount with side rail. These mounts are indestructible. The best part of this beast is a new Aimshot LS 8300 green laser. Try to find or buy one of these. They are restricted for military sales only. You can verify this with Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta. Its the brightest laser you have ever seen mounted to a rifle. You can even see the beam in day light and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS! This one was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO serving in Afghanistan.  This laser will defiantly get you put under the jail. Comes with 2 tail caps and zero tool one pressure and one click. The only other LS8300 I have ever seen sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and it didn't even have the factory mount! Thanks so much for looking and before you make a offer see what it would cost to duplicate this awesome AR."

It looks like this is a pre-ban(pre-1994) rifle. It comes with original wood furniture and the bolt does not look like its been ground(it measures 1.835 inches, or 46.6mm, exactly). sights were welded on straight, and are not bent in any way. The bore is bright and shiny, with very strong lands and grooves. There is some cosmetic blemishes on the rifle: small dings and scratches on the wood stock, some nicks on the receiver behind the ejection port, and some wear on the handguard sleeve(will show in picture). Overall its in pretty good condition. As for reliability, I've had 100% reliability out of this, not a single jam, failure to feed, etc. Shoots like a dream. Rifle will come with around 50 rounds of Federal 150 grain ammo. I checked to see if the rifle buggers up the casings upon ejection, and I never found any dent or scratch on any of them, but it does sling them about 40 feet from the shooter. inside parts are in excellent condition, and the rifle has a nice 7lb double stage trigger. comes with two mags, which function flawlessly, but have some surface rust on them. Im asking for 700 or best offer. You can contact me by phone at six-zero-one-four-seven-nine-three-three-five-six, or by email at REDACTED. Thanks for your time and have a great day.

Grenade launching spigot, blade bayonet, flip up night sight all that. I acquired this piece in unissued, unfired condition. Bluing 100%, stock perfect. It has been fired about 100 times and does not hang or slam fire like many SKS's I have fired. It has been carried around the farm and has weathered only a little bit. I have tested 20 rnd promags and ran them through without a problem. The unique part of this piece is the Tech Sights rear peep sight which is attached to the rear of the bolt cover, replacing the takedown pin with a flathead screw. This is a permanent modification to the rifle and you will never be able to use the standard sights again. The Yugos are tough guns and the standard rear leaf sight had to be cut off in order to make the sights work. It is a vastly superior sighting system, it does however slow down cleaning time as the take down pin is replaced with a screw that must be removed (an extra 20 seconds). This gun is by no means a beater but has been modified from it's original fantastic condition, so I am reducing the price from what you would normally see on a piece like this this days.
