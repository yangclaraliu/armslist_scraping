Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-dog-tag-folder-black-titanium-hndls-black-blade-plain-c188altibbkp/ Based on one of Serge Panchenko’s most popular custom designs, the Dog Tag Folder is a unique departure from Spyderco’s typical folding knife construction methods. Its single-sided handle is fabricated from solid titanium and accurately replicates the size and shape of a military dog tag. The center of the handle scale is machined to create an integral spring bar that houses a steel ball bearing for the blade’s detent mechanism. At the top of the handle is an aluminum back strap that defines the blade’s limits of travel in both the open and closed positions and provides protection from the edge when the knife is closed. The “business end” of the Dog Tag is a sheepfoot-style blade made from premium CPM® S30V® particle metallurgy stainless steel with a stonewashed finish. To protect the edge when closed, the blade is chisel ground with a single flat bevel on the front side—an unusual feature for a Spyderco knife. Our Trademark Round Hole™ in the blade allows easy opening, and a subtle swedge (unsharpened bevel) and a decorative fuller (groove) near the spine add a touch of style. The blade’s pivot is also accentuated by a round aluminum disk that provides stability and structural strength as well as an aesthetic touch. A non-locking folder, the Dog Tag’s blade is held in place in the open position by a detent mechanism. A ball bearing in the handle scale’s integral spring arm indexes holes in the tang of the blade to hold it both closed and open. Since the blade does not lock, care should be taken during use to apply cutting pressure only in a direction that maintains the knife’s open position. This version of the Dog Tag features a black anodized handle scale and black anodizing on the back strap and pivot pin disk.

SIG Sauer’s MCX Semiautomatic Tactical Rifle with Side Folding Stock adapts to almost any setting. Barrel length and telescoping stock configuration can be adjusted in the field. Gas-operated short-stroke piston system offers low recoil and reduced fouling. Fully closed and locked rotating bolt system, featuring a nickel-plated bolt and carrier, provides maximum safety in the event of an obstructed bore. Auto-regulating gas system means the piston position automatically adjusts based on system pressure allowing you to switch between subsonic (silenced) or supersonic (non-silenced) ammo. Rear-mounted charging handle won’t obstruct rail-mounted accessories. Familiar AR-style controls include ambidextrous selector, bolt release, magazine release and charging handle. Aluminum KeyMod handguard.
I've modified the gun with a Geissele Trigger 2 stage trigger (super sweet).  Great Gun with original paperwork and box. I’m the original owner.

For Sale - Very very good condition Sig P320C 9mm 3.9"" with Apex trigger DA/SA Black with Contrast Sights and ""M"" Lower. Comes with 6, 15rd Sig OEM magazines, original case (matching serial), Apex light weight flat trigger, original trigger with Sig OEM replaccment spring, gun lacok, and Sig OEM OWB holster. I would say like new, but when you look on the inside upper part of the slide, you will notice where the factory black has worn. While this is completely normal and expected, I do believe it makes it less than ""like new"". The rails and barrel are still shiny black and show no signs of wear at all - I'm a fan of grease even on poly pistols. According to the case, it was made on Oct 18, 2016 and of course, made in the USA. 
The P320C is the Compact - not the Carry. The Carry and the Compact vary by the number of rounds for the OEM magazines - 17 vs 15 and the Compact, the weight - the Compact is slightly lighter weight than the Carry when empty, and the height - the Compact is shorter than the Carry.This is a Gen 2 P320C 9mm. The main noticible difference is the slide catch is completely enclosed versus the Gen 1 where there was only a small 'slash' below the slide catch - a huge improvement over the Gen 1 IMO. I call them Gen 1 and Gen 2, not Sig. Sig Sauer makes no mention of the lower differences at all, so be aware if you're buying an X-Change Kit or want a different size lower. The FCU is not any different from what I can tell. Use = about 750 rounds of Speer Lawman and Gold Dot 124 are the only rounds ever used on this pistol. The 124 seems to be the sweet spot for the 9mm P320 and I’ve owned/own the Full-size, Carry, Compact, and Sub Compact. The pistol will sell with 6 - 15rd Sig magazines. Yes 6 and not knock-offs, but Sig brand magazines. If you see the orange dot on the front blade, that is NOT an updated sight. I used epoxy day glow orange paint on the standard factory sights. It make target acquisition much faster but it’s only paint and not an upgraded sight. This is a very well taken care of firearm, which you will realize as soon as you see it. Also comes with an updated flat Apex trigger and spring. I also have the original trigger as well as another new in bag Sig factory trigger spring, in case you want to send it back for repair etc. it’s a Sig so Lifetine Warranty! Includes the P320C 9mm 2nd Gen pistol, original case, owners manual, OEM trigger with new OEM trigger srping, 6 15rd Sig magazines, and gun lock. Price is rock solid $475. I don’t like negotiating price and this is by far a very fair price for this setup. No trades, no shipping, cash only, in person only.So so why am I selling? I bought a P226 Legion. I still have my P320CA (Carry) 9mm Carry that I use for EDC - it also has the Apex flar trigger. I live on James Island and prefer you come to my house for sale. I can also meet at my work in Mount Pleasant. You will need to bring your current CWP or a valid SC Drivers License."

It has a JP Enterprises bolt and is fantastic at ringing steel out to 800. It's a little heavy for hunting, but it'll put hair on your chest. There's nothing wrong with the rifle (other than a semi-auto 308 is expensive to feed). Honestly, I'm just selling it in order to build an M40 clone; I want something with a little more accuracy (this is a 1 to 1.5 MOA rifle depending on ammo, handloads should be sub-MOA) and a little more character. That and building things is just fun. Additionally, I have 110 rounds of 7.62x51 milsurp and 3 boxes of 7.62x51 175gr BTHP that'll go with the rifle. I don't intend to sell it with any of the optics or the GripPod, however I do plan to leave a set of Magpul BUIS on it. As far as trades go, I'd prefer not to. But if you have a heavy barreled Remington 700, M1 Garand, CZ 455 Varminter, or something else out of the ordinary, I'm definitely curious."

Gun is in great shape and has about 200 rounds through rifle. I was going to start shooting in an iron site league but ended up moving out of state. Now I have no reason to keep the rifle. If you are looking at this ad you know all about how great these guns are.

The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.

You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A is ready for its next mission."

The comb is adjustable and the right side of the pistol grip has a palm swell. The forend and pistol grip are finely hand checkered.

There is no erosion.Overall Condition: This shotgun retains about 97% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows typical finish loss to the barrels from the installation and disassembly of the forend. There is typical wear from light use and operation. The SEO engraving is sharp and detailed. It is so beautiful with delicate little lines, no mars running through it anywhere. The backside of the trigger guard where the middle finger rubs has some finish loss. There is a scratch on the right side of the bottom barrel just in front of the forend. The top of the rib has some thinning to the finish. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear and crisp. Overall, this shotgun rates in about Excellent condition."

Will consider all offers. If you are looking for the perfect trainer or smaller caliber handgun – this is it. The Sig Mosquito is fun and inexpensive to shoot. This gun is in like-new condition and has all of the features listed below. I’m simply looking for a larger caliber – full size or compact handgun. Prefer Sig Sauer but will consider others. Looking for something in similar or new condition.
A .22 version of the classic Sig Sauer P226. The Mosquito is 10% smaller in size than the P226 and features similar controls to the full-size model. It has a takedown lever, a left decocking lever, reversible magazine catch, ambidexterous manual safety, and has an accessory rail on the frame..  In addition, the pistol is provided with an integral safety lock located at the rear of the magazine well which when enabled prevents cycling of slide, hammer fall, and trigger action. This Mosquito model has a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger. Single action trigger pull is 4.4 lbs while Double-action is 12.4 lbs. The polymer frame and small size (compared to the SIG P226) allow the pistol with magazine to weigh little more than 24.6 oz. The overall height is 5.3 inches with a barrel length of 3.9 inches. The Mosquito’s frame has an accessory rail, a ten-round capacity magazine, and adjustable sights. Made in Germany under license of Sig Sauer New Hampshire."
