It comes in the original case with the wrapping plastic, price tag, manual, SIG sticker, cable lock and two eight round magazines. Would make a perfect all around 9mm for EDC but I usually prefer a revolver for that role so I'm just listing it for trade to change it up since I don't use it but I would definitely have no complaints about keeping it if nothing comes along. I will be using one of my personal transfers only for mine since I have them to use plus its not on the approved list anyway but I have no problem still meeting at a FFL if you need to use one for your transfer. All Federal and MA laws will be followed. If you have any other questions just ask. Thanks for looking."

It's my rifle but on the St Andrews Rifle Club Certificate. Shot a 99 with it last week after my summer layoff so nothing wrong with the rifle. There was an older 1807 on here for $850 and just a barrel and action 1813 for $850 so I'm guessing $1000 for this complete rifle with sights and some accessories. Will get some photos on but email me for more questions... it’s negotiable  Thanks Chad
