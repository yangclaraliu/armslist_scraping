The pistol features a duo-tone black and olive drab green version of Springfield’s proprietary Armory Kote™ finish. This finish gives the pistol a matte, low-glare appearance and protects the metal. The 5 inch barrel is match grade and made from stainless steel. The slide features slanted serrations on the front and rear. The mainspring housing is flat and includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol has a Lightweight Delta™ hammer and a beavertail grip safety, which features a raised memory pad for positive engagement. The extended ambidextrous thumb safety and long aluminum match-grade trigger are upgraded features that are standard to the Loaded Series. The fixed combat 3-Dot sights feature tritium inserts. The ejection port is lowered and flared, and the pistol is fitted with a standard guide rod. The MC Operator® comes with G-10 grips held in place with Torx™ head grip screws."

The barrel is approximately 26""
 
The choke is an improved cylinder for lead and a modified cylinder for lead.
 
The BPS stands apart from other pump shotguns. With it's forged and machined steel receiver with dual steel action bars it is one tough shotgun. Simply stated it's a tough shotgun. Also unique to the BPS is the bottom feed and ejection port - instead of flinging empty hulls out to one side, empties drop straight to the ground underneath the action. This eliminates visual distraction when hunting airborne game, but it also keeps empty hulls from flying in the face of a left-handed shooter. In fact, this feature combined with the top tang safety makes the gun truly ambidextrous - a boon for families with left-handed and right-handed shooters.

What I have for sale or trade is a Winchester model 1894 in 32 Winchester Special. The serial number dates it to a manufacture date of 1970, which makes it less valuable than a pre 1964, but built late enough that Winchester had returned to the same rifle building practices as the pre 64 rifles. The list of included items are: 20 rounds of new hornady leverevolution 165 grain ammo, 25 rounds of loaded ammunition that I assume are reloads and planned to pull the bullets for components, 46 empty brass cases, 100 Speer Hit-Cor 170 grain jacketed soft point bullets, and a set of Lee reloading dies that are in great shape. I haven't shot this rifle yet, it is in great condition and doesn't look like it has been fired much. The action is still very tight, the wood in great shape, and no blueing wear. This is a really nice rifle and if I shoot it, I probably won't get rid of it. Interested in trades that shoot 358 Winchester, 300 Win Mag, 45-70, or 357 mag.

Caliber is .236 USN. The Winchester Lee Straight Pull Sporting Rifle was the sporting version of the Winchester Lee M1895 Navy rifle designed by James Paris Lee and featured a unique straight pull bolt design. The .236 USN chambering was a hot rod of it's day and was known to be a barrel burner. The Lee rifles were not well received and very few were made between 1897 and 1902. Only about 1700 of the sporting versions were made. The S/N of this rifle is 14428 indicating that it was made in 1899. The overall condition of this rifle is very good. The rifle retains much of its original blued finish with edge wear and thinning. It is taking on a gray brown patina. The finger groove walnut stock is very good with some dings from use and a scrape from the action of the bolt, but no cracks. The original steel butt plate is worn to gray with some marks from use. The bore is remarkably good, clean with strong rifling. The unique Lee straight pull action seems to function fine. Overall, a very nice example of this hard to find rifle. C&R OK. NO RESERVE!!

We are VaporTrail Firearms and build custom AR platform rifles. We have our own line of factory built rifles ranging from our quality entry level rifles to completely custom precision machines. We are a little unique in the way that we let you completely design the rifle, any way you want, and we build to your needs. We have a lot of options from barrels, muzzle brakes, gas systems, handguards, bolt carriers, forward assist, charge handles, bolt carrier groups, stocks, buffer systems, lower reciever internal parts, triggers, and all the small parts also. With so many different parts for these rifles almost anything you can imagine is possible. We also can do custom colors and patters. We start all our rifles on a 7075 T-6 forged aluminum platform and customize from there. Why buy a off the shelf rifle that everyone has, or that you want to start upgrading parts as soon as you get it.  Let us build you that completely custom rifle of you dreams. Our custom rifles (depending on the options you want) cost about the same as other higher end AR platform rifles, but built with your custom touch, again not just a off the shelf rifle.  Most of our custom rifles preform 1.0 moa or better at 100 yards. We can build multiple different caliber's including 223, 5.56, 223 Wylde, 300 blackout, 6.5 Grendel, 6.8SPC, 308 Win., 243 win, 22-250, 458 SOCOM, 50 Beuwolf, 9 mm and 40cal handgun rifles, and others.    We also have entry level rifles still based on our quality 7075 platform, that shoot 1.5 moa at 100 yards with match grade ammo. They have a quad rail handguard, with no front sight base so they are already set up if you want to mount a scope. Our entry level rifles start at $600. Call us today at 319-850-5437 to get a quote on your dream rifle.   You can see some of your rifles at https://m.facebook.com/vaportrailfirearms/"

This is one of the last of the ""C"" suffix serial numbered pistols before the Series ""70"" came out. In the Pre Series of 1911's there is less than 2% of these pistols that were Nickel finished. That makes the factory finished pistols very difficult to find. This Colt also has a factory letter that states the nickel finish and that it was shipped to the Johnson Plantation Gun Shop in Ashburn Georgia February 9 1970. This Colt is fitted with stunning original pearl grips. The pistol itself shows very little handling or being fired. The high polish sides have a mirror finish that would rate a 99% overall condition. The top of the slide and frame sides would rate a 98+% overall condition. The magazine is the correct original magazine for this pistol. The barrel shows no plating loss or wear. The high quality reproduction box has the correct end label with the correct nickel finish tag. The instruction sheet is an original Colt printing. This is one of the nicest condition 1911's  that any collector would be proud to have in their collection! The pearl grips are another big plus!

This is one of the last of the ""C"" suffix serial numbered pistols before the Series ""70"" came out. In the Pre Series of 1911's there is less than 2% of these pistols that were Nickel finished. That makes the factory finished pistols very difficult to find. This Colt also has a factory letter that states the nickel finish and that it was shipped to the Johnson Plantation Gun Shop in Ashburn Georgia February 9 1970. This Colt is fitted with stunning original pearl grips. The pistol itself shows very little handling or being fired. The high polish sides have a mirror finish that would rate a 99% overall condition. The top of the slide and frame sides would rate a 98+% overall condition. The magazine is the correct original magazine for this pistol. The barrel shows no plating loss or wear. The high quality reproduction box has the correct end label with the correct nickel finish tag. The instruction sheet is an original Colt printing. This is one of the nicest condition 1911's  that any collector would be proud to have in their collection! The pearl grips are another big plus!

Built on a British Small Arms (BSA) 7 x 57 Mauser style action with controlled feed and custom barreled to .244 Remington (same as 6mm Remington as the barrel has 1:9 twist to stabilize the heavier bullets), the action is smooth as butter with a positive, quiet safety and an incredible adjustable trigger with ZERO creep or travel that breaks like a glass rod at 2.75 lbs. pull every time. The rifle shoots, there is no doubt, but does so with superb good looks and custom rifle touches that are both classic and racy. With just $3000+ $35 for shipping it will become yours.... THIS 22” BARREL HAS 1:9 TWIST RATE and a perfect bore. IMPORTANTLY, THE LONGER 7 X 57 ACTION ALLOWS FOR HANDLOADING HOTTER LOADS AND IS THE ULTIMATE PLATFORM TO MAXIMIZE THE 6MM REMINGTON ROUND. Don't let this opportunity pass you...."
