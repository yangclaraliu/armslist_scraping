I'm selling the rifle and don't need this anymore. If you've done the research, the side scope mounts and the riveted picatinny rail mounts on top of the receiver covers rarely hold zero with all the vibration an AK brings. TWS solves that problem. The Dog Leg rail is a one piece, billet receiver cover (replaces your OE cover) with integrated picatinny rail. It attaches in front to your rear leaf spring sight block and utilizing their own exclusive recoil spring rod, the cover locks down tight with no wobble. You simply won't find a better scope rail for your AK.These are around $170-$175 Online if you can find a retailer that isn't out of stock. As said, mine only has a box of rounds through it and I'm including an upgraded screw and nut. The one that came with this rail uses a tiny little ""C"" clip that didn't want to stay on and kept popping off.I will take $120 for this rail cash.I will consider firearms related trades. I'm in S. Hill. I will ship to you on your dime after Paypal payment."

It's a great shooting rifle but there is one issue with it, my neck is too long to bring the rifle up to firing position without leaning over to line up the sights (I'm tall with a long neck). So rather than continue to sink money into it by getting a new stock with a bigger drop and/or a new set of sights, I'm going to sell this one and move on. I bought it for the price I'm asking ($120), so all the labor and parts (about $75 additional) are your gain. I'll leave it up at this price for a bit, and if it doesn't sell I'll part it out.

This is the real deal, DC Industries 1.5mm RPK type receiver, made originally in the famous Zastava Arms plant in Yugoslavia, pre-Serbia. It is not the thin 1.0 mm receiver that is standard in most AKMs, including the NPAP and OPAP. It has the grenade sights, gas cutoff, solid bolt cover lock, threaded barrel, and a real Yugoslavian bolt hold open magazine. I picked this one specifically because the fit and finish is tremendous and the underfolding stock locks up tight. For you preppers, note that this rifle is only 26"" long with the stock folded. It comes with the original box, tag, manual and Yugo BHO magazine. As always, purchaser must be legal to own a firearm in Tennessee. I will provide a bill of sale.
