I bought the firearm from a local gentleman a few years ago, and it just hasn't seen much use.   I've only put about a dozen or so rounds through it (and the guy I bought it from claimed he only put about the same through it).  

In addition to the firearm, I'm including a large box of .30-06 ammo from Tactical ammunition, as well as a half box of the federal Power Shok 180 grain soft point, and just slightly more than half a box of Federal Premium Vital Shok 180 grain ammo as well. Also has two full boxes of Winchester Super X 180 grain silvertip ammo as well. So there's quite a bit of ammo value here too being included.

Ready to ship, buy it today! 

Although this firearm is not restricted Federally, please check you local and state laws to ensure that this does not meet the definition of a Short-Barrel Shotgun where you live! 

A 14"" Mossberg 500 that's not considered a Short-Barreled Shotgun? 

The Mossberg Cruiser (50588) that ships from Mossberg with a pistol-grip already installed and a 20"" barrel is not considered a shotgun at all by ATF's definition. It is in fact just a ""Firearm"" because in order to fit the definition of a shotgun it must have stock to be ""fired from the shoulder"". 

Since it is not a shotgun it is not required to have at least an 18"" barrel, the only requirement for a firearm is that it must have a length of more than 26"" otherwise it would be considered an AOW. 

Each firearm will also come with copies of the ATF tech branch letters stating the ATF's opinion that these are indeed federally legal and do not require a tax stamp. 

This Mossberg 500 was built on a 500 Cruiser PGO firearm. The total length is 26 1/2"". We use a complete 14"" front end from a Mossberg 590A1 and a birds head grip to achieve the 26 1/2"" total length. These will come in the original Mossberg 500 Crusier box for those that want to be able to prove that it has never had a stock on it. 

Overall Length: 26.5"" 

Barrel Length: 14"" 

Capacity: 5 + 1 

Choke: Cylinder Bore 

Chamber: 3""

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9 mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine is also included.

I just bought this gun a couple months ago. I wanted to invest my money into something that would hold its value and last me. I put a lot of research and time into this purchase finding the right gun and accessories. In addition to just the gun and its original magazine and holster your getting an extra seven round magazine, a pocket holster and also a very comfortable and nice N82 tactical IWB holster. This gun has been just put up and in its case without being used other than carrying a few times. I am selling this gun because I am in a bind with money. I just invested into a Jeep that has been a lemon for me and I need this money to put toward a new engine. If I didn't have to get the jeep fixed I wouldn't be selling it.

This is a great firearm. Comes new unfired from the factory with factory hard case and all factory paper work. Comes with one 30 round magazine. From the factory: The Para Ordnance Tactical Target Upper Assembly features the DIGS (Delayed Impingement Gas System) which makes it the Smallest, Big Rifle in the World. PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner.

For my asking price I'll include the original SIG mag and an extra Black Dog mag (they make them for SIG).
Not interested in any trades unless they are obviously in my favor. Prefer a local Nashville sale.
Thanks!"

The bores are mirror bright. The case colors are 70 to 80% or better and more shows to the eye than in my pictures. The gun is all original and was well oiled when put away (an internal cleaning would be a good idea) and I believe stored muzzle down as there is very little oil staining in the wood and the accumulation of dried oil near the frames recess and rebates with a little bit or darkening of the muzzles. The engraving is excellent and is of the earlier more delicate pattern with the snipe on either side. B grade Foxes are seldom found let alone found in such high original condition and finish."

The Luger Pistol
From Gun Digest Book, 11th Edition, 1957.
By: Fred A. Datig | April 20, 2009
The 1936 was the last year that Mauser used the traditional straw bluing on the small parts. Wartime production was starting up and demand required that the trigger, thumb safety, locking lever magazine release were converted to salt bluing in early 1937. Pre WWII manufacture means it was made as good as they ever were.
Beginning in 1936 Krieghoff, like Mauser, dated his products with the year of manufacture in numbers. A few examples may be encountered bearing dates of “1936″ and “1937″ which do not conform to the proper serial number range. These were pieces assembled from already numbered surplus parts at those later dates. These will have the 1936 S/42 upper all matching and all lower all matching. Some of the Mauser-made Lugers will be found bearing not only the commercial Mauser Banner but also carrying a date-stamp over the chamber. Such arms were originally intended for commercial sale, but when the German military forces demanded more Lugers than normal Mauser production could supply, pistols previously set aside for the commercial market were merely stamped with a date and accepted by the Army as regular issue weapons. In 1936 the secret code names were augmented. Mauser was assigned the code number “42″ in addition to the “S/42″ already in use.

It is not unusual, then, to find Lugers bearing the code name “S/42″ and, for example, the date “1936,” and also to encounter “42″ pieces having the same date. To add to the confusion, pieces were also produced bearing the same date, “1936,” and inscribed with the commercial Mauser Banner.

Save HUGE and buy these for $425/ea or both for $800. Will ship for free, in the US. FTF in San Diego area. 

Here's the details on this great optic:

Standardized by the DEA, ATF, and FBI SWAT team, the Model 552 holographic weapon sight is the sight of choice for such military units as the Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. The Model 552 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The Model 552 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. The battle-proven design can withstand the abuse that any harsh environment, high-powered weapon platform, or military mission can dish out. Other features include a 65 MOA ring reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 30 brightness settings. The Model 552 is compatible with Gen I-IV night vision systems and mounts on 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

I have already had 9 offers just to buy the LS8300. Thanks for understanding. The rifle is new in the box never fired and has a new Trijicon Tri Power sitting on a new LaRue Tactical LT-150 quick release mount. Has a new Elzetta C 333 Charlie 3 cell weapon light sitting on a new Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. Check this light out on the web Elzetta is the main supplier to SF units. This light is 900 lumens' and will fry your eyes and is totally disorienting to anyone you put it on even during the day. Here is the best part it has a AIMSHOT LS8300 green laser yes I said LS8300 these are only sold to SOCOM and other SF units on a military PO. They are no longer sold to LEOs only military. If you have any doubts about that please contact Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta. When you see this laser on you will understand why. Yes it will burn you 2ft away from the unit itself. And you can follow the beam at night for miles and the green dot is the brightest I have ever seen mounted to a weapon. Yes I have tons of fun with it out here on the Lake at night. You can even see the beam before it ever gets dark. Comes with the adjustment zero tool and pressure switch tail cap along with standard click cap. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking. And if you can buy this rifle new in the box along with everything new I have on this one for 2100 you can have this one for free.

Already sent 2 ""LOL's"" and 1 LMFAO to ridiculous offers. No I don't need  Hi-Point Pistols. Nothing against Hi-Points, in fact I will consider trades for their carbines. But a .380? C'mon man. Show some self respect."
