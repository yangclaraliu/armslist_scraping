We were very close and he wanted to teach me how to shoot. When he passed in April, I lost interest in this firearm and recently came to the decision to sell it. The gun is registered in my name and I have all paperwork on it, including the original sales receipt. It has never been fired, and has sat in its case for the past 8 months. For all intents and purposes, it is brand new.
I am including everything shown in the pictures. It comes with 3 factory magazines, hard case, lock, cleaning brush, speed loader, and an additional pinky extension which adds 2 rounds to the capacity and gives a much better 3 finger grip. Never got around to buying ammo for it.
Below are the specs from the manufacturer:
The GLOCK 17 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 9x19mm pistol also retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Also available in MOS configuration.
-I live in Flagstaff, AZ and prefer to meet in my home in Sunnyside, near Killip Elementary School.
-I am interested in cash only, and am open to reasonable offers. I will also want a bill of sale completed for the sale of the gun as proof for ownership transfer."

I can be reached at REDACTED and I can also send pics of my 17 that way.  Thanks for looking"

I would trade for a like new Glock with usable extras like night sights or extra mags, a special edition/hard to find model or one that's still 100% new in the box. I did have a more informative ad up for my SIG but took it down early after some email issues plus I need to take better pics so if you need more info let me know and I'll send a pic also. Prefer to use a FFL for my side of the trade but you can still use a personal transfer if you want. All laws will be followed. Let me know what you have. Thanks."

Emphasis on trade. The pistol is virtually new and comes with the original box, paperwork and a hard carrycase. Less than 100 rounds through it. Included are three 8-round magazines. It's the upgraded satin nickel model with factory wood grips. It is SA/DA, safety/decocker, 3.81 inch barrel, 21oz, loaded chamber indicator, 3 dot sights, extremely accurate. It has a single-stack 8 round magazine + 1 in the chamber for a 9 shot capacity. Compact and slim enough for daily concealed carry, good for home defense and also a great range gun. Sublime trigger and very accurate out of the box. Made in Italy and only limited numbers are imported into the US. It fell off the California roster on Jan 1st 2017 so you can no longer buy one at your local gun store. Very rare and hard to find especially in CA.
