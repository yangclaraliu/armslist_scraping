The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies."

Imported by I.O. Inc., the PPS-43C is considered a pistol because its stock is permanently folded and welded in place. Folks looking for a great SBR conversion project can install a PPS-43/pm wz. 43 parts kit, from which the original folding stock mechanism can be taken to convert the pistol’s fixed stock back to functional after it has been registered with the ATF as a SBR.
Like the classic Soviet SMG, the PPS-43C is chambered in 7.62×25 Tokarev and feeds from 35-round steel magazines. Though its closed-bolt firing mechanism was redesigned to comply with U.S. laws, the remaining components are made from a full-auto Polish variant of the PPS-43Must have a purchase permit, or CCW."

This isn’t a stripped down rifle that’s saving weight by making extra cuts or lacking the battle rifle features you’re accustomed to. We’ve worked Patriot magic into the Revolution by using a 5.56 bolt carrier and other 5.56 parts allowing for a shorter overall receiver size and reduced weight.  This also isn’t a normal small frame .308, it’s smaller! The Revolution features many 5.56 parts; such as charging handle, bolt carrier, cam pin, buffer, heat sink barrel nut, handguard, and 5-position gas piston operating system. The barrel extension, bolt assembly, upper, and lower receiver are the exact same size as those on an AR15. This is truly an AR15 that shoots in .308!  Weighing in at 7.3 lbs.the Revolution features the Edge Handguard with four built-in QD mounts, and is packed with all you’ve come to expect from POF. Fully ambidextrous billet receiver set, high phosphate nickel coated bolt carrier group, 5-position adjustable gas piston, single stage match grade trigger, and more. With our redesigned triple port muzzle brake recoil management is not an issue.   The Viper HST is ideal for a wide range of shooting applications. Blending many of the best features from Vortex's incredibly popular Viper PST and Viper HS riflescopes, the Viper HST (Hunting Shooting Tactical) riflescope is built on an ultra-strong 30mm one-piece machined aluminum tube to deliver increased windage and elevation travel and optimal adjustment. An advanced optical system highlighted with a 4x zoom range provides magnification versatility. A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily. Incredibly precise, repeatable and durable tactical windage and elevation turrets built specifically for dialing, along with its hashmark-based reticle, top off this highly versatile riflescope’s long-range performance features.  Available in several different sizes with options for 20 MOA cant. These extended cantilevers are designed for mounting scopes with a forward location, providing correct eye relief and head placement. The cantilever ring mount positions the center of the riflescope tube at a height of 1.574” (40mm) from the base.  I work at Tombstone and priced this out today, before tax you would be looking at just over 3000 before tax, after tax you would be looking at 3270. I am looking to get 2800 for this setup.
