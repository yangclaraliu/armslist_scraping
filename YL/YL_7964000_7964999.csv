I'd say it has less than 100 rounds through it.  I also purchased a Burris MTAC 1x-4x illuminated scope and the excellent Burris P.E.P.R. tactical mount. I really like this setup as it has great eye relief, and the scope can work as a both-eyes-open ""red dot"" for fast shooting as well as a magnified optic for longer distance shooting.  The Burris also came with a Fastfire red dot, however I didn't have a need for it and sold it when it was purchased. The rifle has a ""Come and Take It"" dust cover installed (the original will be included) and also comes with an extra Magpul Pmag with window, a VTAC tactical padded sling, and a soft carry case. I'll throw in a box of Hornady Express Varmint ammo that never got to serve its purpose. I'm asking $1200 for everything, and I want to sell it all together.

I tried to get a picture of it. It was like that when I got it and hasn't changed in the least.My concern was it was a crack forming but I honestly think it is just in the woodgrain.I have shot this gun quite a bit over several years, enough to think it isn't going to be an issue and is only a slight cosmetic blemish.It has a Hammers air rifle 3x9 with parralax adjustment on it. It works good and fits with out removing the factory sight.Overall a nice old air rifle you don't see everyday.You are welcome to come shoot it Please no text.ThanksMikeREDACTED"

There are no major flaws/defects to be found anywhere on this rifle, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are a small handful of shallow nicks and scrapes, but that is it! This rifle's receiver is in great shape, and is free of any signs of rusting or pitting, as is the barrel! This rifle does feature a number of after-market customized parts and pieces, such as a customer Pistol Grip, that allows the rifle to be set flush on the ground and fired, as well as a custom bolt, that allows the rifle to be easily prepped and ready to go. This rifle ALSO features a custom trigger, with a fantastic pull on it, an adjustable AR Style stock, and a custom screw-on dust cover that fits easily over the barrel. The dust cover also features a small rail, so that an additional accessory (either a sight, or a front grip/bipod) can be attached. This is a fantastic rifle that would make a great addition to anybody's collection.
