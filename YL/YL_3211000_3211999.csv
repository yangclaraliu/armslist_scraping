I have started up my own ammunition company, Vexxer Munitions, and I decided to give my local Armslisters first grab at the ammunition. My selection is limited at the moment; I thought it better to keep a few types of ammunition in stock, rather than buy a bit of lots of types.

This ammunition is very solid. I won't say it's amazing, because let's face it, it's military surplus, and it's corrosive. But that being said, I've fired well over 100,000 rounds through my Mosin collection over the years, and I've had exactly 7 misfire or fail-to-feed.

Up for sale is 100 rounds, for $29. I have 17 in stock at the moment. A discount will be offered for bulk purchases. If you need some cheap ammunition for a shooting trip, or you're a prepper and you want to start stocking up on the world's most powerful surplus bullet, this ad is for you!


Contact me anytime with questions, and do make sure to check out my other ads. At the moment, all I'm offering for ammunition is 7.62x39mm and 7.62x54R, but I do have quite a few rifles and shotguns lying around for sale or trade.

I'd also like to take a moment and thank you personally, Armlister. You, and hundreds like you, have kept Portland's gun community strong. My first ad on here, I asked for Mosins. I was expecting a dozen, perhaps. I was stunned with the results; over the course of 4 weeks, two HUNDRED Mosins were offered for sale. So, thank you for using Armslist instead of your local gun dealer. The stronger the community becomes, the farther prices drop and the more selection we get. It is this fact that convinced me to post this ammunition for sale here, weeks in advance of my proper store being opened to the general American public.

As my business grows and I am able to place larger orders, the price will drop. Significantly. As it stands, I am making mere pennies on each order of 100 rounds, but I'd rather make tiny profit than have these rounds sitting around waiting for someone desperate enough to pay 'scalper' prices.


Regards,
Thomas"

August 9th,"Madison Lake, Mankato, Minnesota",$ 75,"Listed On: Monday, August 4, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Read this if you enjoy shooting guns!!  Only a few days left! Are you bored with the typical range session? Does standing still and shooting paper no longer interest you? We have the solution! A couple buddies and I sat down one day and decided to change the way we shoot.  We started up a club and named it RAC FRAG, or Responsible Armed Citizens, Fun Run And Gun. We set up a course that involves running from station to station and shooting the steel targets at various ranges. We transition from long range rifle targets to close range pistol targets, and back again.  Every gunner gets videoed and timed on their run so it puts a touch of stress into the mix. This course teaches you how to set up your gear, make quick mag changes, shoot while on the move, and shoot while shaking and out of breath. We found a fantastic piece of land near Madison Lake MN that we leased to hold our events. We had a good thunderstorm rip through the range at our last shoot but it didn't stop us from having fun.  Check out Rob's rainy run: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAT8-rcd7pk.  We do other fun things out there besides running the course- like this example of me trying to be cool:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC_zqy-FV9I   So come on out and join us for a ton of fun!  Our next big shoot is this Saturday, August 9th. Cost is $75 per person, or if you want to camp overnight with us and shoot some more on Sunday it's $120. We have a generator on site, a portable toilet, and a grill for whatever you want to bring to cook.  We are looking for more people to add to our club so if this sounds like something you might be interested in, respond to this ad or call/text me and lets chat! REDACTED Please let me know if you have any questions or if you want more info. Check out our website for more pics and videos: http://rac-frag.weebly.com/ Feel free to register on our home page for our August 9 shoot to hold your spot. If you register, you will also be placed on our mailing list for regular FRAG updates. Thanks!! Cody"

I don't shoot it that much, and I have other shotguns.

This gun has had a lot of work done to it; it started life off as a plain jane 870, and was worked over by a retired Special Forces armorer. The receiver and magazine tube has been ceracoted OD green. Ghost ring/night sights were installed for use with slugs (scattergun technologies), along with a Speedfeed stock and magpul forend. The safety is the oversized police/military safety button, and it also has the high visibility follower and extra strength magazine spring installed.

 Really have my heart set on a GI style 1911A1. I'm somewhat flexible as to what brand, but a Scattergun Tech or Wilson Combat shotgun with these features would easily cost $1100 new, so if you're interested, please keep that in mind."

Get a life, get a job and STOP trying to make a living off of your hoarding! (My opinion, YOU SUCK!)
If anyone wants the information on a program that will automatically search for whatever ammo you want and tell you the cheapest prices, brand, ammo count and that IT IS AVAILABLE. (Google Ammo finder or drop me a line and I will let you know how, or you can Android or iTunrs search for Ammofinder). Let these ammo hoarders choke on their overpriced ammo that they have no firearm to use! Then they will stop and we will also be able to find the normal prices and be available again locally.
Start turning these folks In for not paying tax on their sales and cut into their profit margin. It is easily done, get their name and email address and send on to IRS. They will be glad to check it out and collect the money these folks haven't been paying as well as bump the amount up with fines."

EOTech 557 manufacturer info:
The new 557.AR223 has been developed to optimize the functionality of the HWS. The buttons have been moved from the back to the left side for instant access, allowing a magnifier, night vision, or a back up iron sight to fit closely to the HWS body. This new button position allows the user to operate the HWS function switches easier than ever before. Additionally, a portion of the front base has been raised to allow the sight to fit over standard hand guards found on many M-4 or M-16 style weapons. 

The 557.AR223 is configured with a new ballistic matching reticle image for the M4 carbine. The battle tested circle/dot reticle will be offered along with a series of 1 MOA aiming dots that are vertically aligned and calibrated specifically for the ballistic drop of .223 caliber ammunition. The reticle provides 4 aiming dots for target distances of 0-300m, 400m, 500m, and 600m.

It is an outstanding pistol, but it is the only 9mm I own so in an attempt to consolidate calibers, I'm looking to trade it.

It has had a couple hundred rounds fired through it, which barely broke in the barrel. The polygonal rifling on the barrel can easily handle 5,000 rounds before starting to show signs of wear.

The pistol comes with 5, 15 rounds magazines, aftermarket night sights (suppressor height), and a picatinny rail adapter so you can mount any light or laser combination on the pistol.

Below are the pictures of the actual pistol, if you would like to see additional pictures or have any questions please don't hesitate to email me. I am in the business of doing business

This excuse for a man goes by the name of ""HUNTER MARTIN"" I am not sure it is his real name but he uses google phone to hide his identity. He made off with a large sum of my hard earned cash and a very expensive Noveske Lower Receiver yesterday. He advertised a rifle where the internals did not match what was advertised or agreed upon through a series of text messages and in spoken word. As of now he is selling a Noveske KX3 pig for 300blk. He drives a brand new 2013 dark red Honda Civic and will ask to meet in a public place in the GRANTS PASS area. I suggest you do not do business with this THIEF!! 
Thank you

Pictures were found through his Google+ account. Photos must be 4+ years old..


EDIT: many people are asking more details of the transaction so here it is..


It was my first AR buy. My 4 year old and 8 month old came with me so it was a quick deal. It wasn't just the internals. 

The upper wasn't billet, the charging handle wasn't BCM and I didn't think to bring a measuring tape to check the gas length. He said the barrel was mid length gas, it was carbine. He said the upper was complete from Midwest Industries, only thing that MI made was the forearm cover. The bolt group was swapped out too. 

I learned my lesson but it still doesn't excuse the fact that he straight up lied to me both over texts and in person. I now know how to research these things in the future. Either way the guy is a complete scumbag. His final words were ""then sell this gun and go and buy another one."" 

I am an honest person and cannot recover the sum lost because the parts are trash. I will try to sell some of the parts, but in the end he made out with lots of my hard earned cash. I will continue to repost my ad about him until no one in the Rogue Valley deals with him again."

This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

So we're selling/trading it to get a gun that she can operate easily.

This is the new 2014 model, which dropped the ""Duty"" name, and is simply called ""P-07"".  9mm version.  New for 2014, the P-07 has the P-09's front cocking serrations, the P-09's flatter trigger, the P-09's 3-dot sights, and the P-09's squared commander-style hammer.  It comes with three backstraps to customize the fit and feel to your hand.  It also comes with two 15-round magazines that fit flush with the grip.  For that matter, it comes with EVERYTHING you get as if you purchased it new, because I just did last month: nice plastic case, cleaning tools, all paperwork, spent shell casing, factory printout of test rounds, etc.

I will post pictures tonight.

Would like to sell or trade for a Smith & Wesson M&P Shield 9mm.  We tried that one and my wife really likes it, can operate the slide, etc."

The GLOCK 30 in the legendary .45 caliber offers excellent out-of-the- box precision paired with the ballistic quality of a genuine big-bore caliber. The smooth design and the simple operation of the GLOCK pistol allow quick drawing of the pistol. Because of these advantages and especially because of its compact dimensions, the GLOCK 30 is the first choice of plainclothes officers and protection personnel.

""Why are you selling this?""
I'd like to start my own mid-length AR build, and the money from this will go towards it.
""But it's the Sport version...""
Yup! That's exactly why I bought it -- I wanted to see if Smith put out a great rifle for the money, and they do! I was expecting it to not shoot nearly as well as my $1,000 Sig Sauer M400, but I was wrong. It's a great gun, especially for what you pay.
""Are you willing to trade?""
Yes, partially for these few AR components:
Geissele SSA or similar AR fire control group
B5 Systems/LMT sopmod stock
Bravo Company Gunfighter grips

Asking price: $640
Here is my breakdown:
M&P-15 Sport: $590 (I purchased this new for $675, and I have the original receipt if you’d like to see it. Because it is used, I'm taking off $85 in value)
All FDE Magpul Furniture: $50 (I purchased this new as well -- There is a handguard, MOE vertical grip, and medium rail section on the left high side)

Included is a black 30 Round PMAG, an enhanced rubber stock pad, the original box and manual it came with, as well as the original black plastic hand guards. The Aimpoint Red Dot you see in the pictures is not included (Unless you want to add another $430) – there is a Magpul rear BUIS included stock from the factory, which I’ve tested, and is zeroed for 50/200 yards with standard loads.

I’d prefer to meet at Scottsdale Gun Club, Shooter’s World (Phoenix), or, if need be, Cabela’s, to make the sale. You MUST show me a valid AZDL or CCW (I have both). Please keep in mind that just because this is a private sale does not mean a prohibited possessor can legally buy this rifle from me – Federal and State laws still apply. I will sign a bill of sale upon request; just bring it with when we meet up.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. All responses through this site will get e-mailed to my phone. I'm not some POS who is trying to rip you off, and as noted, feel that my asking price is fair; this said, if you want to make me a lower offer, I'll expect you to include some form of reasoning for why and how much that makes sense.

Thanks for your time!"

This has the blade bayonet.

The rifle shoots great and has a very nice, clean bore. The wood is in good shape, but the stock does have a crack near the rear of it. It does not affect shooting and isn't getting any worse. Please see the picture.

The bolt and bolt carrier are also in good shape. The blueing is fantastic for a rifle of this age, with no fading or bad spots.

Feel free to ask any questions.

No trades please, cash only. Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale and have a valid Ohio drivers license."

The trigger is adjustable with titanium hammer and sear for quick lock up. It was adjusted to break clean with little take up and no measurable over travel. The sights are custom and set dead on, not six o'clock. The gun was de-burred for concealed carry, top of slide was matted to reduce glare when sighting, mag well was relieved and extended, feed ramp was polished and ejection port was relieved for reliable feeding. Spring and guide rod (no barrel bushing) replaced with one piece unit to improve accuracy. Slide was fitted to frame.

Located Conway/Myrtle Beach, SC area. Buyer must be at least 21 years of age. Thank you for looking. Best regards. 

I was asking $1400 for it, but I am reducing it by $400.  The first $1000 takes it!!!
