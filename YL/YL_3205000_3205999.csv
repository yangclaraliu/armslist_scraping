Comes with factory accessories(case, lock set, etc) as well as a cheaper laser, cleaning kit, and about 475 rounds. Looking for $425. Gander sells it new for $400, not including tax and background, and without the cleaning kit, laser, and ammo. It is a reliable and great shooter, and a sexy one at that...wouldn't be selling but Im being forced to. No trades sorry. Located in Newburg outside of West Bend. Thanks for your time.

The barrel will be cleaned, refinished and then coated. The turn around time will be 2-3 weeks from the time we receive the barrel. Rush options available. We offer better pricing, better quality and a faster turn around than any of our competitors. 

For those not familiar with Titanium Nitride it is unique in terms of firearm finishes as it not only gives a custom look to your firearm it also adds durability and reduces the friction on the coated part. This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, vastly increases the durability, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is the average coating only adds 3 micrometers of material, so it will not change the function of your firearm only enhance the look and performance of it. It is applied in a cathodic arc chamber which ensures a uniform coating. This is the same coating that is used by high speed cutting tools to give you an idea of its strength.

If you have any questions please let us know. Thanks for taking the time to look!

Frequently Asked Questions:
1. What other colors do you offer? We offer gold, rose, carbon black and silver.
2. Does this include a barrel? No, this is for the coating of your existing barrel. Once you purchase, we will send you the information on where to send your barrel.
3. Can you coat threaded barrels? Yes we can, it doesn't alter the threads and actually offers them some protection.
4. Can you coat aftermarket barrels? Yes we can, in fact aftermarket barrels coatings are a large part of our business.
5. Can you coat my slide or other small parts? We can coat any part that is steel, stainless steel, or titanium. We do not coat aluminum. Contact us for more information.
6. Does this coat the inside of the barrel? If will coat inside the crown and chamber, the areas where most wear occurs.
7. Is there any difference in the colors hardness? No, they are all equally durable and in the 80-90 range on the Rockwell Scale. The Titanium Nitride is much more durable than the steel it coats."

These rifles were used by the armed forces as trainers in WWII for their heft and accuracy. This is the civilian version.   They are a main size target rifle with a great feel and accurate shooting characteristics.  They will digest any standard velocity ammo and shoot it accurately.
This rifle always garners attention at the shooting range as they are not seen often & the people are wowed by how accurate they shoot.  It is a lot of fun to shoot.
I have truly enjoyed owning and shooting this fine piece of American rifle history, but other interests prompt me to pass it on to raise funds for other projects.

The Walther PPQ is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.
The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs.
The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.

The Saiga 12 is based on the venerable AK platform design and boasts unmatched reliability in the worst of conditions. This Saiga was manufactured at the Izhmash factory in Russia, which has operated since 1807. It is capable of firing 2 3/4"" shells, and 3"" shells can be fired from the factory magazines. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The 19"" chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands.

Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more  energy across all effective ranges"

Being old & cranky, I have lost ALL interest in shipping. It's very heavy & a P..I..T..A to wrap anyhow, so that option is OVER!

She has had 40 documented rounds of factory match ammo through her for zero-ing and a little long range practice. This rifle is built to shoot, and will most likely outshoot damn near anyone who gets behind the trigger. I also have about a half box of FGMM 168grn  and a few rounds of Remington Match ammo left. With factory ammo I was shooting .5MOA groups in my first outing with this rifle. With more practice and familiarization I am sure I could get that down smaller. Reloads will only do better!

I chose not to print the action yet since it shoots so well as it sits. This is the perfect set up for a long range shooter to hone their skills, then when the barrel is shot out, have it replaced with a custom barrel and have the action trued at that time.

What I have here is 2000+ plus rounds of .223 / 5.56MM mixed head stamp cleaned and polished brass.  These are a combination of Lake City, Winchester, Remington, and Black Hills brass that I have gotten, ran through my ultra sonic cleaner and then tumbled in media for 48 hours to restore the factory shine.  All brass is then sorted and counted by hand and placed in a bag for two reasons, 1. to ensure that an accurate count is made and that you truly are getting what I advertise, and 2. it gives me another chance to look at each round and sort out the ""bad apples"".  Just as my own little check, I always throw in another hand full of brass just to make sure we get over that 500 mark.  So what I have is four bags of 500+ rounds each for a total of 2000+ rounds.  I have seen advertised on gun broker 1000 rounds of un-touched brass for $55.00 plus S&H and 1000 pieces of cleaned brass for $100.00 plus S&H.  If you don't need all 2000, I will do 1000 for $80.00, and 500 for $45.00.  Please be able to meet local in the Pierce County area.  I will ship outside of pierce county at your cost."

Great carry gun. The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. The Nano's modular structure, ergonomics, and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

Gun comes with stainless, slide mounted belt clip, you can waistband carry this pistol in sweatpants or basketball shorts if you want to! The clip is bolted to the slide under the ejection port, and carries a lifetime warranty against breaking. Instead of a bulky holster, it just clips over a belt or waistband like a pen - perfect!

Inside the waistband on the hip, at 4 oclock, or 1oclock carry positions, the pistol will hide in jeans with a belt under even a fitted t shirt! The perfect carry gun - good looking enough to show off to friends,  small enough that nobody - including you - know you have it when its concealed, cheap enough that you can scuff or scratch it without guilt (which matters if you carry daily!), chambered in .40 so you can actually have some mag capacity AND knockdown power in your hand, plus these guns are reliable as the day is long.  If you need a do it all carry pistol or just a good value on a great handgun, this is your gun!"

This rail came installed on an upper I just bought and after looking it over I have decided I need to upgrade to a 15"" rail in this exact same configuration. If you are not a jolly green giant like myself (6'5"") then this 12"" rail will fit you perfectly.

If you're looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it's by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®'s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you'll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.

The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP.) Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 in .40SW, 9 in .45ACP.) Like all XD(M)®’s, the 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.

If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one.

Will consider all offers. We can work out a deal with cash and partial trades if you like.
I unfortunately I won't drop the price below 700 (unless a trade is involved). This retails for 1300 plus tax and shipping and Handling. Not to mention the 7 week waiting period for it.

You must meet in Oak Harbor, Coupeville, Anacortes, or Burlington. Maybe further for a good deal.

This is from Sig Sauers custom shop.
A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame on this Sig Sauer P938 Equinox. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete the package.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 Equinox packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.


Extras.
I have 2 extra 7 round mags with extension that are very pricey along with the 6 round mag, very nice desantis speed scabbard holster, uncle mikes ankle holster, a soft belt clip holster and Hogue wrap around rubber grip along with the sig grips.
