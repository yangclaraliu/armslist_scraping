The Mark 4 High Accuracy Multi-Range scope from Leupold is a fixed power scope that is ideal for military and law enforcement operators and features an illuminated CM-R2 reticle. Though it is a fixed power rifle scope, the High Accuracy Multi-Range (HAMR) scope is highly versatile, with the high light transmission rates of the Xtended Twilight Lens System and the scratch-resistant power of DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on all exterior lens surfaces. The Leupold Mark 4 High Accuracy Multi-Range 4x24 Rifle Scope is designed for any rifle to add speed and accuracy with ease of use. The Mark 4 Rifle Scopes is guaranteed to be waterproof and is immune to interior fogging, giving you a constantly clear optic for precision accuracy is the most low-visibility conditions. Due to its medium-range magnification, the HAMR excels at mid-to-close range tactical situations.  The top-mounted Delta Point red-dot sight is made with a lightweight aluminum housing, while the aspheric lens generates a wide field-of-view with some of the best image quality ever seen in a reflex sight. Patented Motion Sensor Technology inside of the Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight discerns any movement of the sight and automatically activates the illumination, which is inset into a light tunnel to reduce the light signature in tactical situations. This scope comes complete with everything that came from the manufacturer (including warranty card and Leupold window decal) and is in near-perfect condition.  And here's a little secret: The protective hood that covers the Delta Point sight is only available from someone who bought the HAMR/Delta Point combo.  The HAMR's that are still available don't come with it, and Leupold won't sell it separately. Oh, and the HAMR isn't available directly from Leupold anymore unless you are a large-scale military/law enforcement contract.If you have any questions or would like any more pictures, just let me know.I will ship this sight to a serious buyer.  Contact me to make arrangements."

160,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7780160,For Sale/Trade:  Stoner AR15 in 7.62x39: The friggin’ Kitchen Sink Deluxe!,"South of, Indianapolis, Indiana","$ 1,700","Listed On: Saturday, January 27, 2018",Rifles,Anderson Manufacturing                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"So dubbed “Kitchen Sink” because it has damned near everything on it EXCEPT the proverbial kitchen sink, this beast defies convention, convenience, and practicality, deferring instead to remote preparedness, Swiss Army Knife variety, and pure badassness! Boasting a weight of well beyond what you’d likely prefer, the Kitchen Sink Deluxe (KSD) combines opportunity, novelty, and picatinny for the sheer hell of it.  Starting with convention, this Anderson Arms lower leads with the A2 stock of yesteryear for a more sturdy recoil base and solid feel; of course, no set up for insane gadgetry would be complete without two (of a total of four) points for sling attachment! (The sling is a two-point tactical sling with elastic ends for picking up slack; the rifle provides up to four points of attachment.) The lower also has a Magpul pistol grip, enlarged Magpul trigger guard, enlarged/extended breakdown pins (a must when breaking down for storage!), a Magpul Battery Assist Device (BAD... get it?!?) lever for BCG catch release, and a FAB defense MagWell grip. Beyond all this combined application and novelty, this lower boasts the ability to accommodate not only the rifle’s 7.62x39 set-up, but also other uppers, including the popular .300 Blackout, 5.56, and more!The KSD Upper goes beyond the lower’s already awe-inspiring greatness by more than a stone’s throw by establishing a 12” quad rail platform on which to cram as much hardware as possible, going beyond rationale into an arena of ridiculousness! This circus of accessories only pretends - and only slightly and unconvincingly - to observe reason. Starting at the fore end, the uppermost rail (I.e., in the 12 o’clock position) has a light with a pressure switch drawn back along the length of the rail for ease of engagement at the receiver; a 45-degree offset front sight (for engagement of enemy targets (or paper ones) at varying distances) (to be used in tandem with the matching 45-degree rear sight at the aft of the 12 o-clock rail); a cutaway notch for the factory front sight/gas block; an attachment for sling mounting; numerous LaRue tactical rail index clips for ease of handling (to include several for the management of the pressure switch cable for the light); and a red/green MilDot reticle 2.5-10x scope with a side-mounted laser (for two additional target acquisition systems)! (Of note is the enlarged charging handle engagement lever for easier charging of the rifle.)Moving clockwise to the 3 o’clock rail (as you look down the rifle to your quivering prey), you’ll note the elegant simplicity of the next two items: an NVG mount and a LaRue handstop. (Both are cradled lovingly between the smooth contours of more LaRue index clips, bringing formidable fashion and ergonomic comfort to this juggernaut of excess!) (Note: The Armadillo device for the removal of the index clips is NOT included; hopefully, if you are considering this firearm, you have  the tools necessary (i.e., your fingers) to remove them yourself.) The NVG mount requires no explanation OR justification (NVGs not included, by the way); the hand stop, however, offers an additional support system for firing from the standing, crouching, or cross-legged position.The 6 o’clock rail exposes no surrendering underbelly’s weakness but rather three additional stabilization systems in order from fore to aft: quick detach bipod, front sling mount, and primary forearm grip (underfolding), the latter waiting underneath like this thing’s dong, held in reserve until action arrives and the KSD is permitted to spit forth copious amounts of hot lead; if used correctly, each promises its own reward, and the flow of the three roll smoothly into the lower’s aforementioned MagWell grip.The final, 9 o’clock rail is home to not one but TWO more stabilization systems, one which issues forth a hook for sinking into nearby trees, tabletops and door jams (thereby using pieces of the environment in which only fools would dare to face the KSD as a shooter’s bench), and the other a secondary (and five-position) forearm grip that extends right out at the 9 o’clock position for use with the 45-degree flip-up iron sights.Last but not least is the multi-directional, aftermarket muzzle brake, not the traditional birdcage, but perhaps the housing for something far more hellacious and sinister...Is all this gear necessary, or even reasonable? Probably not. Hell, each available slot is home to extra LaRue index clips, even. But when are words like “necessary” and “reasonable” pertinent in this hobby, brothers-in-arms? Do we need full-auto, 30-round magazines, or 1000-meter guns? Silencers, bayonet lugs, or laser sights? No. But we WANT them, and “need” doesn’t play into this KSD; this is an all-want piece of methodical shooting equipment, friends."

Buy It Now!! The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Caliber: 9mm LugerBarrel Length: 4.6 inMagazine Capacity: 18Magazine Type: Double StackFrame: SteelGrips: RubberTrigger Mech: DA/SASights: Fixed Night SightsBarrel: Cold Hammer ForgedWeight: 2.4 lbsOverall Length: 8.15 inHeight: .79 inWidth: 1.46 inSafety: Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, and Firing Pin Block Safety"

Its unique short energy pulse system reduces length of recoil so that repeating shot energy cannot overlap and knock the shooter off target. Full auto fire is possible with massively reduced recoil and muzzle climb, meaning that all shots fall on target. Ultra fast attenuation of muzzle blast gasses means that flash signature is also reduced. Meprolight: The right solution for military, police and sportsmen when ruggedness and reliability count. Shoot with both eyes open – as fast as you can aim. The Mepro 21 is a maintenance-free, dual illuminated, red dot reflex sight especially designed for quick and instinctive accurate shooting. Originally developed for the IDF, this advanced optical sight is perfect while on the move in close quarters where the use of both eyes is critical. The Mepro 21 provides instant, all light aiming without batteries, and can work in tandem with a magnifying scope. Adapters are available for all the common mounts (Weaver or Picatinny rails, M16 carry handle, NATO, etc).https://aegisguns.com/product/used-iwi-tavor-x95-meprolight-lantac-dragon/"
