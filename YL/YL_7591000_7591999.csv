I've had this sight on my rifle for 2 years and only used it during sighting it in.  I've decided to start using the rifle and prefer a scope.  The sight is in great condition and comes with all the factory literature, tools and hard case.  My research show that they are selling in the low to mid $400's new.  I'm asking $275.
If your interested please text me at 541-771-one433.I will respond to emails and phone messages just not as fast.
Factory Description:The new XPS series of sights from EOTech are the shortest sights from EOTech to date which leaves you with more rail space than other EOTech sights. This smaller sight runs on a single CR123A battery which provides a life of up to 600 hours. Having a shorter sight allows for more room to mount detachable iron sights for backup, or to mount any other accessories you might want. EOTech XPS sights feature an integral mount for use on Picatinny or Weaver-style rails.

It is designed to give the handgun hunter the ultimate choice in semi-automatic gaming pistol and has proven to be more than capable of taking down game such as whitetail deer, russian boar, and feral hogs.

583,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7591583,For Sale:  1777 Charleville Carbine - New - $465,"NE, Portland, Oregon",$ 465,"Listed On: Thursday, November 23, 2017",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"The 1777 Charleville carbine was a much-needed improvement for the French cavalry units, and saw fairly mass production, with tens of thousands being produced over the years. Cahmbered in 65 caliber, these musketoons saw service with various armies right into the Napoleonic Wars, and beyond in certain colonial states.
 
    The 1777 musketoon shares many traits with its more famous cousin, the M1777 French Infantry Pattern musket (aka, the Charleville). Rather than steel barrel bands, brass was chosen to further highlight cavalry units as elite. A shortened 34"" barrel makes this much lighter and easier to wield than a traditional musket, making it especially popular with smaller frame shooters (if you have family who are intimidated by large muskets, this is the firearm for them).
 
   I do not have bayonets, but they do feature a bayonet lug to mount a standard Bayonet, found at just about any shop (Loyalist comes to mind as a cheap option).Price is firm and is well below shop prices. At the moment these sell for $600+ in shops. The only difference between myself and the shops is: I don't stain your stock, I don't clean your firearm. Most people seem to think the afternoon of very basic work is worth saving $150, per firearm.
 
 
Important Information:
 
-Everything ships via USPS Priority Ground and arrives within 7 days.
-Every firearm comes with a small gift as a thank you; let me know if you want historical or practical.
-These are 90% complete kits. While they are range-ready right out of the box, a deep cleaning and staining of the stock to a proper walnut color is highly recommended. You will notice an immediate improvement once you clean your lock's innards.I have other models, including a flash sale on 1842 Springfields. Email me anytime."

It does already have the cutouts to clear the rivets on the rear trunnion of the NPAP rifles. ""Improved Ergonomics"" means a warsaw length stock and lower comb than the normal Yugoslavian design, eliminating the ""cheek slap"" you'd get if you don't have a good cheek weld.
The wood is unfinished and ready for your next project. A perfect upgrade to the cheap quality wooden buttstocks that Century puts on their new rifles which tend to wear out and wobble overtime with normal use. This wood is a sturdy European Beech much like what is used in combloc and other rifles.
 
I just received it in the mail from Ironwood Designs but I had already sold my NPAP so I have no more use for it. It DOES NOT come with the stock bolt. It utilizes the shorter bolts found on the NPAP rifles and not the 10"" M70 bolt. Also does not come with a pistol grip bolt.
 
$100 cash or trade for 400 rounds of 7.62x39 (Wolf, Tulammo, RAS, Golden Tiger preferred, no corrosive). No shipping. This is a pretty low price for these stocks so lower offers will be ignored. Must meet in Saint Paul (Midway area). I am available weekday evenings after 5:30pm or weekend mornings before 12pm or by schedule.
