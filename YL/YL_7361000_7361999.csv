This semi-automatic pistol was designed in the 1950s by Russian Nikolai Makarov.  His objective was to design a simple and reliable medium-powered pistol to be used as the sidearm of the Soviet Forces.  It was accepted by Russia in 1951 and has been a standard firearm ever since.  Recent developments may soon change that, but its place in history is secure.
The all-steel Makarov is both single and double action, with a decocking safety.  The overall simplicity of the gun is part of the genius of design, and allows the gun to be disassembled with very few tools.
Included with the gun is a correct military holster, with extra clip pouch and cleaning rod.  I'm also including nine boxes of 9x18 ammo, suitable for both practice and defense.  The gun will be in a padded plastic storage or carrying  case, and you get my collection of Makarov literature.
The durable, reliable Makarov is a lot of gun for the $450 price, especially when the cost of ammo is factored in.  It's small enough for concealed carry, and perfect for home or car defense.  Reply to my ad with your phone number and we'll meet so you can exame this Makarov pistol.  I know you won't be disappointed.  Please be prepared to show me your Oklahoma Driver's License for proof of residency."

In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application.
If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series."

If you want to return an SKS to it's full glory after it's been goobered-up with Tapco plasti-crap, this here's your huckleberry.BUT......(as i found out the hard way) it apparantly is made only for rifles with the threaded,LONG-collar barrels. It won't fit on non-threaded, pinned-barrel rifles, or rifles with the the threaded short collar. (But, according to the guys on the SKS forums, lots of folks make it compatible by using a dremel on the crossbar, which apparantly works fine. I just didn't want to do any alterations to it.) The stock is in very nice condition, with the usual mild dings on a surplus military stock, but no cracks or anything serious. It has a side-mounted sling swivel, with the typical serial number stamped next to it. It also has all metal parts in place, so it's fully ready to install, as is.If the ad is still up, I still have the stock, so this and other stupid scammer questions will be ignored. Though I might if I have to, I'd rather not to bother with shipping, preferring a local FTF cash deal (north Columbus or southern Harris county)This is priced cheaper than ebay or on-line retailers that have them in-stock.Thanks for looking....Only trade interests would be for a similar stock that's compatible with pinned or short-collar rifles, or a favorable amount of x39 ammo."

Six inch polished, not original bright, stainless steel Colt King Cobra.No box, but there is a rug and some accompanying Colt King Cobra literature.I put the custom rosewood grips shown on the gun since original rubber grips (which will be included) had stripped out threads on the mating side when I bought it.There is a ring on the cylinder since I have, and do fire this gun, as had the previous owner(s).I clean the gun, but I haven't gotten around to repolishing it. So it is less than perfect (but still pretty nice) in the shine department.It is a very nice looking weapon, and it still is a weapon, not a safe queen.Local sale at an FFL only. I will not ship.However, I am willing to drive a bit-- within the state."
