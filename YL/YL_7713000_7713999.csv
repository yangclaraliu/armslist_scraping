It comes with original box, six magazines w/shock bottle base pads, and a selection of grip panel options including the Extreme, SSI Scales, Patriot Defense palm swells, and the stock walnut grips. The gun also comes with a blade-tech holster. The gun has a trigger job, wtih all safeties in tact, and still pops primers of the harder variety. I don't have a trigger guage, but if I was guessing, I would say the DA is around 7 1/2 #'s with the SA being right around 2 #'s. The hard chrome finish is worn, however, the gun functions flawlessly and it one of the tightest fitted Tanfoglios I have handled (I have shot many). Very accurate and easy to shoot fast. The gun has the following improvements - - Henning DLC fiber front sight- Henning stainless guide rod- Extreme one piece sear- Extreme Delt hammer- 13 # Wolf hammer spring- 10 # Wolf recoil spring- Extra power extractor spring"

Today, there’s a plethora of small handguns chambered in .380 ACP. There are so many that it’s easy to forget that Diamondback Firearms LLC of Cocoa, Florida, has been setting the pace for .380’s since 2009, when it was first introduced as a revolutionary DB380 micro-compact semi-automatic pistol. The polymer-framed DB380 was well ahead of its time, featuring the patented ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure real windage-adjustable sights. The DB380 continues to set the standard for small, concealable handguns. The steel trigger with dual connection bars allows for a crisp, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a slide and barrel, designed to be strong for more durability with less felt recoil. The absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Can come with crimson trace laser and crossbreed supertuck IWB holster that’s made for the pistol with laser if trade is appropriate. Very light use.

Also have the strike Industries fang trigger guard in blue that may go with it (had this for another build and never used it. Same with the viper buttstock.) Also, depending on trade, I can include a brand new carry handle rear sight, and BCM gunfighter pistol grip. Im looking to trade 1 or both for a nice pistol or rifle. I am not interested in any revolvers of any sort. I am also not interested in any hunting style rifles. The only shotgun I would be interested in is a vepr 12, a utas xtr 12, or a converted saiga. If it’s a pistol, I’d like it to be something in 9mm. I’d love to have a Springfield emp 9mm, or a range officer carry in 9mm. I’d trade for a nice ar or maybe a nice ak47 as well. I’m REALLY partial to da/da pistols with a hammer. Just let let me know what you have and we will go from there. I am not interested in selling at this time, unless someone wanted to make an offer on all 3. MUST BE KY RESIDENT. CCDW preferred. If no ccdw, I would like to complete a bill of sale for the protection of the both of us.IF YOU OFFER ME A TRADE AND I SAY NO, don’t automatically assume it’s because I think my “shits worth gold” (quoting a reply from someone on here). It might just not be my cup of tea. I expect fair trades FOR BOTH PARTIES and I buy and sell enough firearms to know what real-world prices are. Thanks."
