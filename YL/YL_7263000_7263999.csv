It is in very nice, shootable condition; just not totally correct. Stock has been sporterized very well, and I think makes it more attractive. No peep sights, wrong sling mounts, and missing the bead from front sight. Still very accurate rifle. Will shoot 22 s-l-lr, says so on the barrel! Bought it to train my granddaughter to shoot, but mom insisted she wasn't old enough, and they up and moved out of town. Don't shoot it enough to justify the space in the safe. Rather get another .308. May consider partial trades, but at the price,....what can I say? Will ship it to your FFL for $35.00 Asking price is a starting point; make me an offer. Please reply with number you can be reached at. Thank you."
