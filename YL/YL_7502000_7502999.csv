One magazine is the one that came with the gun when new and is broken in very well, and the other is a Smith and Wesson brand mag that is identical to the one that came with it originally.(bought only two months ago at sportsmans warehouse still have packing and has only been used twice for about 50 rounds each time.). The gun itself is a great gun to go target shoot, accurate and consistent. Another plus it's not terribly expensive to shoot either.($13.99/50round@walmart) since the day I bought it new In 2014 this pistol has never once jammed, not one misfire, and not even a failure to load a new round while shooting. I've shot roughly 1,000-1,200 rounds through the pistol at the range and it's always shot fantastic for me, not a single issue. The .40 caliber is also arguably the best carry caliber out there because its not so heavy that it blows your arm off when you need to use it but heavy enough to feel confident it will do the job if need be. $500 O.B.O.

This comes with a low profile nitride gas block that was pinned by Rainier Arms. Also included is a Noveske Gen1 (iron cross on top) upper receiver and BCM KMR Alpha 10"" rail.The Colt barrel is a very tight fit into the Noveske upper receiver. Either the barrel extension is slightly oversized or the inside diameter of the upper receiver for barrel extension is slightly undersized for a tighter fit to the barrel, which equates to a more accurate rifle. Also, in my experience in fitting Noveske upper receivers to lower receivers, the newer Gen1 Noveske upper receivers have better tolerances to fit lower receivers. The older Gen1 receivers (iron cross on the side) are either loose or very tight.No other parts are included in this sale, only the upper receiver, barrel, and rail. This allows you to customize a few parts to your liking. If you want to complete the upper receiver I am willing to sell additional parts (Noveske BCG, Geissele CH, and SilencerCo ASR flash hider) in the first picture to make this a complete upper. I would also sell the Troy Battlesights.$610 shipped. All NFA rules apply. Please contact me if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!"

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

From manufacturer:U22 Neos: Today's Best Plinking Rimfire PistolDesigned and manufactured in the USA, the new U22 Neos is a single-action .22 LR caliber plinking semiauto pistol. Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.
Cool, Futuristic DesignEven while designing a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor of renown Italian designer Giugiaro--the same mind behind several of our most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes.
Fully-Modular ConstructionThe Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (""Inox""), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.
High PerformanceReliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless-steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look--it won't fail to surpass your expectations."

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's."
