This particular model of M57 features a 1911-style frame mounted thumb safety which is quick and easy to use. This gun is chambered in the original 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge, which sends an 85gr projectile at 1630FPS, for a total of 514 ft-lbs of energy. A 230gr .45 ACP round at 960 FPS by comparison is 471 ft-lbs of energy - it's quite a powerful cartridge. Recoil is like a hot 9mm or a standard .40 S&W round. There is holster wear on the right side near the muzzle, but everything is functional, no rust apparent, bore is clean and shiny, the gun has been perfectly reliable. Also included is a Serpa-esque Cytac holster.Contact me via text or email.Text:REDACTED"

The Model 65 is chambered in .357 Magnum which gives it greater versatility than the .38 Special guns including the Model 10, Model 15, and Model 64. The 65 is made of stainless steel which is more resistant to wear and moisture than the blued finish of the Models 10, 13, 15, and 19. This is especially important for concealed carry where the gun can come into contact with body sweat. The Model65’s fixed rear sight does not have sharp edges to catch on clothing or skin (jellyroll) while also being less prone to breakage from rough handling than the adjustable target sights on the Model 15, Model 19 (both blued) or the stainless steel Model 66. These 3 inch model 65 K frame revolvers are hard to find and bring a premium price on the marketplace.MN buyer Needs a Permit and MN state ID.Out of MN buyer pays $30 shipping to local FFL."

The QSE-2 ""Ricardo Tubbs"" is their first Persian-style blade. Its long, large radius blade makes the knife an unbelievable chopper and heavy-user. The ergonomics of the knife in reverse grip are spot-on, and the balance and weight certainly deserve honorable mention. Features the Tri-Spoke pivot assembly without the ORB pivot system, however the sheer weight of the blade makes for easy actuation from the handle.About the Tri-Spoke Pivot Assembly:A single thread weaves its way through every corner of the knife industry: the desire to be original. To author some form, to create something unique and memorable lives at the desk of every designer throughout our profession.QTRMSTR's signature, at the present point on their timeline is the Tri-Spoke Pivot® Assembly. At the heart of the Tri-Spoke Pivot assembly is the T10 Torx slot, but the science around the perimeter is what’s most interesting. By engineering their own unique hardware and implementing the component as an oversized pivot, they allow our folding knives to distribute the force of assembly over a larger area, allowing the knife to pivot at the same speed throughout its smooth rotation. The results are stunning to say the least.Features Limited Production of Only 300 PiecesSpecifications Blade Length: 4.00"" (10.2 cm) Blade Thickness: 0.165"" (4.2 mm) Handle Thickness: 0.550"" (14 mm) Overall Length: 8.75"" (22.2 cm) Blade Material: S35VN Stainless Steel, Stonewashed Blade Hardness: 59-60HRC Blade Style: Pseudo-Persian Handle Material: G10 Weight: 7.4 oz. Carry Type: Pocket Clip Locking Mechanism: Frame Lock Pivot Assembly: Tri-Spoke without ORB System Made in USA"

It is the older version with the stainless color cylinder, very sharp looking. Very well kept, it shows minor wear on front sight from carry, but firearm itself is like new, shoots great and locks up tight. I just installed a new Hogue tamer boot grip about 2 weeks ago, which makes the pistol easily pocketable and still fun to shoot, just looking to switch things up a bit. Also included is the original Hoge tamer grip with finger grooves, 20 rounds of Hornady American Gunner 38 special ammo, Ruger pistol bag, and all original accessories from purchase. Looking to sell the package for $350. If interested, please contact via email or text 260-21three-171seven; I'll respond promptly to both. Thanks!"

The Barrett BORS measures air temperature, barometric pressure, and bore line angle. The BORS also calculates a ballistic solution for a specific user-selected cartridge eliminating the need for counting clicks, calculating mil dots as target ranges change, or using a handheld computer. The BORS allows the shooter to focus on environmental conditions, assess the tactical situation, and quickly engage multiple targets at varying ranges. The BORS simply takes the mystery out of bullet drop."
