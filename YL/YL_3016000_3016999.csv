The finish on the slide is in terrific condition but there is a small patch of finish missing at the base of the grip on the left side (see photo). The paint on the sights is a bit faded but I have a brand new set of CZ 75 sights I'll include. I've owned the pistol for about three months and have had it to the range one time. I put about 60 rounds through it and was very impressed with its accuracy. Whoever the previous owner was put a fair number of rounds through and took excellent care of the weapon. The outside of the barrel is darkened from use but the inside is very clean and in great shape.

It comes with an extra Rib Rail Panel if you'd prefer to cover all four rails.

The KAC M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military’s M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle’s barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels. 

Manufacturer:  Knight's Armament Company
Model:  98064
MSRP:  $350
Length: 6.25”
Weight: 8.9 oz
Free Float: No
Material: Aluminum
Finish: Black Anodizing

Rifle Requirements: The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants. Installation instructions are included.

Reviews:

I have shot the real AK47's in Vietnam when I was with the 25th Inf.Div.1/5 meck Inf.and I can say if this weapon could be made full auto.it would be the best weapon in the world.This rifle was built great and I have four of these AK47's and got them when they were on sale two years ago that's how good they are and I don't buy junk.

Love it, i already knew i would but after firing her she won my heart AND soul. but seriously, right out of the box i fired around 120 rds everything was super smooth. and that trigger reset is a dream come true and the chevron compensator really reduces muzzle climb especially when firing controlled pairs. the only think i replaced was the grip for a Houge rubberized. if you got the extra money don't waste your time with another AK

These legendary and nearly impossible to find 7.62X54 Extra Match 200 grain cartridges were developed to dominate International Competitions.  This ammo still holds world records for long range accuracy.  Russia has banned export of Extra Match ammo because of the pinpoint accuracy of these hard hitting long range rounds,

Others are selling the less accurate, lower power, steel 7N1 sniper ammo @ $1+ per round.  Each tin of Extra Match has been tested and certified to group 20 shots sub MOA @ 300 meters.  Yes, 20 shots, not the 3 or 5 shot groups others use to rate ammo.  Typically groups sub 0.5 MOA.

Spetsnaz FSB special forces snipers are the only units allowed to use Extra Match ammo today. It is specifically designated for long range termination of large predatory creatures. (works great at close range too)

If you are not familiar with this ammo. you probably don't need it.  I only have two sealed tins (1 crate) to sell.  I would like it to go to somebody who will use it properly since it cannot be replaced.  It shouldn't be wasted on paper targets once your rifle is zeroed in.

  Extra Match has a stronger recoil than other 54R.  I use a muzzle brake that tames recoil by over 50%.  Varga Tactical Precision produces awesome muzzle brakes for about $40 that others sell for $100+.  They custom make your brake with your choice of thread and bore size.  I have several with M14x1LH (AK) threads which isn't listed on their website, but is available  http://www.vargatacticalprecision.com/products.html

240 rounds per tin.  Price $225  (93.75 cents per round)

1 or 2 tins delivered for the same fee of $20 to anywhere in the Continental US by FedEx Ground.  2 tins will ship in the wood crate with opener.

This is a heavy gun.  It is super easy recoil with 44 special, and very accurate.
Good for:  Hunting, target, collecting, and home defense (in my opinion).
I've only put about 200 rounds through this gun.  Mainly in 44 special.  The magnum rounds do kick quite a bit, but I was able to shoot six in a row one handed.
I only shot one of the buffalo bore 340 grain magnums through this gun, and I was glad to be holding on with both hands!  I wouldn't shoot them again, unless a Grizzly was attacking me.
The price is firm (and quite low and fair).  I expect cash only.

Over-All Length: 42.7” The M48 rifle represents the peak developement of the K98
Mauser style infantry rifle. It’s superior design incorporated more refinements
and it was constructed of superior materials, not having
been subjected to material shortages like the rifles built in Germany.Some people may be getting the mistaken impression that these rifles were manufactured by Germans during the occupation. That is not the case. These rifles were manufactured with German and FN technology in Serbia after the people had driven the Germans out of Yugoslavia.
This is an important distinction, because that is one of the reasons why the Model 48 is recognized as an excellent example of the Mauser 98 Karbine type military rifle. The factory in Serbia was not bombed, like the German factories during the war. The factory in Serbia had a good supply of raw materials. And the Model 48 was produced by free people, instead of forced labor. All of which resulted in an excellent rifle in its own right, as well as an interesting piece of history.
This rifle has been stored in cosmoline. It is as new,never issued."

Small to Medium Game Fun in a Full-Size Rifle. In 1983, Ruger responded to the many shooters who desired a high-quality, adult-size 22 rimfire rifle - one that was built to centerfire standards of strength, accuracy and aesthetics. Focused on building a rifle that was accurate, economical, and extremely handsome, Bill Ruger launched the family of bolt-action rifles using the rotary magazine. 
Comparing favorably with custom-made firearms, the innovative Ruger 77/22® (available in 22 LR, 22 Mag. or 22 Hornet), the powerful Ruger® 77/357™, Ruger 77/44® and the flat-shooting and superbly accurate Ruger 77/17® (available in 17 Mag. or 17 Hornet) have all established themselves as the perfect rifle for small game hunters, ranchers, and long-range informal ""plinkers."" Offered in a variety of calibers and configurations, these rifles boast all of the technological advancements of the M77® Mark II rifle with the rugged and utterly dependable Ruger detachable rotary magazine.

I will consider a trade for a quality AR-15.  No crap.  I prefer a mid length gas system with a quality barrel and bolt.  I have a good idea of what I want and what AR's and parts are going for new so be realistic.

This has been my hobby gun for a while, but it's time to move on. This started out as a plain Saiga rifle but it has been converted to be 922r compliant, which means it's legal in the US and you can use regular AK 30 round magazines.

I can take better and more detailed photos if you would like, it has around 500 rounds through it without a single malfunction. AK reliable and it's in fantastic ""like new"" condition.

If you don't already know, the Saiga rifle comes from the Izhmash factory that has built and continues to build the ""real"" AK47 for Russia. This cannot be compared to Century Arms cobbled together crap, the fit and finish is above all...there is a reason Arsenal uses them.  Grip is MFT Engage and stock is KVAR nato length. Internals have Carolina shooter's supply bullet guide and Tapco G2 trigger with billet trigger guard.

The single barrel offers the advantage of maintaining the point of impact of the second shot exactly in line with that of the first shot, thus ensuring excellent performance. the Beretta UGB25 Xcel with break-open barrel is based on short recoil, which keeps the internal parts of the gun clean even after prolonged use. The short recoil (and low barrel axis position) almost completely compensates for muzzle jump during firing, with quicker and easier re-alignment of the barrel on the target for the next shot.The low barrel axis position transmits the recoil forces in line with the shooter’s shoulder thus minimizing felt recoil. The perfect adjustment of the rearwards and forwards breech bolt travel allows use of all 12 ga. 2 3/4 ” (70mm) shotshells, from subsonic ones up to 1 1/2 oz (42g) cartridges without any modification."

I'm including with the gun 2 Blackhawk Serpa holsters, one black and one basket-weave, and a basket-weave Safariland hidden-snap 1911 double mag pouch. 

The gun itself was $1200 new, $30 a mag, $90 for grips, and about $70 a holster. This whole set is worth over $1600. Its all yours for $1000. I'll also just do the pistol and magazines for $900.

It's made in the Izmash factory, but is considered a step above standard AK and Saiga rifles that come out of there (Legion is a branch of the Izzy Arsenal, and they select their rifles by accuracy).  It was imported by Mercury-Hermes.

This is a Saiga with pistol grip with battery compartment, collapsible stock, and sling studs. It's been modified to accept standard AK-47 mags and has a bullet guide installed.  Also had the hand guards ported to help keep them cool when firing a lot.  Please note that it is NOT a ""converted"" Saiga - the only conversion is to accept the AK mags.  This can be switched back to the standard European-style Saiga stock and handguards (stock and handguards run about $40 online) if you don't want that ""assault rifle"" look, or live in an area that won't allow them to be used for hunting.

The rifle has some wear in the usual spots (mag release, side mount, safety lever, etc), but works flawlessly.

It comes with a soft ""tactical"" case with outside pockets for mags, etc., 2 brand new in package Magpul AK pmags, and 60 rounds of ammo.

I won't travel very far right now.  My wife just had a baby so I have to stay close to home.  If you're local you should be willing to come to Brookfield; if you're coming from up north I'm willing to meet up at Gun World or Cabela's in Richfield.  If you're from Madison area, I'll travel out to Johnson Creek to meet."

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.-KELTEC

This particular piece was manufactured in 1975 and still has great bluing with no noticeable wear to the finish. It has the 6"" barrel and is a real tack driver, but I've only fired it a few times because she's just too pretty to take out of the safe. In addition to the stock rubber grips, I have a custom set of Coco Bolo grips with the Colt medallions that I think look amazing with the blued finish on the gun."

I am only selling so I can replace it with an M&P Shield 9mm. I love the 9mm guns!!

It will come with the gun, of course, two 16 round magazines, the original box and paperwork, the lock, etc., that came with it new. The only modification to the gun is the installed APEX TACTICAL trigger spring kit, giving a lighter pull on the trigger. I also still have the original manufacturer springs you can have with it.

IF you want a holster, I have two available. First is a nylon Bulldog, kind of an inexpensive yet functional holster for side carry. Secondly is a very nice EVERYDAY brand Kydex / Leather holster made for right hand inside the waistband carry. I have carried this gun in this holster, and being a larger guy (250 lbs, 5' - 10""), it works perfectly and I can hardly even tell I am wearing it. The holster is probably only 3 weeks old. If you want the holsters with this gun, I am asking an additional $50. So, $375 for all. The gun alone is only $325, and that is a deal considering it has the added spring kit, which was $25 itself.

Again, I am ONLY parting with this gun because I am not wealthy enough to own an arsenal, but need the right carry for me. I normally dress in button up shirts 100% of the time, so a smaller gun is a necessity, unfortunately. I say unfortunately, because I could show you some target shooting I did and how extremely accurate this gun is!!! And the smaller the gun, you lose some of that.

Get back to me, and let me know when you would like to come to Port Orchard to see this baby."

This rifle is extremely accurate.  I have shot it out to 600 yards and it will slap steel all day at that range.(I have the videos on my phone to prove it)  It functions as it should and is in excellent condition and kept clean.   I don't know the exact round count, but it is under 500.   I am mainly looking to trade because I didn't join the rifle range this year so I wont be doing any long range shooting.  I want to trade for something I can get a little more use out of.  I have plenty of the mk262 ammo that I would like to keep, but could go with it for the right deal.  Prefer to keep together, but I could possibly separate upper/optics for the right deal as well."
