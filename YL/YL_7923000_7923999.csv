This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."

These kits were installed and used for 2 boxes of ammo at one range sesson. Wife and kids shoot these guns and the trigger was a little light for them. They wanted the stock trigger back in. I really liked the pull on these but as these are shared in the family I went back to stock. Price is $75 each or both for $140.

The slide work and cerakote work was done by slideworks engineering in Texas. The burnt broze looks great and sets it apart from traditional black glocks, and the front slide serrations are minimal. They offer a slight reduction in weight that helps offset the weight of the rmr, and provide functionality when manipulating the firearm. It feels great in your hands with a mild stipple textured grip that is comfortable to shoot and carry. The concept of a red dot furnished pistol is something that is becoming increasingly popular, and with the quality of trijicon, the rmr is built to last. In contrast with traditional iron sights, the red dot allows the shooter to ""threat focus"" which is beneficial for fast target acquisition, and also provides substantially increased accuracy at distance. The internals are completely stock, keeping the reliability of a glock. Always well maintained, never dropped or abused. Estimated round count is roughly 500 rounds. All things included, there is well over $1200 invested in this firearm.

One of the best examples I have seen, as close to a pre ban Chinese rifle as you can get without being an actual pre ban. This was caught in customs at the time the 1989 Ban went into effect. At the first of the ban there was not a proper way of debanning and different importers did different things. This one does not have Mak90, SP or Sporter electo penned or stamped, the only things that makes this not a pre ban is a number of importers were struck out as some importers didn't want to deal with the ban and the bayonet lugs have been ground off. This rifle was originally meant to have a Chinese Type 2 bayonet, but the fangs were left remaining and a Chinese Type 1 bayonet will lock up tight. Original Chinese furniture and the bluing is excellent, no rust or pitting. A very, very nice rifle. Call or text 918 371 six250."

It's missing the saddle ring, butt plate and mainspring but is otherwise complete. The Carbine has minimal pitting on the exterior. At some point the lever connector broke and was brazed with a piece of copper to fix it. The bore isn't in the best shape but with a mainspring everything would function. Overall this is a cheap alternative for someone who collects Civil War weapons but doesn't want to spend $1200+ on a better example. There's a company called The Rifle Shoppe that makes all the components needed to complete and repair the rifle. OEM parts can also be found.  I will include a reproduction buttstock.
