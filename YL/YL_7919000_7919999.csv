It's extremely light (5 lbs.), with an 18.5 inch 1:7 twist barrel. The forend transforms into a bipod, and the hollow stock holds a spare magazine. The best part is it folds in half -- I kept this in a tennis racquet case in my trunk. This model has steel sights (not the plastic ones) and a replacement pin with a ring so you can fold and deploy it easily. This gun is so much fun to shoot and even easier to tote around. I'll include two 30-round magazines (aluminum or new P-Mags, your choice). Face to face transfer within 25 miles of Boones Mill/Roanoke/Salem. I will need to see valid Virginia ID.

That’s what it’s for! I have an IN DL, lifetime carry permit, have 0 felonies, always willing to sign a bill of sale, and conduct upstanding business. And I require people to show me documentation. I purchased a gun last night (sig p229) that came with 4 mags. When I met the guy for the gun, decided I didn’t really care for the condition it was in (even though it’s really in decent condition) so instead of telling the guy I decided I didn’t want it and backing out thus wasting his time, I bought it anyway. Today I went and shot it at point blank in Carmel. Shot the damn thing well but decided I would trade it for something else and listed the price at $800 because I know how much people low ball on this site. I had no intention of selling the gun for $800 but wanted to get a decent trade for a gun that retails for $1000 so I listed high.i also added one of my own brand new mags to the package. Out of no where some piece of trash Billball1517 @gmail.com has decided to slanderme on this website and email me nasty things all day for no good reason. Oh and list my personal information on this site (he will be receiving a visit from the police. I have never even met this psychopath.

Break open single shot very reliable and there the best for home defense because of that as you know it will go off when you pull the trigger and easy to reload quick if needed. Feels good in the hands. No front sight as it's a shotgun you don't need a front sight or if wanted Walmart has them for $5.

It is sized for 2 3/4” and 3” shells, made in the USA and is a heavy gun that is a quality build.  It is not a show gun, but is a perfect home defense gun, truck or trunk gun. It is a workhorse and shows it, but functions perfectly. I have put 50-75 shells through it and it eats everything. It has lived under my bed as a home defense shotgun ever since I had the barrel cut. Contact me with any questions or if you need better pics."

Hated it right out of the box, but kept shooting it and now it's a reliable and accurate little all-metal pistol.It's also a unique design. Unlike the 100 or so polymer ""tilting-barrel"" semi-auto pistols on the market, the R51 incorporates a ""Pederson block"" to  create a ""delayed-blowback"" action.If you collect firearms with unique technologies, this is the pistol for you.THE PERFECTED REMINGTON R51.POINT INSTINCTIVELY. RECOVER INSTANTLY.Re-engineered from the ground up and thoroughly tested to deliver ultimate reliability, the R51 gets you on target faster and more intuitively than any other subcompact on the market. Add 25% less muzzle flip and a sleek, ergonomic design, and it’s exactly what you need to shoot your best in worse-case scenarios. Chambered for 9mm Luger with a 7-round magazine capacity.A proud reintroduction of a truly groundbreaking design, the perfected Remington R51 has been re-engineered from the ground up and thoroughly tested to deliver utmost reliability, and the highest level of shootability of any subcompact handgun on the market today. Because it has the lowest bore axis in its class, its intuitive accuracy is unrivaled. The low bore axis also reduces muzzle rise by 25% for faster recovery between shots. Its Pederson block design and optimized grip angle work together to dramatically diminish felt recoil. With a 3.4” barrel and smooth, rounded edges, it conceals easily and deploys like lightning. And it all comes with a confidence-boosting 7+1 rounds of 9mm Luger. Updated features include a precision-built fast-reset polymer trigger, a more aggressive and durable extractor design, enhanced recoil spring and a host of other features that make it the model of dependability.KEY FEATURES* Less muzzle rise and reduced felt recoil* Light slide racking force* Optimized grip angle and slim aluminum frame* 9MM +P match-grade 3.4” barrel* Light, smooth and crisp trigger* Two semi-flush 7+1 magazines"

Bought this pistol new about a year ago, had put about 1000 rounds through it, cleaned and lubed after every use.
This pistol is the most accurate 9 I've ever had and is definitely the most reliable 1911 I've ever had. Out of the fun I've had with it I haven't had a single FTE, FTF, or any other misc. jamming type issue. This price includes 3 MecGar mags, hardshell case, and a thigh drop holster. If you're looking for a steel framed 9 or a lower-cost 1911 without the hassles this one is a great option. If you're curious, model came with the ""battle worn"" finish, but honestly it doesn't really even look all that worn despite being used. These are currently ~385.00 most places (this price is from Bud's). Save some cash and get 2 extra mags!
 
Also open to some trades, especially music gear, although cash is certainly king!

I was going to put this on my AR pistol, but I decided to go the red dot direction instead. I blacked over the Cabelas logo on the scope bc I didn't really like having the logo on the side. I can remove the paint if you'd prefer it that way. That said, this sight is great and for $100, it'll be hard to find anything better. The glass is pretty good and it has good eye relief for a prism scope. These are exactly the same as the Burris 3x Prism scopes from everything I have been able to tell. The scope has an etched black reticle (this means reticle will be there regardless of battery life) that can be turned on to green or red, with 5 different brightness adjustments for each color. It has a few scratches from over time and the price reflects that as well."

Has muzzle break attached with set screws. ""Mankave"" cantilever scope mount. No name bi-pod. Bent handle bolt. Archangel stock that appears to be olive drab in color. The rifle is dusty as hell and there is surface rust on the bolt handle but the previous owner assured me the value is here. I have fired one round through to check function. Rifle needs a thorough cleaning for sure. Will include the handful of ammo that came in the trade deal. Looking to get $400 as that is what I accepted in trade value. Fredericksburg on the weekends. Travel to Northern Va. during the week for work. Need to see a valid Va. ID from purchaser. Please only reasonable offers. Will accept trades that are heavily in my favor.LAST TIME POSTING: Please no bs offers, this is as low on the price as I will go!"
