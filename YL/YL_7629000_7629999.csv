It starts easily, even if it's freezing outside. I never have to plug it in. It runs strong, and the turbo sounds and feels healthy. It may put off a small puff on startup, but otherwise doesn't smoke while running or driving. It drives good, and pulls like a 7.3 should. It is a good truck overall, and mostly everything works. The a/c blows cold, the heat blows hot. All the lights work, as do the wipers. The windows are manual, and roll up and down fine. The seats lean and adjust, and the backseat folds to make a large storage area. Both fuel tanks work, but the front tank always reads ""full"". The gauge works fine for the back tank. The outside is in decent shape, fairly straight, the paint and clear-coat look alright, but there are chips and dings you might expect of a work truck. It has a receiver hitch, as well as an in bed removable ball hitch mount, but it's missing the removable ball. This truck has only 240k. You are not likely to find ANY other 7.3 trucks with less miles, and never for this price. They'll have twice the mileage and still cost more! The tag is out, but only by 2 months, so it'll be cheap. I have a clean, green, lien free, Oklahoma title in hand, ready to go!Cash is king, but I am willing to consider trades of all types. Gold, gun, car, truck, motorcycle, generator, name brand tools, dirt bike, four wheeler, etc. You get it - man stuff and things of value. Just text me a picture of your trade item, and please mention Ford F-250, as I have various items for trade. I will trade down for an item I really like, or add cash (or trade items) to trade up. I have ALL kinds of things to trade. Mostly looking for AR and AK rifles, but I may consider any trade. The worst I can say is no. 91Eight-40Two-748EightCash is king, but I will consider trades, including but not limited to: car, truck, bus, diesel, atv, utv, four wheeler, 4x4, rzr, sxs, side by side, jetski, pontoon boat, motorcycle, things that go boom, bangs, bangstick food, etc. Land, acreage, parcel, etc. Just text me a picture of your trade and we'll go from there. I may trade up or down. I may add cash on my side if I really like the trade, or I may have other trade items to throw in as well."

I started with an unfired MAK 90 kit using a 1.6mm ITM receiver. Cerakoted in tungsten grey. The barrel was cut to allow the front sight to be moved closer to gas block and the lantac dragon compensator was pinned and welded to meet the minimum legal length of 16"" (16⅜"" to be exact). The rear trunnion is specifically made for ace stocks and adapters, for maneuverability I used an ace folding adapter and for modern ergonomics, an AR magpul SL-K stock. The magazine release is oversized for quick easy mag changes and the magwell funnel guides the mags into place quick and easy. It has an alg trigger and a custom made oversized safety selector paddle so that the safety can be operated without taking your hand off of or out of position from the pistol grip, maintaining full control at all times. The magpul Zhukov handguard gives a modern feel and forward hand position. It has a TWS dog leg dust cover and a holosun red dot along with fixed sights. Has the original dust cover in matching tungsten grey cerakote as well. Up front it has a 625 lumen streamlight protac 2 rail mount light with a pressure pad that works in momentary and constant along with programmable high, low, and strobe functions. 1250 I have many more pictures availableAk47 akm ar15"

This last lever-action rifle designed by John Browning had a pretty good run, from 1895 through 1936. The Model 1895 was a popular rifle among hunters. Most famous, of course, is President Theodore Roosevelt and his son, Kermit. Browning designed a single-column, integral box magazine that positioned the cartridges under the receiver and just behind the breech. The single-column magazine is utterly reliable, sleek and lightweight. Its follower is powered by a spring that extends underneath the barrel and into the fore-end. Notches toward the rear of the magazine box allow the cartridges to be freed as the round is guided up a short ramp at the breech. The bolt can then push the cartridge into the chamber.DOM: 1924S/N: 410322 BOriginal Lyman 21 Aperture sight (Value $500)Only private sale ""95"" on ARMSLIST in this condition at this price.Photos on request for interested persons.No trades"

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.Includes: Handgun, case, 2 x 14 round magazines, all manuals and documention.Condition: NewRequire Purchase Permit or CCW - Bill of Sale to be completed.No Trades - Thank You."

That way you get to have one at a lower cost than retail and beat the shipping, and I make a few bucks, so we both win.I've only run a few boxes of ammo through it, and never dropped, dinged or abused it. It's been one of the many ""knights of honor in the safe-queen's court"", so to speak.  I've got another clear 20rd one up on another post, so if you'd like em both, we can do a deal, (and it'd be cheaper than buying just one at retail).Contact me if interested - call or text is great."
