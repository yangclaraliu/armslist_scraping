The dash 5 is also built with the highest level endurance package, which includes a more robust indexing system, enlongated bolt notches in the cylinder and larger cylinder bolt, radiused trigger and hammer pivot pins inside the action to eliminate stress risers and a frame mounted firing pin. What it means is you won't shoot this gun to pieces with magnum loads. It's the safest and strongest 629 you can get without that awful lock. On top of that it's a beautifully made firearm. I'm a machinist and the work on this revolver looks outsanding to me. Fit and finish is also outstanding, timing is perfect and lockup is tight. I haven't put many rounds through it, but accuracy is great and the action and trigger pull is just what you'd want and expect from a S&W revolver. Condition is an easy 97-98% with a few very minor marks here and there. I'm selling because I have another of these and I'm in the process of putting together an outfit for an Elk hunt this fall. I don't need two 629s. Trade interests would be high end Zeiss, Leica or Swarovski binoculars, with additional cash from my end. I live near Plant City. Prefer face to face in the west central Florida area. I don't mind a little driving for a serious buyer. Please don't be a felon. Please have a valid driver's license - CWP is much preferred. Be prepared to sign a bill of sale. Cash only. $825 OBROIf ad is up, gun is still available!"

Beware, if you fight these THIEVES they will retaliate.It doesn't bother me one bit to RE-POST their criminal use of the following emails:1. robertmullin12 ""at"" gmail ""dot"" com2. StanleyHenson3 ""at"" yahoo ""dot"" comI will continue to expose these thieving losers, along with all others that attempt to perpetrate their daily scams. The main thing that will alert you to their scamming ways is their desire to utilize a ""Certified Cashier's Check"". Not to mention their bad spelling, punctuation, sentence structure and all around improper use of the English language.I would suggest ONLY dealing FTF with cash, or, if you must ship an item, accept ONLY a USPS Money Order or possibly discrete Paypal, even though we know Paypal is anti-american and anti-gun.Personally, I'm sorry this once useful sight is being overrun by these losers and thieves. I would hope that the site-manager or owner of Armslist would help clean up the community. Everyone can do their fair share by LISTING names and emails that are being utilized for fraudulent purposes!"

I stopped hunting over a decade ago and so far this rifle has mostly been a safe-queen, so time to get rid of it. It has has usual wear and tear rub spots from being in a gun safe for so long, but the rifle has no fowlng, pitting and the bolt face is spottless. The major detractor from it's value is the small crack on the stock near the front end (quite possible got dropped at some point). Doing my own research, from how small the crack is and it's placement, a gunsmith could fix it with relative ease. After shooting it again after so long, I found that it still runs just perfectly but still kicks like a mother. It comes with the scope, a bushnell scopechief 6, a nice Ross leather sling, green Remington gun bag, a 20 rd box of Winchester super x and a 20 rd box of Remington Express Core-Lokt ammo. All that and freshly cleaned. Buck season is right around the corner, this would be an excellent hunting rifle for your son or daughter or just yourself. I am also consifering trades. Anything chambered in 357 whether it be a revolver or long rifle. Would be willing to travel a bit for a serious buyer. 1REDACTED"

No firearm is included - This is simply a sale / trade ad for the chassis only. Thank you.*Like new HS3 chassis made by MDT, machined of 6061 T6 aluminum that is hard anodized, for the Remington 700 Short Action. The chassis only touches the rifle in the V shape bedding block and recoil lug area, ensuring the best accuracy and repeatability out of your Remington 700 short action. The barrel is free floated. The forend does not touch the barrel at all, so you can use the forend as a barricade rest for your rifle without any worries of any shift  in accuracy.The sides of the forend have removable polymer panels that are FDE (see photos). There is an area near the front aides where you can attach m-lok mounts for whatever you want to attach to this. MDT also makes a night vision hood mount that attaches to the forend in front of your scope so you can have a night vision device in front of your scope. -This sale includes the MDT adjustable butt stock. It is adjustable for length and for cheek height (you can also use any AR-15 buttstock if you buy an adapter piece). Includes a rubber shoulder pad.I can include an Accuracy International brand 10rd box magazine (sells for 80), and an MDT brand 10rd polymer box magazine (sells for $30-40). Both mags work great, havent had any issues, I've uses both mags about 4-5 range trips. I will include both mags for $50.I also have a Harris bipod ($60) that is lightly used and an Ergo brand Swift AR15 grip ($20). This grip is more vertical than your usual AR grip which allows a more relaxed comfortable wrist angle while shooting prone. I will include these for $50.Feel free to contact me with any questions.
