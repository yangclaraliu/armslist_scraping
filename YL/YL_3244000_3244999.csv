34,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3244034,For Sale/Trade:  Harley Davidson (7k miles) literally like new 100th Anniversary,"Franklin / Cool Springs, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 4,500","Listed On: Tuesday, August 19, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"It's time to sell mom's Harley. At 67 years old, she's decided to let it go. She's babied it from day one and it shows. This is a one owner (1 owner) female owned and ridden bike that has never been abused, dropped or driven hard motorcycle. Bike starts right up with minimal choke required. You will be hard pressed to find a cleaner and better maintained bike than this one.

It was raining like crazy the day I took these photos. I can and will take any detailed pics you wish - the pictures do not do this bike justice. It is extremely clean and well maintained. Always, always garage kept.

For Sale: Mom's 2003 Harley Davidson 100th Anniversary Sportster Motorcycle (XLH 883 Hugger) with many add on's and/or upgrades to include the following:

* Upgraded 100th Anniversary Seat 
* Upgraded Factory Exhaust - louder than stock but very mild throaty sound 
* Crash Bars and Highway Pegs
* Easy Pull Clutch
* 100th Anniversary Windshield (not pictured but included)
* Upgraded lighting for greater visibility and vision especially at night
* Upgraded Mag Wheels - not the general spoke wheels
* HD Saddlebags (these are the factory bags and are really nice
* Misc. chrome pieces
* Helmet included
* All fluids and maintenance are up to date
* Battery was replaced about four months ago
* Always ethanol and fuel treatment included in gas fillups 

This motorcycle belongs to my mother who is 67 years old now and unable to ride any longer. It has been female owned and ridden from day one. The motorcycle only has 7,445 miles on it (yes, that is correct - less than 8k original miles or approximately 675 miles per year). Motorcycle has always been stored inside and covered. All fluids and maintenance just recently completed including a new battery. Tires are like new as well. This bike isn't even close to being broken in. 

This motorcycle is in excellent condition. Cash only and I will be happy to let you see the bike, crank it, sit on it, etc. but you cannot ride it unless cash changes hands. Too much liability for me and our insurance to cover. No other forms of payment accepted other than cash. I do not need help selling the bike and will not respond to crazy and/or low ball offers. The bike has been paid for for years and we are not desperate to sell it. 

Harley Davidson does offer financing to qualified buyers for their bikes. Feel free to contact HD to inquire about obtaining HD financing. Buyer will be responsible and I will only hold the bike for potential buyers with a $500 deposit.

Clean and clear title in hand.

Feel free to call, text or email with any questions. If the email or text looks suspicious, we will not respond. 

This bike does not need one thing other than a new owner and rider. Bike is being sold as is with no written or implied warranty. The Harley Davidson dealer in Cool Springs is willing to consign it in their dealership with a price tag in the $6k range. They have also offered to give a good price toward a trade, if desired.

Might be open to certain trades but prefer cash sale. Please don't offer junk, non-running cars, etc. Trade must be at least worth this bike is worth retail.

Potential Trades: 
* Rifles, shotguns, pistols, etc. 
* Z71 Tahoe, Suburban or Truck Pickup
* Volvo

UK VZ.59 Scopes  $699  

Factory: “yal” Meopta Prerau - Prerov factory
Manufactured: 1960's
Tube: 35mm
Magnification: 4x8, non adjustable focus and magnification.
Reticle: Cross with single chevron in center – reticle moves off center with windage and elevation adjustment similar to a Mosin PU sight
Adjustments: Windage and Elevation knobs (black with white numbers) – moves reticle off center in sight tube. 
Accessories: Shock absorbing screw-on rubber eye-protection piece; Screw-on yellow Lens Filter (male threads on one side, female threads on other); Screw-on Lens Flash Hider (screws directly on to lens tube, or on to lens filter).
Case: Some of these might include a Canvas carry case with belt loop, straps and leather trims; sometimes may include a Lens Cleaning Kit (horse hair brush and piece of linen)
Variations of sight: Tube (Day/Night sight) with side port and connection for reticle illumination device; Daytime only optic (rare) without side port connection for reticle illumination.

Illumination/Flashlight device (Can be purchased separately for $100 if available): Flashlight has RGB plastic color filters manually slid into place over the bulb IR, Red, Green, Blue, White. Sight reticle illumination requires this battery operated illuminator with cable attachment – see the connector on the mount side of the sight tube for bulb port. You can shine a small flashlight or bore light into the port on the side of the sight tube to see how the reticle lights up white in dark environments.

Mount: Clamp mount – securely pinned to sight tube, fits all UK VZ.59 milspec receivers 

THESE OPTICS WERE DESIGNED TO TAKE THE VIBRATION AND SHOCK OF A FULLY AUTOMATIC UK VZ 59 LIGHT MACHINE GUN OPERATING IN COMBAT ENVIRONMENTS, SO WHILE THEY ARE SIMPLE IN DESIGN AND FUNCTION, THEY ARE VERY ROBUST FOR A CIRCA 1960's SIGHT.


This private collection of optics have been individually inspected and it is believed that each sight functions properly as designed, however I am not an expert. The single cross/chevron reticle correctly moves off center (similar to a Mosin PU scope) in both windage and elevation using the two adjustment knobs on the tube as designed – there is no binding. The glass lenses are clear and not cracked or damaged, but may include tiny cleaning scratches, or inclusions/flaws in the glass as originally issued from the factory.  

Mount:
The original sight mount is included securely attached (pinned) to the optic tube and is complete and functional and will attach the optic to the UK VZ59 receiver top guide rails securely as designed.  The mount is isolated from shock with a hard rubber membrane manufactured between the receiver mount and the scope tube.

Parts:
The optional rubber eye piece extension, the yellow daytime lens filter, and the lens flash hider are all intact and included with the optic. There may or may not also be a piece of cloth and small paint brush (“cleaning kit”) and canvas bag (carry case) included so ask.

If you find that the optic does not mount securely to any milspec UK59 receiver, or function properly as originally designed and intended, you can return it to me WITHIN 10 DAYS of receipt in the same condition you received it in, for a full refund of your purchase price (not including shipping costs). This does NOT cover any cosmetic issues. 

These optics are acceptable used Czech Military surplus equipment and they will show varying signs of field use potentially including: scratches, missing paint - usually on mounts, field paint touch ups, surface rust and/or slight pitting on bare metal surfaces (like the mounts), small dents, and other cosmetic blemishes.  I believe these optics are in very acceptable military surplus condition, function properly, and would rate them as very good to excellent used surplus condition.  The are no bad parts, cosmetics, or issues that will effect the proper mounting and/or operation of the optic. 

Signal Device Flashlight and reticle illumination with electrical cable is offered for additional $125."

PRODUCT REVIEWS
I couldn't believe the quality of this scope. I compared it to several other name brand high end scopes that cost two to three times more than the 3X9X40. For the money you get way more than you expect. This scope is distortion free at 9X. I couldn't believe it but at 50 yards the clarity is good enough to see the holes in the black part of a cheap target. Anyone who buys this scope will not be disappointed. Superb clarity and brightness and sturdiness for a reasonable cost plus lifetime warranty. IMHO you can't beat this scope for the price.

“Professionally presented! Meticulously prepared! AND…even entertaining!

Jake was thoroughly prepared to teach critically important information. I appreciated that he stressed safety, practicality, and common sense all while conveying the legally required information. I can’t imagine this material being presented in a more thorough and convincing way. Thank you….. “

“I am very happy that I took my Concealed Firearm Course from Foremost Defensive Solutions. Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.”

Lori B. (Full last name omitted by Foremost Defensive Solutions, LLC for this persons protection of privacy)



“I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the knowledge and professionalism Jake displayed in our concealed weapon training class. The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough. His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole. His own experience as an officer was tremendous. Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part. I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake. I highly recommend the training he provides.

Thank you again for the class.”

Barrel and gas block are Lithgow made, Aussie. Bolt and carrier are Aussie. Bolt has spent some time in a British FAL that was serial number UBA 117976. Stock is NZ air force with the brass disc. Has an Aussie folding charging handle which would be correct for an NZ. Having marked laminate hand guards. Originally this 1962 rifle would have had solid wood hand guards so the laminates are replacements, but the wood often cracked or were broken so the replacements would also be correct.

According to Skennertons book (as per the serial numbers) this rifle is/was part of a contract run for New Zealand. Comes with 2-20rd mags and 1-30rd mag. One 20rd mag and the 30rd mag are DSA mags.

Note:  I realize that these prices do not reflect the good old days of 1-5 cents per round.  Just checked the Internet, prices from major on-line ammo dealers for a 1400-round Remington bucket were:  $185.42, $186.99, $187.95 & $209.00.  Add shipping to these prices.  When buckets sell for around $70 in retail stores, they are sold out in minutes.  I bought the Remington buckets second hand from a dude in Smyrna TN for well over $100 each, plus 150 miles road trip.  Sorry, I couldn't do better, wish I could buy at the big box store wholesale prices and sell cheaper than them."

644,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3244644,For Sale/Trade:  Sig P220 Elite Dark,"SW - 1604/90, San Antonio, Texas",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 9, 2014",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Selling my Sig Sauer P220 Elite Dark chambered in .45ACP.  Here's some highlights:

- The aluminum alloy frame's frontstrap and trigger guard is factory checkered and has a sweeping beavertail at the rear to assure you don't experience slide bite when shooting with an aggressive grip.
- Checkered aluminum grip panels provide a positive grip (manufactured by Hogue for Sig Sauer)
- The 8rd single-stack magazines also reduce the pistol's size for shooters with smaller hands.  The P220 feels very similar to a 1911 for both grip angle, circumference, and overall size.
- The barrel is 4.4"", and is not threaded.
- Equipped with adjustable night sights, still bright.
- Factory-equipped with the excellent Sig Short Reset Trigger (SRT) which reduces the amount of trigger reset between shots, providing for a super-fast reset for quicker follow-up shots.
- Sig short reach trigger installed which allows shooters with shorter fingers or smaller hands to easily reach the trigger for proper trigger finger placement, enhancing accuracy.
- Trigger was weighed with a Lyman digital trigger gauge, average of 10 pulls in single action was 5lbs, 5.50z and double action was a smooth 10lbs, 10.5oz 

This is a great pistol to shoot, one of the attached pics shows the first 10 rounds I shot from the P220.  I loaded 5 rounds in each mag and decocked the hammer between mags.  This was at a measured 7 yards.  I'm far from a great pistolero, but this thing is accurate!  On top of that, I had no malfunctions with the 100 rounds I fired from it.

The P220 comes with factory case, both 8rd magazines and rear sight wrenches - no user's manual will be provided because the first owner lost it.  I estimate approximately 500 rounds have been fired, total.  I have detail stripped and inspected/lubed the pistol.  Frame rails show no wear, and only the expected wear on the barrel's finish is visible.  Pistol is in fantastic condition, shoots great and is reliable.  Only selling because I'm moving to a double stack .45ACP which will fit my hands better.

Price is $800 FIRM. Face to face transactions only, buyer must be 21 years of age and will be required to present valid Texas ID at time of sale (CHL preferred).  I may travel a short distance to close sale, but no tire kickers, please!  I typically do my face to face sales in the parking lot of Academy located at 410/Military or 1604/Potranco."

 .54 CAL Traditional Hawkins. Not sure of the manufacturer of this one. This one is a right handed model. Nothing wrong with this one. This one has a sling installed and a hot nipple as well.

 Including all the items I have for the guns in the deals. 

 I have seen these listed online from $300-$400 each. These are in great shape and do not expect to get that from them. However I would like to get $200 each for them. Also considering trades. If interested in either one text me at REDACTED. (emails seem to be messing up and sending people to my spam folder)"

Ported and polished by A2A for power and a 15lb hammer spring installed. It takes 17 shots to go from from 3000 to 1900psi in its current state with 31gr Barracudas and it packs a punch (I have no specific speed measurement on it, I just know that animals don't have a chance). Last owner owner had some sort of cheek rest installed in it and plugged up the holes before I bought it. Last owner stated this airgun could put out 80FPE with heavy 43gr pellets so coyotes aren't a problem.  Shoots really well, just changing this out for a different airgun.

Gun wasn't a safe queen and saw some hunting use so there are some rubs and small dings but nothing major. Last owner had a cheek rest installed but it was removed and plugged before it was sold to me. 

I am asking 515 shipped (or 495 FTF) for this air rifle, 1.25 tins of 31gr Barracuda pellets, a degassing tool, bipod (attached) and 2 magazines. I am pretty sure that any sane person would say that this package is a steal.  A new Marauder runs about 500 bucks so think about that...

 Beretta PX4 Storm Inox Information from Beretta.com:

 The Px4 Inox brings a fresh look and unique style to the Px4 family. Starting from a solid bar of stainless steel, the slide is bead blasted to a smooth satin finish, ensuring a non-reflective surface that is highly resistant to the elements (barrel is black). Mated to the highly refined, techno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frame, the Px4 Inox is optimized for use in the most challenging environments.Together they create a two-tone finish that is not only practical and functional, but distinctly attractive.These features make the Px4 Inox perfectly suited to humid climates or harsh environments.The Inox continues to maintain the proven features of the Px4 line of pistols.The three interchangeable backstraps make fitting most shooters with different sized hands quick and easy.The magazine release is easily changed to accommodate both right- or left-handed shooters, and the unparalleled reliability of the in-line feeding system keeps the Inox running shot after shot.The Px4 Inox epitomizes functional elegance for the most demanding shooter.

 The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
 Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

 The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

 1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

 2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
 located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

 4. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
 misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

 5. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

 6. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

 7. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
 dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

 8. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.

 9. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

As some of you are probably well aware, most gun experts have definitively stated that the S&W 3913/3914 family of lightweight compact pistols are probably the best 9mm pistols one can use for CCW.

These pistols are accurate and super reliable. Easily as reliable as a Glock .

The 3913 is the most commonly seen version, and is available in LS, NL, and TSW configurations. The 3914 is the black version most popular with LE, and many who have owned both have stated that the trigger on the 3914 is smoother and accuracy was better. The 908 was the economy version that was released a few years later and not up to the same standards. Thus, the 3914 is the best 9mm pistol S&W has ever made or ever will make. These early pistols have no lock and no MIM parts. You cannot find a better 9mm CCW pistol anywhere.

This pistols has an alloy frame which can withstand +P ammo. This weighs only 24 oz. 8+1 capacity. DA/SA with ambi decocker. Shaved hammer is flush with the slide. Mine has  holster wear on the edge of the  slide by the barrel and the edge of the trigger guard, primarily left side.  Match grade accuracy that is more narrow than a 1911.  As you can see in the pics this gun was carried often and shot little.  One of the last all metal autos that S&W produced.
