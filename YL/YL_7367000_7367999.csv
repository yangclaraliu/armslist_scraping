71,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7367071,For Sale:  1990s Flack Jacket,"Maryville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, March 2, 2018",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The development of Kevlar and ceramic materiel in the 1970s and 1980s made real bulletproof vests possible. The ""Improved Conventional Munitions"" (ICM) Vest was issued in 1975, the first one of the new composite material (Kevlar) vest adopted by the U.S. military. However, even though it was a big improvement over the Vietnam Era M-1969 Fragmentation Protective Body Armor it did not become widespread in the U.S. services. The PASGT Vest and PASGT Helmet were introduced in the early 1980s, both made with Kevlar. The formal name of the vest is ""Body Armor, Fragmentation Protection Vest, Ground Troops"" but it was usually called the ""PASGT Vest"" or just the ""flak vest"" or ""flak jacket"". It was part of the PASGT system that included the Kevlar helmet and other components.
The PASGT Vest is a front opening design which protects the upper torso of the body. The ballistic fill consists of 13 plies of 14 oz. water repellent treated Aramid (Kevlar 29) fabric. The inner and outer cover, shoulder pads and front closure flap of the vest are water repellent treated 8 oz. ballistic nylon cloth. The outer cover is woodland camouflage printed and the inner cover is olive green. In the 1990s, 3-color and 6-color desert camo covers were issued for the PASGT in addition to the standard woodland camo.
 The vest has a 3/4 in collar, pivoting shoulder pads, 2 front pockets, 2 grenade hangers and rifle butt pad in the front shoulder area. The front and the pocket flaps all have velcro closures. The side overlaps are made flexible through the use of 1-1/2 inch (3.8 cm) wide elastic webbing.
The PASGT vest has improved ability to stop or slow down fragments, compared to the nylon vest of the Vietnam War period, made obsolete by PASGT. It reduced the number of wounds, especially serious and lethal, from exploding conventional and improved conventional munitions. When the PASGT Vest was worn in combat areas, an 18-53 percent decrease (threat dependent) in all fragmentation caused casualties was predicted and largely 
The PASGT vest was superior to the Vietnam era nylon vest not only in ballistic performance but also in terms of comfort and camouflage properties. The PASGT Vest provided a superior fit and wearer comfort because the PASGT vest was more flexible due to both the materials used and the vest design. The Kevlar ballistic filler in the back was made in four sections; the three upper back sections slide over each other and over the lower back section to allow for any changes in body dimensions associated with various movements. The shoulder pads with elastic webbing and snaps allowed more freedom of upper arm movement, and compatibility with the other clothing and individual equipment was increased. In addition, vinyl envelope and plastic stiffeners are eliminated through the use of water repellent treated materials, and camouflage properties are improved.
The PASGT vest could be upgraded to stop 7.62-mm rounds by teaming it with the Interim Small Arms Protective Overvest. However, the combined weight of the two systems was 25.1 pounds, considered too much by most soldiers."

The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible. All Daniel Defense cold hammer forged barrels are made from start to finish in a state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with the heritage of not cutting corners, all cold hammer forged barrels feature a forged chamber and heavy phosphate exterior coating or Salt Bath Nitride Finish. These barrels will prove themselves to be more accurate and last longer than a barrel that has cut or button rifling.

The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish and installed a new firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This gun does come with a Folbus paddle holster as well. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up for yourself. Price is firm. I am in Maryville and will only meet in Maryville due to transportation complications. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale for both of our records and safety. Thank you."

This is an anodized black aluminum metal knuckle guard grip for M7 bayonets. It is a replacement grip for your M7 bayonet for M16/AR15 style rifles with bayonet lugs. Just replace your right side grip and use the original screws. Still works and fits as a bayonet on your rifle. Unique! These grips were reportedly made in the US during the late Viet Nam era in Kentucky by a company called Conneta as an experimental project. They also had a contract to provide M7's to the military. You remove the factory grip from one side and install the replacement with your screws and nuts to make the bayonet into a trench knife. The grip has never been used or installed, so it may require some work to get it fitted to your particular M7 bayonet. More pictures available to show these mounted on M7's that were used. Again, the M7 bayonet and scabbard are not in the listing. Please be sure you can legally own this item before you bid. There are no returns because it is illegal for you to own in your state. Do your homework first. Continental USA shipping only. Shipping is $5. I accept Paypal or USPS Money Order only. Thanks for looking."

This revolver is famous for looking and functioning similar to a Colt Python. It has a cylinder open latch that works the same, and it has a cylinder that turns clockwise. This is not a Python in terms of it's quality or how it feels. This is a working man's pistol. It's rough around the edges, and it's a shooter, but that's why you buy guns, right? This pistol is missing the end cap for the plunger that ejects the shells.

I built two identical rifles with mine being an SBR version with a 12"" barrel and TBAC Ultra 9 suppressor. I build the 16"" legal version for a friend who is old like me and can't carry a heavy rifle but wants something that can reach out and kill with good energy. I picked the lightest possible parts available. The rifle weighs just 5lbs with a full 5 round magazine but no optics. It weighs just 6.5lbs with the larger 4-14 optic and just 6.2 ready to hunt with the smaller 1-4 style optic in an Aero Precision SPR ultralight mount. Unfortunately my friend had money issues and can't buy it so it's up for sale. I took my SBR version down to Youngs Long Shot in Indiana and was able to hit the 18"" steel target at 1000 yards. Imagine 1K with an SBR! This was using the Hornady factory Black ELD 123-X ammo. Here is the build list with the prices listed as if you built it yourself.
