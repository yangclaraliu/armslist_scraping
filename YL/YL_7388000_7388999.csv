I am selling a brand new, freshly built Precision type AR-15 complete upper receiver group. This upper is loaded down with some of the best mil parts on the planet. Let’s begin with the barrel. It is a Ballistic Advantage Hanson profile 14.5” with a Surefire WarComp muzzle device. This will accept all fast attach socom suppressors as well as the Surefire Warden blast diffuser. The rail is the BCM KMR Rail 13” in length. The upper receiver is a Ballistic Advantage model with M4 feed ramps. Strike Industries charging handle with oversized latch. Also comes with a bipod. This is a rather inexpensive bipod, but it should get the job done for most people’s needs. The included Bolt Carrier Group is a Spike’s Tactical mil-spec model with a phosphate finish. It also comes with the newer Streamlight ProTac Rail Mount HL-X. It is mounted on a BCM offset mount, and comes complete with tape switch. As pictured, also comes with some BCM Keymod rail covers in FDE color. I may have left something out. Just have a look at it and tell me what you think. Thank you.."

I got it recently as a part of a trade. I have not fired it yet, but the previous owner told me that he'd fired about 400-500 rounds through it. Starting off as a SLR-107FR, it is improved a great deal by Krebs including by having the barrel made shorter, a precision crown added, and the muzzle brake pinned on (you can't even see a weld). The sights are laser bore sighted, all sharp edges are removed including from the bolt, mag release and trigger guard. I can tell you that it's a very smooth rifle. Krebs did a great job with these, the coating is amazing.It's in amazing condition. As the buyer, you will get the choice of one of the pistol grips, handguard sets and stocks from the picture above. In addition to that, you will also have:- 1 x Arsenal AK Sling- 1 x 5 Round Arsenal Magazine- 1 x 30 round Magpul Magazine- 1 x 30 round steel magazine (may not be functioning properly)- Larry Vickers/Blue Force Gear AK SlingI'm selling this whole package for $1,650.

I have owned it for the last 12 years and put less than 100 mi a year on it. I purchased it from a private owner in scranton pa. It has mostly been in garage storage and started every so often. Runs good. Never driven in rain by me, or ever if you believe the previous owner. It currently has Classic Tags on it which cannot be sold/transferred with the car so I will be removing them. Upgraded Monza chrome exhaust, chrome gear shift knob. Has factory aluminum wheels. Has the original leather bags for the T-tops. New rear tires, speakers, new Battery from autozone, new K&N air filter, new shocks, new exhaust as stated above. Has blackouts for lights, working original 8 track tape player +extra tapes, power windows, rear defog, car cover, orig owner's manual in perfect cond.  Problems that I can find: Passenger seatbelt does not suck back in at the top. Power door locks do not work.  Horn stopped working. AC not hooked up/working - has ac but I have never used it because I only drove with the ttops off. When you turn the ac on it blows air but not cold - I just found the belt that was removed for the ac motor in a rear storage compartment.  Brakes feel pretty good now that I've started driving it more. It is a beautiful car, but its not perfect. Purchase knowing that it is not perfect, sold as is. I will do my best to describe every detail but I may miss something small. Thanks. Purchaser responsible for shipping arrangements. I am near Harrisburg Pennsylvania. This car is sold as is.

The Chiappa Rhino 4"" revolver offers great ergonomics and accuracy due to its very unusual profile. The flat cylinder allows for maximum comfort while reducing the typical revolver profile. The barrel position is key to the Rhino's low recoil characteristics because it lowers the center of gravity and yields a center line of the bore that is more in line with a shooter's arm. The Rhino's unique design allows for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target.

Inside the admittedly-cool exterior lies one of the finest firearm innovations we've seen in some time: the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down and away from the shooter, virtually eliminating felt recoil and muzzle climb. The low bore axis takes it a step further, ensuring that the recoil travels back, not up. THE GEN II SDP: THE VECTOR SELF DEFENSE PISTOL. The Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full-length Picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterpart, and is civilian legal in most states. Additionally, the SDP features all the Gen II enhancements of its larger counterparts, like a chrome-lined barrel, beefed-up barrel contour, improved fire control group, and a re-positioned fire/safe switch, among others.

Product Description
The criteria for the gun:
To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.
State of the Art:
Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.

Comes with 3 x (20 round pmags Gen 3) and the orginal box, manual, and cheek riser. Can send more pictures if needed (excuse the bad photography). I bought the galil this year new in box from Big Daddy Guns in Gainesville with the intentions of starting precision shooting. But as the months went by and the hording of .308 and 7.62x51 became another expensive hobby I am now deciding to sell it. Not because its a bad gun but because I don't think at this time I can devote the time to practice and use the full potential of this rifle. The closet range to me is an hour drive and it not really a long range. I have never shot or took this gun anywhere close to a gun range so it would literaly be like new with the exception of me cleaning it time to time, so maybe that would increase it's value by $200 for having it cleaned by a professional gun cleaner. But all jokes aside this is a great rifle never needed to be repaired or serviced and no broken parts or defects. The person who buys this will have a badass time with it and if you have any question message me whenever. Thanks for taking a look at my listing and Have a great day(also I can sell some steel .308 Tula at a good price for whoever buys the rifle.)"

Can meet anywhere around Orlando and Gainesville area. Changed this 5 shell mag tube out for a full length titanium one and had this one lying around doing nothing and wondered if i can make some money of it. Fun fact: if you like the SCAR's apperance in color then you would love this on your Benelli M4 because this tube straight out of the factory has a two tone color scheme with dark grey closer to the reciever and black at the barrels end. (will trade for a Barrett M107A1 or somthing else thats really expensive and cool)All jokes aside if your interested and have a question just message me anytime. Thanks for taking a look at my listing and have a great day.
