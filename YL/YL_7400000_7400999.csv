This rifle comes in OK, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have some pretty heavy wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was not properly taken care of over the last 50+ Years, as well as the fact that it was regularly used, and previously owned. There are no major flaws/defects to be found in the rifle's wood stock, or forearm, though there are a handful of minor scratches, and scrapes, as well as some shallow nicks and cuts. There are no severe chips, cracks, gouges, staining, discoloration, or breaks. The receiver, and barrel on this rifle however, do show a moderate to heavy amount of rusting, staining, and pitting. This has caused the lever to stick slightly, when the firearm is racked, but it does still fire properly. This rifle features its original iron sights, as well as an off-set hunting scope. This scope is off-set, as the rifle features a top-load shell ejection system. Despite it's somewhat rough condition, this rifle would make an excellent addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the rifle's EXACT condition, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

The barrel is stamped 4-43, though it has undoubtedly been rearsenaled. All parts save for the magazine cutoff are parkerized. This indicates the rifle was gone over after the war, as many parts would have originally been blued. The stock, however, appears original. It shows signs of use, and the cartouches are all there that indicate originality. It really adds to the beauty and interest of the rifle. Most of the small parts are marked with an ""R"" as you would expect given its Remington production. Also included is a front sight cover which I believe is aftermarket (it is not a hood, just a cover for the thin front sight).Rifling is strong, bolt is smooth, and it shoots wonderfully. The rifle is fully functional, and ready to bring many more years of enjoyment."

Leupold Vari-X 3-9 Compact with Duplex reticle and 'bikini' lens caps, and the sling as shown.  Optics are bright and clear.  I purchased this new in 1999, and have taken several deer with it - a great caliber for Wisconsin mixed woods/field hunting.  Total weight including sling is less than 7 3/4 pounds.  The rifle was made in New Haven CT.If you're looking for a collectable, this is not for you.  I do not have the box or original papers, and it is no longer in 'factory original' condition.  But if you want a practical, accurate hunting rifle, in beautiful blued steel and walnut, then check this out.Wisconsin ID, no minors, no felons.  A valid CCL is preferred, and face to face transaction only.Sorry, no trades at this time ... Just bought some new toys, and need the cash.And yes, if the listing is still up, I still have it."

Built in 1919.. Its finish is so nice for the age it appears unfired since factory. These guns were a favorite in the Ganster era of the Police and the Gansters alike. John Dillinger had one in his pocket the fateful night he went to the movies with the 'Lady in Red"" in Chicago. Colt even made a run of these a few years ago and they sell at a big premium. The Blued finish is deep and highly polished with the correct Colt Black grips with the Stallion. One magazine that says Colt 32 on its base. A great Christmas gift for the man in your life that has everything!MN buyer needs MN state photo ID and permit.Out of state buyer pays $30 shipping to thier local FFL."

I purchased the firearm new about 4 years ago and since then the firearm has seen less than 200 rounds through it. It has been well cleaned / oiled between each session. I purchased due to the reliability of a revolver as an everyday carry, and the trigger pull on the Ruger LCR can't be beat! As the wife wants it out of the house, I am including everything along with this sale (perfect for a first-time owner like me)!
1) Ruger LCR 38 SPL +P w/ Hogue Tamer grip. Original box, paperwork, trigger lock, Ruger zip-case, test shell, etc. It's all there.
2) Crossbreed Super-Tuck IWB holster. (Custom Ordered for Ruger LCR 38)
3) Around 150-200 rounds of .38 Estate Ammo, some +P Ammo, and a brand new box of Hornady Critical Defense rounds. Ammo case included.
4) Ear and Eye protection, bottle of oil, some .38 Snap-Caps, and a can of break-free powder blast.
5) Combination-Lock Gun Case.
Asking $375 for everything, firm. The Ruger box still has the $349.99 price I paid on the side of it, the crossbreed holster alone was $70, and you're getting about another $70 in ammo (including a $22 brand new box of Critical Defense); everything else is yours since I will no longer need it. I live south of Atlanta by about 30 minutes, willing to travel, but local sales only (no shipping)."

Made in Germany in 1970. This is the same as the Savage Anschutz Model 54 Sporter except that this one is wearing its original name and markings. It was not imported through Savage but directly delivered to the VIP buyer, Walter G. Bush. It wasn't renamed and rebadged to 'Savage Anschutz Model 54 Sporter' by Savage like all the other 1422s imported to the States during the 70s.What makes this rifle unique is that since it was ordered by a member of the Bush family it has all of the top of the line options. Most noticeable is the fully jeweled stainless steel bolt with stainless steel handle (all others I've seen do not have a stainless steel handle but a blued cast steel). The sides of the trigger are also jeweled. 'Walter G. Bush' was engraved in a cursive font at the Anschutz factory on the right side of the receiver. The bluing is old school and of very high quality. It actually looks 'blue' unlike today's offerings where the ""bluing"" looks black and is of inferior quality. The stock is made of beautifully grained Walnut wood.I'm allowed only 3 pictures on this site but I've provided a Google Drive link above for full size images. If you are interested and have any questions or would like more pictures please feel free to contact me. I'd rate the bluing as 99+% and the wood 90%. Please take a look at the photos to judge for yourself. This rifle was used by the original owner and not just kept as a safe queen. There are some use marks on the wood but nothing that stands out or lessens the beauty of this incredible rifle. Most importantly the metal and mechanics are flawless.I'm asking $1350 OBO. Feel free to contact me with any questions.Thanks for looking."

This revolver was shipped in 1942 to a gentleman in Tennessee that was a civial Flight instructor that trained WWII pilots for the War effort. This is the only reason we can figure how he was lucky enough to get a Colt shipped to him during the war. Tis is beacuse all of Colts production was shipped to the Military during these years and No civilians were allowed to get new guns because they were deemed non-essential by the Government. We did some research and came up with his story and even a picture of the man! The revolver has a bobbed hammer with a checkered top so the shooter can still cock it for single action shots. It has a Parkerized finish. The gun has very little if any use and the grips look new as well. A neat little War time Colt with a good story and a letter all in 38 special.MN buyer needs MN state photo ID and permit.Out of state buyer pays $30 shipping to thier local FFL."

When i got the laser he told me the batteries were dead. He didnt give me the allen keys or have them in order to remove the small screws to change the batteries, i was told that the screw head on the screw that needs to be removed to be able to change the battery was stripped. Which means it cant be opened to chane the battery to even see if it works.i messaged back the guy to tell him and no response. He also lied about the laser being a CMR-206, after having it removed it says laserlyte on the inside. Check everything the guy tries to sell electronically or internally and make sure everything works, i gave the guy the benefit of the doubt but i guess some folks really cant be trusted. Dont buy any laser or lights from him, stay safe and buy em new. Update: i had to buy a set of allen keys to remove the back plate where the batteries where. I changed out the batteries with new ones and the laser still did not work!! He knew it was broken or didnt work and just passed it off as dead. Deal with him at your own risk if you must."
