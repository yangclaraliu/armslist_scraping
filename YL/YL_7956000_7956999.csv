Collectors seem to be after the box and not all have matching SN to the pistol. Has original owners manual and cleaning rod as well. This is a 1977 Star BM, spainish guard pistol in 9mm. Resembles the look of the original 1911 and is in a commander compact size.  The original guard roll marks were milled off before export but there are several underneath the left grip showing date made and issue. Several exporters do this in case some time down the line in some foreign conflict they have their insignia removed and can't be held responsible. Apparently they didn't know they were coming to America. Besides being used by Spain in law enforcement these pistols were service pistols in Rhodesia. As service pistols they are pretty stout and have held up great over the last 40 years. This example is a ""Good"" rated surplus pistol. Only wear is holster wear. Slight ding on the front sight post but I flattened it back up and doesn't effect the accuracy. I completly stripped it to ensure there was 0 rust on the internals and to clean up 40 years of use. I removed the magazine disconnect and polished up the mag to help it drop free, but I'll reinstall it upon request or just include it in the box. Slide to frame is extremely tight just like a 1911. Single stack 8 round mag. Single action. I'll be fair on price not like others on armslist posting junk for high dollar prices. Considering the collectible nature of the box and matching numbers I'm only asking for $20 more than what I got it after transfer. Get a good looking 1911 style pistol in 9mm for less search them up on YouTube. Buyer will not be disappointed. I bought 3, this one is the most collectible of those three. I've already stripped and buffed one, going to duracoat the other. This one has the same fate but offering a collector a chance"

The receiver/frame is case color hardened still displaying iridescent hues. Installed on the solid barrel rib is a set of Truglo Gobble Magnum front and rear adjustable fiberoptic rifle sights. A new Limbsaver Precision-Fit Air Tech recoil pad was selected and installed on the butt stock. This shotgun can be converted to a Combination Gun by by inserting the 18” 32 H&R Magnum Insert Barrel manufactured by Green Mountain Barrel Manufactuing Company and custom fabricated for fit and finish by Gunsmith Ace Dube of MCA Sports in Alaska. The Insert Barrel and the bore barrel are notched for proper alignment to achieve repeatable Rifle Sight and VFY1000 R/G Dot Holographic Reflex Sight target accuracy. It can be chambered for 32 S&W Short, 32 S&W Long, and 32 H&R Magnum, with 32 S&W Long being preferable for small game hunting. This ammunition using lead flat head bullets is lethal on small game while limiting tissue damage and conserving tablefare by the nature of the non-expanding bullet type. The Shotgun barrel has a cylinder bore and chambers  2 3/4” 16 gauge shot shells or slugs."

He said his father loved the gun to much to shoot it a lot so that is why it is in such fine shape. I called Smith & Wesson to get a date on the gun and the guy there said all he could tell me is it was made between 1962 and 1967 and he said I could pay to get a letter with the exact date but I declined. The gun is simply fabulous and it original and NOT a re blue. Here is a good buy for you... Insured shipping available on request for $50 buy may only be shipped to an FFL dealer."
