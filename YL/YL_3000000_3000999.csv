This is a used item that came to me as part of a trade-in package.  I was informed by the previous owner that it was a service duty weapon for Maryland Natural Resource Police.  Initially I contacted Smith & Wesson Customer Service to find out the Factory Shipment Date and was informed by the S&W Rep that it left the factory on February 25, 1990 and was delivered to Maryland Forest, Park, & Wildlife Services in Annapolis, MD. 

I Followed up with Maryland Department of Natural Resources and confirmed via the serial number that this was in fact a service issued duty weapon for MFP&WS, (pre-merger).  In 1992 the MFP&WS merged with Maryland Natural Resources Police.  At that time MFP&WS were issued S&W Model 67’s as Service Duty weapons, however after the merger with MNRP, MFP&WS Officers traded their 67’s for Beretta 92’s (which is what MNRP Officers were carrying at the time).  At that point, the Model 67 former duty weapons, no longer needed for service, were marked for “decommission” (ie, destruction)  by the state of MD (which would have been nothing short of a travesty in my opinion).  However, at the last minute, they were granted a “reprieve” of sorts, and were traded into a Law Enforcement Contractor/Provider.  From there they were sold off to people who simply happened to be in the right place at the right time.

 I’m not exactly sure how many MFP&WS 67’s remained in the end, but from what I was told, there weren’t that many (maybe 15 – 20).  You can see from the pics, this particular service weapon sustained very little duty wear, and is in Good/Very Good Condition. Formal documentation (from S&W and from MNRP), can be obtained to verify all I’ve indicated above, however I do not possess any written documentation at this time (and the offering price reflects this accordingly).  There is a possibility that I may receive one of the letters of verification that I’ve requested, any day now.  If I receive it prior to a sale, the offering price will be adjusted accordingly (as you can probably guess, the asking price will go up).  If I receive it “post-sale”, I will obviously convey it to the new owner to be made part of the firearm.

Offering Price - $750.00 (For all in-state purchases this includes all Background Check/Transfer Costs).  For Out of State Purchases, I must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or I will not ship. Payment can be made with Bank Certified Check.  I charge $20.00 for freight to ship this firearm USPS.   IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PURCHASING.

Gun is in excellent condition and fired very little. Colt Snake guns are highly collectible and seem to increase in value daily. The Colt Anaconda is widely regarded as the finest 44 mag ever made.  I will spare you the history and basics of the firearm, since if you are looking at this ad you no doubt know what it is.   Let's just say whether you are looking for an investment gun, to take down a Grizzly Bear or something to leave the guys at the range with dropped jaws, the Colt Anaconda fits the bill. Please feel free to email me with questions.

FTF transfer or through local dealer if you like. I will not ship the pistol. Must be legal to own firearm and show valid ID. Must be willing to sign bill of sale.

From Mossberg’s International division comes this outstanding Silver Reserve Side by Side Shotgun. Examination of its lines and workmanship demonstrate the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. The home company is Kayhan Art of Turkey. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. It is every bit as slick as the Ithaca / SKB doubles from the 1970s. Kayhan, and pretty much all Turkish guns we have sold, portray their Italian influence. The milling equipment, we are told, is from Italy. Metal construction is all steel, blue steel 26 inch barrels. Chambering is for any 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shell. Choke system is Beretta Mobil-choke style, threads at the muzzle, and any Benelli or Beretta tubes will interchange with the Silver Reserve’s tubes. This shotgun comes with a total of five tubes: two each .708 Improved Cylinder; and one each .701 Modified, one each .691 Improved Modified, and one each .683 Full. Sighting system is low groove recessed rear beginning at the top of the breech lug, and brass bead front sight. Ejection system is solid block extractors, no shell-slinging ejectors. Mechanism is classic Beretta style box lock with Single Selective Trigger and tang mounted safety that also acts as the barrel selector in safe position. Trigger guard, breech lever and forend furniture are all blue steel; and receiver is half coverage engraved nickel plated steel. Stock and forend are satin finished Turkish Walnut, with cut checkering on the forend sides and pistol grip area. Length of pull measures 14 1/8 inches from the face of the single gold plated trigger to the end of the 1/2 inch decelerator type factory recoil pad. Buttstock drop is 1 3/4 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt. Right hand cant to the buttstock is about an inch, so this shotgun will not be southpaw friendly unless its buttstock is altered or shimmed to cant it to the left. Weight empty is 7.1 pounds, balanced at the front of the receiver. Photo specimen is one of only a few dozen we were able to get on an Importer liquidation. All of them are brand new, and under Mossberg Factory Service Warranty; at this price, however, we will accept returns within 7 days of the execution of the 4473 form. We have only seen occasional edge scouring around the pistol grip cap area on the buttstock. Replacement pricing on this shotgun is over $1,000.00 on the retail level. It wholesales for over $700.00. We’re offering the 12 gauge Mossberg 77081 Silver Reserve in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 389.00.

As advertised. I will also throw in 500 rounds of 125 grain Lake City. I got a good deal on this Ammo and will gladly pass along that savings to the buyer of this rifle. Meaning I will not sell the rounds separate.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

From Mossberg’s International division comes this outstanding Silver Reserve Side by Side Shotgun. Examination of its lines and workmanship demonstrate the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. The home company is Kayhan Art of Turkey. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. It is every bit as slick as the Ithaca / SKB doubles from the 1970s. Kayhan, and pretty much all Turkish guns we have sold, portray their Italian influence. The milling equipment, we are told, is from Italy. Metal construction is all steel, blue steel 28 inch barrels. Chambering is for any 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shell. Choke system is Beretta Mobil-choke style, threads at the muzzle, and any Benelli or Beretta tubes will interchange with the Silver Reserve’s tubes. This shotgun comes with a total of five tubes: two each .708 Improved Cylinder; and one each .701 Modified, one each .691 Improved Modified, and one each .683 Full. Sighting system is low groove recessed rear beginning at the top of the breech lug, and brass bead front sight. Ejection system is solid block extractors, no shell-slinging ejectors. Mechanism is classic Beretta style box lock with Single Selective Trigger and tang mounted safety that also acts as the barrel selector in safe position. Trigger guard, breech lever and forend furniture are all blue steel; and receiver is half coverage engraved nickel plated steel. Stock and forend are satin finished Turkish Walnut, with cut checkering on the forend sides and pistol grip area. Length of pull measures 14 1/8 inches from the face of the single gold plated trigger to the end of the 1/2 inch decelerator type factory recoil pad. Buttstock drop is 1 3/4 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt. Right hand cant to the buttstock is about an inch, so this shotgun will not be southpaw friendly unless its buttstock is altered or shimmed to cant it to the left. Weight empty is 7.2 pounds, balanced at the front of the receiver. Photo specimen is one of only a few dozen we were able to get on an Importer liquidation. All of them are brand new, and under Mossberg Factory Service Warranty; at this price, however, we will accept returns within 7 days of the execution of the 4473 form. We have only seen occasional edge scouring around the pistol grip cap area on the buttstock. Replacement pricing on this shotgun is over $1,000.00 on the retail level. It wholesales for over $700.00. We’re offering the 12 gauge Mossberg 77084 Silver Reserve in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 389.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card

Photos are representative, but this entire lot of pistols is well maintained and buyer will receive a very smilar P38 to the one in the photos. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, may take any number of very similar Walthers at the same per-pistol price and with no extra shipping charges. From duty on the front lines of the Cold War with the Federal German Border Police, Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS,  here is one of several very attractive Cold War pieces manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, from 1958 until 1963. These pistol are certainly a symbolic pieces of the Berlin wall, and the island of Democracy that West Germany stood for. 1963 was the final year of government issue for pistols labeled P38; the new P1 designation came at the request of the German Army. Each pistol bears correct West German proof marks, and Its only U.S. marking is the federally mandated  import stamp, PW Arms, so marked on the right forward side of the slide. Slide and frame have matching numbers. This is a lightweight, alloy-frame model P-38 in 9mm Luger, production of which began in 1956. It is very similar to, and a direct descendant of, the fabled steel frame P38 of World War II. Construction is durable anodized alloy frame with matte  military finish on its barrel , slide, and all its steel parts. Type is traditional double and single action semi-auto with full safety / decocking lever. The P-38 has a firing pin safety as well, but no magazine safety. Magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm Luger, Parabellum, 9x19 ammunition, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 4 7/8 inches. Sights are dovetailed notch rear and blade front. Weight empty is 28.2 ounces. Surface detractions are minimal, only faint amounts of whitening on its sharp edges and light holster contact streaking. We rate these P38s as Very Good, close to Excellent, 85 to 90 percent  vicinity by our estimate. If refinished, the lettering is so sharp it doesn’t matter. Each pistol is excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, and the West German Police always took good care of their firearms anyway. This is an excellent quality pistol, but not designed for +P loads. Its historical importance includes the fact that the P38 was the direct ancestor to our own well known 3900 and 5900 Smith & Wessons, and the Beretta 92 / M9. Own one of these fine Cold Warrior Walther P-38 pistols	for only	$ 339.00.	All are definitely C&R Eligible; C&R licensed civilians only may own in Massachusetts.

Description
MAG5-60
The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

-Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines

 Comes in original wooden engraved NRA display case with glass lid.

 $1,200.00 Or Best Offer
 Research provided following information on this piece.

( From Gun Values Board )
 Book Value seems to be from $800.00 to $1,400.00 for the Friends of NRA Beretta 96 FS .40 S&W. Beretta made a total of 825 of these NRA 10 year Commemoratives. After a few calls, a phone visit with a regional director, and some research I can offer the following for what it's worth. Number 1 of 825 is in the NRA Museum, number 2 is in the Beretta museum. Numbers 3 thru 15 of 825 were given to NRA Officers and regional directors ( Number 10 was given to Charlton Heston - NRA President ). Numbers 16 thru 22 were given to major supporters of the NRA, 23 thru 33 were ear-marked for NRA regional events as awards ( it is not known if all 10 were awarded at events ). If I understand correctly, number 34 of 825 was the first of these that was offered for sale to the public, with preference to NRA members or NRA events. As is usual, the lower the number ( for example, number 61 of 825 Vs. say number 506 of 825 ) the higher the value. Since the first 33 were ""in-house"" gifts or gifts to major supporters, numbers 34 thru 150 of 825 would be at the upper end of book value. 

 For sale here is number 042 of 825, or ( according to the research ) the 9th one available to the public.
 Asking price is $1,200.00 Or Best Offer"

Here is Mossberg International’s crowning achievement, the Silver Reserve Over and Under Shotgun. Examination of its lines and workmanship demonstrate the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. The Silver Reserve Field, of which this is a specimen, is equipped with five interchangeable choke tubes and wrench, providing the ultimate in versatility with lead, steel and other non-toxic loads. Manufacturer is Kayhan Art, or Khan, of Konya, Turkey. Importer is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT. Mossberg Int’l SKU is 75410. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over-and-Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. So says Mossberg. The photos show the attractively blued barrel, 3 inch chambered 28 inch Vent Rib with a total of five Benelli/Beretta thread choke tubes: two each .708 Improved Cylinder; and one each .701 Modified, one each .691 Improved Modified, and one each .683 Full. Stock and forend are satin finished European Walnut with cut checkering. Receiver is engraved satin nickel with gold inlay. Trigger is gold plated, and the tang safety serves as barrel selector. Barrels have single block extractor, and the extractor and chamber sides are nicely jeweled. Buttstock measures for a 14 inch length of pull including the Decelerator type buttpad; 1 1/2 inch drop at comb and 2 1/4 inch drop at heel with about a 3 degree right hand cant from the frame, so this O/U will not be Southpaw friendly unless a competent stock smith alters the cant. Weight empty is a well balanced 7.7 pounds with center of gravity at the back of the forend. Firing selection is by mechanical transfer, not by recoil. All our specimens are new and unfired, manufactured in 2011 or 2012, and this 75410 variant has given way to an essentially identical 75412 variant in the Mossberg International Line. All of our specimens are in their boxes with all their papers and equipment just like they shipped to a distributor last year. Those papers include a never executed factory registration certificate. Forends will show some finish stain weakness on their edges and checkering like the one in the photos. These shotguns were never out of Mossberg distribution channels until we got them. These Silver Reserves command prices upwards of $900.00 apiece in our area. We're offering the 75410 Mossberg Silver Reserve in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for a wholesale level price of only $ 469.00.

From Mossberg’s International division comes this outstanding Silver Reserve Over-and-Under Shotgun. Examination of its lines and workmanship show the impressive expertise of Turkish Gunmakers who, after all, have been at the trade for as long as their Italian teachers and counterparts. The home company is Kayhan Art of Turkey. Not only Mossberg, but also Remington, Smith & Wesson, and Weatherby have all indulged their lines with shotguns made in Turkey; and this is the most attractive of the entire lot. The Silver Reserve Field .410 gauge handles both 2 1/2 inch and 3 inch shells interchangeably; barrels are 26 inch Vent Rib, full choke bottom tube around .375 muzzle diameter; and Modified top tube around .385 muzzle diameter. Mossberg International SKU is 75410. At the heart of every Reserve Series Over-and-Under is an underlock design, box lock action for superior strength and low profile. So says Mossberg. Mechanism is Single Selective Trigger; the safety lever serves as barrel selector. The shotgun cocks itself upon unbreeching, and transfer is mechanical, not recoil. Mechanism is extractor, no hull-wasting automatic ejectors. The photos show the attractively little lightweight. Stock and forend are satin finished European Walnut with cut checkering. Receiver is engraved satin nickel with gold inlay. Trigger is gold plated, and the tang safety served as barrel selector. Barrels have single block extractor, and the extractor and chamber sides are nicely jeweled. Buttstock measures for a 13 3/4 inch length of pull including the Decelerator type buttpad; 1 1/2 inch drop at comb and 2 1/4 inch drop at heel with about a 3 degree right hand cant from the frame, so this shotgun will not be Southpaw friendly unless altered by a professional gunsmith with expertise in stockwork. Weight empty is a very pleasant 6.25 pounds, center of gravity 2 inches forward of the trigger guard. Photo specimen and its mates are new and unfired, in their original boxes with late 2012 manufacturing dates on their labels. They have occasional shipment wear to the edges of their forends. These Silver Reserves command prices upwards of $800.00 in our area. We're offering this one, however, the shotgun in the photo or one of its identical mates, for only $ 519.00.

Rossi .38 Special model 351 Blue Steel 3 inch 5 Shot Full Lug Heavy Barrel Excellent in Box Factory Demo Walnut Grips Discontinued 38 spl S&W 36-10 Classic Stand In R35103U We’ve dealt Rossi Revolvers for a long time. They’ve always offered credible copies of the Smith & Wesson Chief’s Special. Some of our first were the model 30s of the 1960s. After 1968, and up until the mid 1980s, all the new Rossi J frame revolvers had 3 inch barrels. A 3 inch is optimal. It will hit point of aim better than a 2 inch, yields 50 fps more velocity, less noise, and more stability. Snubs always outsold them, still do, but the 3 inchers are a better choice. Any ammunition shown in our photos is not included. Here is Rossi’s descendant of its 68 series revolver, the R351 chambered in .38 Special. Manufacturer is Amadeo Rossi of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, a Taurus affiliate; this .38 is marked Made In Brazil By Taurus. Type is traditional double and single action. Construction is entirely blue steel with the exception of the gray hardened steel hammer nose firing pin and rivet. Frame is J Size small frame, with Square Butt Grip frame and 3 screw side plate. Barrel is 3 inch heavy full lug type, with matte finish verticals and barrel-integral serrated blade front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, and Rossi rates its 351 series revolvers for +P ammo. Note the cylinder yoke’s detent latch, a Taurus inspired mechanical improvement that prevents cylinder wobble. Trigger is .290 smooth faced combat with semi-target, shorter spur .400 serrated hammer. Weight empty is a well balanced 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the trigger. Double action trigger pull is smooth and consistent, 12 pound vicinity, with a crisp 6 pound single action pull. Safety system consists of a transfer bar that prevents the firing pin from touching a cartridge primer unless the trigger is fully depressed, and also Taurus’s innovative internal hammer lock. Note that we have installed a set of Sile Italian Walnut Grips for Smith & Wesson J Frame Square Butt, modified and fitted to this Rossi. Small amounts of grip frame will show, as the photos show, but the Siles look infinitely better than Rossi’s factory issue rubber grips, see our attached comparative photo of an early 1980s 3 inch S&W 36 with Herrett’s Grips. Note that a 36A Speedloader Will Not clear the rest ridge on these. From its letter G serial number prefix, this 351 was manufactured in 2012 or 2013, perhaps a special run, since the 3 inch variant is not even in Braztech’s Archive. This revolver is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or showgirl from Firearms Industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show held in Las Vegas. It is in its original overlabeled factory box with instruction manual and two keys for its hammer lock. Note that the box top is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means that if this Rossi develops mechanical problems, Braztech will repair it at no charge, but they will not give a freebie refinish. It does not need any refinish anyway. Surface detractions are negligible, only faint occasional edge whitening and cylinder rotation marking. Grip frame exposure past the grip panels’ edges is minimal, as the photos show. We rate this 351 as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. The only comparable Blue Steel 3 inch 5 shot revolver on the market is the occasionally produced 36-10 Classic in 3 inch; if a person can even find one of those, it will severely damage $1,000.00.We’re offering the Rossi 351 Blue 3 inch in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates for only $ 299.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

Rossi .44 Magnum model R441 Blue 2 inch Snub .44 Special 720 descendant Excellent in Box with Service Warranty 44 Spl Mag 5 Shot R44102 Taurus 44C Tracker Frame One of Interarms’s best loved guns was the Rossi model 720 Stainless, chambered in .44 Special Caliber. The 720 enjoyed only a brief run from 1992 until 1998, and they are top quality, eminently collectable, premium pieces. Here is a specimen of the 720’s successor, the Rossi 441 or R441, produced, we are told, in 2012 only. Photos are representative, one revolver from a small lot we were fortunate enough to get. Dealers, collectors, and agencies may take any number of additional, virtually identical 441s we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. We can provide photos of the exact revolver upon buyers’ request Manufacturer was Amadeo Rossi S.A. of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; Importer and service warrantor is Braztech of Miami, a Taurus affiliate. Frame is marked, Made in Brazil by Taurus; even more striking, the frame is stamped 44C, so this is a Rossi built on a Taurus Tracker frame. Type is traditional double and single action revolver with floating firing pin and transfer bar safety mechanism. Construction is entirely steel with a bright blue finish, matte blue atop the frame and barrel. Barrel is full lug, possibly two piece, blue steel with steel encased red fiber optic front sight that dovetails into the solid barrel rib. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Finish is entirely bright blue steel, with the exception of the case colored .400 smooth faced combat trigger and matching shortened spur hammer that holds Taurus’s patented security system hammer lock. Grips are absorbent Taurus Ribber type pliable black rubber combat type with 3/8 inch thickness at the backstrap, and Pachmayr ROS/C Compacs are readily available. Weight empty is 31 1/2 ounces, with center of gravity under the rear cylinder face. That is only 20 percent heavier than a Smith & Wesson 329, and 10 percent heavier than a Taurus Tracker Ultra Light. Capacity is 5 rounds of .44 Smith & Wesson Special or .44 Remington Magnum ammunition, interchangeably. We always practice with .44 Special ammunition, and then possibly load with Magnums, just like we do with .38 Special capable .357 small revolvers. Photo specimen comes in its original factory box with two keys to its lock, an instruction manual and factory registration card. This is what we call a demo, most likely a sales rep’s sample that served as a showgirl at Firearms Industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show. Surface detractions are negligible, all we detect is a few white spots on the cylinder face, and faint rotation marking. It comes with Taurus’s famous mechanical warranty and its box lid is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. Lettering is sharp throughout, only with the letter X suffixed onto its serial number. We rate it as Near Mint in box, and photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Replacement pricing on the nearest competitor, Taurus’s Tracker series, is over $600 per unit. We’re offering the Rossi / Taurus R441/44C in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates for only $339.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts.

It has a 2"" barrel and larger ergonomic grip. While it is larger than NAA's standard mini revolvers, it is still very concealable and MUCH easier to shoot. If you aren't familiar with NAA revolvers, they are single action, and have a safety notch in between each round on the cylinder so the hammer can safely rest without having to leave one less round in the cylinder in fear of hammer striking a live round.

This is the model with the conversion cylinder so you can shoot .22 Magnum AND .22 LR. Each cylinder holds 5 shots. This is the version with the adjustable sights. I bought it brand new about a month ago. I have fired 50 rounds of .22 lr, and have not yet fired any .22 WMR through it yet. Needless to say the gun is in excellent, like new condition.

Includes the gun w/ both cylinders, factory hard case, PLUS:
100 rounds of CCI Mini-Mag
50 rounds of CCI .22 WMR
50 rounds of Winchester PDX Defender .22 WMR.
Good luck finding either of those in stores, let alone both.

Why so cheap? Whats Wrong?
it has a few cycling issues, IT DOES FIRE but it will fire a couple of times and then not cycle the round correctly. It is has been kept in a climate controlled safe for 35 years and is in ""fair"" condition for an old rifle. 

Why this price
Gunbroker.com is my scale to evaluate the worth of firearms. the lowest price on there was for a in good condition shotgun $350-$500 (buy-it-now not bidding, don't send me a link to someone selling it for $1)..

It is a good shotgun for any collection, If you are interested please contact me. be sure this is what you want, I ask for people to sign a receipt (private party) that I keep in my records. one last thing, I dont know the history of this shotgun or anything regarding information around it. so if you send me a question, it would probably be best to look it up first.

It's a Winchester model 74 which I believe was made sometime in the 1950s this rifle feeds through a tube in the butt stock and holds 15 rounds. The unique feature with this rifle is it features a removable bolts with the push of a button for easy cleaning.

The stainless steel barrel is just 3.5"" long. The grip frame is roughly half an inch shorter than the standard frames. The shorter barrel and shorter grip frame result in a 32 ounce pistol that is an excellent choice for carry.

This model has a stainless steel slide and frame, with the flat surfaces polished and the rounded surfaces left matte, giving it an attractive, almost two-tone look. The red Cocobolo grips stand out against the stainless, and feature the Springfield Armory logo.

The low profile combat sights also make this a good carry pistol. The rear sight has smooth corners. The sights have three tritium dots embedded in them for low light shooting.

This pistol is fitted with a match trigger, with a pull of five to six pounds, just right for a combat pistol. The ambidextrous safety is a plus for competition shooters doing weak hand drills, not to mention southpaw shooters.

If you're looking for a dependable, light weight, attractive pistol for carry or competition, this one deserves your serious attention.

Every Springfield Armory 1911 pistol is equipped with a trigger locking device. A key inserted into a hole in the rear grip strap positively locks the trigger, making it impossible for a child to accidentally discharge the gun. This system gives you a choice as to whether or not you need to lock your gun. Unlike trigger locks on other brands of guns, the keyhole is small, so that it doesn't ruin the looks of the gun.
I'm the original owner less then 500 rounds fired through pistol. Only has 2 small scratches by take down pin. This is a very nice handgun price is firm I paid way more then I'm asking for it but I don't have to sell it. Pistol is basically a safe princess hasn't been fired in over 2 years.

Having previously owned a SCAR and ACR, which I tend to put in the same category as the XCR, the XCR is actually my personal favorite.  Recoil is minimal, maintenance is extremely easy, while the XCR's piston system makes it as reliable as an AK-47, but with the accuracy and appeal that far exceed any AK.  If I wasn't selling my collection, this is one I would certainly keep and despite selling it now, I do plan to again own an XCR at some point in the future.
Included is a hard case, manual, 30-round mag, tactical sling, competition muzzle brake, competition 2-stage match trigger, and optics (fixed 4x prismatic scope and your choice of a 3x, 5x, or  7x Sightmark magnifier, and a holographic reflex sight).  Most of these items are shown in the pictures below but I'm happy to provide additional pics or respond to any questions.  

Additional info on the rifle is below:
Designed specifically for the most demanding military, law enforcement, and recreational users, the XCR-L offers a level of reliability offered by few other rifles.
XCR-L incorporates heavy duty components such as a sturdy oprod, a beefy three-lug bolt, a locking extractor, and a fixed ejector.  These elements and others ensure reliable performance with minimal maintenance.
The XCR-L is the most ergonomic rifle available anywhere.  Professoinal users report that the XCR has the fastest magazine change and clearing times of any rifle.  
Whether the rifle is supported by the right or left hand, the operator can manipulate all the controls while keeping his eyes on target and index finger near the trigger.
Our new Fully Adjustable Stock not only folds but is adjustable for length and height ensuring unparalleled shooting comfort.
Many rifles claim to be modular weapon systems just because they have a 1913 standard rail system used to attach accessories.  The XCR-L is truly modular.
With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light weight carbine, or a longer marksman's rifle.
The XCR-L's quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability.  Barrel and caliber changes can be made in less than 5 minutes.
Armorers who are familiar with the XCR-L find it the easiest rifle to inspect, maintain, and service resulting in lower overall maintenance costs
The true beauty of the XCR-L is the simplicity of design and durability of its parts."

From STI- 
Integrating patented 2011 technology with classic 1911 design, the STI International Edge is a high capacity pistol that carries John Browning’s design into the 21st Century.
Since its introduction in late 1997, the STI Edge has become the undisputed standard for USPSA/IPSC Limited Division competition shooting as demonstrated by Michael Voigt and Frank Garcia finishing one/two as they led the US IPSC Limited Team to victory at World Shoot XII. It has been adopted by SWAT teams, HRT teams, street cops, and law enforcement training sites. It has been embraced by almost all other shooting disciplines.

Built on the STI Modular Steel 2011® frame with polymer grip, the Edge delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

True to 1911 tradition, the Edge has a unique full length slide with front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight and STI adjustable rear sight. The Edge comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI knuckle relief hi-ride grip safety and stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safeties. It comes with an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel. Not only is it the most accurate and reliable handgun on the market, it is also one of the most beautiful.


Sti is often compared to SVI, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Nighthawk, Wilson Combat, Colt etc."

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight."

Bought this at Turners to kill rattle snakes that get in my yard.  Used it once and it was way too loud for my neighborhood.  I live in a valley with high mountains near my property and it's too loud, compared to shooting on flat land.  I'm going to buy a pellet gun instead, they are not as loud.  See description below. It literally only had 10 bullets shot out of it.

I'll throw in a box of bullets with it.

The 1911 has upgraded trigger, hammer, safety, and slide release and enlarged mag well all Wilson Combatas well as new Pachmeyer grips, and comes with three mags. Two of which are Wilsons.

This is a VERY nice gun, kept in very GOOD condition. You can tell it has ridden in a holster before, but there are no serious marks on it. No dummy mark, and no dings. 

Shoots and cycles butter smooth, loves ball ammo, and still eats hollow points with no issues (Hydra Shok, and a HST tested)!

The holster is a classic Galco Super Tuck, this allows you to conceal, and still tuck a golf shirt into your waist. This holster is extremely comfortable, and really spreads the weight of the firearm across your belt, so you literally will forget the gun is there!

Please, don’t be afraid to offer trades, but I only am interested in handguns, and only in the .45 flavor. No 9mm’s, no .380’s. Unless the trade is heavily in my favor.

When the Bushmaster Carbon 15 made its debut in 2006, many of us were highly skeptical as to whether a polymer AR15 lower receiver would hold up. After 7 years, we are fully convinced. Out of three hundred some odd Carbon 15s we’ve sold from our little store, we have only returned one, and its receiver was just fine. Here is American Tactical’s polymer lower receiver for AR-15. Manufacturer is American Tactical Imports of Rochester, New York, and this lower is made in the U.S. Model is Omni, multi caliber and advertised as such. Construction is weapons grade fiber filled black polymer. It is fully threaded and inletted to military specifications. Factory product flyer warns against non-mil-spec parts, and recommends chambering in .22 LR or .223 Remington calibers only. Parts fitting with this lower will be substantially easier than it will with an alloy receiver. Factory product flyer warns against non-mil-spec parts. We’re offering this brand new lower, new in factory box, the one in the photos or one of its identical mates, for only $ 49.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Aurora IL, Cook County IL, California, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where AR15 rifles are restricted to Law Enforcement Only.

If you're reading this, you're probably familiar with the history of the Jungle Carbine. If not-it was designed, not specifically for jungle warfare(the name is actually an unofficial nickname), but with the British Airborne in mind. WWII ended before the rifle was put into widespread use. It was criticized by the war department as having a ""wandering zero""(accuracy issues), but historians believe that this was over politics and not the actual quality of the rifle. Ironically, it's most noteworthy service came the year after the end of it's production. In 1948, British and Commonwealth troops were armed with No5 rifles fighting the communists in the jungles of Malaysia.

This particular weapon was made in October 1945 at the Royal Ordnance Factory in Fazakerley outside of Liverpool. It's exceptional in that all of the serial numbers are legible and matching. This includes the bolt, receiver, butt socket, stock and even the magazine. This rifle also features the less-common metal-cap on the end of the handguard.

The bolt is smooth and functions properly, the magazine feeds correctly, and the bore is excellent-shiny with good rifling, no rust, pitting or frost. Additionally, the stock has a pleasant tiger-stripe pattern to the wood, which is dark in places, but still retains it's original finish and looks striking. The rubber butt plate is in good shape and, while not soft and pliable, has not turned rock-hard as usually encountered on No5s. The rifle does exhibit handling marks, old dings in the wood consistent with military service, and some loss of paint(these were painted as opposed to blued), but rates at an NRA Very Good condition. I've tried to give a good representation of this in the photographs, but I'm happy to take a picture of anything specific upon request
