4,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7779004,For Sale/Trade:  2006 Honda Ruckus and all accessories,"Harris, MN, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 3, 2018",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"First- before I give you the details, let me address all the Icebear Ruckus clones out there. There is a reason the Ruckus has been copied by several Chinese companies. Its an awesome scooter. The engine in the clones is a copy of an OLD Honda design. But the quality is where they are lacking. Yes, you can buy a clone NEW for half the price of a Ruckus. Or you can buy one USED for next to nothing. Because they don't hold up. There is a subforum on TotalRuckus.com discussing the clones- and they are not even good for parts swaps onto the Ruckus, because even the parts are poor quality. There is no TotalIceBear.com or TotalTaoTao.com. Look at the mileage on my scooter. Over 13k, and that was all put on in less than three years. I trusted my Ruckus to take me to work and back EVERY DAY in rain (and snow, as rare as that was in Seattle) 16 miles EACH WAY. If the weather was nice or traffic was bad, I took a longer route home. I rode from Seattle to Portland and back, a two- day ride with friends- over 10 hours each day of continuous riding. A guy from Korea rode his Ruckus around the US in 2007, 17k miles in a year. You can read his blog on TotalRuckus.com. They hold up- the clone will not.So- I bought my Ruckus in 2007 with 1200 miles on it. It has 13k on it, but I rebuilt the engine at about 10k, with a new crank/bearing assembly. Not because of poor quality, but because of my parade riding habits of doing burnouts on the crosswalks. So you have a fresh engine that hasn't been abused. Has a chin bone made by Pomeruck. This is one of only SEVEN that Pome made, it is a solid mount at both ends, no pivots. So it actually does the job of triangulating the frame, it is NOT just for looks. Has a windscreen made by Chanito-san. At the time I installed it, I noted a 2mph increase in my top speed, more if I really tuck behind it. Frame extension to move the motor back 6 inches made by All ThatRuckus (now mostly known as ATR) Combined with the beefier rear shock, and added springs to beef up the front fork, this mod did WONDERS to smooth out the bumps. Has a CDI box to allow higher rpms, with a soft rev limiter at 10,500 (above which the valves can float and make contact).KN variator, with DR Pulley slider weights. Have a few different weights so you can tune it to your body weight and riding conditions for optimal speed and acceleration. Normal sizes are 5.5 and 6 grams, I accidentally was sent some 16 gram weights, which I have never used, I was thinking of using them if I ever bombed downhill from Paradise at Mt Rainier but that trip never materialized. Maybe you can use them. I also have a chrome-plated variator wrench so you don't strip or break anything when changing out your weights or changing belts.I also have a flywheel puller if you ever need to rebuild the engine, or plan to send your flywheel off to be lightened.Has a Gates Kevlar belt on it, pretty new but I'm throwing in two spare belts as well.Extra spark plugs and air filters. Extra airboxes, I swapped them out due to a defect in the sealing on my original. Still like running with the protection of a stock airbox. Lots of other extras- spare carb jets in various sizes, a whole set of Honda shims for your valves (if you have friends with ANY HONDA they can use these) Helmet with clear and tinted shields, winter and summer gloves, clear riding glasses, extra antifreeze, full shop manual, it all goes. There's probably stuff I forgot. We can talk if you're interested. This Ruck has a ton of history and I'll be sad to see it go. I was the organizer for Ruckus CON 2009 in Seattle, riders from Canada, Colorado, and the Rucksters crew from California all attended.Due to spammers and scammers, initial contact is by email only.

THIS IS NOT A MAGNUM CHAMBERED SHOTGUN. I just dont have a need for the magnum ammo so I thought I'd throw it in. Ive shot this shotgun a little bit (Maybe a 100 rounds) with no problems, it is a Mossberg after all. Gun is in fairly decent shape although there was some surface rust on the Bolt and along the vent rib. The well worn spots are included in the pictures. This shotgun would make a good project gun to customize or an inexpensive beginner trap/skeet shooter. These guns can do anything and keep on running.I'm not looking to trade.

Nothing wrong with it just have a few in this category and want other things.not in quick need of cash. There is probably 130$+ of ammo here, don’t lowball and expect a response. If add is up, I still have it."

Scarce ambidextrous USP Expert in 40 S&W  - very few made.  Includes with grey zipper HK case, cleaning kit, and four LEM 16 round JET FUNNEL OEM factory magazines. 5.2 inch barrel. Match grade adjustable rear sight.
This gun features a jet funnel, an extended slide release, and an ambidextrous decocker which also act as a safety, allowing its operator to carry ""cocked-n-locked"" aka 1911 style, allowing this top-of-the-line German pistol to function like standard auto pistols and also like a 1911 platform sidearm. This gun is a joy to shoot and extremely accurate.
HK uses an O ring system around the front of the barrel, which basically assists in the gun's accuracy.  Both create slight friction at the front of the slide which helps eliminate barrel play within the slide. This is currently one of a small handful of HK USP Expert pistols for sale and currently one of the very few in .40 S&W available anywhere in the US. Not only an amazing, high performance German-made pistol but also an extremely collectible choice firearm.Includes: four 16 round OEM/factory LEM (law enforcement military use only ban no longer federally prohibited) Original grey zippered HK case Blank warranty card, operator's manual, and test cartridge (signed and dated by HK)

M10 ""open bolt"" 9mm. This gun is in basically unfired factory tested condition. It is clean as possible on the inside with virtually no scrape wear at all and no carbon fouling anywhere. It looks like it did in 1981. 
Comes with original box, original paperwork from 1981 - purchase receipt / County Police gun permit, six 32 round factory steel mags, fake suppressor, both versions of the factory manual, nomex suppressor sock that has never had the springs attached let alone stretched, original cleaning rod, mag loader, Assault Systems carry bag, sling and history book.
These were banned by the ATF in 1982 and can never be made again, but the select few stamped SAP M10 (semi automatic pistol) were grandfathered and considered exempt from this ruling. According to RPB there were fewer than 400 of these produced as most examples of these guns were sold to class 3 dealers and many of the small run marked SAP were actually converted to fully automatic weapons by class III manufactures.  It is possible only a handful are legitimately available today. This could be the only chance to own one of classic weapons in this mint condition.
 RPB manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made, some were stamped ""sM10"" but a very few were made with the model stamped as ""S.A.P. M10"" (an abbreviation for semi auto pistol) This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol.   In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow was able to get the BATF to approve it as a Title 1 firearm, that is, a regular gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of business in 1978.   The period of manufacture was very short lived however as in 1982 - the BATF reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were too easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns)   These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again.   In case you don't believe that there is any way these rare guns can be legal please read the text of the ATF decision ruling 82-8 which banned any more of these from being made but allowed the ones already in existence as of the date of the ruling to be grandfathered in paragraph 6 of this ruling.   This is sold as a unique collectible pistol - you are responsible for complying with all state and federal laws - With that caveat we suggest that you don't do anything illegal with it - don't contemplate anything hypothetical, don't ask any STUPID questions, and don't discuss anything even slightly questionable even as a joke – we will NOT respond to any foolish emails containing illegal subject matter
This gun must be transferred thru an FFL and it is the buyers responsibility to comply with all laws – Cash only sale – no trades"

I have been hitting pop cans at 100 yards easily with this. It is more accurate than my go to AR which will now be getting rebuilt as an AK beat it. Very nice trigger and very smooth action. No rust on rifle.the Bakelite mags alone could sell for 300 bucks. The steel feel lip Izzy is worth at least $120 as it has all inspection stamps still intact as well. Bakelites are not cheap anymore. All of these bakelites have worked fine and are not broken or cracked. One Tula has a Russian name etched into them the other Tula has a number on it etched near feedlips. Doesn’t effect function or durability. 3 of the bakelites are ridgeback 3rd generation mags, one is a 4th generation. Bakelites are not fragile.

Typical surplus yugo m57 chambered for 7.62x25.  Good condition, works just fine.  Barrel is on the darker side like you'd expect with a used surplus firearm but the rifling is good.  I say dark but we're not talkin' dark frosty mosin nagant style dark... i'd give it a 7/10.  Has the importer-added safety and giant laser-etched importer logo.  Comes with 2 9rd magazines, a cleaning rod, a handfull of surplus 7.62x25 ammunition, and of course the surplus leather holster.  I've put a few hundred rounds through it in the time I've had it... it sort of fun to shoot.
I've been thinning out my firearms collection for a while but I still like to keep a nice old .22 around- I would prefer to do some sort of trade or trade/cash deal for a .22 pistol or revolver that's in working condition.
Sale must be face to face in a public place and cash only.  Buyer must be willing to show an Ohio drivers license to varify age and residency.  I'd prefer to meet at a show if possible.

I would have used it more if I’d had it.” He goes on to say, “The bullet shoots farther and flatter than a .50 caliber, weighs less, costs less, and will do just about as much damage. They are awesome weapons.” He was obviously a big fan of the .338 Lapua, and the only drawback he mentioned was “my model’s lack of a suppressor. When you’re shooting inside a building, the concussion is strong enough that it’s a pain – literally. My ears would hurt after a few shots.”  The.338 Lapua was the rifle that he made his longest confirmed kill with, which was a 2,100 yard shot. That is 1.2 milesThe scope (SWFA SS 16x42) is a personal favorite of many seal teams.  The Atlas bipod is a .338 Lapua quality bipod.  There are NO bipods at the box stores (Bass Pro, Cabelas, etc...), that can handle the recoil from a gun of this size.Info on the rifle can be found by searching ""ammoland 2016/12/savage-arms-110-ba-rifle""Info on the scope can at snipercentral by ""searching sniper central accu-shot 66-bt10-v8-atlas bipod swfa-ss-10x42mm-tactical-rifle-scope""Info on the Atlas bipod can be found at accu-shot, search ""accu-shot 66-bt10-v8-atlas bipod"""

This is the 4 3/4 barrel. The gun has the transfer bar safety. The gun shoots and functions fine. It is truly a beautiful piece of machinery. The trigger is nice and crisp with a wider trigger than my Uberti Cattleman which makes it nicer feeling and shooting.If you have questions let me know. I just saw a old stock, new in box one on GunBroker for $735, so considering this is used but still in great shape.  These have been discontinued, so they are getting harder to find as people hold onto them since they were regarded as being a very fine Colt clone and some sites mention possibly the best.I am looking to sell but if a trade comes my way I might be interested. I mainly shoot 9mm and 45ACP. Would be interesed in springfields, glocks, sigs, hk or something else but try and stick to the two calibers.The name is chris and the phone number is 440 seven two five 7913.

Asking $160
6-shot .22lr revolver.  The cylinder is removed by pulling a pin that holds it in the frame- the pin pushes an extracter, then you load the new rounds.
-This firearm has indexing issues and is not working properly.  It should not be fired until the indexing issues are addressed.  It doesn't reliably go to lockup when the mainspring is cocked.  When it does lock up the cylinder is nice and tight.  There is a bit of fore-aft play in the cylinder which leads me to believe the ratchet is worn and the cylinder shoudl be replaced.  It is also possible the hand is at fault- I did replace the hand in the past and it was functioning reliably but lately it seems to have quit.  
On the bright side the nickel finish isn't terrible and the striker on the hammer is in good condition. The troublesome mainspring these sometimes have has been replaced with an all-metal one.
Fix it up and have a fun plinker.  I've had it apart before and it's not too difficult to work on.
I have a few other firearms listed- a yugo m57 and a remington 512 .22 rifle.  I would love to do a combined trade/cash deal if possible.  I'm looking for a working .22 revolver or auto loader.
 
Sale must be face to face and in a public place.  Cash only.  I'd prefer to meet at a show if possible."
