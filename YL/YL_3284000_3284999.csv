It was just built at the end of June, and is in mint condition. Comes with all black furniture and has the LaRue RAT stock factory installed (most PredatAR's that are currently shipping come with the basic Magpul, they only include the RAT on newer orders that are still who-knows-how-long away from from shipping). Includes a SureFire SF-3P flash hider, also factory installed. 

Sights and optic were mounted but the rifle is unfired. Includes everything that comes with the rifle directly from LaRue, as well as the swag pack (owner's edition hat, some dillo dust, dillo, pocket constitutions, and bumper stickers). 

The Aimpoint Micro with TD cover, LaRue mount, MBUS, PMAG, and LaRue rifle bag pictured are regretfully not included in this sale. 

Please send me an email with any questions. Thanks for looking. 

Info from LaRue:

XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy.


Caliber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO
Rifle Weight: 6.25 lb. (based on 16.1” barrel version, unloaded without optics)
Barrel Length: 16.1“
Rifling Twist Rate: 1/8
Muzzle Thread Configuration: ½ x 28 *
Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx)
Gas System: Mid-Length Direct Impingement
Rate of Fire: Semi automatic
Magazine Capacity: 30 rounds 

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are lightweight-profiled with rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies.

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:
LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

I have a New England Firearms Model R22 in 22 WMR Magnum. It has a four inch barrel and a six shot cylinder. I am the original owner of the gun having owned it for just over 20 years. I took it to the range one time prior to moving to FL and fired 30 rounds through it to check for accuracy and function. I cleaned it and returned it to climate controlled storage. It has never been carried on my person, been in a holster, carried in a glove box. I would rate it in 99% condition; if not having been shot I would rate it at 100%. It has no scratches, dings, rust or wear on the grips. The cylinder is bright blue with the frame and barrel being flat blue like a Parkerized finish. The factory box was misplaced in the move to FL.
It comes with a full box of CCI MAXI-MAG+V ammo ($17) and an Allen gun rug ($12).

This is the newest rifle from SIG Sauer, introduced at Shot Show this year and serves as the latest generation of their 556 line of rifles. Completely ambidextrous and capable of converting to 7.62x39 with only a few interchangeable parts. I encourage you to check out the video ad SIG put out of the rifle for a better description if you haven't already seen it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdTuJ27vEeQ

I purchased the rifle new a few months ago and have put about 200 rounds down the barrel. Very accurate, easy to operate, and reliable.

Uses a 16 inch barrel w/ 1/7 twist
Swiss style folding stock w/ removable cheek riser
Folding back up iron sights
Uses standard AR/M16 GI mags
Gas piston operation--feels like a perfect marriage of the best of AR and AK attributes.

The rifle has been meticulously maintained, cleaned immediately after leaving the range and kept in a safe. The deal will include the original box, 1 magazine (negotiable based on the deal), single point sling--everything it originally came with. Let me know if you have any questions!

Price is firm!"

This is an outstanding upper (almost anything by Troy is). I have one for myself and do not need the second one I have. I believe the top three features of this complete upper would include the Integrated Spring-Loaded Front Sight, Alpha Rail Handguard (Squid Grip Compatible) , and Melonite Barrel, which is much better than a chromed barrel. It’s also pretty darn light, too. Here are the specs:

-M4 Forged Upper
-Charging Handle
-16"" Troy Melonite Barrel (5.56)
-Troy Medieval™ Flash Suppressor
-13” Troy Alpha Rail with Integrated Front Sight
-Mil-Spec Parkerized / Chrome Lined Bolt Carrier Assembly

This uppers cost $665.33 + shipping, tax, etc. (direct from Troy) and typically run at least $700.00 + shipping, tax, etc. on vendor sites. I would like $625 cash for this NIB one but am willing to take $600 if you come pick it up. I am NOT interested in trades for this item. 

This upper is brand new and still in the original box. It is in perfect condition and covered under Troy’s warranty.

Serial prefix is UPV, test-fire date of 2/8/13.  This one has the less-matte finish.  

I am not the original owner, but purchased the gun in essentially new condition, aside from the result of someone thinking about smoothing out the bottom of the trigger guard but then giving up rather quickly.  Basically, it's like the bottom of the trigger guard was run over a few times with some sandpaper so that it is relatively smooth.  A significant amount of material was not removed.  Aside from that, the gun is cosmetically in great condition. 

Completely stock except for steel 3-dot sights (not night sights).  The sights have been on multiple guns in the past, so they aren't that great looking.  But, I think they're better than the stock plastic sights.  

The pictured Don Hume holster is included.

I would like $475 for the gun.

I also have the pictured ammunition: 139 rounds FMJ; 206 rounds JHP for $75

AFTERMARKET ADDITION:

Efk fire Dragon dual action frame saver recoil buffer.

The Frame-Saver Dual Action Recoil Springs offer these advantages:

Impact: The elimination of the slide impacting the frame at high speed preserves the structure of the firearm

Muzzle Control: By changing the final backward movement of the slide from a sudden stop to a progressive stop, muzzle jump is greatly decreased by 40% giving you more control.

Function: No interference of ejection port or any feeding problems.

Progressive: This is a system designed to reduced the backward motion of the slide in progressive stages after the gun is shot. The effect of this system is that the recoil is reduced by 40% making your follow up shots much easier to shoot. This is a VERY effective system.

Stability: Better stability for your barrel. Stainless steel guide rod replaces plastic or inferior metal guide rods for superior barrel support and function.

Better Accuracy: Progressively slows down your slide from heavy impact against the frame. Works just like a car shock absorber, reducing the slide impact. Lower impact means less recoil, accurate recovery of the weapon for on-target accuracy is better achieved, shot after shot.

Lower Frame Shock: The slide is one of the heaviest components in a semi-automatic pistol. Upon firing, the slide slams back with great energy against the frame. Frame Saver Dual Actions springs can lower this slide impact dramatically, preventing excessive wear, cracked slides and damaged frames.

My asking price is $565 firm. Thats over 80 dollars under my cost for a package that has only 75ish rounds through it, so I wont take any less. It is a fair price. Thanks for looking! Pickup in north lakeland only"

I got it from Dick's Sporting Goods in Whitehall, PA. in early July to validate being eligible to buy and own a firearm and develop a new hobby, but it turns out I don't have interest. Again, it has not been fired and other than adding the swivel mounts and strap, no modifications have been made. I'm just trying to get as much money back as I can.

I have the receipt for it. I have the factory 10 round magazine (loaded), factory box, plastic bag, manual, scope mounting rail, wire lock, metal ""no-fire"" device, and the clear chamber indicator; which is everything it came with. I did register it with Ruger via their website, but I can let them know about selling it to take care of that.

I also have one Ruger BX-25 detachable magazine (loaded) along with 400 rounds of Winchester, 100 rounds of CCI Mini-Mag, and 65 rounds of CCI Velocitor with the other 35 in the magazines for 600 rounds total. Additionally, I bought a Claw Strap and installed a basic set of quick disconnect swivels into the front and butt stocks. The rear swivel is one inch from the bottom end of the butt stock. The front swivel is one inch from the rear side of the barrel band. I also have two unused pairs of in-ear ear plugs and one pair of basic clear safety glasses that fit over regular glasses that are not used.

You may come by to see it and purchase it in my home if you wish / as I would prefer.
Contact me as needed via this ad to arrange a time to look at it and purchase in cash only.

The price is firm as MSRP is $300. No haggling or low ball offers will be entertained.
Most stores sell it for $249 and ammo is expensive.  I have $355.46 into it with tax.

You will have a brand new rifle with a good strap and swivels installed and 600 rounds of ammo that you don't have to try to find and go get all for just $300 in cash only.

You must live in PA., be at least 21 years old, and have a valid PA driver license.
You must sign a bill of sale with all of the firearm details as well as all basic info about you including but not limited to:
-all of our name's and addresses and phone numbers and Email addresses
-state that you are not prohibited from buying or owning or possessing a firearm, and that once paid for, I am immediately and permanently not responsible for the use of it
-either my wife or a neighbor will sign as a witness with one copy to you and one to me

*** FÉGARMY Arms Factory of Hungary started producing Walther PP/PPK clones in the late 1940s starting with their Model 48 which differed from the Walther PP only in minor details. By the late 1950s FÉG began making broader changes resulting in the PA-63, which uses a 9x18mm Makarov round. It quickly became standard issue to both Hungarian military and police forces. ***"

Several options available, Hartford and Hamden. With original magazines, but the magazines are NOT marked Hi Standard, and the guns were sold originally in Germany (and therefore have German proofmarks)

Steel and aluminum ribs, with and without weights.  ""Close"" offers considered.  Some of the guns without weights require a long spacing for the weight screws (bolts).  These weights are not readily available, but the barrel will accommodate pairs of recut standard weights.

For those considering a Hammerli (Walther) Trailside or Xesses but who want a far more accurate and durable gun, this and the other Hi Standards are a ""must consider"" alternative.  Heavier than a plastic gun, they also are far more durable and more accurate.  Single stage trigger, but adjustable pull weight.

""Original S&W"" M41 also available.  These are not as good a gun as the Hi Standard Victor due to lack of trigger adjustment, but still are preferable to the Trailside.  See my other listings, or ask for the catalog.

Price range is $650 for the Hamden gun with barrel weights, to 950 for the most expensive Hamden gun.

Hand grip size on these guns is slightly larger for slightly longer fingers) than the Hi Standard TX guns.

A catalog of these Hartford and Hamden Victors is available can be had by email.  Send your email address for download.  More detailed images, with 4 views of each gun and specific prices are in the catalog.  Currently, only one relatively low resolution image is possible on Armslist.

The image displayed includes left side views of 3 of the guns available.  The main image, lower part of the picture, is a Hamden gun with steel rib, and long spacing for the weight holds.  Upper left is a solid aluminum rib gun.  No weight, but it accepts standard spacing weights.  On the upper right, is a Hartford gun with weights, and aluminum rib.  An additional Hamden gun with extra-long weight also is available.

Law Firm of Ryan Sweet, PLLC. REDACTED. www.rsweetlaw.com 

Make the smart move and hire a former active duty Army Defense Judge Advocate, former Army Prosecutor, and former Army Magistrate (reviewing evidence, making probable cause search/seizure determinations, judging hearings and determinations on pre-trial confinement, etc.) and Administrative Law Attorney and combat veteran! Litigation is what I do, and negotiations, and interpreting laws are part of that. 

I'm an experienced and aggressive military law and defense attorney, accustomed to intensity and high pressure. I have defended many serious felonies such as allegations of rape, larceny, burglary, sale of stolen property, assault with a weapon, AWOL, drugs, etc. (many of my clients have faced life or well over a hundred years in prison), getting favorable results, including getting charges dismissed, findings of Not Guilty, and partial acquittals. I will provide affordable, exceptional and passionate representation and defense of Service members in all areas of Military Law and Criminal Defense, including General Court Martial, Special Court Martial, Involuntary Separations, Reduction in Rank, Reprimands, Tab Revocations, Relief for Cause, and any other Administrative punishments. 

I can help you with allegations of criminal misconduct involving sex crimes, assaults, robbery, theft, forgery, alcohol and drug related incidents, AWOL and FTR and missing movement, adultery, conduct unbecoming, and other UCMJ violations. 

I offer a FREE no obligation consultation.  If you decide to hire me for my services, I offer a very affordable flat or hourly rate, and I accept payment by cash, check, credit, or barter items at fair market value (property, jewelry, vehicles, guns, ammunition, tools, etc.).
