With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down.  The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset."

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.
Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market."

It's all through the handle (from choil to the area just before the false edge starts.)
The Handle is consisted of a pair of black G-10 scales with curved grooves crossing at right angles which gives it a grenade like design.G.SAKAI made the design with the use of the state-of-the-art 3D CNC machining to create these complicated geometric patterns on the grip. Finger choil & finger grooves are amply supplied on the bottom of handle to secure the safty grip.

G.SAKAI's history of ChallengeG.Sakai was a small knife maker when it was founded under the name ""Sakai Hamono"" in 1958. It has sought a way of its originality while contributing greatly for the progress of the knife industry in Seki City.Having been greatly inspired by Gerber Legendary Blades in USA, G.Sakai has challenged the pinnacle of the world knife industry.In 1977, Sakai Hamono has finally entered into a technical tie-up with GLB after long efforts and hard work. The success on the production of the Silver Knight series, of which sales recorded more than a million pieces for a decade, is thought to be a milestone in the history of world knife industry.
Sakai Hamono changed the name to G.Sakai Co., Ltd. in 1982.Since then, G.Sakai has continued generating quality-products by his own name, while accomplishing many O.E.M. projects offered from various excellent knife-companies like Al Mar, SOG , Spiderco.
Now, G.SAKAI has grown to the top knife-maker in Seki, but is still callenging the pinnacle of the world knife industry.

Information About The maker Ken Brock In His Own Words:I began making knives in November of 2002. Due to my background in law enforcement, I’ve always enjoyed making the smaller concealed carry sized knives. Knives that will actually be used instead of being stuck in a safe. The ones that I make are generally the same ones that I would carry at work, on a SWAT call or working in plain clothes. Since I grew up hunting and fishing, I also make a few that are suited for that role.
Since I generally specialize in making using knives for personal defense, they usually have a swedge on the blade. My knives can be ordered without a swedge or you can have a fully sharpened swedge on some models, it’s all up to the customer.All of my knives are made out of CPM154 steel from Crucible Steel and are heat treated by Peters Heat Treating. Occasionally I may have some Carpenter CTS-XHP or Crucible 3V but I don't keep enough on hand for orders. You won’t find any polished parts on my knives. They have a machine satin finish which is all that’s necessary for a working knife.
Handle material is G-10 or parachute cord. Black G-10 is standard but occasionally I have a few different colors lying around. I don’t use stag or wood. I secure the handles on the blade using hidden bolts and 2 ton epoxy, so they are not removable.Sheaths are made out of kydex. The sheaths have rivets that are spaced to take a TekLok (not supplied) or you can attach an IWB loop or static cord.

It is the original half cock hammer.   I have the original box with it.   I can send mor pic by email.  Will not travel, or hold.Only trade I am interested in at this time is a Winchester 1895 Saddle ring carbine in 30-06, one of the newer prodution ones with ""100years of 30-06"" on the side."

Right barrel has twist rifling whereas the left barrel has straight rifling (no twist). Both barrels measure .565 at the muzzle. Barrels are 27” long and have a flat rib with the name A. Barthelmes in gold. Stockel shows several Barthelmes working in Zella Germany in 1850-1860. This Percussion rifle has a set trigger for the right (twisted rifled) barrel and a hunting trigger for the left (straight rifled) barrel. Bores are very good in both barrels. Barrels have a 2 leaf sight (one folds) and a silver ramp front sight. Length of pull is 13” and in 1850-60 would probably been correct for the average shooter. Locks, tang, hammers, butt plate and trigger plate are engraved. Patch box opens by pressing the center petal in the carving. Gun is fitted for sling swivels. 95% of the Damascus pattern remains on the barrels. Stock is nicely figured and in very good condition. Hammers have blocking safeties. Altogether this is a fine and unusual double barrel slug gun with two purposes considering the difference in rifling.Any questions?
