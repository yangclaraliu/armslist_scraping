Premium components, smart controls, perfect weight and balance...In short, it's everything you've come to expect from H&K®! Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.And durability? During a recent endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. No wonder it's been chosen by numerous European law enforcement and security forces.HK P30S V3 Semi-automatic Pistol special features:    A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet, increasing bullet velocity. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional ""lands-and-grooves"" barrel by thousands of rounds    Internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life    Interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user    High-strength reinforced polyamide polymer frame    P30S variant has the ambidextrous safety lever    Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers    Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient    Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber    Open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points for fast aiming.Specifications:    Caliber: .40 Smith & Wesson®    Action: Semi-automatic (SA / DA)    Capacity: 10+1    Barrel length: 3.86""    Frame: Polyamide polymer    Grips: Polymer with interchangeable backstraps    Sights: Fixed    Overall length: 7.12""    Overall width: 1.37""    Overall height: 5.43""    Overall weight: 26 ozs."

While not as quality as a real carbine, these particular rifles have a much better reputation than some other commercial manufactures. This rifle has a beautiful clean wood stock, metal heat shield, and flip rear battle sight. The metal finish is poor, but there is very little surface rust and no pitting.  The gun functions well, but it was recommended by a gunsmith that a new spring be put in as the bolt has some trouble picking up rounds out of the magazine. These springs are easy to find and affordable. All in all this rifle would be great as a plinker, restoration project, or home defense carbine.  The ONLY trades I will consider is for military surplus rifles or pistols (1946 or earlier)  Plenty of pictures available on request."
