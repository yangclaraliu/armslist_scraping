I purchased this brand new in the middle of March for $415. I've put exactly 350 rounds through it. When I took it out the first two times I experienced a dozen failures to feed. It would eject the spent cartridge fine, but would not fully return to battery when feeding the next round. It was a tight fitting weapon, and was pretty cold out, and the first two times I took it out I did so without field stripping the weapon and cleaning it even though I just bought it. I field stripped it, and gave it a good scrubbing, having found it loaded with oil. A little frog lube on the rails and a couple other lubrication points, some manual cycling of the slide, and I haven't had a problem since. 



My very first time reassembling after having cleaned it, I put a slight ""idiot scratch"" in it while trying to re-insert the slide stop. When I say slight, I mean slight. Not one of those horrid gouges you see. I could probably buff it out in two minutes....but the bluing on the Metro Arms American Classic II isn't exactly known for being top notch as demonstrated by the bluing being worn off underneath the safety and slide stop (visible when the safety is switch to the on position and the slide is locked open). It is in very good condition overall. No other scratches, dings, or other flaws to speak of. It's not at all a bad gun...in fact I really enjoy it. I had plans lined up to send it to a gunsmith for a few customizations that I wanted to get done (trigger, night sights, mainspring housing)...but that idea has been cancelled in favor of knocking out an unplanned bill.

If you know anything about FN barrels (twice as thick chrome lining, same barrel as used in the M-249 machine gun), and heavy barrels in general, you already know that this thing is a tack driver from hell. There's a reason FN won the military contracts away from Colt- their barrels are stiffer, more accurate, last longer, and house more chrome than a Cadillac.

The Colt Official Police is a medium frame, six-shot, double-action revolver with a six-round cylinder, primarily chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, and manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company. The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time, eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry.[1] The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II. In 1933 the Colt sales catalog listed many law enforcement agencies as having adopted the OP as a sidearm, including the New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Kansas City police departments. In addition many state police organizations and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation chose the OP as their issue revolver.[1] The U.S. Army also bought some of the revolvers, issuing them to military police and to federal agencies in need of a revolver for their armed agents, such as the Treasury Department, Coast Guard, and the Postal Inspection Service."

Rifle is a SUB MOA GUN!  I will gladly include a half-dozen targets (can scan/email) and show you beautiful 5 round groups from 250 that are WELL under 3/4 inch - the straight jacket system WORKS, and you can see the prints for yourself.  Shame they never got their marketing/business right - the product is SUPERB.  RARE to see a rifle like this.  The gun isn't too finicky with ammo, however it definitely has it's perferences for different ranges.  I'll be happy to include my own cookbook recipes with the rifle - If you are not a hand-loader, this rifle is probably not for you.

Will Include:

Richards Tactical Sniper style Laminate Classic stock (fully fitted/inletted) UN-finished (ready for finishing/bedding)

20 rounds Hornady ""Custom SST"" (new box, they are 45-50 a box)

The rifle prefers 150 gr for shorter range, however you'll see those boat-tails and heavier grains make a huge difference when you start to get out 400, 600, 800+ yards.  

There is easily over 5 grand here - I am asking a modest 3850 or best offer, for ALL.

Obviously I will include BOTH the threaded Teludyne Muzzle Brake and a matching ""Cap"" (for competition, where no brake is allowed).

I put one 100-round box of ammo down the pipe of this fine firearm, to confirm function.  As I understand it, Sig Sauer has amazing guns but terrible customer service, which is why their used guns are so popular and high in value... If you get a perfect gun from the factory (as I did) it's worth it's weight in ammo because you don't have to deal with Sig's horrible service, and they've been known to let guns leave the factory with all sorts of problems and then fight tooth and nail to have them corrected (it took a major lawsuit by the California firearms community getting together to get them to understand their obligations).


This is brand spanking new.  Ionbond-produced NITRON finish on the slide, hard anodized black frame, SIGLITE tritium night sights ... 3 15-round magazines with special MK25 phosphate anti-corrosion coating, as well as the phosphate anti-corrosion coating on all internal components (Only anti-corrosion process that stood up to the NSWC saltwater test) ... amazingly accurate gun, shoots like a competition pistol, handles like a target gun, works and stands up like a pure combat pistol.



OK if you are interested let me know... this MK25 is absolutely amazing, has the SIGLITE night sights, phosphate-coated internal components and Physical-Vapor-Deposited coating on the special MK25 Magazines which compliment the hard-anodized frame and Nitron (Actually IONBOND) slide... this makes the gun absolutely the best salt-water resistant gun there is... plus it has  FULL MIL SPEC picatinny rail, DA/SA trigger w/ a $50 Short-Reset-Trigger kit available.. its amazing.


$--900 CASH --  -- I am going to be honest here , I hate to sell this and I actually didn't respond to a bunch of people around Thanksgiving that made full-price offers.  I thought I could get away with not selling it but , sadly, the fact is I have a bill I didn't expect to have (something came up that frankly happened , as life happens, and now needs to be paid and there isn't going to be anything to be done about it) and selling this seems to be the most logical, as it's an ""extra"" gun and also happens to be very nice and about the amount i need.  It sucks, I hate to sell this, it was a dream of a purchase and I would love to keep it but I can't.


REDUCED TO $850 CASH, WOULD LIKE TO GET A DEAL DONE ASAP- tHank you.

If you want it and want to get this done quickly, hit me up, and it's yours (as long as you can come get it, I am sorry but I am not interested in driving to South Florida or 4 1/2 hours as some people have suggested I do.)  Thanks again and God Bless."

Its a single shot/break action pistol.

Comes with the soft carrying case, scope/mount combo.

This setup was over $900 new. Its been shot about 150 times. The recoil is not too bad actually, about inline with a 44 mag, maybe a touch more snap. Its really fun to shoot and gets a lot of attention at the range, I just no longer have time to shoot it.

I will not separate the frame or barrel assembly. 

Although in the sub category its listed as a 380, it is not. Armslist does not recognize Encore's entire line of pistols available to the public.

This is a good, all around performance model with the skeletonized trigger and hammer, and extended beaver tail with good trigger and low profile sites. 
These are fairly new to the market. 
My dad got this for me as a birthday gift and its really not what I was looking for. I am more of a WWII collector and was hoping to get a WWII era pistol - he got me this 1911 thinking that the 1911 would be good for a WWII collection (not much of a gun guy).
That being said it is brand new and unfired. Comes with both 8 round mags and factory papers and lock ect, just as received.

PRICE IS FIRM!!! I WILL NOT COME DOWN AT ALL - if it does not sell at my asking price, I will just keep it as a keep sake from my dad. I am only interested in trades for WWII era pistols. No other trades will be considered.

Must have IN DL or CC license and must be 21 years or older to purchase. I am located on the NE side of Indianapolis and not able to travel too far.
