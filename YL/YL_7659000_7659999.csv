the Kit is a 1977 Romanian Guard AK-47 rifle kit with fixed stock. It has a NODAK NDS1 Premium receiver, and romanian SAR furniture.  I also have an AKBUILDER set of rivits, Spring plate replacement, and AkBuilder Side mount Scope mount that is to be rivited on as well when its being built.  The kit has been only partially de-milled as the rivits still need drilled out.  
 
Romanian Guard kits were highly saught after when they hit the US shore years ago, as they had very little if any use as a complete weapon and came with intact NON cut up AK47 Chrome lined barrels.  This one is still pressed into the front trunion.  These kits alone without the receivers are going for 500 -700 on gunbroker from what im seeing, however I'm asking 700 with all pictured. I am slightly negotiable, but please know low balls will be ignored.  Some trades may be accepted depending upon what it is. 
 
As NODAK or Romanian is not listed on the manufacturer list i chose DDI. it is NOT a DDI, but a NODAK Receiver with a Romanian Guard AK Kit.

This thing is a laser. Comes with one green translucent polish mag, the collapsible stock, and latest gen pic rail. Gen 3 model with tri-rivet trunnion and pinned brake on the 18"" barrel. Very low round count and accuracy is unmatched.Only about 700 of these made it into the country before imports dried up. I bought this one to give to my brother for his birthday, but unfortunately a family member is sick and it might be a good idea to have some more funds just in case things take a turn for the worse.Don't miss this chance to buy Poland's cool service rifle! Most AK collectors drool over this thing. Very hard to come by, especially in this configuration. REDACTED"

This new recoil system allows a shooter to go at least 5,000 rounds before a spring change is necessary. Felt recoil and muzzle flip are also dramatically reduced. The proprietary barrel system is unique to any we have ever produced. The groups at 50 yards are beyond the capabilities of the shooter”. This pistol qualifies as an EDC carry piece for those whom demand the superior lethality of the 10mm and or an awesome back country back up for bears, lions, etc. Keep in mind the 10mm is used in Denmark for polar bear protection! If you wish to use for EDC make sure you have appropriate ammunition ie not Buffalo Bore"
