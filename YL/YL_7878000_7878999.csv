Even trades or trades with cash or usable extras (except ammo), normally I don't argue putting out cash I just cant think of any I really want at at higher price point just for the range right now. For the trade I have a SIG P225-A1 9mm (G10 grip model with SIGLITE sights plus the standard SRT they come with) that's still practically new in the original case with the manual, lock, price and warning tags, sticker and 2 8rd mags. Just haven't touched it cause I usually carry a revolver and would rather just keep putting range wear on my other SIGs. Again its still practically new and not cheap so please keep that in mind before making a offer, sorry but get tons of silly ones. I will be using a EFA10 transfer for mine.

It's had only 100 rounds through it (50 when I first bought it, and 25 rounds each year before a yearly cleaning and lube). The firearm is an ""under the end-table"" gun for home security (see picture)...and is in impeccable condition. The only flaw is a slight imperfection under the trigger guard (pictured); and this was present when I purchased it. Maybe a manufacturing problem, but it didn't bother me that much. Other than that, it just as minor scuffs from general handling and cleaning...nothing that won't wipe away. I'm looking to purchase a new firearm and simply need to reduce the quantity of firearms I own. Since this one gets no use, I'm letting it go to a home where it can get used properly.

They both shoot great but I am getting older now and don’t want to leave my children with rifles they no nothing about or even care to. I am selling them together only because I have so much in the way of accessories that I wouldn’t know where to stop with one and start then with the other. So hopefully this add will find a couple people wanting to get into smokeless muzzle loading.
My wife’s rifle hasn’t been shot in 3 or 4 years and mine I shoot a couple times a year.
The makings of them include
Remington 700 ML stainless actions, bolt noses accept the 209 primers and breech plugs with Tungsten bushings.
Both have Ken Farrell 20 MOA steel scope bases and are bedded to receiver.
Pac Nor Stainless match grade barrels 1 in 22 rate of twist.
My rifle has a Remington Factory stock which was pillar and action bedded. It also it has a Boyd’s stock pillar and action bedded, you can change out for your preference and a Rifle Basix trigger set at 1 pound.
My wife’s has a custom bolt handle and the original Remington trigger set at 2 ½ pounds a Boyd’s thumb hole stock pillar and action bedded.
I have numerous pictures of both rifles along with targets with different loads, along with all the extra accessories that I can send to anyone interested. The accessories include a wide array of bullets, Custom made bullet knurler, dies, bullet loading Jags, bushings, three - piece ramrods, and the extra stock.
I have roughly $1,500 in accessories to include. No scopes included...You can email me and I will give better pictures and inclusions."

These carbines (and rifles) were based upon the German Mauser action and were the brainchild of Colonel Nariake Arisaka. The prototypes were submitted in 1896 and full production began ""in the 30th year of ruling Meiji-emperor"", translating to the year 1897 in western calendar terms. Full approval was given to the Japanese military two years later.These weapons saw use in Russo-Japanese war of 1904/1905 and also [reportedly] WWI and WWII. They appear to have been manufactured between 1897 and about 1902. The total production run of Type 30 infantry rifles seems to have been over 500,000 rifles, while the total production of carbines is estimated only around 40,000.Japan sold these rifles and carbines in large numbers to Great Britain and Russia during WWI. ""In Great Britain M/97 rifles were issued [to] training units, Navy and Flying Corps and known as 'Rifle, Magazine, .256 Pattern 1900.' Suffering from even more disastrous shortage of rifles the Russians could not afford to issue these rifles only as training equipment. So they issued Japanese rifles also as part of usual weaponry issued mainly to their non-frontline units, this included their troops stationed in Finland.Finland used about 8,000 infantry rifles and a minuscule amount of carbines M/97 during the Finnish Civil War of 1918. Suojeluskunta (Finnish Civil Guard) used some in 1920's. The most distinct feature is the hook-shaped safety in bolt head (other than that they appear very similar to the Japanese Type 38 series).Based upon the German Mauser action with some Mannlicher influence, bolt-action with hook safety, 19"" barrel, made from 1897 to 1902. Caliber is 6.50mm x 50R Arisaka, five-round fixed magazine with spring-loaded floor-plate.NOTE: Cleaning rod is missing on this example.This rifle was manufactured in 1897. This rifle was not decommisioned, appears to have been brought back by a soldier. Looks to have been used as a service weapon. This rifle is untested. Shows lots of signs of wear. Great patina and character. Please see pictures.Shipping to FFL of your choice is available for $40.00 in the lower 48. Insurance is available at purchasers expense. There is a 4% credit card fee.Please contact me with any other questions. More pictures are available upon request. Larry REDACTED."

It is by most accounts, a stonger built Shotgun. Unlike the 870 which has an aluminum or alloy receiver, the Hawk-982 is made of steel. It is slightly heavier than it's 870 counterpart but of course, that comes from the All-Steel Reciever, I would guess.So who really makes these shotguns?Here is where, 'Who Makes It' gets tricky and kind of funny. Everyone knows the H&R-871 Pardner Pum Protector well, Hawk (speaking of my Hawk-982) confines itself to making shotguns, including a slew of clones like the classic Remington 870, some of which are sold under the H&R name (Hmmm). Oh, and H&R is an affiliate of Remington, which is part of the Freedom Group, (Hmmm) which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Some of these are made by a company that is affiliated with Norinco, (Hmmm) lol. So, tell me again who makes the 870 that Remington sells. (Hmmm) Kind of makes you wonder, does'nt It? Features;* 18.5"" Barrel Chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" Shells /Magnum Rated* Adjustable Ghost Ring Rear Sight / Windage and Elevation Adjustable* Post Front Sight with White Dot* All Steel Receiver* 5 + 1 using 2-3/4"" Shells * Synthetic Stock and Fore-arm* Cross Bolt SafetyIf you like what I have done to it then, you might be interested in owning it. It's no longer an inexpensive shotgun.New Features or Upgrades;* MESA Tactical M4 Stock Adapter with M4 Mil-Spec Buffer Tube* MagPul MOE M4 Adjustable Stock* MagPul MOE-870 Fore-Arm (M-LOK)* Blackhawk Ergonomic Pistol Grip with Bottom Plug* MagPul MOE Angled Fore-Grip (M-LOK)* HERA Side Folding Adapter* Single/Double Point Sling using QD-Sling Swivel Mount(s)* Wilson Combat, +1 Magazine Extention (now holds 6+1)* HFD2 Breacher ""Pumpkin Puncher"" Magazine Attahment* Internals, Bolt, Bolt Carrier, and Action Bar Assembly and are new, Remington 870 Factory Parts. So, internally it is now Remington 870 original and factory new. Yes, this was an inexpensive Shotgun When I purchased it new and, I was skeptical but Man, is it awesome now. Of course I cannot ask $200 for it after all of the Cool Added Features so, I have to ask at least $650 for it as shown. I simply have too many shotguns. Throwing a bunch of cool features at this one was fun but, Someone can really use if for some honest Home Defense I am sure. I added the, Home Made (double kobra knot) sling to it in Army - Yellow & Black."
