Better mousetrap? After many tries by many manufacturers FN finally developed a better Glock than the Glock! In the powerful 45ACP caliber the FNX offers all of the features that dedicated handgunners want. The ergonomic polymer frame has a low bore axis for less felt recoil and improved control. The grip panels are checkered and ribbed for comfortable, no-snag carry. Four interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt the FNX to your hand size. The profiled stainless steel slide has cocking serrations front and rear, and the 4″ hammer-forged stainless steel barrel delivers pinpoint accuracy. Ambidextrous operating controls make the FNX perfect for competition or personal defense. Every FNX is made in the USA."

Everywhere I've taken it (ranges) people would always stare and watch me and my friends shoot it. It has virtually no recoil, is easily accurate to 100 yds with my poor eyesight, and comes with several minor (reversible) upgrades. 

Has a discrete bottom rail for magpul forward assists, lights, or a laser. Has made for-sub2000 removable stock extension. Has the ""Tacticool"" recoil buffer installed, bolt cover, and charging handle cover. Not essential for functioning, but definitely great feeling improvements. Folds flush as intended. 

Also comes with 3 factory Glock mags. 1 15 rd and 2 22 rd high-cap mags. These are hard to find! Chrome-lined barrel, 4 pounds unloaded, .41 Rem Mag power-equivalent from the 16"" barrel, and small enough (16.5""x7"") to fit in a laptop bag or stow in your truck. That's roughly 60 rounds of HOT .40S&W coming out from the end of that barrel! Def. not a toy. Think ""Poor man's"" semi-auto MP5.

Overall, very pleased with the carbine. Wish I could keep it, but need the money for other things right now. You know how it is. Reply for pictures (Stock image included). Serious inquiries please. $650 obo."

In May 1967, production of Redeye systems switched from Block II to Block III, and in March 1968, deliveries of Block III systems to operational Army and Marine Corps units began. In late 1968, the Redeye Block III was finally declared fully operational standard equipment. The Redeye system was therefore re-designated as M41, and the production Redeye missile became the FIM-43C. In September 1969, the production of the Redeye was terminated after about 85,000 rounds had been built. This assembly can be used for training or display purposes but cannot be made to fire; it is inert. This is an authentic 1960’s Redeye and NOT a reproduction or resin copy. The entire piece is in great condition with a small chip missing from the front cover. The launcher’s tube was touched up with OD green for static display purposes a while back. These are incredibly rare with so few being made and the majority of those sent to South America and Afghanistan following Vietnam. This item looks really good!

This revolver has beautiful deep relief cut engraving in a classic floral pattern. The revolver was given a ""French Coin"" finish that accentuates and defines the beautiful engraving even further. Additionally, there was custom action work performed by Paul Sallee. The action was tuned, the barrel ported, hammer skeletonized, and an extra ball detent added to the crane.....all nice touches. This fine gun remains unfired since the engraving was done. Grips are genuine mother-of-pearl. All this work was performed on a Smith & Wesson Model 57, .41 Magnum, 4-inch barrel, pinned and recessed revolver. The gun is accompanied by Ben Shostle's certificate of authenticity.

The pistol have been very well cared for and fired sparingly. Had it a a gun shop recently and the guy said its 90-95%. There is some holster wear on the bottom front of the frame. It has not been carried much. I bought it in Alaska to carry for protection against bear and I haven't carried it since. 

Do not want part with it, but the wife said I have to to get a rifle. Cash price is $900-950 (depending on how far I have to travel to meet). The MSRP for the base model 329PD is $1159 and this is the laser engraved Alaskan Backpacker model. I'm willing to make a trade for a rifle only.

When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5 + 1 Standard: 4 + 1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results."

Strength, Simplicity and Ruggedness. Ruger GP100 double-action revolvers
are among the most comfortable shooting revolvers. Their rugged,
medium-sized frame and cushioned grip system permit repeated firings with
minimal shooter fatigue. Easy on the hand and budget, all GP100 revolvers
boast solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), and frame widths that are
increased with extra steel in critical areas that support the barrel,
making them rugged, reliable, and dependable.

It has  Leoupold 2.5-8 power scope on it with 1 picece base by Leopold.. It is Glass bedded..has the two thrubolts as all magnums did in Safari Grade...It is pre Garcia..made in Belgium and has appropriate ""Browning"" pad on it. For the life of the gun I have used almost exclusively ""Safari nickel dteel shells and 210 nosler partstion bullets...no hand loads..all the very best factory loads...It spite of fact I have used it so long it has been not been fired much as it almost always stayed ""ON"".  I doubt if it has had 300 or400 rounds thru it as It was always on..I don't know specifics as far as LOP and drop etc...I do know that it does not punish you....Great caliber..In Alaska it made a few 1450 pound moose real sick at 300 yards..It is not too big for deer either.it's taken a bunch of 'em and Caribou too...Long extractor for safety with dangerous game...and better lock-up..Great rifle..must sell as I face tragedy with my 13 year old son versus Obamacare...need money but would like a handgun as partial payment for memories sake...The gun shows some wear as it should..has some small air pockets between lacquer and wood...should be oil finished for beautiful look as it is beautiful wood.
Check under Anschutz also as I have one of few in captivity of those....like that I am not sure of values...just don't want a long protracted battle over nickles...I think this one is worth around $975 or cash and interesting handgun.....Mauser action..probably fair or if I am full of it tell me as I will you.. please ...you thieves out there; spare me the $500 offers....If you truly want the gun we will work something out....like 2 handguns and less money and I can peddle pistols as I need money again....LOWERED PRICE...DOES NOT INCLUDE SCOPE.....PRE...1964...not a Saltwood

Unlike conventional fixed-barrel semiautomatic shotguns, this new type of locking system enables the shooter to move from one firing station to another without having to extract the chambered cartridge, simply by levering the barrel downwards*. The single barrel offers the advantage of maintaining the point of impact of the second shot exactly in line with that of the first shot, thus ensuring excellent performance. SHORT BARREL RECOIL The operating principle of the Beretta UGB25 Xcel semiautomatic gun with break-open barrel is based on short recoil, which keeps the internal parts of the gun clean even after prolonged use. The short recoil (and low barrel axis position) almost completely compensates for muzzle jump during firing, with quicker and easier re-alignment of the barrel on the target for the next shot.The low barrel axis position transmits the recoil forces in line with the shooter’s shoulder thus minimizing felt recoil. The perfect adjustment of the rearwards and forwards breech bolt travel allows use of all 12 ga. 2 3/4 ” (70mm) shotshells, from subsonic ones up to 1 1/2 oz (42g) cartridges without any modification."

Grip has been stippled for better traction so if you like your carry guns to be more usable and controllable, keep reading. If you want a show-off piece, go buy a 1911.  That being said, there's not a scratch on it unless you consider the stippling a ""scratch"" and it does definitely improve your ability to control the firearm.
