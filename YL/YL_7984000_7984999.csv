Up for grabs is my model 1909 Argentine Mauser dated 1912. Made in Berlin. Has original finish on barrel and no finish on receiver, that's just how they did em back then. Colbalt blue bolt release and mag release. Original 7.65 chamber. Barrel has been cut down to 22in, recrowned and bedded in a Fajen walnut stock with ebony end cap. Turned down bolt handle and Timney trigger with flippable thumb safety. Mounted is a older El Paso marked Weaver K6.Included with the rifle:184ct of Norma brass, cleaned & sized, primed with CCI No200.200ct of Speer 150gr sp.100ct of Speer 125gr sp.80rds of Priv 180gr sp.47rds of Norma 150gr sp.40rds of reloaded 150gr sp with CCI No200.08rds of 180gr mil surp.RCBS carbide dies.Gun has some marks, scuffs and small spots of surface rust here and there. But let's be real, it's 106yrds old. What doesn't show some mileage at that age. Its an honest and accurate rifle for it's age but does show signs of use. Doesn't impact how smooth it is though. This is one of those rifles that will serve someone who either appreciates Mausers, or the 7.65 cartridge. This is my deer rifle. My ONLY motivation is I want a semi auto more. Will trade but mainly looking for cash to put torwards a new toy. I do have more pictures of the rifle. If serously interested, send me your cell or email and I can send more."

27,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7984027,For Sale:  MDT LSS-XL Chassis,"Hertford, Outer Banks, North Carolina",$ 490,"Listed On: Friday, February 16, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Increase accuracy and ergonomics of your rifle with the LSS-XL Gen2 chassis system. The LSS-XL Gen2 is a longer and more feature-rich version of the LSS chassis system. The LSS-XL Gen2 has been updated with a bold, modern new look inspired by the popularity of the ESS chassis line, while maintaining and improving upon the overall aesthetic of an MDT chassis.The LSS-XL Gen2 allows you to convert your bolt action rifle to a highly versatile rifle allowing you to adjust the ergonomics with the use of AR-15 buttstocks and grips and, at the same time, converting it to an external box magazine fed rifle.DETAILSThe original LSS-XL chassis system was designed as a variant of the highly popular LSS Chassis system. The LSS chassis was designed for use with compact, short barreled rifles. Many customers liked the LSS chassis, but wanted to use a fixed buttstock and get their bipod out further forward.This prompted MDT to design the first-generation LSS-XL chassis system, which has a forend extended by 3"" and was designed to accept fixed rifle stocks without the need of using any adapters.After the successful launch of the ESS chassis system, requests started pouring in for the new features that had been introduced on the ESS chassis to be rolled out on the other chassis systems. In response, MDT upgraded the LSS-XL chassis line with a Gen2 lineup that incorporates the following new features:Bold, modern new lookAmbidextrous magazine releaseThumbrest above trigger guardLarger barrel channel to accommodate barrels up to the diameter of the actionM-Lok pattern attachment slots on all five sides of the forendBarricade-stop grooves ahead of mag-wellSide-relieved mag well to accommodate bulging magazinesCollapsible and fixed buttstock interface optionsThe chassis is designed with V-shaped bedding surfaces, allowing you to drop your rifle right in without the need for additional bedding. The bottom profile of the V-block cutout has been kept round and close to the action without making contact, maintaining maximum strength. The LSS-XL Gen2 chassis will free float barrels up to 1.350” diameter.MOUNTING AND COMPATIBLE ACCESSORIESThe LSS-XL Gen2 chassis are designed to accept any AR-15 buttstock and pistol grip (purchased separately), offering the option to customize from the wide variety of accessories available on the market.The LSS-XL Gen2 chassis accepts AICS-pattern external box magazines and supports the installation of M-Lok patterned accessories along the forend.Note: Long action magazines come in 4 different lengths: 3.560”, 3.715"", 3.775"", and 3.850"". Unless otherwise specified, MDT long action chassis use the 3.715"" length magazines.The chassis will accept recoil lugs up to .350"" (8.9mm) thick.SPECIFICATIONSIncreases accuracy by up to 21%CNC Machined from 6061 Aluminum.Cerakote finish in Black or Flat Dark Earth.M-Lok pattern attachment system on all five faces of the forend.Collapsible buttstock interface option designed for collapsible AR-15 buttstocks, including the MDT Skeleton Carbine Stock.Fixed buttstock interface option designed for fixed AR-15 buttstocks, optimally the MDT Skeleton Rifle Stock V5.Accepts most AR-15 pistol grips.Lightweight, free-floating modular forend.Will accommodate barrels up to 1.350"" diameter.Compatible with AICS style magazines.Weight: 1.6lb - 2.0lb, depending on the rifle model.WHAT YOU GET AND WHAT YOU NEEDThe LSS-XL Gen2 chassis system comes as a 1-piece chassis, with all required mounting hardware included. This includes new action screws and a screw for the pistol grip.To complete this chassis on your rifle, the additional items you need to purchase are:Any AR-15 buttstock.A buffer tube for your buttstock. (Both mil-spec and commercial work on our chassis)An AR-15 pistol grip. For fixed interface chassis, a grip without a beavertail or with a soft (bendable) beavertail must be used.At least one magazine.IMPORTANT NOTESHowa 1500 / Weatherby Vanguard actionsOnly the MDT polymer magazines will work in the short action rifles due to the flat bottom. The long action rifles will work with the metal 3.715"" magazines without fitting.For .223 models, the bolt stop prevents the bolt from moving back far enough to pick up the rounds. This can easily be modified by removing the bolt stop and trimming the contact face.Savage models 10/110, 11/111, 12/112, 16/116For rifles with the bolt release at the bottom, the bolt release can be engaged through the side of the chassis using a pin or tool (not included).Savage Long Action in 338 Lapua MagnumSavage Long Action chassis systems all use 3.715"" AICS magazine wells. The BA in 338 Lapua Magnum uses 3.850"" magazines and have recently switched to a thicker recoil lug, which will not fit MDT chassis. The ESS has been specifically designed around the current BA 110 in 338 Lapua Magnum.Tikka T3 - Long CalibersOnly the MDT Metal 3.560"" magazine will fit with the chassis for this action and needs to be purchased separately.Ruger AmericanThe action screw is located directly above the magazine lever. This means that the magazine lever needs to be installed AFTER installing the action into the chassis.Ruger American in 223/5.56mm requires the use of a magazine with extended feed lips, such as this one: http://shopruger.com/556-NATO-10-Round-Magazine/productinfo/90458/. This is to prevent the round from being released before entering the chamber. Does not work with 300 BlackoutThis chassis will also accept the Predator and Ranch versions. Please read the notes above regarding magazines for 223/5.56 rifles.DIMENSIONSDimensions shown are based on Remington 700 Short Action.*Skeleton Carbine Stock shown below is the 9.75"" Version"

This is a locked breech compact .380, a rarity in this caliber that combined with the relativerly low recoil of the .380 makes for extremely managable recoil. The locked breech allows the slide spring weight to be lower making it easy to operate, and makes the percieved recoil much less ""snappy"" than blowback designs in the same caliber. It's small enough to easily conceal, but not so small that operation or shooting comfort are compromised like the single stack subcompact .380's out there. The low recoil and easy operation make the gun ideal for ladies, novices, or anyone who is recoil shy or with not-so-strong hands. Has single/double action striker system with second strike capability in the event a hard primer doesnt ignite on the first strike. Feed ramp and extractor have been polished and the pistol feeds JHP and FMJ alike with zero issues. Includes Taurus safety system and a locking key to easily disable the gun to prevent unauthorized use.If the ad is active the pistol is available. Additional pictures available on request.

Only 36 rounds have been fired though the pipe. It was an anniversary gift from my wife but it's a bit too much for a man my age. Included with the revolver are 400+ rounds of American Eagle and Winchester .44 magnum ammunition. You also get a beautiful set of tigerwood grips along with the original Hogue rubber grips. The ammunition alone is almost $200, the grips another 75. We paid $1400 for the firearm alone. MSRP on this firearm is $1619. So you're basically getting a brand new firearm at an incredible price. The price is firm and we can complete the transaction at a local FFL dealer at my expense. This is one very serious firearm. When I picked it up I asked the dealer to recommend some defense rounds. His reply was anything you can put into it."

Any questions, please feel free to contact me.Via website......The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting."
