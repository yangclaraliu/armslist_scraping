This is No. 59 of only 300 made. Cal is .44 mag. From the America Remembers webpage: ""For over 135 years, The National Rifle Association has served as America’s first line of defense in preserving the heritage our Founding Fathers left us. America Remembers is proud to honor the NRA’s tireless and patriotic commitment as 'Defenders of Freedom' with the National Rifle Association Second Amendment Tribute Revolver. For this Tribute, we selected a Smith & Wesson stainless steel Model 629 revolver in caliber .44 magnum, a very popular short-barrel revolver. For this Tribute craftsmen commissioned specifically for this project by America Remembers have created a museum-quality masterpiece certain to be a treasured family possession for generations. The revolver is decorated in lustrous 24-karat gold and nickel with artwork highlighted in a rich, blackened patina for maximum detail and contrast. The Tribute’s decorations handsomely and elegantly capture and honor the legacy and mission of the NRA.""  Left side features the instantly recognizable seal of the NRA. The seal depicts the majestic bald eagle with its wings and talons extended atop a pair of crossed rifles and a shield adorned with the Stars and Stripes. Right side features the striking image of the American bald eagle in front of Old Glory. This iconic pairing is encircled by a frame that reads, “Defenders of Freedom.” Skilled artisans have added nickel highlights, making the bold white feathers of the eagle’s head stand out from the lustrous 24-karat gold. Both sides of the barrel feature a portrait of the iconic militia member standing at the ready with his musket. Also featured on both sides of the revolver—between the barrel and the cylinder—is the NRA “Armed With Pride” logo. The backstrap features the stirring final phrase of the Second Amendment, “…the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” There is slight speckled wear on the bottom of the backstrap and the cylinder has been turned, but that is the only wear. Also, it doesn't appear to have been fired. Wood display case has slight storage wear on the top, but nothing major. Key is not included. SN: DCW33xx."

This hybrid design provides quick target acquisition and enhanced shooter comfort. Striving for perfection in order to support the shooters desire for the perfect shot is the very reason for our latest addition to the F3 shotgun family. The new F3 Vantage not only scores with the mechanical perfection found in all Blaser shotgun receivers, it also delivers ideal target awareness due to the hybrid nature of the raised rib. Available in 12, 20, 28 and 410 this 32” (81cm) adjustment free barrel offers the perfect blend of elevation for comfort and unsurpassed peripheral vision. This unique rib design insures your sight picture will be consistent when shooting aggressively or relaxed depending upon target presentation. The rib’s forward rake makes shooting with a mounted gun effortless and the responsiveness when shooting from a low gun will leave the most challenging FITASC targets a cloud of dust. To fully appreciate the new rib design the engineers turned to the next critical element, stock design. Available in several variants from Sporting to Trap you are assured your shoulders and neck will be relaxed allowing better movement from any shooting position. Recoil management is also addressed by using the original KICK-EEZ recoil pad made with Sorbothane the softest and most durable pad on the market. All Blaser firearms are covered by a 10 year manufacturer’s warranty. Whether in the field or on the competition course you’ll gain the ad-VANTAGE with Blaser."
