For those who aren’t familiar with this pistol they were popular with law enforcement before the M&P’s came out and in my opinion were a better quality gun before they went to the polymer frames. It is the compact version of the model 5906. Has a 3.5” barrel and is all metal (steel slide and alloy frame). Comes with 4 magazines (12+1 round each). And also has a nice DeSantis leather holster that I will be including.Right now I’m not sure if I want to sell or trade. I like this gun but am curious to try something else out there. I mostly shoot revolvers in 38/357/22 and 9mm pistols. Just let me know what you got. Must have a CCP and/or valid SC driver license.

Includes handgun and one magazine, 15 round capacity. Built like a brick. If you’re a fan of the Star pistols -like me- it is a neat addition to your Star collection. Did I mention that it’s heavy?  (39 ounces, unloaded)  See photos.Buyer must have Georgia Weapons Carry License (see below).I've sold a few guns through ArmsList, so here are answers to some of the most Frequently Asked Questions:-  I'm in the south Georgia area, and it's a 3 hour drive from Atlanta (over 6 hours round trip)- I'm only selling; I'm not looking to trade.- I am NOT desperate to sell, and the asking price is firm.- I will sell in a face-to-face transaction. I do not ship, it is too much trouble.- It is against federal law for me to sell a handgun directly to a non-Georgia resident.- I don't sell guns for a living, and I have a job. Scheduling a time to meet will take some patience and coordination, so please bear with me.- I'm asking to see the buyer's Ga Weapons Permit because that lets me know the buyer passed the NICS check. I'll also accept a blue card (Georgia licensed armed security guard) or military ID with assignment (PCS) orders to a Georgia base. There are lots of fine, law abiding citizens that don't have these,but I don't personally know them all, and --- in today's world --- I want proof. I'll show my Ga Weapons Carry permit, and I will check the buyer's permit.Thanks for your interest and for reading all this!"

It has a FDE free floating 15"" SS Pro Forend made by UTG right here in the USA. FDE Magpul furniture all around, has a magpul B.A.D lever on it so you can rack a new clip more quickly. It comes with a CMC 3.5 pnd precision drop in trigger (breaks like glass) and a nickel boron PSA Bolt Carrier group which runs smooth as can be. Gas impingment system is made by YHM. As far as optic go, I have installed a Leoplold LCD red dot on top and it has BUIS (back up iron sights that are co-witnesses'd. So if you run out of battery just pop up the sights and your good to go. This AR is a beastly, battle ready rifle and the beautiful part is that its percieved recoil is like a .22 with the heavy tungsten weights I added so it's got nearly zero barrel rise which makes follow up shots a breeze. I've only fired 30-50 rounds through it but it's eats anything you throw at it. It's a real pleasure to shoot, honestly wish I did't have to get rid of this one but i've got to many AR's and I just don't use it as much as I aught to. I put well over 2k into this project and I'm asking 1200 for it so it's my loss your gain. This thing is a beast, great for runner's and gunner's, or... with the bulled out barrel you could pop a long range scope on it and stretch it way out. Come's with 2 pmags and 2 box's of 62g AR shells. Feel free to email, text, or call, my name is Alex. REDACTED. Thank's for looking!"

This is the perfect concealed carry kit. This pistol fires 9mm, a powerful service caliber, and yet the Nano is as diminutive as most underpowered .380 ACP pistols. The included IWB kydex holster is specifically designed to keep the pistol grip pressed against the body in order to minimize ""printing"". This pistol was purchased new in June 2017 and has only been broken-in with 250 rounds of 124 grain ammo exactly as prescribed by Beretta.Asking: $279, cash only, with no tax, no fees and no trades. Typical FOID check. Buyer and seller will have signed copies of the bill of sale.Details: Beretta Nano 9mm semi auto pistol in box and Beretta supplied hard case. Pistol is pristine in like new condition. The barrel was treated prior to first use with Archoil AR8300 yelding semi-permanent nano-ceramic layer harder than any gun alloy and purported to achieve a remarkably slick surface with the lowest coefficient of fricion known to man (.003 CoF). This treatment makes cleaning a breeze since fouling and residue easily wipes free. I have used this treatment on other handguns and it makes for extremely easy cleaning. I polished the feed ramp to a mirror finish for improved reliability. After unboxing I stripped the gun with denatured alcohol then I lubricated/protected all but the AR8300-treated bore with Hornady One-Shot CLP (a top winner in both lubricity and corrosion protection in a rigorous comparison of 46 gun lubricants/protectants, i.e, to see this 46 product comparison follow link to www.dayattherange.com/?page_id=3667 The exterior of the handgun is protected with Renaissance Wax which prevents fingerprints and is used to protect firearms and other valuables by almost every major museums throughout the world, including the NRA museum.Specs: caliber= 9MM (9x19), type= semi-auomatic pistol, action= double acion only, barrel length= 3"", finish= black, stock= textured, capacity= 6+1 & 8+1, number mags=2 (6 rnd, 8 rnd), model= BU-9, magazine release= reversible button, grip frame= replacable frame of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer, slide finish= Pronox, front sight= ramp, rear sight= windage adjustable, overall length= 5.63"", height= 4.17"", width= 0.9"", unloaded weight= 19.8 ozIncluded in sale: Beretta box, hard case, paperwork, Beretta Nano pistol, 6 round flush magazine yielding 6+1 capacity, 8 round magazine yielding 8+1 capacity, and Clinger ""Atom"" Kydex IWB holster.Nano was kept in safe within a gun rug except for the two time I went to the range, firing in total exactly 250 rounds of 124 gr ammo because Beretta recommends at least 124 grain ammo for break-in. There were no issues (FTFs, FTEs, etc.). Recoil is very mild for such a slim and diminutive handgun thanks to Beretta's hefty double captured recoil spring. The windage adjustable sights are amazingly visible for a pocketable pistol. The pistol is being sold to fund the purchase of a CZ P01. The included Clinger ""Atom"" Kydex holster is a comfortable minimalist IWB Kydex holster. It is an easy-on, easy-off tuckable holster that does an outstanding job of concealment since the belt clip is positioned as close toward the grip as possible, over the trigger guard, which forces the grip consistently against the body (see pictures)."

Designed specifically for military and law enforcement operators, the APX has been put through extensive testing and evaluation at the professional end user level. The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences. The APX’s aggressive full length slide serrations make slide manipulations easy under any conditions. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous.
The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta.Barrel length (mm)108 (in)4.25Caliber 9mmMagazine17Overall height (mm)142 (in)5.65Overall length (mm)192 (in)7.55Overall width (mm)33 (in)1.3Weight unloaded (g)800 (OZ)28.24Please message me with any questions."

The mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any condition and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts.

With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 7 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the user may require. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Simple in its execution, yet robust and reliable, the revolutionary Strike Latchless Charging Handle offers forged 7075 construction, efficient side gas venting, and a solid, comfortable interface for the user. Reliable receiver lockup is achieved through a novel hidden spring mechanism that uses the Charging Handle insertion slot in the upper receiver charging handle channel. This channel features a natural radius that will not wear rapidly like the external, 90-degree edge of the standard CH latch area of the upper receiver. The flat spring bearing surface is much larger than a steel ball bearing, spreading force and wear out over a larger area. Increased service life is one benefit of this type of system, as is the comfort and peace of mind that come from a lack of moving or external components that can break or snag/catch on your gear and foreign objects. The solid aluminum construction is durable and provides a solid mounting point for the ISO Tabs, an add-on component that increases surface area for those using large optics and/or gloved hands. WARNING: For standard mil-spec AR15 only. Not rated for suppressors and /or full auto fire. Not for use on SBRs or pistol length barrels (<14.5"") Package include- 1x Ambi Charging HandleFeatures - Net Weight: 0.9 oz- Improved service life over competing designs.- Ambidextrous architecture.- Simple, sleek, snag free design.- High-efficiency Gas Vents.- 7075 Forged Aluminum Construction.- Modular Extended Latch options coming soon."

First off, pistol, or at least the slide, looks to have been re-blued at some point. I say this because there is some obvious wear to the lettering and stamps that appears to be blued over. Also, the blue that is present is probably a deeper gloss blue than would have been the case during this era. Blue has about 80% coverage with some holster wear on leading edges. The pistol has a 5 digit serial with a B Suffix. Partial serial is on the frame and barrel. There is an eagle over swastika proof on the frame just under the slide release and very, very faint evidence of what should be the same proof over the slide release on the slide itself. Barrel also looks to have faint proof ahead of the serial. Only other visible stamp is MP on the front of the trigger guard. Pistol looks to have original grips in great shape. Magazine is an aftermarket but works fine. Pistol has tight smooth operation and functions as it should.BUYER MUST HAVE: A NC CCW Permit or Pistol Permit from sheriff's office as well as proper ID to show the permit and or license is indeed yours.

AR MAGLOCK solution allows the shooter to re-insert a magazine while the upper and lowers receivers (the action) are closed or open, allowing for faster magazine changes. Allows you to have the ejection port cover open or closed when closing the action, the competition only allows this with the port door closed, causing even slower operation. Does not scratch your upper receiver with an adjustment screw like competition does. Last but certainly not least, AR MAGLOCK also has finger knurling for excellent grip in any and all weather conditions, in addition to coming with the knurled grip tacticool rear take-down pin and accompanying split ring for quick pull operation."
