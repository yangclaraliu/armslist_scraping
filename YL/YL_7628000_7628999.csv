All original accessories included and the overall condition of the gun is mint unfired. Don’t let this one get away as they rarely trade on the open market. Please feel free to contact me with questions. This firearm is not displayed in our shop. It has been squirreled away in our shop vault for years and this is the first time it is for sale to the public. Wowzer this is one awesome gun!....Contact me on (321)-701-8299"
