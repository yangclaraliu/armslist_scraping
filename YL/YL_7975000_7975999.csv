Lake City's current price for this ammo (M855) to authorized buyers is $1.25/rd = $1050.00/840rds.Am selling the Sealed can for $0.75rd = $630.00/840rds.*The open can has been sold.*If you show a listing for a sealed/open can of single lot M855 (not XM855) 5.56 ammo as the one in this listing, the price will be adjusted accordingly.What's included in this listing:Each can consisting of 840ea rounds of M855 62 grain steel penetrator brass case ammunition (reloadable brass cases)*84ea 10 round stripper clips*28ea cardboard sleeves7ea 4 pocket bandoliers (will also hold 4ea 30 round magazines)*7ea stripper clip feed guides (one each per bandoleer set)*7ea heavy gauge anodized safety pins*1ea water-tight, steel M2 ammo can** These items are reusable: The used brass can be reloaded, the stripper clips can be reused multiple times, the bandoliers serve a multiple purpose and the feed guides make loading magazines quick and easy.Each bandolier holds 120 rounds on 10 round stripper clips in cardboard sleeves of 30 rounds each.The stripper clips slide into the feed guide which slips over the trailing edge of a 30 round magazine.Using the feed guide, rounds from the stripper clips can be loaded into a magazine in a matter of seconds without wearing out your thumb.Once the bandolier is empty, the white zip stitching running along the lower third of the fabric can be pulled out with one tug, opening the pockets to the proper depth to hold a 30 round magazine.The bandolier loaded with four 30 round magazines can then be slung over the shoulder, using the the safety pin to attach the strap to clothing, vest or gear to prevent loss should the wearer fall head over heels or roll.By slinging bandolier straps over opposing shoulders, the weight can be kept in balance. Sixteen magazines with 480 rounds can be carried in just 4 bandoliers.The amount of ammo that can be carried in bandoliers far exceeds the capacity of any ammo vest on the market... civilian or military.Open to:- Cash- Cash + trade[s]- Trade[s] of equivalent value***Include NAME and TELEPHONE NUMBER for reply***"

The G35 Longslide models are popular around the matches (ie 3-Gun, etc.). Ive tried shooting it, but it just doesn't do anything for me.

The rifle will come with its original pmag as well as 1 polymer IO inc magazine and 2 Croattian steel magazines bolt hold open (have been filed down to fit) and about 300 rounds of 7.62x39 I think it is 298 rounds to be exact. 49 of them are brass cased, the rest being steel cased. The IO inc magazine is not the greatest magazine; I have only ever been able to fit 23 or 24 rounds into it and some of the rounds will rattle around in there. Luckily I have never had a malfunction with it or any of the other magazines I am bundling with the rifle. I have put around 500 hundred rounds through the gun with no malfunctions at all. The rifle is pretty accurate however I have only shot out to 50 yards with a red dot that I previously had on the rifle. I was able to get a 2-3 inch grouping at 50 yards with Tula ammunition. With better ammo the rifle will perform much better. The c39v2 does not come from the factory with a side rail so I installed the AK Master Mount and to that goes the RS Regulate Quick Detach Rail System. The original pins will be included in case you decide to take off the Master Mount. I have never had any problems with the AK or any of the rail mounts. It is a great all around rifle. I can meet around the Atlanta area."
