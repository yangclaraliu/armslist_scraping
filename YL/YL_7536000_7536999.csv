These new T3x rifles are built to the same standards that so many have come to rely on from the original T3, and continue to boast a hammer forged barrel, sturdy stocks, and smooth bolt actions. They still offer a 3-shot sub-MOA accuracy guarantee right out of the box, and will continue to represent the great value of the Tikka rifle line. Some new features that set the T3x apart from its older brother include the following:  Modular synthetic stock allows the pistol grip to be changed out for a more personalized and comfortable fit Improved asymmetrical grip pattern and shape that will better accommodate grip in any condition Upgraded recoil pad to mitigate felt recoil Foam insert to lessen noise that is produced from the stock (not available in models with adjustable cheek piece) Redesigned ejection port that creates easier single feeding through the ejection port Improved rail attachment via an extra screw placement on top of the receiver for sturdier rail placement A robust metallic bolt shroud to cover and shield the rear of the bolt body and firing pin Steel recoil lug to decrease deformation even in larger calibers compared the aluminum ones in use in T3 rifles Chassis made by Tikka are short action only.  Tikka has always been considered one of the best options when considering a rifle, and the T3x continues and enhances this legacy. In addition to the regular T3x features, the Tac A1 also features:  A 2-Stage Trigger Includes 2 magazines and an additional 1 magazine available by mail when you register the rifle with Beretta Includes Muzzle Brake Safety that features a button that allows user to unlock bolt while rifle is on safe  Specifications       Caliber: 6.5 Creedmoor   Weight: 11.24 lbs   Rifle Overall Length: 43.8""   Action: Tikka T3x Bolt Action   Trigger: Two-Stage Trigger, Adjustable Pull 2-4lbs.

It has been stored on my Safe Queen Winchester 1200 for several years.They just don't come any nicer than this! Beautiful.Also Fits Winchester 1200 & 1300 and Sears Ted Williams 200.Note:Most (not all) Winchester 1200 and Sears Ted Williams 200 guns had 2 3/4"" only chambers. All (that I'm aware of) Winchester 120 and 1300 had 2 3/4"" & 3"" chambers. This barrel will fit and function fine on any of models I have listed above using 2 3/4"" shells. If your gun originally had a 3"" chamber, both 2 3/4"" & 3"" shells will still work fine with this barrel. If your gun was originally a 2 3/4"" gun, this barrel will still fit and fuction just fine with 2 3/4"" shells, but your receiver may or may not be able to cycle the 3"" shells."

Some input and hopefully pics from my fellow armslisters in the local community would be greatly appreciated. Also thinking of slide milling service too but sort of leaning towards a zev slide unless someone shows me an example of local work that catches my eye. Thank you guys and god bless"

The relationship between the UK MOD and Accuracy International began in the early 1980's when the Accuracy International PM (Precision Marksman) rifle was submitted into a sniper rifle trial for the replacement of the L42A1 sniper rifle. Following a successful trail, the PM entered into service as the L96A1. The L96A1 represented a paradigm shift in the design and feature set of sniper rifles, and the system evolved into the AW (Arctic Warfare) family of rifles through a long period of successful military trials. The basic L96 action was both lengthened and strengthened to accommodate magnum cartridges which offered greater range and power providing UK and NATO sniper forces with essential overmatch capability. During the 1980s, Accuracy International participated with Nammo Lapua Oy in the development of the .338 Lapua Magnum to create the first modern long range sniper rifle and ammunition. The resulting AWSM (Arctic Warfare Super Magnum) in .338 Lapua Magnum was adopted by the UK MOD and entered service as the L115A1 fitted with a Schmidt & Bender 3-12x50 PM II scope. The L115A1 saw extensive, and highly effective service in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 2000s. By 2007, the UK MOD had identified updates which would increase the effectiveness and capability of the L115A1, and launched the Sniper System Improvement Program (SSIP) which culminated in the L115A3 sniper rifle system entering service in 2008. The L115A3 update included the highly regarded Schmidt & Bender 5-25x56 PM II LP telescopic sight with built-in illumination, parallax focus and antireflective IR coatings, a quick detachable sound suppressor, folding butt stock, push button adjustable cheek rest and butt extension, and a retractable butt spike. Supporting items in the L115A3 kit included suppressor cover, Harris Bipod, a heavy duty tripod, spotting scope, drag bag/pack, and laser range finder making a truly capable sniper system. An L115A3 issued to British Army Sniper Craig Harrison was used to take out two Taliban combatants firing a machine gun on Nato forces at a distance of 2,474 meters (2.47 kilometers). This successful engagement resulted in the longest documented sniper kills on record. The Accuracy International model AX was introduced to the market in 2010 in response the USSOCOM's Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) solicitation. The AX was a highly modular rifle system with many enhanced features including the capability to be reconfigured by the user for different military calibers such as the .300 Winchester Magnum and 7.62 NATO. After three years of parallel production, the market was clearly communicating it's preference for the Model AX, and In 2012, Accuracy International announced the discontinuation of the storied AW series of sniper rifles. The UK MOD also recognized the dramatically improved capabilities of the Model AX, yet the L115A3 was only 6 years into it's life cycle and a procurement for an all new system would be very difficult with the drawdown of forces in the Middle East and military spending reductions. The MOD realized the most significant improvements in the Model AX were in it's advanced chassis system which provided massive capability to accommodate ever improving night vision optics, laser designators, and day optics without the need for bespoke mount interfaces. The new right folding chassis was also more compact in the folded configuration making it more portable and concealable, and featured a pistol grip. The MOD approached Accuracy International to explore the possibility of updating the proven L115A3 sniper rifle to the AX series chassis system, to produce a rifle that is a hybrid of AW and AX features. The AX enhancements were well received by the MOD and British snipers, and an update program was launched thus producing the L115A4. That L115A4 can easily be mistaken for a completely new AX series rifle system such is the quality and workmanship of the update. The Schmidt & Bender 5-25x56 PM II scope as well as the suppressor, bipod and several other accessories from the L115A3 were reused in the L115A4 resulting in significant cost savings. Along with the rifle updates, the L115A4 includes a new deployment case, maintenance kit, and other accessories. Craig Harrison, along with other British snipers, were advisers on the L115A4 update. At the conclusion of the L115A4 update, Accuracy International still had inventory of AWSM actions as well as the unique components of the hybrid AX chassis system. Following a long tradition of offering limited editions of military grade sniper rifle systems, Accuracy International - in collaboration with Craig Harrison - is offering the Maverick 41 system. Maverick 41 is Craig Harrison's sniper call sign, and it is fitting to designate this special edition L115A4 system after the call sign of the sniper who set the world's record with the L115A3. The Maverick 41 kit is the exact system configuration in every detail currently deployed by British snipers. The limited edition Maverick 41 kit includes a signed copy of Craig Harrison's book, ""The Longest Kill: The Story of Maverick 41, One of the World's Greatest Snipers"".

This guy was NOT converted to .30-06 and has the Brazilian Crest still intact. When these rifles are sold as surplus it was standard procedure to scrub the crests. The overwhelming majority of these rifles were converted and marked 1908/34. Very uncommon to find one unconverted with an intact crest. Test fired the rifle with 20 rounds of S&B 7mm Mauser: fed, fired, extracted and ejected just fine. Only caveat with this one is it has a rifle length hand guard instead of a carbine length. Carbine length hand guards are unobtanium while rifle length ones are a dime a dozen. At some point in its life it got a replacement, practically unnoticeable. Typical wear from storage conditions in South America. Stock is sound with no cracks. Bore is dark with some frosting but has plenty of life left. Bolt and Receiver match. No cleaning rod, probably lost decades ago. NOT import marked. Comes with one box of Spanish 7mm Surplus ammo, one box of S&B 7mm, and the 20 cases of S&B from my test fire. Can meet at the Sportsman's Warehouse in Mesa or AZ firearms in Gilbert. AZ ID required, CCW is a plus."

Some new features that set the T3x apart from its older brother include the following:  Modular synthetic stock allows the pistol grip to be changed out for a more personalized and comfortable fit Improved asymmetrical grip pattern and shape that will better accommodate grip in any condition Upgraded recoil pad to mitigate felt recoil Foam insert to lessen noise that is produced from the stock (not available in models with adjustable cheek piece) Redesigned ejection port that creates easier single feeding through the ejection port Improved rail attachment via an extra screw placement on top of the receiver for sturdier rail placement A robust metallic bolt shroud to cover and shield the rear of the bolt body and firing pin Steel recoil lug to decrease deformation even in larger calibers compared the aluminum ones in use in T3 rifles Chassis made by Tikka are short action only.

It is built with the inspiration of its older brother the F3, which has been a favorite among hunters and sports shooters for years. As is the case with every firearm that comes from Blaser, this shotgun is exceptionally constructed to exceed your expectations. The F16 is undoubtedly going to become one of the most sought after shotguns in the industry with its intuitive pointing abilities, lowest profile receiver on the market to date, newly developed tapered rib that supports a larger peripheral field of view for much faster target acquisition, a crisp trigger pull of 3lbs 10oz and the Inertial Block System that adds an element of reliability and safety by not allowing the shotgun to double fire or fan fire. This F16 Sporting Standard is also a beautiful and elegant firearm with grade 4 wood stock and a rounded forgrip that adds to the ergonomics of the shotgun as well as the style. It has a 32 inch barrel and a 14 ¾ inch length of pull. This shotgun is sure to be on firing line so make sure you are able to keep up with the competition with one of your own.

I have a couple very specific trade interests in mind and I would really prefer the trade matches my offering pretty much item for item, with the exception of the weapon light, I'm talking mag for mag and holster for holster.My trade interests are handguns in 9mm for the most part, but I might consider one in .357 Sig.Now for a list of what I'd like to trade for: CZ SP-01 Phantom, the polymer decocker version of the SP-01, CZ P-01, a Sig 226R or maybe a 229RI would also consider a trade of 2 cheaper handguns, for example a Canik TP9V2 and a Smith hammerless j frame or a FEG PJK-9HP and a Smith hammerless j frame like a 442 or 642. I'd prefer a Smith without the frame lock, but it's not a deal breaker.For the right trade I do have several extras I can include to sweeten the deal.Feel free to hit me up with other trade offers, there's no telling what may interest me, but please do it by text. The only real requirements I need is that the pistol have a rail, and is in one of the above named calibers. I can be reached at 405 919 9231 and I can also send pics of my 17 that way.
