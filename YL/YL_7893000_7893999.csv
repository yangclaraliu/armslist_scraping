The Saiga looks kind of silver with paint worn off. What What happened to it? Is it USED?A: My Saiga is perfectly clean. It is not a “single color.” It is totally custom BLUED FINISH.*CUSTOM*BLUED* It is very light or “almost worn to bare metal” look. It is not worn to bare metal. Just looks like it in some places, yet dark in others. You can see Russian tooling machining marks. a custom look. The outside, whole shiny, is perfectly clean and dry. Not oily. It is common to think it is dusty from the range or the battlefield (when not paying close attention to other clues). So, it is BRAND NEW.)Q: I tied bluing my 308-hunting rifle and a few shotguns, and it’s a PITA. So why go with a Custom Blued Finish?A: Because you don’t Ceracoat a (Russian) KALASHNIKOV. *** And a rifle heavily used on the field of battle just looks soooooo kooooool …… The finish is my “Blued” interpretation of a $500 custom ceracote “battlefield pickup/distressed look.” I saw and admired. Nut you don’t ceracote an AK… Mine is an interpretation of what an RPKM/AK74M/100 would look like if it spent 10 years in Afghanistan or Chechnya.
