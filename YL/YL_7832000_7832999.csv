This Remington Model 700 SPS Tactical Rifle is brand-new, out of the box. This rifle has a 20” carbon steel, heavy barrel with a satin black oxide metal finish. This barrel has a 1:12 right hand twist and is free-floating.
The overall length of this rifle is 39 ¾” and weights 7.5 pounds empty. This rifle comes with the X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger that is currently set at 3.5 pounds. The rifle has a hinged floorplate magazine that holds 4 rounds of .308 or 7.62.
The stock is a Hogue overmolded, pillar-bedded stock with a SuperCell Recoil Pad. I have set this rifle up as an intermediate range tactical sniper rifle system.
At the front attachment point, I have installed a new Harris Engineering Ultralight Bipod, Series 1A2. I have also installed a new Kinetic Research Group Bolt Lift.
I have installed a new Leupold VX-R Patrol Tactical Scope on this rifle using a new Leupold Remington short action continuous Picatinny Rail in matte black. I am also including a new UTG Remington short action cutout rail in case someone wants to install a longer mount at some point.
The new Leupold Scope is the VX-R Patrol 1.25-4 x 20mm. This scope has a matte black finish and the FireDot Special Purpose Reticle (“SPR”). This scope has an actual low magnification of 1.30x and a high magnification of 4.00x. The field of view at 100 meters is 22.9 meters on low magnification and 8.8 meters on high magnification. The eye relief is 4.10 inches on low and 3.70 inches on high magnification. The scope weighs 11.50 ounces (325 grams).
The scope’s elevation and windage adjustment range are both 90 moa. The total length of the scope is 9.40 inches. The tube diameter is 30.00mm. The scope is mounted to the rifle in a Leupold Mark 2 Integral Mounting Systems (“IMS”) 30 mm mount. The mount is in matte black and is 1.40 inches high. It is aluminum and uses an aluminum cantilever.
I have included with this sniper rifle a brand new Lost Woods padded rifle bag in olive drab. I have also included a new Fox Tactical 11” x 17” Tactical Scope Protector.
This rifle comes with its original Remington Arms box.
After putting this sniper system together, I zeroed this rifle to 250 meters. The first round fired was one (1) M-80 7.62 x 51mm NATO round with a 147 grain full metal jacket bullet on a cold barrel. Loading, firing, extraction and ejection of a standard 7.62 NATO round was flawless.
I next fired three (3) rounds of Hornady Match .308 Winchester rounds firing a 155 grain A-Max full metal jacket bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2860 feet per second, to align the scope to the barrel.
I then adjusted the scope windage and elevation to zero at 250 meters and fired three (3) rounds of the same Hornady Match .308 ammunition. These three confirmation rounds at 250 meters realized a 2.5” group (and I pulled the last round), which is sub 1 minute of angle accuracy at 250 meters. Total round count through this rifle is seven (7) rounds as noted abov"

Really interested in pre 2010 production with the slick ""textured"" finish but would consider newer. Excellent to like new condition with matching numbers only and preferably all stock or at least with no permanent modifications. Not really that interested in pre ban mags cause most are almost as old as me or tons of custom extras that don't really enhance function like engraved slide cover plates, custom stuff is just not my thing and pricy U notch mags have cracked for me before. For the trade I have a practically new SIG P225-A1 9mm that is the all black model with factory G10 grips, SIGLITE sights and Short Reset Trigger. It comes in the original case with the manual, lock, price and warning tags, wrapping plastic, sticker and 2 8rd mags. Has all the makings of a perfect carry gun and it feels just like a shrunken Legion but I almost always go with my revolver for carry and I would rather continue putting all the wear on my other older SIGs at the range so this one never gets touched, kinda sad really. I would trade it for a Glock 22 or 23 if you can add some cash and I'm not trying to be greedy or get rich but most Gen 3s and my P225-A1 are not approved in MA and there is quite a price gap between the two new or pre-owned. Let me know what you have and the basic details about it, I wont answer replies that only say ""Got a 22 to trade."". EFA10 transfer. If you can meet local I can be free almost any time or set something up another day if that doesn't work. All laws will be followed. Thanks."

CWP not mandatory. This FNS-9 from Fabrique Nationale is by far the best 9MM pistol on the market. I’ve owned it for 3 months and during that time have taken it to the range 3 times so total of 150 rounds have fired. It comes with everything.....original case, 3 magazines, all paper work, lock, etc. I’m asking $450. The FNS-9 4″ has a shape, length, width and unloaded weight that matches the Glock 19.  They’re both striker fired 9mm pistols.  There are some aesthetic differences, of course. Beyond that, the FNS-9 is almost exactly like a Glock 19…except slightly better in almost every way. On the FNS-9, all the controls are there and ready to go.  You can swap hands and continue to use the gun with no issues. There’s not much more you can ask of a pistol than to hold 17 + 1 rounds in a fairly compact, concealable package, that also boasts great accuracy and provides nearasdamnit flawless reliability. I don’t love the manual safety, but I understand why it’s there. The trigger has a secondary safety so you can choose to carry with the manual safety off if you’d like or buy the version without the safety altogether. Specifications: FNS-9  * Caliber: 9mm * Operation: Striker fired * Sights: Fixed 3-dot * Magazine: 10 or 17 rds. (17 rounds tested) * Advertised Weight: 25.2 oz.

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7832989,For Sale/Trade:  1940's Radom model 35,"Soddy daisy, Chattanooga, Tennessee",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, January 15, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,1940's Radom pistol in 9mm. Overall in pretty good condition for its age with some minor surface rust in spots. I believe this to be a gun that was produced in the later parts of ww2 possibly at the steyer plant. It has some markings and characteristics that would place it in that time frame. The grip on the right side is loose and there was a spring that was replaced in one of the levers. Seems to be in good shape but I've not fired the gun. Mainly looking to trade on something that I will use more often. Open to hear any trades and offers text or email is best REDACTED
