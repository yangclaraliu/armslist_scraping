His Chogan and Kangee T-Hawks are shaped of single-piece steel with a curved handle and grip choils along the front for enhanced holding power. Full-length handle scales are checkered for added grip security, and can be removed for cleaning. The two different models offer distinctive bladed head styles, which both provide exceptional utility and toughness. Molle equipped, form-fitting Kydex sheaths slip over the head and secure with a buckled strap. Available in both the Chogan and Kangee T-Hawk (tactical tomahawk) models. You will find both of these T-Hawks very well balanced and easily controlled, while still being robust enough to handle most anything dished out.

The gun is in perfect condition and was purchased new only 2 months ago. It works flawlessly and has only fired 42 rounds while I was adjusting the sights. It is single action with 2nd strike capability. So if you got a light primer, it goes into double action and you just pull the trigger again to fire the round.  I have an extra mag I bought from pro mag that is brand new. But the pro mag does have a major issue where it refuses to feed on every round. I’m sure it can be fixed, I’m just not experienced enough yet with semi autos to mess with it (always had wheel guns till I got this). The gun also has a mag pouch to carry the extra mag if you can get it to work. I have added a pinky extension to the original mag. But I have the original bottom as well. I also have 150 rounds of brass federal fmj ball ammo as well as a quick mag loader. I also have a cheap nylon holster I’ll throw in as well.

I am the first owner of this beautiful yet rugged firearm, and it has served me well as a nightstand gun for the past two years. Total it probably hasn’t had much more than 200 rounds through it, and the vast majority of those were .38s. The only reason I changed it out is because it was a little big for my wife’s small hands, and I want to make sure she has something she is comfortable using if I am away. The matte stainless finish is attractive and practical and exhibits only minor wear from the drawer and range trips. The robust front and rear sights provide for fast target acquisition, and the front is factory mounted with a big light gathering fiber optic which makes it even more effective in low light. The grips really make it stand out from your average run of the mill revolver, with the very nice rubber grips with checkered wood inserts. It is really the best of both worlds here, with the shock absorbing properties of the rubber with the great style and and grippiness of the checkered wood. I’m asking $625, which I think is pretty fair considering they sell for $860 and up from local dealers after all fees are factored in (see picture three). I would prefer to meet at either Mechanicsburg Ordnance or SPAR Firearms to do the transfer, but am open to anywhere reasonable within the Mechanicsburg, Carlisle, Camp Hill area. This would be a great pistol for the range, the field, or to sit ready to go in your nightstand!"
