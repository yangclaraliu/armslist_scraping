Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.

It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

Ie: collapsible, folding, magpul, etc. With the current magpul stock it is by far the tightest most comfortable defense shotgun I have ever fired.

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.
The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. LNIB with all factory papers, test casing, bushing wrench etc. serious inquiries only, no trades.

Absolutely no wear on the barrel, not a single scratch on the weapon or any signs of wear.  Factory SIG SLP lubricant was still on the weapon when I purchased it.  I have only fired 25 rounds through this gun. A great chance of have a brand new SIG without paying new SIG price.  Comes with two magazines.  I just purchased this, but have had some unexpected expenses come up.  This pistol was $699 at Vance's just 25 rounds ago.

Its in great shape, but I already have a subcompact carry gun, so I'd like to trade it for something a bit bigger, mid or full sized in 9mm. Would primarily be interested in an XD9 Service model, Glock 19, Beretta 92, Stoeger Cougar, maybe an SP2022, or similar, Would also be interested in a mid size (4 inch barrel, no snubs) .357 or .38 special revolver. No Tauruses please. Let me know what you have, but I'm only looking for a 9mm semi auto or .38 special/.357 revolver, and I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns.

With summer now here it'd be a great choice if you're looking for an easier to conceal carry gun.

Would prefer to trade but will sell the gun and laser for $450.

We'd tried notebooks, arm bands, all the typical solutions. Some were fast to use but with small writing surfaces, some blew away in the wind, none were perfect.

It's two layers of Acrylic, one white and one clear, and they are held together with magnets. You slip your dope card between the layers, and then you can write with a wet or dry erase marker on the clear top. You can also write on the white base if you have something you don't want erased every time you change positions. At the Steel Safari, my buddy liked to have the ""V"" representing the target area drawn on the white board. At each stage he just had to jot down the ranges to the targets, writing them down on the clear board roughly representing where they were in the field. 

The magnets hold the two layers securely, but are easy to separate by sliding them apart. The boards are 6"" X 9"" and fit in the cargo pocket of most cargo pants. This is how he ran his, and it was very fast to deploy. They weigh 12 oz, so they don't blow away in a double value wind, but they not too horribly heavy that they're uncomfortable to carry. 

Not just for competition. I use it to for my own practice and as a teaching aid.

The other 40 rounds are in a ziplock bag and this is because my AR was my rifle of choice for home defense and I kept 4 magazines ready to go and thus threw out the boxes.  These rounds have NEVER been fired and are all new in the box (or the 40 rounds in the bag - also never fired).  They were kept on the top shelf of a closet in an  air conditioned home that never sees above 73 degrees F and never has moisture/humidity issues.  I'm selling all 220 rounds for $70 firm.

The gun is in great shape minus some paint coming off the extractor (common with HK's) and a little grip tape coming off the bottom right side of the grip ($40+- to repair both). You can see this in the pictures.

For a little extra I will throw in the Sentry Safe that I used the padding from the black carrying case to line and hold the gun in.

Product Description
barnes_precision_machine The Barnes Precision CQB Patrolman's Carbine is an agile, soft-shooting carbine loaded with features normally seen on rifles at twice the price. This model comes with a 12-inch picatinny spec free-floated rail system. A BPM enhanced barrel nut helps the rifle achieve unprecedented rigidity for the length of the rail. Each rail system features four steel reinforced interchangeable sling swivel inserts. The CQB also features an A2-Style muzzle device which reduces muzzle blast and felt recoil, complete with a breaching tip and a mid-length gas system with a low profile gas block."

I have a: 

NEW Leupold AR SCOPE Mark 4 CQ/T 1-3 x 14mm Matte Illuminated - $1500 BRAND NEW. IN BOX.

NEVER USED.............. No, not craigslist ""new"" but REALLY, TRULY NEW.

http://www.amazon.com/1-3x14mm-Matte-Illuminated-Optics-Scopes/dp/B007X0Q3G0

Here's what I want. . . I have this scope that's pretty specifically for an AR platform, and you have two or more AR's. I would trade the scope for one of those AR's.

That simple enough? I would not want an AR that costs MORE THAN this scope, so I wouldn't add cash to boot. YOU may, though. Say you have a $900 Rock River Arms AR and wanna trade it. I'd welcome that in trade, plus cash.

Or a Kimber or other nicer 1911............... and a Walther PPK or PPK/S......... or what-have-you.............but those are the ones I'm actively trying to buy right now.  

That's really about all I'm looking for right now. I'd be curious to hear your offers though.

Please, no xbox, nor kids games, nor ""beats"" headphones, nor iphones, no tatoos, no massage, no 420, no BS.

Due to a growing family, I can only keep those rifles and other weapons that will fit in the safe, so everything that does not fit is currently being listed here. These listings are at very low prices as I try to balance the losses I'm willing to take with the shrinking timeframe in which I have to reduce my collection. However these low prices represent a great opportunity for potential buyers to build their own collection and pick up some new pieces at a sizable discount.  Thanks for looking and please see my other listings as well. 
TRADES:
There are a few trades I'll consider and these included handguns in 9mm or .380 (Glock handguns in particular), 1911s, and perhaps some assault rifles in .223/5.56."

Its short barrel and competition hammer is well-suited for quick draw. And the low hammer profile makes it easier to cock and shoot the CMS with one hand while mounted on horseback.

I have a stainless Rossi .357/.38 for sale.  It is in excellent condition, only about 100 rounds fired.  Accurate considering it is a snub nose and easy to handle.  Even with .357 mag rounds it seemed to handle well.  It is a heavier revolver, but that helps with the recoil.  I bought this to demonstrate in a firearm training class and have since obtained another revolver and have no need for this one.  Rossi is made by Taurus and they make a good revolver.  It is backed by a lifetime service policy if ever needed.  Comes with 1 speed loader

If interested, please give me a call/text, Don REDACTED. If you have a carry permit we can do bill of sale. No permit, we can do FFL transfer and I'll split fee with you. Have a good day/night and thanks for looking."

You can even use this to make money by doing sight work! The P500 is precision-machined and its steel tool safely removes, installs and adjusts front and rear sights on handguns. Clamp your slide into the tool and line up the sights with the tool’s pusher tip for installation, removal, or adjustment. Mobile jaw customizes to the height of your slide and can be used from the right or left side. Delrin® liner protects slide from scratches. Includes three sight pushers that attach to the end of the sight-pushing bolt. 1⁄4"" square tip works perfectly on shallow, cross-dovetail sights. Hold Down Clamp helps prevent the slide from twisting in the frame of the P500 by applying extra force to the top of the slide. Provides a secure seat in the tool when working with hard-to-remove sights or slides with angled sides, like the Springfield Armory XD and the S&W M&P.
