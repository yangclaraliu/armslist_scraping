Good clean reliable rifle.I'm told, Windham-era Bushmaster XM15s are made before the company was bought and the original Windham manufacturing team was laid off. The new-era rifles are priced lower, but the old ones like these are priced higher from people who know the level of quality the old crew made them in Windham. Fine rifle and amazing trigger, and is pretty accurate.PRICE: $800 OBOI can take $100 off if you don't want the scope.Transfer to be done in Beaverton/Tigard area at your FFL dealer of choice (Tigard Pawn is a good one for only a $25 total fee).
