This is an standard 1951 model with a 5 round magazine tube. It is very clean on the inside and in perfect working order, with wear on the patina finish of the exterior. This would be an excellent shotgun for lefties, since it loads and ejects downward from the receiver. Stock was cracked at wrist (which is very common for this type of shotgun and replacements run about $65 dollars) and has been epoxied together. Runs very smooth and is chambered for 2 3/4 shells. Barrel is a modified choke and is 28 inches long. Engravings are still in good shape and not a spot of rust anywhere on it. What's beautiful about this is the slam fire capability that was removed from the newer shotguns. If you hold the trigger down and pump the action, it will fire as soon as the chamber closes. Very fast and very fun. Looking to sell to fund a new project."

This cartridge started the ""Magnum era"" of handgun ammunition and it is also regarded by many as an excellent hunting, metallic silhouette and self-defense round. With proper loadings it can also be effective against large or dangerous game, such as bear and ungulates, howerever many consider the larger magnum calibers to be more appropriate such as the .500 Smith & Wesson, .50 Action Express, .44 Magnum, .454 Casull, .41 Magnum as well as other larger magnum rounds. Comparatively, the 357 Magnum has less energy than the larger magnum revolver loadings but is smaller in diameter with high velocity allowing for excellent penetration properties, It is a fine small- and medium-game round and is sufficient to hunt deer at reasonable ranges if suitable loadings are used by a competent marksman. So i can assure you that this gun can be all you want it to be and it will resosnate perfect with you. On purchasing this gun i'll give you a warrantee for a year."
