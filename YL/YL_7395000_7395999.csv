The pistol has been shot but very few times and is in like new condition. This G.I. style pistol is built like a tank and very accurate! One of the hardest pistols to find on the market today. CZ produced 999 of these pistols before halting production. Some say that the reason for halting production was the start up of the CZ Dan Wesson 1911. This pistol has super tight tolerance and a nice trigger. I found 2 for sale: 1 on gun broker for  $1400 and one with wear for $850 on Armslist in another state. I'm wanting  $775.

I purchased this last year and decided to SBR (short barrel rifle) it, so I filled out the Form 1. Got it approved (8 months later) and all is good. I have never fired this gun, ever. It has sat in my safe its entire sad life... I've done some research and selling an SBR, due to NFA laws, is a complete PITA. I have contacted the ATF to get this SBR removed from the NFA registry to make it a normal handgun again. I am going to go ahead and list it now to line up a buyer but it can not be sold until it has been removed from that registry - don't ask. I'll provide a copy of the notarized letter I sent the ATF and you can call to confirm once it has been removed.Selling this as a package deal. I am not going to split anything up at the moment. If I have trouble selling it, I may go that route but honestly it has sat so long I am not in a hurry. You won't be disappointed with this setup. No trades and price is non-negotiable - please don't ask for either. I've researched the prices and am being fair. Again, I am not in a hurry. Please KNOW your own state laws regarding firearms! i.e. no Commie states - sorry California and New York. Colorado still have that mag ban? I don't know them all so please make sure it is legal.There was a question about the Troy grip and Form 1. On whether it would make it an AOW (Any Other Weapon). Honestly, I am not positive. I put it on after I had my Form 1 completed and am removing it now to be on the safe side. Reducing the price $50.Update: It has been removed from the registry and is ready to sell. All questions have been answered. Still available at the moment. Included:Sig MPXP9 MPX P 9mm 8"" - unfired. It does have the Trust name (NFA required) and Celtic emblem etched into the lower. It can be removed via touch up or if you wanted to cerakote the firearm (something I never got around to doing but had planned to). Other than that, it is in excellent condition.OEM Sig MPX Hard Carrying Case - configured for non-brace and vertical grip - if sold separately they run $504 - Sig MPX 9mm Polymer Translucent Magazines - List for $30 eachSig Sauer Romeo 3 Miniature Reflex Sight - this thing alone lists for $400 and it is a phenomenal little reflex!Sig Sauer Folding SBX Stabilizing Arm Brace Kit - this lists for over $200 as well.2 - Yankee Hill Machine Co 1/2 inch risers - planned on getting a solid one but I had these laying around. - Lists for $15 each*** Removed VG due to questions about a Form 1 requirement **** Troy Modular Combat Grip - lists for $70 *** NOT INCLUDED *** And, I'll toss in a couple hundred rounds of FMJ 9mm ammo. Again, the price is firm!"

Product Description
The criteria for the gun:
To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.
State of the Art:
Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.

The steel is exposed at the front and rear locking areas, preventing wearing the mag out from inserting it into your weapon over and over. The U.S. Palm AK30 magazine has a reputation for being one of the best commercial AK magazines you can buy. The magazine body is made from high-strength polymer with a permanently affixed floorplate, creating essentially a very strong five-sided box. The follower is vented on top to allow for debris to easily fall out and for easy cleaning. At the top of the magazine, stainless steel locking surfaces have been molded into the polymer for added strength and durability. The exterior features aggressive ridges on the front and rear and a very deep waffle pattern on the sides to assist in rapid extraction and control.(2) $60 (4) $100 (8) $180NOT SELLING INDIVIDUALLY!281-698-ZERO9THREE9"

I got this but don't really have a use for it since it's to big for me to carry. I did have a custom leather holster made for it by a leather worker in canyon which will go with the gun. I have put about 4 mags through it so it's very clean. I lost the vickers extended slide release and one of the vickers floor plates unfortunately. Since I don't have the ""extras"" that came with it I'm pricing it as a standard glock. This does have the vickers sight installed from the factory which are a huge upgrade over standard glock sights. Unfortunately I cannot ship so it will have to be face to face. THANKS!"
