I originally bought it as the .40S&W, but after purchase I also bought the Caliber X-Change kit to convert it to a 9mm. The thing is extremely easy to disassemble. It takes about a minute or less to convert it to either caliber. This was one of those hasty decisions to purchase as they had a decent deal on it. To help even further sweeten the deal, this firearm has never actually been fired either. The only thing that has been done with it was it's been disassembled a couple of times, and there is currently ammunition in one of the .40S&W magazines. There are two 13 round .40S&W magazines, and two 17 round 9mm magazines. What's nice about this gun is it is the carry model which means it is the ""compact"" barrel, but it is still the full size grip that takes full size mags. I love how this firearm feels in my hand, but it is just not for me. Looking back, I probably should not have purchased it, but hey you can't pass up a good deal when you see one. I originally paid about $650 for the firearm itself, and I paid $400 for the X-Change kit. I'm only asking $650 just to hopefully sell it quick to buy what I want next. If you're interested, feel free to shoot me an email."

I've kept very good care of this gun cleaning bore, oiling after every firing.shoots where you aim it meant to be exceptionally accurate. Design after the full size 1911 .45 with same weight and overall size.the best in my opinion as a training gun to stay proficient with handling of guns.i used gun for sighting and trigger pull right on target. I can't remember what the trigger pull is but the trigger forces you to steady your pull.trying to guess how many rounds fired is difficult lost track. If you want me to guess I'll give it a try when you write or call.you will find I polished the follower and the base for easy slide. Love this gun and so will you. I haven't used it lately due to firing primarily 9mm now.buy and enjoy. Any questions I'm available."

Like all Generation 4 Glocks here in Cali, this one is an off-roster pistol, meaning you couldn't walk into a store and buy it — only available through legal private party sale / transfer at a licensed dealer/FFL (Turners Orange, CA).  One of very few (ever) for sale in the private market in Southern California, and I paid a fortune for it. More than what I've listed her for.Unfortunately, it has remained unfired & unchambered, as new - in the box in my gun safe since purchase. It is unmolested, un-touched and new, ready for an optic/red-dot. These handle the 10mm round's recoil phenomenally and many use these in competition as well as hunting and for bear protection while camping or hunting or in the woods.If you've been looking for a longslide 10mm -- this is the most powerful glock on the market, red dot mountable - includes plates/hardware from Glock. Truly hard to find (if not impossible) in SoCal.Price is $1049.00. As an avid 10mm fan, I dropped much more.Meet at Turners in Orange, CA for the FFL paperwork & safe legal transfer.Not really looking for any trades. I ended up not using this pistol, so my loss is your gain -- chance to own an an off-roster Gen 4 Glock - only one listed in SoCal.*I am funding an independent movie & $30k cinema camera, so selling this 10/10 never chambered piece. If you don't have cash and would like to use a credit card, that's workable.------------Keywords: G40 Gen4 Generation 4 G4 Glock40 M.O.S. 10 millimeter long barrel longslide long-slide long slide off roster optic red dot 10 mm lone wolf lonewolf"
