With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button make it great for right hand and left hand shooting. There is also a single action striker-fired trigger pull. Solo frames are machined from aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. This makes for easy cleaning. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel and edges are rounded and blended. Great carry gun for anyone!

This is not your typical plinking AR as it is expensive to feed and belongs out putting deer on the table. I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, (5) 26 round Alexander Arms magazines, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo, I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then we go to a local FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested. If one carbine is not enough for you, I have two Alexander Arms consecutive serial number carbines waiting for that father sons hunting trip. I would be happy to sell both to you for $1000.00 each. I will pay for all the transfer and shipping fees.

Not another close to this bad boy at all. It has a new TRIJICON TRI POWER sitting on a new LARUE TACTICAL LT150 quick release mount. The weapon light is a ELZETTA C CHARLIE 333 900 lumens weapon light. This little light is the brightest you have ever seen mounted to a weapon. It disorienting even in daylight but at night its totally blinding. Last but not least is the AIMSHOT LS8300 Laser. Try to find one of these bad boys. They are only sold to SOCOM and other Elite Special Forces Units. Law enforcement agency's can no longer by these. You can call Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify this. This is the brightest green laser you will ever find mounted to a rifle. You can follow the beam even in daylight and at night it looks like something from STAR WARS the dot is unbelievable bright. YES IT WILL LIGHT A MATCH!!! Comes with zero tool and two tail caps. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking.

How it Works
ThermaCELL® Mosquito Repellent Lanterns and Appliances are powered by a single butane cartridge. Butane provides the cordless, portable heat that activates the patented devices.
The heat generated by the butane cartridge is directed to a metal grill that is part of the design of the Lantern or Appliance. A small mat, saturated with repellent, sits on top of the metal grill. Heat vaporizes the repellent, allowing it to rise into the air.
The repellent is allethrin, a copy of a repellent that naturally occurs in chrysanthemum flowers. It repels mosquitoes, black flies, and no-see-ums, and will not harm humans or pets.
Within minutes after turning on the Lantern or Appliance, the repellent creates a 15 by 15-foot (225 square-foot) area of repellency, the size of an average deck, patio, or campsite. All ThermaCELL Mosquito Repellent products use the same refills, which contain both repellent mats and butane cartridges.

This variant is series 70 style in that it does NOT have a firing pin safety, no firing pin block. Magazine is Armscor / ACT-Mag bright blue steel 8 shot, and any Colt Government magazines work just fine in this Armscor.

It's in perfect condition, runs without a hiccup, and retails for $1,200 or more new.  (See here  http://www.watchclick.com/concord-saratoga-0310734-watch.html ) The maker doesn't really have the name recognition of, say, Rolex, but is highly regarded among watch enthusiasts.  

I, however, am a firearms enthusiast.  I never wear a watch, and I was given this one by a now-former employer, so I thought that it would make a good trade for something that goes bang.  

There are many replicas of this watch floating around in cyberspace, but this one is the genuine article.  I have the original manual and warranty card, and it comes in the original box.  Interested parties are free to confirm the serial number with the manufacturer, have it authenticated by a jeweler, or whatever other means may be necessary to dispel any doubts.  

The watch was made in 2008, but sat unused in a closet for a number of years until my wife recently unearthed it during a fit of spring (cleaning) fever.  

As far as trades go, I'm open to just about anything, but mainly focused on long guns and revolvers.  Bolt action rifles in good deer hunting calibers are a favorite, as are S&W or Ruger DA revolvers.  My collection is also missing a good 30-30 lever gun, a Browning A5, a 223 bolt gun, and an over-under.  I've also had an interest lately in 3rd generation Smith and Wesson autos.  I'm more into classic/hunting guns than modern tactical stuff, but may consider a glock, AR, etc. if I don't have much luck trading for the kind of guns described above.  

I'd guesstimate the value of the watch at around $800, so I'm looking for trades in that ballpark, but I could give or take a few hundred bucks for the right item.  Multi item trades are welcome, ammo, reloading gear, etc."

From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target.

Armscor of the Philippines launched its business the same year we did, 1952; but it was a little over a decade before we began carrying their products. Since the earliest Armscor .22 rifles, to their long produced .22 Magnum ammo marketed by Fiocchi, we have had positive experience with Armscor products, and that is especially true with their Rock Island Armory series of Government 1911 style pistols. We admit that the Taurus Revolvers are winners hands down over Armscor’s; but the Filipino Gunsmiths have many more years of experience with their 1911A1 pistols than the Upstart Brazilians do. This offering is for Armscor / Rock Island’s new Commander type .45, the 1911A1 MSP, a pistol that holds its traditional looks and lines while incorporating custom features. Construction is all steel, with traditional military parkerized finish and silver inlay slide marking. Barrel is 4 1/4 inch Commander Length, but with Detonics style bell nosed muzzle area and full length stainless guide rod. Hammer is traditional serrated spur Government style .300 wide, and with matching serrated face black anodized trigger. Felt creep is minimal on all specimens we have handled. Sights are low profile traditional 1911 stake on half moon stake on front and dovetailed black rear. Grip safety and main safety are traditional 1911 type, with serrated flat mainspring housing. This variant is series 70 style in that it does NOT have a firing pin safety, no firing pin block. Photo specimen’s trigger gauged at 4 7/8 pounds with minimal felt creep. This pistol comes furnished with a total of one 8 shot blue steel magazine. Grips are nicely grained Filipino hardwood. This pistol is an exceptional value at only $ 389.00. Not transferable to civilians in California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in New York, we will sub a 7 shot mil-spec magazine. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

Magpul PMAG® 30, 5.56x45 Magazine – AR15/M16 The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a (optionally purchased) pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which provides even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Made in U.S.A. Features: * Impact and crush resistant polymer construction * Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding * Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability * USGI-spec stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and field compatibility * Textured gripping surface and flared floorplate for positive magazine handling and easy disassembly

Below I have listed the factory specifications along with a factory description for you to look over. If you have any questions feel free to give us a call, shoot us an email, or stop in and check out our large selection of New & Used Firearms! Description: Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

The kayak is flat bottom, weighs 39lbs, was manufactured in Maine, and is very stable for beginners.  It is ideal for small streams, rivers, and smooth lakes. Item 32088-1.  This kayak comes with State of Oklahoma demonstration permit and Manufacturer's Statement of Origin to a Boat.

Comments by owners include ""I love the Otter! I have had several different boats since I started kayak. I found this Otter used for $200, it has been my favorite boat since the first time I got it on the water. Handles great can hold a line and is very comfortable. The only set back to The Otter is the lack of foot peddles (can be easily installed) and the behind the seat storage compartment is can be hard to access.

All things considered: I don't head towards the water, without the Otter.  Rating: 9 of 10""

And "" I see this has lots of reviews so I'll just say that I bought this new a couple years ago at a local sporting goods store. It is super easy to paddle, stable and turns every which way when you try and coast. Seriously this thing has no directional stability at all, but I'll never get rid of it because it is so tough, light and easy to throw around, anyone can stay upright in it and paddle around with little or no experience. I still use it for paddling creeks, rivers and small lakes mainly for exercise and some exploring, I don't mind bumping into rocks or dragging it on the gravel cause it's so indestructible. The seat in mine is a rigid plastic with a high solid back and I love it, just have to sit on a cushion but if you have ever paddled one with a soft low back you will understand what I mean. I like the foot room in this better than some of the newer design kayaks.

Rating: 8 of 10""

Another ""I picked up this boat from Craigslist as a boat as a friend boat for when I went paddling with people that didn't have a boat. I decided to try it out and make sure it was OK for that purpose. I'm almost 6'4"" and vary between 210-240lbs., currently closer to 240lbs. and I couldn't believe this boat. It held me, was fine on small lake, mild river, and light surf is still a question. I threw on a spray skirt and throw it in my pickup and go. From a BS friend/backup boat I find I use it all the time. It's just fun and easy to move.

Rating: 10 of 10""

And finally ""I got my Otter at a yard sale for $50, it is worth way more than that to me! I have used it for everything from short jaunts to overnighters and no matter what the Otter handles me, gear, and whatever punishment comes its way. My favorite thing to do is hook up with a 3-5 ft long muskie and use the awesome stability of the kayak to wear out the fish. There is nothing that compares to having a fish the size of your leg pull you up and down the creek, over logs, and up whitecaps. No matter what I'm getting into the Otter is up to the challenge. Awesome little kayak!

The PX4 Storm is a Double/Single-Action Semiauto

The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement. Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. 

The PX4 Storm is Ultra-Durable and Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.

The PX4 Storm has a Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with Features

The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.


PX4 Storm is Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to Maintain

This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.

Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down."
