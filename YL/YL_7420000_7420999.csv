DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH OFFERS LESS THEN ASKING PRICE, Thank You.
Back story: I bought a 90TSS and bought multiple chokes from Briley, unfortunately one choke was defective and while at Grand Blanc Huntsman’s Club I attempted to seat the new choke out of the box into the brand new gun and it got stuck. Briley wouldn’t stand behind the issue and I was out $1750 dollars plus the chokes because the gun was of no use. I called SKB and eventually got ahold of the owner, Rob. He’s a great guy and I’ll only shoot SKB shotguns from now on, Rob sent me a replacement gun until my gun could have a new barrel set made and installed in Turkey. I then purchased the gun that is for sale here today, once my original gun came back. REDACTED, JARED
 
Now I have two great 90TSS Shotguns and I thought I’d keep one as a spare but I’d like to look at a SKB auto so when I sell this gun that’s the plan. Literally like new in the box, very well taken care of."

As the title states it's a 2001 SXR 600. I've owned it for about 3 years and its never given me any problems and always starts right up. Last year I put new Skis on it as well as new Hyfax. This winter I put a Kawell 9"" 54W LED lightbar spot/flood combo on the 8"" handlebars which turns on with the Hi switch. The LED low beam kit from RoczToyz turns on with the Low switch like normal. Both are very bright compared to stock. It is a pull start and does NOT use a battery. I also put a GPS mount up by the gauges. The seat is in perfect condition with no rips or tears. The hood has some wear and scuffs but no cracks. Could probably use a new windshield. As for mileage I would guess around 7-8K as the ODO and speedo haven't worked since I've owned it. I'm selling it because I flat out do not have time to ride it and it's just taking up space in the garage.Asking price is $1600 OBO. I also have some like new riding gear that I would throw in for another $300."
