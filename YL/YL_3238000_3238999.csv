Those are face to face prices.  Please add $25 for shipping FedEx, insured, signature confirmation, to your FFL.  [Note:  f you buy both (not face to face), I will give you a shipping choice:  Take the scope off and ship the rifle in box, and scope in its box in same larger box - Or, leave scope on, bubble wrap everything, and ship all in one large box.  There's no great advantage to the latter to you, since the scope is not sighted in, but maybe you want to do that so there will be no new mounting marks from taking the scope off then putting it back on later.]

I can barely in DA and kind of in SA but have to reposition the gun and it doesn't line up with my arm.

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.
MSRP is $815.00 Our price is $715.00"

Why? Cause between my kids sports and my other hobbies etc. Its just been sitting.
This thing runs like a champ. O.S. 18TM motor with Trinity pipe, pull start.
I still have all the parts for the original EZ start but it was junk and just added a bunch of weight.
Especially as good as this OS motor runs it doesnt make sense to drag all that extra stuff around.
I do also have the hex drill bit that I used when I first got it with a lame TRX2.5r motor. That way when it flooded I could still get is started easily.
A while back I traded in the old motor under the Traxxas trade in trade up deal and the new motor was much more consistent. But after about 1/2 to 3/4 of a gallon I got a smokin deal on the 18TM and never looked back.
Like I state in the title, this truck is a basher not a racer. It has a full roll cage, rpm A-arms, rpm bumpers, Aluminum turn buckles. I have a couple of sets of great bash tires too depending on the terrain I was running. JR radio, stock servos (never thought the money was worth upgrading cause the stockers never gave me any trouble at all.)
I've ran this thing in the mud, snow, gravel, pavement, grass and anywhere you can imagine.
I even used to have a 3' tall ramp I would use to do backflips over my shed ;)
Front and rear diffs were recently rebuilt along with axle seals and bearings. Still have about 3/4 of a gallon of the Traxxas 33% nitro. Which is all I have ran through this motor. Prolly got a total of 3/4 gallon on the O.S. Once this thing is tuned you dont have to touch the needles till winter. Seriously.

I have tons of spares and extras depending on the interest. Also have a three ring binder with all the exploded views printed out 11x17, along with the original manual and the manual for the radio all in there for convenience.
Check out the pics and email me with questions. I'll get back to you ASAP."

America's best shooters keep choosing Kimber. Legendary LAPD™ SWAT tested five major 1911 brands and chose Kimber. United States Marines assigned to Special Operations Command chose Kimber. The U.S.A. Shooting Rapid Fire Pistol Team trains for Olympic competition with a Kimber. Most recently, LAPD™ SIS transitioned to Kimber. They all chose Kimber for the same reason: quality, dependability and accuracy. So should you.


Kimber builds the world's finest 1911 pistols right here in America—something that makes sense, as few things are as American as a 1911 .45 ACP. Virtually every critical component of every pistol is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. The finest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards

 4-16x30mm Millett illuminated reticle scope with Warne mounts and receiver rail. You can count the moon's pimples with that scope. Got a better or smaller scope in mind? I also have a second Gamestalker one piece mount for a 1"" scope.
The factory trigger has been professionally tuned, and breaks at 3.5 lbs, doesn't have even a hit of-creep, or over travel. It's as crisp as a cold apple.

If you're looking at this ad you probably already know the specifics of the safe. I couldn't be happier with it but I'm moving out of state. I sold my collection now it's time to sell the safe. It has two dehumidifier rods installed to keep the contents dry and rust free.

This price includes delivery and installation at your location within a 30 mile radius of Avon Lake. It will be installed by a company that has installed over a thousand of these safes.

This is from a pet free, smoke free, child free home. That 
 it won't smell like smoke, or have pet hair or urine on it or have had a child playing with the the electronic lock mechanism. 

Please no lowball offers and please don't ask me what my bottom price is, make me your best offer. If you want to move it I can lower the price to $1950. That's about $1000 cheaper than if you were to buy it from Gander Mountain and have it installed.

http://www.cabelas.com - ProVault Safes by Liberty
Store your firearms and valuables with confidence and peace of mind in a ProVault Safe by Liberty. Heavy-duty, two-piece door and body construction is six times stronger than competing designs. There are no seams exposed to potential prying attacks. Extra-hard plate protects the lock mechanism from drilling and punching. Ten 4"" military-style locking bars provide stronger security in the door’s four corners. Break-resistant lock-down hinges are stronger than traditional welded hinges. A dual-action stabilizer in the locking system ensures the locking bars engage evenly and consistently. The Suretight handle is outfitted with a slip clutch so no matter how much a would-be thief tries to torque the handle with a pipe, it will protect the locking mechanism by slipping. Fire protection rating is 30 minutes at 1,200°F. The 1"" composite fire door is outfitted with a Palusol® door seal that expands up to seven times when exposed to high heat in order to protect safe contents. The door opens 180° for convenient access to safe contents, and extra shelving allows for storage of both firearms and accessories or valuables. New S&G locks. Lifetime warranty on safe (fire or attempted break-in) and locking mechanism. Lock and paint has a 5-year warranty."
