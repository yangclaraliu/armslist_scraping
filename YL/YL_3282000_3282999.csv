Here is a Romanian contract Model 1934 Beretta military pistol assembled in 1941, as indicated by the markings on the left side of the slide, and with two original WWII Beretta magazines. The back of the right side of the frame displays Romanian armory mark, ""CM"". 
NO import markings!
CONDITION: Excellent, with 97-98% of original blue still on the metal. All matching serial numbers (frame, slide, barrel). Fine bore with strong and shiny rifling. Very smooth action. Difficult to find pistol without the import marks! Caliber: 9 mm Short (.380 ACP, marked on barrel). Two WWII Beretta magazines with thin metal floor plates and no other markings, both in like new condition (as is the pistol!).

This Beretta model 1934 pistol offered here was manufactured for the Romanian military in 1941. In August of 1940, the Romanian military placed a contract with Beretta for 61,000 model 1934 pistols. This contract specified that the pistols were to be delivered within seven months. The first of these pistols was not delivered until February of 1941 due to the shortage of steel and Romania's failure to send Beretta the entire fund amount for the pistols. Beginning in February of 1941, Beretta delivered 10,000 pistols with the promise of 5,000 more per month until the total contract was filled. By August of 1941, Beretta had sent a total of 40,000 pistols, but the remaining 21,000 were never delivered. This means that there are less then 40,000 of these pistols in existence today. The first of these Romanian contract pistols can be identified with a 0(zero) at the beginning of the 5 digit serial number. The Romanian contract pistols are identical to the Italian model 1934 versions except that the slide is marked 9 SCURT instead of 9mm Corto as seen in the pictures below. These Romanian model 1934 pistols were normally issued to the Romanian officers 
during WW2.

This was my back up hog killer, less than 30 rounds have been through it. There are normal holster rub signs on the bluing but not very noticeable from a few feet away as you can see from the pics, there is NO RUST OR PITTING. Only real signs are on the front sight and the hammer and if you polish the hammer I believe it would look good as new. I would rate this cosmetically an 9 out of 10. This is my personal weapon so no extra fee's apply, I will ship for a fee or you can come to Carthage Texas to pick up. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me directly. I also have a Tikka T3, and a Browning 40th anniversary Silver hunter NWTF .12 gauge semi auto ONLY 1,000 were ever made

RPB (which has been rumored to stand for Rape, Pillage, and Burn... but actually stands for the initials of the company founders) manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made, most were stamped ""sM10"" but a very few were made with the model stamped as ""sapM10"" (an abbreviation for semi auto pistol) These few are the only open bolt M10's which are not banned as assault weapons by the state of CA. This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol. 

In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow (miraculously, I still don't know how he pulled it off) was able to get the BATFE to approve it as a Title 1 firearm i.e. a 'Regular' gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of buisness in 1978. 

The period of manufacture was short lived however as in 1982 - the BATFE reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns).... 

These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again. 

In case you don't believe that there is any way this can be legal please read the text of the ATF decision rule 82-2 which banned any more of these from being made but allowed the ones already in circulation to be grandfathered. 

This is sold as a unique collectible pistol, you are responsible for complying with all state and federal laws (i.e. don't do anything illegal with it, to it, around it. Don't think illegal thoughts, don't contemplate any hypothetical, don't ask any STUPID questions, and don't discuss anything nefarious even as a joke...)"

Ruger 4191 Red Label Over/ Under 12 Gauge Shotgun, 28 Inch Barrel, 3 Inch Chamber, American Walnut Stock
Back and better than ever, the NEW Ruger® Red Label over-and-under shotgun represents American gunmaking at its finest. Known for years as a top choice of American hunters and clay shooters for its world-renowned rugged construction and handsome American styling – the Red Label returns. Newly redesigned, the shotgun now features refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil, making it lively in the hand and even more pleasurable to shoot. These improvements make the new Red Label shotgun the perfect choice for hunting upland game, waterfowling, sporting clays, skeet or even just informal clay target shooting with family. Built by American workers in American factories, the Ruger® Red Label shotgun is another 100% American-made product from Ruger.
Features:
*Automatic, two-position tang safety/barrel selector provides instant visibility and accessibility.
*Finely polished, stainless steel receiver is corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws.
*Reliable, single mechanical trigger that allows for firing the second barrel without recocking and features rebounding hammers for easy opening.
*Sleek, compact locking system is considered to be among the strongest ever built for over-and-under shotguns.
*Precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged barrels made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel feature 2″ forcing cones and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more uniform patterns.
*1/4″ dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib with brass bead front sight is stress relieved, contour-grounded, precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished monoblock.
*Beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American Walnut stock features a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr® buttpad is mounted on the 14.5″ length of pull stock, which features a 1.5″ drop at the comb and a 2.5″ drop at the heel.
*Five steel-shot compatible, screw-in Briley® chokes and wrench included, featuring two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one improved cylinder choke, plus a premium-quality Briley® choke tube wrench.
*Also includes: custom molded, semi-soft case; safety lock.

This is the newest rifle from SIG Sauer, introduced at Shot Show this year and serves as the latest generation of their 556 line of rifles. Completely ambidextrous and capable of converting to 7.62x39 with only a few interchangeable parts. I encourage you to check out the video ad SIG put out of the rifle for a better description if you haven't already seen it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdTuJ27vEeQ

I purchased the rifle new a few months ago and have put about 200 rounds down the barrel. Very accurate, easy to operate, and reliable.

Uses a 16 inch barrel w/ 1/7 twist
Swiss style folding stock w/ removable cheek riser
Folding back up iron sights
Uses standard AR/M16 GI mags
Gas piston operation--feels like a perfect marriage of the best of AR and AK attributes.

The rifle has been meticulously maintained, cleaned immediately after leaving the range and kept in a safe. The deal will include the original box, 1 magazine (negotiable based on the deal), single point sling--everything it originally came with. Let me know if you have any questions!

Desert Eagle XIX 44mag is an amazing firearm, as long as you shoot 240gr brass loaded rounds. also NO cast loaded rounds, due to the polygonal rifling and the gas system can get lead fouling. FMJ or jacketed softpoints are fine. has around 50 rounds through.

Trades just offer, worst i can say is no. with that in mind be realistic on your trade. im very easy to deal with and will respond politely.

Put about 500 rounds through it, no jams. Only problems I can find is the stick mag needs the feed lips filed down a bit(typical problem with these GI stick mags) and the pistol grip is slightly loose(if you tighten the grip too tight, the trigger won't function). Drum mag functions fine and is very fun to shoot with. The plastic rear peep sight has something broke on it... Not 100% sure, as I don't use this sight, I just use the iron sights or shoot from the hip(as this thing is ridiculously heavy).

Paid $1599 for it new about 6 months back. I just don't take it out often enough and would like to see it go to someone who would put it to good use."

Caliber:  .357 Mag. 
Barrel Length:  6 inch 
Capacity:  6 

Taurus Model 66 chambered in .357 Magnum, which of course will also shoot 38 Special ammo. This pistol has seen very little use & is in mint condition, 98 or 99%. 6” barrel with a solid serrated rib, adjustable rear sight, ramp front & it has an ejector rod housing. Case colored wide grooved trigger & a checkered target hammer both boasting strong colors. The blue shows no wear & shines brightly with the only flaw being a slight cylinder ring & a very small handling mark at the muzzle. It is deep & rich, bright & shiny. The wood grips are checkered with nice grain & finish & the checkering is still razor sharp. Mechanically like new as is the bore, the past owner claims to have only fired a box or so through it. This is built on a medium sized frame & looks just like a Smith & Wesson. It is well balanced, nice trigger pull, is dead accurate & a pleasure to shoot as a single action or double action. A nice revolver that can shoot the powerful .357 magnum round or the inexpensive .38 Special. Nothing to explain away, it is as new as a used pistol can get & it is hard to beat the Taurus Lifetime warrantee. Thanks for looking & please see my other auctions for more pistols & a wide variety of other great firearms. Taurus Model 66, 6"" barrel .357 Great condition, Production Year 1988 Model 66 / special 6"" barrel. Model Is HG-M66-B6 This is a beauty. No California sales. No Warranty either expressed or implied. I accept Postal money orders. Any questions, Please call Mark REDACTED."

Last time I took out shooting, it was awesome... shot it out to 400 yds on a 16"" gong, rung it every time.

It started life as a 16"" CMMG complete upper, I had a smith put on a 12"" Daniel Defense FSP rail. It's my favorite rail, great thin profile and weight. Totally solid, and long so you can mount flashlights out near the barrel without burning yourself. I have a troy folding sight on it, and it should still be zeroed. I've got the original BCG and a BCM gunfighter charging handle. Amazing package, and the price is awesome. There's been about 1000 rounds through this upper, but with the mil-spec chrome lined barrel, chamber, and milspec bcg, it's good for probably 10k more rounds. I've always been very careful about cleaning… much more than my present gun. It's never been put back in the safe without a bore clean and a cleaning.

It's presently painted in a krylon multicoat scheme that uses the same shades as multicam.

If you want, I can throw in a vertical grip or magpul AFG, if that's your thing. I've got rail covers and all that too if you want."

An excellent all steel Tokarev style pistol from Serbia imported by Century Arms International. It is designed from the factory with a modern manual slide mounted safety much like the ones found on the Berettas that effectively blocks the firing pin and hammer making it effective for carrying ""cocked and locked"" and drop safe so long as the safety is on. Not the cheaply added import trigger safeties like on the other Tokarev variants. Very simple and effective design. Has a 1911/Browning feel to it. The gun is very slim and easy to carry despite weighing 2lbs. I love it but I need to sell it to fund a newer style gun that I will use for my personal carry. Capacity is 9+1.

I have shot 400 rounds through it since purchasing it new 3 months ago without a single hiccup. Mostly cheap Tulammo and Winchester white box as well as Sig Sauer hollow points. It will eat up any ammo! Shoots pretty darn accurate once you figure out the grip. The pistol feels great in your hand.

The gun is used so it shows light wear in some places. Most notably some of the bluing is starting to come off by the palm grip but not much and I've since added on a rubber hogue grip that has drastically improved the grip and feel of the gun as well as protecting that area from the wear of your palm.

Comes with:
THREE 9 round mags
Kydex IWB holster for conceal carry. Great and comfy. Evenly distributes weight along your belt so the gun feels very light.
OWB holster that has a pocket for an extra mag.
Original box


$240 takes all. Cash only. No shipping. No trades. Price is FIRM. Lower offers will be ignored. Can meet anywhere in Saint Paul after 4:30pm...Or we can meet at Bill's in Robbinsdale after rush hour. MUST SHOW A VALID PERMIT TO PURCHASE/CARRY & ID TO PURCHASE. Thanks for looking!

This thing is just too tacticool for me. I'm a humble man, I like humble things. AK's for example. A fine Jewish space gun like this jut isn't on my level. It's high speed/low drag, I'm low speed/high drag.
That being said, it's fun to shoot, but the layout takes a little getting used to if you aren't familiar with bullpups. Handles extremely well though. Sort of like having and SBR without the paperwork.
This is the ""IDF"" model, which means it came with a better set of BUIS's. The front one has a tritium insert. Also comes with a Mepro 21 mounted, like the IDF intended. Oh, and did I mention the Mepro also has a cozy little sock you can put on it when you aren't shooting turrists? WELL IT FREAKING DOES. FOR NO EXTRA CHARGE.
Couple mags, cleaning kit/tool pouch, box, papers, etc. Personally put about 200 rounds down the pipe. Don't know how many pieces of paper the former owner blasted, but it doesn't look like it's been rode hard. Looks pretty new, really.
I'd like to get $1900 cash or trade. Partial trades are fine."

Also included is 3 magazines 2 of which are Tapco and the other one is the standard one it comes with, and a Drago Double rifle case ($70 value before tax). I will point out that you can buy the same rifle in Prescott in J&G Sales for $529.99 right now but that's not including tax which comes out to about $579.99 and the price of gas to go to Prescott and get it and that's with one magazine and no case. There is the option of having it shipped to you from J&G's to a closer gun shop and with the tax, $30 to ship it, and $30 for the FFL transfer fee, and that comes out to about $640 and again that's with one magazine and no case. I originally paid $599.99 for it at J&G Sales but I did have to pay the FFL transfer and also the shipping cost and it came out to just under $700 and that was with one magazine and no case. I will be losing $80 in the deal so my loss is your gain. I don't need the money I just want to buy another AK with the money. If interested email me or text only Alex REDACTED. More pictures upon request.

The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Product Specifications:

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Product Specifications:

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Product Specifications:

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty.
