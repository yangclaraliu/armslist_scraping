It was my last hurrah at trying to love 1911's but they just don't do it for me. Now it needs a new home. I'm not the first owner, but when I got it the gun looked like it only had maybe 100 rounds through it. I've put 3 mags through it and then put it in the safe. It's in excellent condition, not a scratch on it. Gun was made in 2016 I believe, and the night sights are still very bright.Comes with 2 mags and the box.Asking $800 for this. This is a great deal for a great gun. Cash is king so I can put it towards an X95, but willing to consider all FAIR trade offers too. Just please no .40's, bolt actions, black powder, AR-15's, 1911's, or shotguns. I'd love a Glock 40, Kel-Tec RDB, PS-90, CZ Scorpion, or FN Five-Seven, but let me know what you have! I can add cash for anything valued more than mine. Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but not too far. Face to face only, must be 18+ with a Purchase Permit or a CPL.

Condition is excellent and the cold hammer-forged Barrel is NEW. It comes complete with the rifles original Arsenal technicians log book military issue leather ammo pouches cleaning kit in the butt stock and the brass oil container in Leather Pouch. More importantly I had Murray's Gunsmithing install their best SS firing pin which includes reaming the firing pin shaft and refacing the bolt. This firing pin is much better than the stock firing pin and it eliminates the potential problem of the slam Fire or the firing pin sticking in the strike position which can make the rifle fire uncontrollably automatic emptying out your entire magazine. That had cost me $70. Also bought a flash hider to replace the launcher nozzle. Included will be the extra flash hider and the original firing pin. this one came from classic firearms back when they first got these in and I ordered it hand-picked with the guarantee of the inclusion of the original Arsenal log it is truly near new condition. If you order from classic nowadays it is a crapshoot as to what you will get. with this one you know what you are getting. Open to honest quality trades 600 invested 450 cash or tradeReply by call or text is best REDACTED

No exceptions. I purchased it legally, possessed it legally, I’m not going to commit a crime selling it.***The next person who inquires with a request for me to circumvent the law will be turned in to local law enforcement and perhaps even lured into a trap if law enforcement is interested. If your a criminal don’t message me for any reason !, thanks.You will have to be able to legally purchase a firearm to buy this weapon through one of the above mentioned methods. I'm Firm on my price of $400.00 and you pay your own transfer fee if an ATF4473 form is filed, I paid $720 for the weapon new 5.5-6 years ago from Gun Connection in Rochester, Indiana. It's sat in a safe most of that time, I ordered it from Glock, the test casing was dated literally about 32 days prior to me receiving the weapon. I did take it to the range a couple times, it's had about 200 rounds through it. It has Glock brand green iridium lit night sights (they just glow green all the time), Glock brand extended pieces throughout (slide lock, and slide and mag releases) as well as the factory pieces included too, has a set of Lone Wolf maritime spring cups installed and the factory Glock cups included. It's a real nice clean package, everything from Glock and then some.I would travel within a 30 mile radius or so.I would prefer Rochester/Winimac area, but would travel to Logansport, Plymouth, maybe Kokomo. My price is firm, I don't want trades of any kind, if the listing is still active, the weapon is still available. Thank you for your interest."

This is a build that we tried putting together that works and operates great. The pistol started out as a Smith & Wesson M&P 2.0 9mm with no thumb safety. The top was removed and a Smith & Wesson Performance Center 9mm 5"" slide and barrel was added. This upper slide has raised sights and has the cutout and mounts to add your choice of reflex optic. This does come with several mounting plates that are not pictured. The mounting plates are the ones offered with the Core Slide from Smith & Wesson. The slide is 5"" and ported as pictured. The slide stop release was replaced with one that works with the Gen 1 slide as pictured. This is a great looking pistol and is one that you can not buy from Smith and Wesson, soon Smith will meet the demands but so far this is the only way to get a 5"" factory cut slide on an M&P 2.0.

My Dad purchased the gun new in the late '70s and gave it to me in 1986. I hunted pheasant with it twice and and at most have fired a couple of boxes of shells through it. The gun is in excellent condition. It does have one very small scratch on the lower left side of the butt stock that is about 1/2 inch long and does not appear to penetrate the clear coat. It is barely visible if you look very closely at the first photo. Probably from shifting it around in the gun safe over time.Otherwise the gun is like new. It has fixed choke barrels, MOD and IMP.I am not the greatest of photographers so please inquire with any questions you may have. I want it to go to a good home and I simply need to clear out a few guns that I really don't use."

They were later presented to officials and employees of the company. There may have been only one batch of these pistols totaling less than 150 in number....This ERRS gun is 100% Original and Authentic. This one is in excellent condition, you can tell it was special to someone. I would say not hardly used or fired much. These ERRS guns being experimental in design there was not a standard specification for the parts and finish. Anything went and some even seem to have been made from odds and ends of parts. I have seen many of these guns and seems like small groups of them are similar and those groups greatly differ from the other groups. I would say the one seen the most is the Parkerized finish and some or all Parkerized small parts....like this one. Slide and Frame are exact same in color despite what the pics might show. Parkerized guns are a bit*h to photograph....None of the other ERRS guns had Govt acceptance proofs (like this one) or markings of any kind on the frame except the serial number and a ""P"" on the left front trigger guard....of which I have seen three with the P and found a picture of one with P on the internet that belonged to the Rem Rand chief inspector Peter D. Strolis, he had serial 45. I have several pics of up close serial numbers from other ERRS guns, other ERRS gun pics and a few websites with some info....if you are serious about buying I would be more then happy to send that stuff to you. On the note of Serial number pics I have....One thing I find interesting is the NO prefix at serial...the O on all the ERRS guns I've seen seems to be sized odd, different then standard production, It's almost looks like they used a Zero instead of letter O, and they are all like that. Here is one link from coolgunsite.com which is widely respected in 1911a1's....it mentions that Several of these pistols were found in a Remington Rand vault in Buffalo NY in the early 1960's. These ERRS and EXP pistols are highly prized by collectors..... http://www.coolgunsite.com/images/1911/1943%20errs%2061%20rr/remington_rand_errs.htm......This ERRS gun is very clean, one thing pretty common when they were given to Rem Rand employees is that they would engrave their initials on the gun, usually above the serial number (I've seen 3 like that and have pics of a couple), but this one has it engraved on the front left of slide....the initials in cursive ""LA"". You hardly notice they there-see pics. Has Mint High Standard barrel, Early Keyes Fiber Co. grips without screw reinforcement ring, Comes with Mint General Shaver mag with ""G"" on toe...This gun is in the Extremely Rare category, They do not come around very often...Don't miss your chance here, I know this will be going to a Hardcore Collector and whom ever you might be....I tip my hat to you! I don't really want to sell it..."

Quality made early year custom designed steel blade unlike many from Mexico.  Blade is thick, hand-forged carbon steel of surprising quality, hand engraved on both sides. One side exclaiming a warning to anyone who steals from another this knife will exact vengeance upon them and or leave them naked something like that. Spanish friend had a hard time translating it back to me in literal English.Blade is very sharp and has a long false edge along its clipped-point tip but that false edge is NOT sharp, so this knife would be legal for import into Australia or New Zealand.  The Deer Hoof Handle surprisingly is very tough, tougher than I would have expected by it's looks. Some of the hoof shell is missing on one side but does not weaken it at all.
Deer hoof has a large, cast aluminum cross-quillon and pommeled with a plate of aluminum underneath, held in place with four brass rivets.  The knife is approximately 14"" long with an 8"" blade that is 3/16"" thick.
Thanks!"
