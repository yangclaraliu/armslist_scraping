This rifle if just plain FUN to shoot and in the two times I’ve taken it to the range it always was had a huge interest factor. Frankly, I don’t want to sell it but I’m pursuing a Master of Divinity seminary degree and cash flowing it and I need the funds a lot more than I need this rifle.  I’d conservatively place this gun at 99-100% and if I hadn’t put some rounds through it there is no question it would be 100%. I’ve had it to the range twice and have put less than 100 rounds through it.  Per BB, MSRP on this model was $2,779.  In the condition it is in I’m asking $2,100 (which is well below BB value for one in this condition. I will include 4 magazines with the rifle.
Serious inquires only please. With a day or two notice I can meet you almost anywhere for the exchange.
Thank you for your interest…pictures will be added shortly!"

It comes in both the factory cardboard box and hard case with four 13 round factory magazines and all paperwork. This is the Compact model 92 with a barrel ¾” shorter than a full size 92 The grip is also just a bit shorter and while still not a tiny handgun it is a lot easier to hide than a full size model 92. Mechanical condition is excellent with an excellent bore. Very little internal wear means very few rounds have been fired. Cosmetic Condition: The gun looks great. There is some slight wear on the front edges of the slide from a holster but that’s all I see. It’s a good looking pistol that retains at least 95 % original black finish. These compact model 92’s have always sold well here in the store. They are a little easier to conceal but shoot just as well as the full size 92. Good luck.If you have questions please feel free to write or call.Shipping is $30.00 inside the continental U.S. to your FFL. Credit cards add 3%.

I’ve had it to the range twice and have put less than 100 rounds through it.Per BB, MSRP on this model was $2,779.  Based on its condition it is in I’m asking $2,100 (which is well below BB value for one in this condition). I will include 4 magazines with the rifle.

It fits just fine in a kydex glock 19 holster I have.  Comes with box, two magazines, additional backstraps, lock, manuals/warranty, and brush.  I'd call it NIB but I shot 30 rounds through it.  You are not buying some heavily used gun that has been through hell and back.  It's a freaking new gun people.  I put 30 rounds downrange, cleaned it and put it in my safe where it's been sitting while I wait for a buyer.  Gun functioned beautifully, no failures.  I paid $510 after shipping and another $20 for FFL transfer $530 total.  I'll sell it for $470 in person.  I don't want to have to deal with shipping the thing.  If you have a concealed carry license I'll drop the price to $460, just because I feel safer dealing with someone that has gone through all the training and fingerprinting and what not.  Transaction will follow all necessary laws for private sale.  Sorry, doesn't come with the weapon light in the picture!  Just comes stock how you get it from the factory.  Please don't contact me with trade offers.  I'm trying to thin out my collection, not add to it."
