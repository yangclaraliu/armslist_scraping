I also have some gear and clothing I no longer have a need for that consists of a 5.11 Tactical Concealed Carry Shirt size 3x(fits me snug and I'm a 2x), a pair of 5.11 Tactical Speed 2.0 Side Zip Boots, and a set of Kryptek Typhon camo pattern BDU's for a 2X. I will ship any item out of state but I will only take payment via a Postal Money Order as it is the safest method for all parties involved. I no longer need or want any of these items and supporting my family is more important as a whole. Regarding the firearms, the Baby Luger is in excellent shape both internal and external. I do not have a box or manual for it as it was something I inherited when my grandfather passed away. I personally have a belief that I will not own a gun I do not shoot or do not enjoy shooting and that happens to fall into that group for me. I wont even try to hide it, loading the magazine is a pain in my hands and it is not enjoyable. It does fire and function quite well however but I dont like the idea of Safe Queens. I'm asking for $700The MechTech is an upper for a Glock 20/21 lower frame, it is compatible with a Gen 3 or Gen 4 frame. It is not considered a firearm under law and can be shipped to your front door. I have all the original paperwork for it, owners manual, and it is coming with a SeeAll Fiber Optic sight to which I have the original box for and manual for it too. The upper functions perfectly fine, I however recently parted with my Glock 20 in favor of other things but still have it sitting around. I'm seeking $500 for it, to which I have the original invoice for this upper and by itself after tax and shipping was over $550 and the optic was originally around the $100 range so the value is there. Lastly there is the Carcano M41 rifle. I had bought this last tax season as a project rifle as I collect old Italian mil-surps among other things. When I recieved it, it was missing a butt plate and still is as I have no found the time or money I thought I'd have to dedicate to restoring this rifle. I have taken it shooting and with it's fixed sight system it can shoot 3 inch groups at 50 yards using improperly sized PPU 6.5 Carcano ammunition and out to 100 about a 2 1/4 inch group with properly sized Carcano ammunition that is still widely available both on the surplus market and newly manufactured as well. Included with the rifle will be three 6 round en bloc clips and whatever stock of PPU 6.5 Carcano I have left which is around 60 rounds of ammunition. The finish in worn bad in many places, but internally everything is well and functional. As stated, it was intended to be a fixer upper project for me that never got off the ground, for the rifle plus everything I'm seeking $150.As for the clothing, for the 5.11 Boots I'm seeking $20, the CCW shirt, $10, and the Kryptek BDU's I'm seeking $40. The boots have been lightly used, the CCW shirt worn once or twice, and the BDU's have seen some use but are in good shape. I can send additional pictures of any of the items in question as Armslist will only allow 3 pictures per post. If you have any questions feel free to call or text Chris at REDACTED. I am not interested in trades at this time with few exceptions. If you wish to offer something for trade I will listen to it but I am not likely to accept so please keep that in mind. I absolutely do NOT want ANY AR's, AK's, or hunting rifles/shotguns and the likes as I have all those kinds of things already and am not looking to expand. If you wish to buy all the firearms mentioned together I will sell everything for $1200, if you wish to buy all the clothing items as well with it I will knock it down to $1,100. If you are out of state I will ship anything as mentioned however the price will be slightly different to factor in shipping and insurance on items. However for single item sales, the price listed is the final price so if you ask for a lower price or offer one, you will be ignored."

READ OUR FEED BACK AND BID WITH CONFIDENCE.The Lady Hawk was designed originally with the female shooter in mind but as the pistol reached the stores, we found that about 90% of the pistols were being purchased by men. The benefits of the Lady Hawk outweighed the fact that the words “Lady Hawk” were carved into the slide of the gun. As with all things, the Lady Hawk has evolved. The slide of the pistol is being ordered, again at the 90% rate, with no markings on the slide. It can come with or without the Lady Hawk markings, your call.Richard Heinie has been building custom 1911 handguns for more than 40 years. That’s long enough to learn how to do more than just turn a screw. He understood women and some men needed a 1911 that fit their hands and was devoid of sharp edges. So, he built one and now it’s available from Nighthawk, the Lady Hawk.Regardless of your gender, the Lady Hawk represents a level of elegance, grace, slender, and shooter comfort never before seen in a 1911. That’s why both women and men are drawn to it.FEATURES ON THE LADY HAWK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:Ambi.

The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Comes with 4 - 35rd mags and Bulldog Case."

Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.

I can also ship to your FFL or C&R by FedEx ground for $45 flat, lower 48 states only. She is a bit rough that's why I'm selling for less, but she's a great shooter... SAMCO Import. Matching bolt and receiver, electro-pencil matched magazine. The stock does not match.I am the first American owner and I have broken down and removed all cosmoline, including from the bolt. I have also function tested at the range, approx. 80 rounds non-corrosive ammo only. The bore is a little frosty and shows minor wear in the grooves and lands, but no major pitting is visible and the rifle is fairly accurate (will do 2-3 MOA). There is a little side to side play in the gas tube assembly, which not uncommon for Yugos. The action cycles flawlessly with factory ammo. The grenade launcher valve/shut off is also in excellent shape from being stored in cosmoline and will last you many years with proper care. The windage and elevation on this SKS are still adjustable with minimal effort.I have dated this SKS at 1968. It does have flip up night sights, which no longer glow. Based on the night sights and the hardwood stock, I believe this rifle went back to arsenal for refurb, possibly mid-1970’s. I sealed the stock using a satin poly to protect it from our Northwest weather. I will also throw in FREE: a spare firing pin ($10) two Yugo stripper clips ($10), a front sight tool made specifically for the Yugo ($10), and 2 x 7.62x39 snap caps ($5).Selling to fund other projects.

Serial numbers match on receiver, barrel, bolt, forend, rear sight leaf and nose cap. Magazine unnumbered, as is typical. The forend does have some dings. Buttstock has some repairs, has spent some time on the parade ground. The barrel has the WW2 green paint added, much of it intact from knox form to nose cap. No sold out of service marks. Do not see any civilian proof marks. Rifle is import marked. It is just a typical Mk.III*, but it has gone through 2 world wars and has some ""been there, done that"" character (I hope to look this good when I am 102 years old). Want $450, face-to-face Reno/Sparks/Carson City area. Would love to keep this rifle, but have bills to pay."
