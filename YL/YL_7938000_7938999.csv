Up for sale is a 9mm Browning Hi Power in immaculate condition. Manufactured in 1994, she sports a hard chrome frame and epoxy black slide. The only real wear on the gun is on the end of the slide, however she was never carried. Fired approximately 200 times, it has been taken care of by myself in typical obsessive compulsive fashion. Internals are spotless and you will not find a spec of rust anywhere on the gun. Fit and finish are superb and the gun has been 100% reliable. I got rid of the original pachmyer grips and got some hogue wrap arounds which really complement the ergonomics of the HP. It will come with original box and paperwork and two 13 round mags with the rubber base plates. In terms of trades I am interested in another Arsenal SAM7, gen5 Glock 17/19, select 1911s, M&P 2.0, or all-steel CZ pistols. Also would love a good fishing kayak. I can add cash for the right trade and would accept a trade + cash for a pistol of lesser value. I paid a bit more than my asking price, but regardless I am asking $800.00 cash. Feel free to PM or email me with questions or offers. Thank you in advance for your interest."

Modified choke barrel alone is worth $350A very nice example of a 1960’s era Belgian Browning A5. Includes two Belgian solid rib barrels. One barrel has been cut back to 25” and has Truglo slug sights installed. Originally choked: * (full choke) the bore now gauges at cylinder bore. The other measures just under 28” and is choked: ** (modified choke) and gauges as a tight modified. Both are chambered for 2 3/4” shells.The stock has not been cut down and retains it’s original LOP of 14 3/8” without the factory buttplate. With the recoil pad currently on the gun the LOP is 15 1/4”. I’m 6’ 3” and the gun fits me perfectly. Stock is the desirable blonde color, not salt wood, round knob, and in very nice shape.this gun has the later speed feed auto 5 shell lifter and cross bolt safety. Overall the gun retains 90%+ of its original blueing, and I would conservatively say it’s an 85% gun overall. It would grade higher if you could find an original buttplate for it. No rust, pitting, or anything but light scratches and a few dings in the wood. An excellent and soft shooting gun as well.$500 firm.

270,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7938270,For Sale:  NEW HK VP9 9mm $579,"3701 Franklin Ave, Waco, Texas",$ 579,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 11, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"NEW HK VP9 9mm $579
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

The standard by which all contemporary sidearms are measured, The SIG SAUER P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."

655,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7938655,For Sale:  NEW HK VP9SK 9mm $579,"3701 Franklin Ave, Waco, Texas",$ 579,"Listed On: Saturday, February 17, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"NEW HK VP9SK 9mm $579
The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design.
The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols.
A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.
VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available.
VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.
VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm.
VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And like full size VP pistols, the VP9SK is value priced at $719 (MSRP)."

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.
Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.
The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.
Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.
Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.
An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.
By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.
Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.
Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire."

This piece has been nicely refinished (rampant colt and proof marks still visible). There is some wear and tear in the form of thinned bluing and a little light surface corrosion in a couple of areas. There is a little play in the cylinder at full-cock. I have not fired this revolver, but the previous owner said he did without any problems. Research tells me this Colt (service number 21036) was shipped January 4, 1918 to Commanding Officer, Springfield, Armory (6,403 revolvers in shipment). These guns originally required the use of half-moon clips to hold and headspace the rimless 45ACP. This particular gun has steps machined into the cylinder so the 45ACP could be fired without the clips in an emergency. From what I learned, Colt did not start putting the steps in these guns until serial number 30400. That tells me the cylinder is not original to the gun but was probably changed over during the refinishing. All in all, a very nice piece of American history that can still be taken out and enjoyed."
