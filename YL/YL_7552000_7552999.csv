This is an NEF (formerly H&R Handi-Rifle) in .223/5.56 with a medium contour 22"" barrel. The rifle is equipped with an ejector and kicks the empty case out when the action is broken open , but the rifle can be converted to an extractor easily (egunparts and youtube are your friend). The rifle has a brand new Evolution Gun works (EGW) optics rail and sports a Choate survival stock which both the buttstock and forearm have storage compartments. Inside this buttstock I have included the EGW paperwork and allen wrench for the rail and two .223 snap caps. The rifle is in excellent mechanical condition and i would say it is very good cosmetically. This rifle is a hunting favorite and is no longer being manufactured and are getting hard to find so you will see that the price is great on this rifle, much less than  just barrels are selling for elsewhere. Please no trade offers. Let me know what firearm you are interested in as I have several active listings.Thanks, Kevin (843) 718- 9513"

Sig Sauer P938 Extreme
With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations."

This pistol is still in use with Spanish military and police and was actually in the running to replace the 1911 as the US military standard sidearm. It only lost the contract because it is heavier than the aluminum M9. These guns are solid as a tank and shoot like a dream.

For almost 20 years, Knight’s all-copper, Red Hot 50 Cal 300 Grain Muzzleloader Bullets by Barnes have been an industry standard for performance and accuracy. These black powder bullets provide superior expansion for maximum damage to the target.

They can deliver deadly performance at both high and low velocities. Red Hots can expand to twice their original diameter, creating six razor-sharp copper petals that slice through game. No fragmentation- these tough, deep-driving bullets provide massive shock to the target while typically retaining 100 percent of their original weight. Recommended for: Big to Light Skin Game

The only sound to be heard is your tires grabbing and pulling the pathway behind you. You twist the throttle further, and feel your stomach lurch in your ribcage. The electric hub motor provides a uniquely forceful acceleration, with an eerie lack of complaint, and with no exhaust trail behind you. Gaining speed on the incline, the forest air begins to make your eyes water. As you reach your destination at the top of the trail, you savor the moment. You are one with nature. The future is clean and silent, and you are in it. Not all Electric Fat Bikes are created equal. Bikes like the Sondors impress you with astonishingly low prices, but underwhelm, when it comes to performance. Likewise, you can spend thousands more for a Rambo or Haibike, only to discover that the battery range is not quite far enough for your needs. The Bullseye represents the culmination of our Electrical engineering prowess. As the third generation design, we believe we have perfected the Electric Fat Bike experience, and we think, once you have ridden it, you will agree.

Despite what you may have heard, the Remington 700 mount will NOT fit your Howa 1500 or Weatherby Vanguard. The bolt pattern is similar, but the remainder of the mount (ejection port, length, etc.) renders it useless on these two guns.The middle spread is the distance between the two middle holes, center to center, on your receiver.This mount is available in 0, 15 and 20 MOA. Please see our FAQ section for more information on action lengths and MOA.We recommend:0 MOA - if shooting 0-500 yards20 MOA - if shooting 500-1000 yardsPicatinny cross slots run the full length of the rail, which gives the shooter flexibility when mounting scope rings and other accessories. The channel in the center reduces the overall mass of the mount, weighing in at 2-3oz on average. Also, in many cases, it will not obstruct usage of factory iron sights. EGW’s one piece scope mounts are the obvious choice for hunters and tactical shooters alike.Add EGW’s Practical or HD Scope Rings to make it a complete overhaul!This mount is a Picatinny-style base and compatible with Picatinny or Weaver scope rings."

I ordered this pistol over the summer as a backup to another Seecamp 380 but it took several months to get to my FFL. By the time it got there I made up my mind that I didn't need another one so the Seecamp was taken out of the box, inspected and placed back in the box. I'm clearing out some space in the safe so the holsters will come with it as well. The bear creek holster could be listed as new as it was never used except to hold my other Seecamp when in the safe. The Desantis holster is in very good shape but has been used with another firearm. Price--- $6002) Seecamp 32 that is as new in box and has never been fired. I purchased it as a surprise for the wife but she has a hard time pulling the slide back and doesn't feel as comfortable with it like she does with an LCP. It has been taken out of the box, cleaned, inspected and has been sitting in the safe ever since. It has never left the house. I have a Seecamp 380 already and have no need for the 32 as well. It will come with a box of winchester white box and a box of Speer gold dots. It will also come with a Desantis superfly pocket holster and another Desantis pocket holster if the buyer wants it as well, both in very good condition. Price--- SOLDIf buyer wants both Seecamps and extras I will offer a discounted price.Not interested in any trades and not willing to ship at the moment I can send more pictures if needed"
