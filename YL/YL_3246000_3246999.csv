Full specs listed at the links below. I'll take $950 cash for it which is a steal for a 1911 of this quality and packed with this many features. The Tactical Custom ll has great reviews and are known to be highly accurate pistols that run perfectly right out of the box. It weights just 31 ounces which is even less than a S&W with the Scandium frame. Makes it nIce to carry, but the recoil is no different than on heavier 1911s I have shot. Only has a few hundred rounds through it so it is just broken in, and it runs flawless. If you are interested and serious, please reply with a phone number to contact you on. Price may be slightly negotiable for serious buyers but only in person and with cash in hand.

Comes with low profile night sights (that still glow like new), flared mag well, match grade barrel, match grade trigger, full length guide rod, match grade stainless steel barrel bushing, ambidextrous safety, front strap checkering, skeletonized hammer and trigger and more all straight from the factory on this high end model. 

The fit is awesome on this pistol and the trigger is super crisp. It also has the premium KIMPRO ll finish and has been upgraded with a Wilson Combat mag and VZ grips. I'm sure I am probably forgetting some things but all the details and specs are at the links provided below.

I have nine assorted mags with it, 4 Sig high caps, 2 Sig 10 rounders, and some various others. I will also throw in around 150 rounds of ammo... mostly target rounds, a few hollow points, all factory loads.

The pistol does have factory installed night sites, which are dim but still work. It also shows some holster wear from when it was my CCW, but the pistol is well cared for and in great shape and functions flawlessly. 

I am mainly interested in a nicer 22 rifle but would consider a 22mag as well. I would also be willing to add a little cash for a Stainless Ruger Scout or a nice PTR in 308.

This Chinese Norinco AK-47 came in from one of our local customers as a trade-in and is great condition. This pre-ban configuration AK-47 sports black polymer furniture which did not originally come on the NHM-91 rifles. All numbers match, metal is in excellent condition with just a few storage marks, and the both the bore and bluing are excellent. The rifle used to sport a bipod, but it has been removed (barrel collar still installed for future installation). Takes high-capacity, double-stack magazines and with the 20” heavy barrel would make an excellent long-range AK-47

It has been polished for that custom two tone look.  Slide is stainless steel. 
The grip is fully stippled to give it a real aggressive grip making it easier to hold on to. It  noticeably improved my accuracy. 

This gun is a true double action which makes it much better (in my opinion) for  ankle carry.  It has a long trigger pull like most pocket .380s but because it's a true double action if there is a misfire you can keep pulling the trigger on the same round until it goes off. I've never had it misfire but in an emergency situation you don't want to have to rack the slide to reset the firing pin before shooting again.  

I owned the Ruger LCP and I hated it. I love this gun and would trust my life with it over an lcp any day.  The biggest differences is the trigger pull, the double action,  slide lock, and safety. All these things make it a better gun.  

This gun has been my daily carry but has only seen a couple hundred rounds. And I clean it regularly. It shoots flawlessly and the laser functions well. 

Comes with two magazines. One has an extended tail piece so you can get all three figures on it.   Ankle holster  included. 

Also has a clip installed making it very easy to clip it on anything. I've even carried it in a pair of gym shorts. 

Looking for trade or cash.  Cash price is $380 FIRM. Buyer pays transfer.

During the War of 1812 fifteen year old American Schoolboys volunteered service and with the Hall Rifle successfully defended a bridge in 1814 during the Siege of Plattsburgh, repelling advancing British troops.

HISTORY:  This rifle was designed by John Harris Hall who was born in Portland, Maine on January 4, 1781.  He died at the age of 60 in Moberly, Missouri which is 933 miles to the west of Harpers Ferry.  Hall worked in his father's tannery until setting up his own woodworking and boat building shop in 1810 where he tinkered with guns in his spare time. He took an interest in firearms during militia service and focused on increasing the rapidity of loading.  On May 21, 1811, Hall patented a single shot, breech-loading rifle in collusion with Washington, D.C. architect, Dr. William Thornton.  

He began manufacturing his new rifles at the rate of 50 per year until the Ordnance Corps (United States Army) ordered 200 rifles in December 1814.  He regretfully turned down the contract because he was unable to meet the Army delivery deadline of 1815. Hall recognized individually fitted parts as the factor slowing rifle production, and adapted his breech-loading design to the “uniformity principle,” widely known as interchangeable parts.  Hall proposed the concept of interchangeable parts to the Army in June, 1816,[1] and earned a contract for 1,000 of the ""Model of 1819"" Hall rifles from the War Department with interchangeable parts being the chief condition.  To fulfill it, Hall spent more than five years (and $150,000 of government funds) at Harpers Ferry Arsenal, where he occupied an old sawmill on a small island in the Shenandoah River called Virginius Island. 

Hall's contract for 1,000 rifles was completed in 1825.  When a three-man committee deployed by the US Ordnance Department to verify Hall’s process in fulfilling his rifle contract visited Harpers Ferry, they were floored by his results, and especially the machines. They lauded Hall’s “system, in the manufacture of small arms, [as] entirely novel,” and one which could yield “the most beneficial results to the Country, especially, if carried into effect on a large scale”.[2]

A trial was devised to test the rate of fire of Hall's breech-loading rifles in comparison to muzzle loading rifles and Army-issue muzzle loading muskets. A company of 38 men were given 10 minutes to load and fire at targets 100 yards distant.   The company scored 164 HITS (33% of the 464 shots fired) with conventional muzzle-loading rifles, and 208 HITS (25% of the 845 shots fired) with the faster loading, but less accurate, army-issue smooth-bore muskets, in comparison to 430 HITS (36% of the 1198 shots fired) with Hall's rifles.[1]

Hall's rifle design worked so well as to undergo minimal change through the end of the Model 1819’s run in 1853.  By 1842, 23,500 rifles and 13,682 Hall-North carbines had been produced, most at Harper's ferry, earning Hall nearly $40,000 in royalty and patent-licensing fees. The men who had learned Hall's methods of interchangeable parts while working at Harper's Ferry (most notably Christian Sharps) went on to apply those methods to production of the Sharps rifles shoes, watches, clocks, bicycles, clothing, rubber goods, and, later, automobiles. 

As regards Christian Sharps a reference states:  Sharps accepted an entry level position at the Harpers Ferry Arsenal in the 1830s working as a filer. While at Harpers Ferry, Sharps was introduced to the Hall rifle, an early breech-loader, and worked for its inventor, Captain John H. Hall. Sharps also became versed in the manufacture of weapons with fully interchangeable parts.  Hall's methods transformed the United States from an economy of workshop craftsmen to a nation of industrialized mass production.

I have been sharpening my friends and families knives whenever they need them done and one of them suggested I do other peoples knives too.

So I am offering up my knife sharpening to anyone who wants a Wicked Edge put on their knives. I have done kitchen knives and lots of edc pocket knives.

 The Wicked Edge system allows me to reprofile knives to pretty much whatever degree bevel you want. It allows me to do 30-60 degree inclusive angle bevels (15 degree per side = 30 inclusive angle). I can take knives up to a mirror polish or leave a toothy edge on them, your choice.

If you want a crazy sharp knife just let me know. Price will vary depending on what you want done. For pocket knives doing a reprofile and taking them to a 1000 grit will be 10 dollars.

Incorporating new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability, the PMAG 10 provides next-generation performance for those needing lower profile magazines.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

 1896 - KRAG JORGESEN (30-40) A distinctive feature of the Krag-Jørgensen action was its magazine. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag-Jørgensen was integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, single cartridges were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.

This weapon has a pretty cool history. Was the issue sidearm to commanding officers of naval special warfare during the Vietnam war. Best I can find on my research is that this weapon was produced between '65 and '68'. Was primary issue for a California fire department inspector, carried twenty years for duty and then retired to a family member that just stored it before it was passed to me. 

No rust or metal degradation. I put 50 rounds of Winchester 9mm through last week with no issues at all. Fires true and straight and for it's age has a really nice feel and reset.

I hate it when I buy a gun off of armslist and it has problems the seller didn't tell me about. So as a service to you, here are any and all of the issues with this gun. 

The frame and slide is scratched and nicked from regular use, not a brand new gun. I've fired over 600 rounds through it, so again not a new gun. I've only used this one mag the whole time I've had this piece, so it no longer locks back on the last round. You'll need to probably buy a new mag to fix that. This has no decocker like the newer PT-92s. This doesn't suggest better quality like a pre-lock Smith and Wesson, this just means that you don't have a decocking option. 

Good things about the gun.

The slide and action is buttery smooth and well broken in. Excellent DA/SA trigger, clean 5~6 lbs break in SA and a smooth DA pull. The bullets go where the sights are, at 15 yds you'll hit what you're aiming at. This thing will eat everything you feed it. Match grade ammo, steel cased ammo, JHP, the gun doesn't care. The mechanism and barrel are in good condition and this gun still has plenty of life in it. Mags and parts are easy to find. Many parts interchange with the Beretta 92fs.

I have put many hours and $100's into this Polaris and am at the point that I have no more time or money to spend so my loss is your gain. 

Currently is not mobile. Has good compression, spark and gas to the carb, but not getting gas to the spark plug, from what I have read it is either a carb issue or the timing is off. Also needs 1 front shock. Has lots of new parts and paint. I was told it ran last fall up until they shut it off when the a-arm broke causing the front end repairs I've been doing. I bought it from a friends dad who said it ran fine. 

Brand New Parts: 
Front brakes pads
Right side outer tie rod end 
Vacuum lines 
Carb floats
Scott handle bar grips (blue and grey to match)
Right side CV boot 
Rubber carb Mounting Flange between the carb and engine
Misc. bolts and nuts  

Replaced the outer clutch shroud (previous had a crack and hole)

Has a 2000 lb electric winch

The front wheels are painted inside and out to match the 4 wheeler as well as some side parts and some of the frame has been touched up. Both front wheels and tires are here, 1 is off the 4 wheeler right now. The back tires have very low miles, still have the rubber tits on them.

Bad (besides the no start listed above):
Needs a battery (old battery is in 4 wheeler) and front shock (have the old shock, but is blown out). The rear brakes do not work (caliper is frozen, but front work great and are new) Seat is taped up and does not secure down.

948,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3246948,For Sale:  Armalite AR-180A,"Centralia, Southwest Washington, Washington","$ 1,200","Listed On: Saturday, July 5, 2014",Rifles,Armalite                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"1960s Sterling England AR-180A (Yes, original A, not B) Manufactured in Costa Mesa, California. 

Rifle is all original with adjustable carrying strap; chambered in .223. Fits 21 rounds: 20 round mag + 1 in the chamber. Rifle has quick-detach scope and a folding stock. Full length: 38 1/4 inches, folded length: 28 7/8 inches. Trigger pull is military style, hard and solid, feels natural even when you have only fired it once or twice (Have had several buddies and the girlfriend fire it). Charging handle is on the RIGHT, not centered.

Scope is original Japan licenses Armalite, quick-detach, 20 mm, 2.75x optical zoom with blank cross hair (no hashmarks). It has a top turret with a regular side adjustment (Not technically turreted). Scope has an aperture below it allowing for use of iron sights when it is attached. When we meet in person I will demonstrate all working actions this rifle has. 

Here's how I figured the price. Standard new AR style rifle currently sells for anywhere from $800-$1000 at Cabelas. This is older, but it has a lot of historic value being one of the first AR-180A Pre-Patent rifles from the Costa Mesa Facility. The scope is an easy $300-$400 because it is a quick-detach (It literally takes about 2-3 seconds to detach and re-attach) with an iron sight space.

Email or call (Not text) Jon at 36o-88o-4435. Will meet only in a public place (Chehalis Wal-Mart?). To buy this firearm, I require a valid WA State Driver's License or proof of state residency."
