It's in perfect condition and has every single thing you see in the pictures that is going with it.  I'm including my gun magnet too.  It can be screwed underneath a table etc. that you can slap your gun up onto.It has two 19 (+1) magazines.There's not much else to say about it, it comes with everything you see in the picture you can Google this particular gun, and it's basically brand-new and was purchased from a gun shop locally here in Wilmington.Ok! I didn't know I can only upload one picture and I have about 20 on my phone. So everything that you read below in the review about it is what I have in the case. Everything is in perfect condition. It comes with 2 magazines, a padlock for the case, the owner’s manual and a barrel cleaning brush. It also comes with three interchangeable backstraps for different sized hands, a magazine pouch. It also has a polymer holster.REVIEW:Springfield is back with a brand new dance called the XD(M) Compact 3.8 9mm pistol. Why the 3.8 designation? That’s the barrel length. They kept it short with concealed carry specifically in mind. It’s a polymer-framed pistol, which keeps the weight down to a respectable 27.5 ounces. Sounds like any other 9mm, eh? Read on, because this baby has a couple cool tricks up its sleeve. For starters, the 3.8 is shipped from the factory in a nice polymer box with a foam interior. Inside, there are pre-cut locations for everything that comes with the pistol. Aside from the gun itself, included in the case are no less than three magazines, a padlock for the case, the owner’s manual and a barrel cleaning brush. It also comes with three interchangeable backstraps for different sized hands, a magazine pouch and finally, a polymer holster for the 3.8. Oh, the magazines. The 3.8 features two different sized magazines: a 13- and 19-round mag. It is, however, specifically designed as a compact gun and fits best with the short magazine. And, just as you may have figured, the 19-round magazine sticks out of the butt a bit more, of course. Either way you go, both magazines have a polymer collar that extends out making it a bit easier to grip. Another trick in the 3.8’s bag is the new and different grip safety. There is a special pad on the grip that must be held firmly before the slide will even rack. The 3.8 is serious about not being fired until the shooter actually decides it’s going to be. Aside from the grip safety, it also features an articulated trigger safety like you’d find on Glock pistols of the same ilk.  The 3.8 is meant to be taken down and cleaned in a hurry, too. One only has to remove the magazine and lock the slide to the rear, and then turn a special take down lever before releasing the slide lock and easing it off the frame. From there, the barrel and recoil spring simply lift out. I really liked that feature because some guns are rather tough to break down for a field cleaning. The serrations on the slide are pretty aggressive, too, which facilitates chambering a bullet with gloves on or when your hands are sweaty on a particularly hot day. At around $700 and with all the accessories and options the pistol comes with, it’s priced very reasonably."

(it's a shotgun cut down you don't need a front sight or install a $5 at Walmart if you wanna shoot slugs.) Shoots great. Great truck gun with armory steel barrel. Meridian arms.Forearm was made for gun and JB welded/super glued to barrel so doesn't come off to be able to take the shotgun barrel off unless you trim some of the rear forend off which would be simple if someone wanted it apart, But in my opinion solid would be much better. Break open single shot very reliable and there the best for home defense because of that as you know it will go off when you pull the trigger and easy to reload quick if needed. Feels good in the hands. Just a cheap gun to tear up and play with. only $80 cash today.Pick up in Utica or Newark"

I won this at the Mammoth Sniper Challenge, but I already have a tripod setup. My loss is your gain. This same exact setup retails for $650 on Amazon right now.Manfrotto 055CXPRO3 Tripod w/ 322RC2 head Tripod Description The new 055 carbon fiber 3-section tripod delivers maximum rigidity from the lightest components. The 100% carbon fiber tubes and new QPL leg locking system increase the tripod’s rigidity and absorb vibrations, stabilizing camera equipment under any conditions. The key feature of the 055CXPRO3 is its 90 Degree Centre column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached. The legs of the 055CXPRO3 tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers. The special design of the QPL levers allows single-handed opening of all leg sections in one action. Intuitive and ergonomic leg angle selectors allow each leg to be independently and solidly set to any of the preset angles, again allowing considerable positioning freedom. A bubble level is built in to the top of the Centre column for precise framing. The bubble level rotates freely around the Centre column, so it can be positioned wherever it's easiest for you to see it. Head Description Manfrotto 322RC2 Grip Action Ball Head Features Unblock, move, position and lock your camera with one hand in one position Revolutionary grip handle design with ball lock lever Friction control wheel regulates power of the blocking mechanism to match the weight of your camera and lens Load capacity of 11 pounds; 5.5 pound capacity when in the vertical position And Two ZAYKIR Quick Release Plates for the RC2 Rapid Connect Adaptercall or text anytime: REDACTEDWould be willing to work a trade for a Glock 17 or 34.

This is once fired brass, mixed headstamps, from training exercises.  No Military brass with crimped primers to deal with.
The brass is ultra-sonically cleaned with proprietary cleaning solution.  The brass is then dried and placed into a proprietary media and brass polishing solution.  This gives the brass a super shiny appearance and smooth texture.  The brass is easier to reload when all the powder residue is removed.  The brass loads into the gun chamber much easier with this cleaning process.  I helped a company produce this cleaning process, which they still use today.  Buy it and you will see.

This is once fired brass, mixed headstamps, from training exercises.  No Military brass with crimped primers to deal with.
The brass is ultra-sonically cleaned with proprietary cleaning solution.  The brass is then dried and placed into a proprietary media and brass polishing solution.  This gives the brass a super shiny appearance and smooth texture.  The brass is easier to reload when all the powder residue is removed.  The brass loads into the gun chamber much easier with this cleaning process.  I helped a company produce this cleaning process, which they still use today.  Buy it and you will see.

This is once fired brass, mixed headstamps, from training exercises.  No Military brass with crimped primers to deal with.
The brass is ultra-sonically cleaned with proprietary cleaning solution.  The brass is then dried and placed into a proprietary media and brass polishing solution.  This gives the brass a super shiny appearance and smooth texture.  The brass is easier to reload when all the powder residue is removed.  The brass loads into the gun chamber much easier with this cleaning process.  I helped a company produce this cleaning process, which they still use today.  Buy it and you will see.

When the pistol fired, a great deal of pressure had to build up before the ball was fully deformed and could pass through the bore. This gives the pistol much more muzzle energy than could be obtained from a patched ball load. More pictures available on request.Thank you for reading, I'm asking $1,200 OBO on this heirloom please text me, or call me (and leave a message) with any serious offers.

The P226 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P226 SAO variant brings the same feature set to the table in a single-action only package. The addition of the SIG Master Shop Super Match Flat Trigger provides exceptional feel and consistent trigger pull regardless of finger placement. The SAO is available in 9 mm."
