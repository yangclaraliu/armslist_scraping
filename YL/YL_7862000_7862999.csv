Also not pictured I have a black magpul angled foregrip that has never been used. On the gun is a Vortex Crossfire ll 1-4x24 with the V-Brite red dot reticle. It is mounted on a Vortex Sport Cantilever 30mm mount and comes with Vortex lens flipcaps. The entire buttstock, upper/lower receiver, and handguard were all hyrdodipped in a Krytek camo by a licensed dealer. I've put less than 150 rounds through it since I'm out of town most of the time for work. The gun is in GREAT shape and has been kept in a safe. Will include all the ammo I have left which is like 150 rounds or more. I'm looking to get $1300, but I'm willing to negotiate so any questions feel free to contact me anytime.

Hello. I recently had this gun posted up but decided I would just keep it and finish the project I started its a G34 Gen 3 that internally is like new with less than 200 rnds through the barrel. The gun was hydro dipped and I made it into a battleworn Atacs AU pattern. It has had double undercuts. The grip has been chopped to accept G19 mags for more concealability. The finger grooves were removed as well and the stipple pattern feels really great and is mild and not over abrasive. It took a good while to do because in order to achieve this pattern I had to do it with a tempt adjust wood burner on the lowest temp. The gun comes with 1-G19 mag and 2-G17 mags. It has orange fiber optic Defoor sights with spare rods: Comes with the FDE TLR-1 HL I have  tHe box and accessories for the gun and light. Has grip force adapter beaver tail comes with 2 kydex mag pouches and 2 holsters one is reversible iwb or owb the other is just owb. Both holsters are made to work with the light on it. I can send any pictures you want. I’m willing To take a loss on everything for $425 FIRM or may consider trades on other pistols. Thanks
