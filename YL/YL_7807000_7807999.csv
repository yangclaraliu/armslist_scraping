I am happy I did and would not change a thing.  I am only considereing parting with it because I would rather not have so much money tied up in one firearm that I do not actually use.  Once you rack the slide on this firearm and feel how the slide seems to be on ball bearings, you will immediately recognize the quality that you only get from a custom 1911.  (No Kimber compares to the feel of a hand-built 1911.)  As far as  ""off the shelf"" 1911's go, the only one that would even come remotely close would be the Dan Wesson Valor which coincidently was designed by Bob Serva when he owned Dan Wesson before selling it to CZ and starting his own company.  My specs for this 1911 were intended for it to be a fighting or duty 1911 so it is entirely black, even the barrel, except for the VZ grips.  It has a magwell, XS sights, match grade barrel, ambi safety, extended mag release, checkered front strap, sure-grip slide serrations on the rear only, custom tuned trigger that breaks at a crisp 3.75 -4.25 lbs. recessed slide stop pin, full length guide rod, and the barrel is target crowned and flush cut, and the top of the slide and back of the rear sites are grooved to prevent glare.  All edges have been softened for carry.  It comes with an additional XS front trituim sight, case, and three magazines all tested for function by Fusion.  As for it's value, when I ordered it, the total package was $1,850 and I asume it would be over $2,000 today.  If you are in the market for a high end 1911, this one is ready without the wait and is more than worth considering.  Don't pay for a name, pay for quality.  VERY SERIOUS inquiries only by PHONE CALL ONLY.  NO TEXT OR EMAILS WILL BE REPLIED TO.  I will email or text pics after we have a phone conversation so please do not email asking for the. My trade interests are specific, so please do not offer anything other than what I mention here:  Daniel Defense Mlk 18 pistol configuration, or uppers only.  Bravo company 11.5"" pistol upper, or complete build using the BCM 11.5"" upper.  Colt Single Action .45.  If the trade value is less than my pistol's value, cash would be expected on your end, and if your trade value exceeds mine, then cash would be added on my end.  You MUST have a valid TN Carry Permit, and be willing to sign a bill of sale to purchase.Price: $1,850 oboNO SHIPPING - WILL ONLY MEET AT FOOD CITY IN BLAINEPHONE CALLS ONLY - NO TEXT OR EMAILS WILL BE REPLIED TOI DO NOT NEED HELP SELLING THIS FIREARM.865-three two three-44 one 9FUSION IS NOT LISTED AS A MANUFACTURER OPTION SO WILSON COMBAT WAS CHOSEN.  I apologize for the upside down pic."

From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design convertible from safety-decocker to decocker-only, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition.  Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive Pointability The Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.  Versatility and easy Accessorization One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more.  Easy to Use and Maintain The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over."

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine, and a low capacity-compliant version is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

The rifle is in mint condition (99%) with no marks I can find in either wood or metal. The M673 is based on the Model Seven and has a laminate wood stock and magnum contour barrel with vent rib and high vis front sight (the rear sight on this rifle was removed for scope installation). The price for the rifle alone is $625 and is firm. If you want the scope already mounted on top, a Leupold Rifleman 2-7x33 (just serviced by Leupold and also mint), the price will be $750 for both (firm). The rifle has been shot and hunted with, but has a very low total round count of less than 50 rounds total, I'd figure. I can only recall ever using the remington 165gr load in this rifle which shot very well and is readily available at this time online.

Up for trade or sale is a very nice Polish AK47. It’s built on an Ohio Ordinance Works receiver. Made with Polish parts (including an original Polish barrel). The dust cover and bolt carrier have the same numbers etched in them (not sure if that means anything). The original Polish furniture it came with was pretty rough so I had it sent off to Combloc Customs to get it stained in a Russian Red shellac finish. Now it’s beautiful! She comes with 2 steel 30 rounders, 1 Korean 75 round drum (brand new, only loaded and stored with the spring unwound of course), and around 250 rounds of Tula 7.62. I would like to get 850 for everything which is a great deal for a rifle in this shape, or trade for a CZ Scorpion. I may be interested in other rifles, but no handguns, shotguns, AR-15’s or weird calibers. My cell is REDACTED. Thanks everyone"

I need to SELL this by 1/12 - I am relocating to New Jersey and cannot keep this, I am NOT interested in trades, coins, cryptocurrency or quads - Cash Only. The price has been reduced and is FIRM at $630, I will NOT return it to stock and I will NOT remove items to reduce the cost.**Reloaders: For $1000 I will add 8 pounds of unopened Universal Clays, unopened 5K Small Pistol Primers (Ginex - OEM for S&B/Xtrme) and 6.2ish-K sorted/washed 9mm brassMy urgency does not equate to complacency, do not insult me with a low-ball offer - those offers and trade requests will be ignored.This is an otherwise unmolested Gen 4 Glock 19, the modifications are listed below:- Trijicon HD 3-Dot Green/Green Night Sight (installed 10/2017)- Glock OEM Extended Slide Release- Lone Wolf Ultimate Adjustable Trigger (UAT) **Notes on this below**- Ghost EDGE 3.5 Connector- ZevTech 6# Trigger Spring **Notes on this below**- ZevTech Reduced Weight Safety Plunger Spring **Notes on this below**- All metal contact surfaces have been (mostly) deburred, and polished w/ 1500 grit and hit w/ a microfiber cloth with Flitz- Four (4) 15-round Magazines, All Glock OEM- 450 Rounds of Ammo: 200x 124gr NATO loadings (higher SAAMI Pressure/slightly higher velocity), 75x Federal 115gr +P HiShok, the rest is LOOSE and has about 80 or so 115gr Tula Steel case with the rest being a mix of AE/Fed/Win with some 147gr GS/GD/Hornady CD stuff in there- Most stock parts are included as well as the box, backstraps, etc**Regarding the Trigger** - I have received questions and concerns regarding the viability of this for Defensive/CCW applications; while the sum of the UAT, Ghost Edge and the Zev springs may sound like this is a hair-trigger - it is not. Unlike the Fulcrum, Glockstore Drop-In or the Overwatch triggers, this does not have the weak ""2 pound"" break with all of these parts. I added the heavier Zev trigger spring and the UAT to give this Glock as much of a ""double action"" feel as I could. Ergo - there is no mushiness, yards of travel, creep, wobble or general sloppiness you get when you are using a standard Glock trigger (Even with springs/connectors) - this feels like a refined/broken-in Sig DAK action, and breaks around 4 pounds. I have tested it for dropfire, and if you did not like how it broke the trigger is fully adjustable so you can add a little bit of takeup to ease you mind. I did not adjust it nor modify it as to bypass the trigger safety - the reduced weight plunger spring and Edge Connector only aid in reducing that ""bump"" you feel near the break on a stock Glock trigger, this was not and never was intended to be a USPSA hair-trigger - this breaks smoothly and like glass, or as close at it gets in a striker fired pistol.The Striker Assembly was not touched, it has the stock striker spring and stock striker, there will be no issues with partial ignition, FTFs, FTRTBs, FTEJ or FTEX - as long as you have quality ammo and do not limp wrist, this pistol should give you no issues.If you bothered to read through all of that, again, the price is FIRM at $630 - I am located in the Polaris area and will meet at the BMV off of Lazelle and US-23/High Street or the Cabela's off of Lyra/Gemini and I-71 - I can meet downtown near Nationwide near 3pm, and I will drive up to ONE HOUR.You can reach me readily via email but TEXT is preferred at 6one4 6four8 49five8 - no calls please.
