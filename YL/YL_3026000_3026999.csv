We’ve had many requests to produce a Commander-sized 1911 in 9mm. In response, we’ve revived one of the early Dan Wesson 1911 models with a twist…
We have combined the best features from two of our most popular models, the Bobtail* Commander and the CCO. The new Guardian has an anodized aluminum bobtail frame and an aluminum mainspring housing to help reduce printing when carrying concealed and make it comfortable enough for full-time carry. The Duty Black finished Commander-length slide and alloy frame give it just the right feel and balance. If you are looking for a lightweight Commander-sized 1911 in 9mm,  don’t pass up the Guardian.

Bravo Company (BCM) complete 20-inch 1/7 government profile barrel, A4 upper with BCM bolt, carrier and charging handle. 

Got the whole thing from Bravo company a few years back, added the handguards (they are Colt or old Bushmaster, I can't recall) and set it aside. Its been sitting in the safe for a while and just needs a new home. 

Bravo company is really first-rate gear and quite exceptional. This is the info from their website:

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.

As a note: BCM™ barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

There is a slight mark near the takedown lever from not being taken down correctly/carefully. This was present when I purchased the firearm from its original owner.

Includes original box, original factory papers, original 8 round magazine plus one extra magazine, and one Blackhawk IWB holster. 

This firearm is priced to move as I would like to start a project Glock19. At the time of sale, I would require a bill of sale signed by both parties and a copy left with both parties...just as a precaution. 

Price is open to negotiation, however, since it is already priced lower than similar postings, I cannot afford to go all too much lower. Serious offers are always accepted.

This has a 3 inch barrel and all the same great qualities of a 1911 except it's a double action only.  It has a smooth trigger pull that's consistent every time.  No worrying about carrying cocked and locked like a normal 1911.  The light double action helps prevent accidental discharges, but is light enough for a quick pull when you need it."

Considered by some to be an ""obsolete"" firearm, I have found it to be anything but obsolete.  It is the Remington 878 Automaster. This is not a misprint. One of the finest pump-action shotguns ever produced.  Very few have heard of this baby, the 878 Automaster, a semi-automatic shotgun based on the 870 architecture.  And with good reason...  the 878 was only manufactured for five years, with somewhere in the window of 63,000 (give or take a few) Automasters produced."

SN 47401. These are specially made Colt Model 1878 Double Action revolvers with extra -large trigger guards and long triggers. These were needed to replace the ineffective .38 Caliber revolvers in the Philippines when it was obvious that a larger caliber arm was needed for stopping power. This gun has about 90% blue with an area of corrosion near the left side of the muzzle and some corrosion on the cylinder, trigger guard and left frame above the trigger guard. I believe this loss was from poor storage rather than use. The action is very strong and tight and the bore is pristine. The right side of the frame has the correct “1902” and “US” markings and the “JTT” mark of John Taliaferro Thompson. The right side of the frame and trigger guard bear the “RAC” inspector marks of Rinaldo A Carr. The back of the cylinder also has the RAC mark. Has a factory letter showing delivery to the Government on November 10, 1902. This gun is modern but qualifies as a Curio and Relic so either an FFL or a C&R license must be submitted for shipment. I will not ship where there are any other special requirements. It is up to you to know the laws of your state. If I cannot simply ship to a C&R or FFL in your state, do not bid."

I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be.

Time to step it up with the best AR cartridge for the large frame ever. Designed from a clean sheet as a tuned package, this new 6.5 x 47 Lapua upper assembly just needs your standard LR-308 DPMS pattern lower - and optics. Excellent accuracy combined with lower recoil than 308 Win and .260 Rem make for a super combination.
Match chambered barrel - Bartlein 22"" stainless (fluted under handguard) threaded 5/8""-24. 1:8.5 twist with point cut 5R rifling and 11 degree target crown.
New Armalite AR-10 bolt carrier group for smooth reliable cycling action.
Rifle length 12.5"" light weight free-float aluminum vented hand guard.
Clamp on SLR Sentry adjustable steel micro gas block. This is the best adjustable block in the industry with repeatable one tool adjustable detent positions that do not require loctite. Barrel is .875"" under the gas block and .800"" at the muzzle.
DPMS hi top smooth side upper receiver laser etched by Thunder Arms. No forward assist or shell deflector.
5/8""-24 Stainless four port brake optimized for 6.5 caliber bullets and indexed to the barrel.
BCM MOD4 Gunfighter charging handle.
Based on the .308 Win case dimensions, the 6.5 x 47 in the large platform AR uses standard 308 magazines with no issues.
Chamber and throat dimensions optimized for use with 123 Scenar bullets and Lapua factory brass. (1) dummy round included for COAL reference.
Load data and targets from this upper included for reference.
This cartridge has been tested by us for several thousands of rounds in the large frame AR with excellent results in accuracy and barrel life.
Factory loaded Lapua 6.5x47 ammo is available currently from most suppliers using 108/123/139 grain scenar bullets. We find factory ammo to be very nearly as good as the best handloads.
This upper was head spaced using PGT headspace go/nogo gauges and that exact matching bolt is included. A bore scope was used for perfect gas port alignment. It has been test fired for proper function and gas block adjustment.

This is a new factory built Spikes upper complete with all Spikes Tactical parts, including the well know and highly regarded Spikes Bolt Carrier Group. Complete specifications are listed below. It has never been fired. It has the Spikes Spider logo laser engraved on both the BCG and the upper receiver, and the barrel is marked ""ST"" along with all the other specs in the rollmark. It has a 16"" barrel and mid-length gas system, which is pretty much better in every way than the standard carbine length gas system. Longer hand guards for more versatile hand placement, longer sight radius, and they are also softer shooting and run smoother due to the longer gas system which equals less felt recoil and less wear and tear on components as well.

This rifle shoots great and has a really nice action. The blueing was all took off the barrel, and it has a neat black/green stick and leaf camo on the stock. It is topped with a Thompson Center 3-9 zoom scope that's really clear. I am trying to sell this rifle so I can buy or build a flatbed for my pickup. This makes a really great truck gun. It also comes with one 10 round magazine. There is some pitting on the outside of the barrel only, but its just cosmetic.
