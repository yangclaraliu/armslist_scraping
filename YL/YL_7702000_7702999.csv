Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Will Ship for $25Florida Residents Must pay sales tax"

Complete C-Mag system includes 1 C-Mag Magazine, personal loader, carry pouch, tech manual and graphite. The advanced design of this C-MAG makes it the world's first magazine capable of providing a full 100 round capacity and can be pre-loaded and stored indefinitely. Successfully tested in combat during Desert Storm where it performed flawlessly under the most rigorous conditions. The 100-round capacity of the C-MAG drastically reduces vulnerability during magazine changes, while dramatically increasing survivability. Law enforcement and security operations find that the C-MAG magazine's high capacity and pre-loaded storage capabilities reduce loss of life and property damage. They also provide tactical sustainment and in turn, area containment . C-MAG is built to the highest international military production standards and meets or exceeds all NATO MILSPEC tests. It has surpassed extensive field testing including continued exposure to temperatures below 40°F and above 160°F. It has functioned perfectly with the ice forming on it or after submersion in mud and sand. It is also resistant to salt water, fuels and a number of chemicals.

The fluted, free-floating, button-rifled barrel helps even the beginning marksman shoot tighter groups. Fluting increases rigidity, reduces weight and enhances barrel cooling. A recessed hunting muzzle crown aids accuracy as well. Much of the barrel is surrounded by a machined-aluminum forend tube that's drilled and tapped to receive accessory rails. The R-15's overall light weight and ergonomic design make handling it a joy. A receiver-length Picatinny rail atop the action accommodates your choice of optics or accessories. The single-stage hunting trigger consistently breaks cleanly. For concealment, the R-15 is covered in Advantage MAX-1 HD camo. Carbine models feature collapsible stocks. Includes a five-round magazine, making them legal for hunting in most states. Compatible with aftermarket AR-15 magazines and accessories. Lockable hard case included.This rifle has never been fired.
