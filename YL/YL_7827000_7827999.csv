This rifle, serial #193407 was manufactured in 1903. The rifle comes with two special order features, a 26"" half octagon - half round barrel and a half magazine. It also has a period addition of a Lyman No.3 Gold Bead front sight, and a Winchester 38B Mid-Range Vernier Peep sight (which is quite valuable on its own). As for condition the receiver retains most of its original bright blue, thinning on the edges and the belly from light carry use. The original 26"", 1/2 octagon barrel retains around 90% of its original bright blue finish. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, showing very minimal handling marks. The buttstock may have had a light coat of finish added long ago. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The lever and hammer still retain bright original case colors in protected areas. The bore is MINTY, with a mirror shine and sharp rifling. I would rate it at 95%. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. In all this is a great example of a Model 1894 in a very desirable configuration and the best caliber. This rifle would make a great addition to ones collection and/or an excellent shooter, giving the condition of the bore and mechanics. I have provided over 90 photos and offer a 3 day inspection period so you can bid with confidence. All pictures were taken outdoors in natural light and provide an accurate depiction of its condition, if anything I feel the gun looks better when held in person as the camera lightens up the look of the bluing some.Insurance is included with shipping. Thank you for looking."

Totally reliable pistol. If you could figure out how to load their mags with beer cans, I bet  they would feed them with no problems  Super smooth and light trigger.   Very managable recoil. Traditional double and single action locked breech semi automatic pistol. Construction is steel barrel, slide assembly, internal parts, sights, trigger, hammer, levers, magazine body and innards, all built into a lightweight alloy frame. Only the grips, Mag safety plunger bushing, and magazine floorplate and follower are polymer. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch Devel type with ball joint muzzle collar that ensures accuracy and facilitates disassembly. Rifling is five groove right hand 1:18.75. Slide is serrated rear, .925 wide at the port; with ambidextrous safety levers that also decock the pistol. Slide also houses the firing pin and magazine safeties: the 6906 will not fire without magazine. Sights are matte blue steel dovetailed front and rear; dot front  These came from the factory with 12 round magazines.  My supplier didn't supply any magazines for them, but each will come with either one brand new flush fitting (with finger extension) 10 round magazine, or a nice used 12 round flush(with finger extension) fitting mag. 15 round mags are available for only $20, which seat well and are for the same 59 S&W series, but extend somewhat past the body of the pistol. I suggest getting it with the one flush fitting  mag, and getting the 15 round mag for $20 more. Its nice to have a 15 rounder for range time anyway.  I will not sell magazines separately without pistol purchase. While polymer frame pistols have their place  there is something to be said for a classic American made fully metal service quality pistol.  This baby eats Glocks for lunch.  This is the type of gun that you could pass on to your great grand kids after 5g rounds and it still will look and function great.   Super fantastic conceal carry pistol.  Smith & Wesson stands by its firearms, so buy with confidence."

I am running out of room in the safe, so I figured I'd see if there was a market for this.  I chose the OBR because the reciever/rail have 20 MOA built in.  There are certainly some other good rifles out there, but this rifle will shoot with any of them.The stock photo I used shows the rifle as I am selling it, though without BUIS as it didn't come with them. The rifle currently has a Magpul PRS Gen 3, Silencerco muzzle brake and an expensive scope on it, and I want to avoid the inevitable emails from people asking if all that stuff is included. The rifle doese come with a Larue plastic case, 2 mags and all the typical Larue goodies. The stock and such are negotiable.From Larue's site:The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.Barrels:Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Internals:The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

The bluing on the rifle looks good, with some wear. Barrel bore is shiny and lands look good. Barrel is threaded and has the correct barrel nut to match up with the bayonet. Wood looks to be crack-free, with some dings on the body from use. Buttplate has a few typical dings, with some deformation of the wood around it. Action is smooth and still needs the residual Cosmolene cleaned out. Magazine locks up tight and the bolt hold-open functions correctly. Not much wear in that area,Overall a great collectible rifle. Shipping available. Ask for more pictures. The Egyptian Rasheed Carbine (also ""Rashid"") was born from the Hakim Rifle which, in turn, was born from the Swedish Ljungman AG-42 semi-automatic rifle line. The Ag-42 rifle was produced for the Swedish Army during World War 2 (1939-1945) and entered service in 1942. The weapon was a gas-operated, repeating rifle system utilizing the local 6.5x55mm cartridge. After the war, the Egyptian government secured the rights to the rifle and purchased the required machining tools for local production of the type - this becoming the Hakim Rifle of the 1950s with chief changes being its now-adjustable gas function and chambering for the 7.92x57mm Mauser. The Rasheed was a further-developed form of the Hakim though shortened into a more handy carbine form. Production numbers totaled only 8,000 units and adoption occurred in 1960."
