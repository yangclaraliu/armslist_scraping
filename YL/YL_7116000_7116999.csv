Although more than a few years old, these are still popular rifles within the palma community in the UK and New Zealand. The barrel, action, and stock are all in fine condition with no rust. The receiver maintains a high blue finish (sorry about the glare in the photos). The rifle has been rebarreled with a nicely fluted .308 barrel. I was told when I purchased the rifle it was a Krieger barrel, but I can't confirm that. Also includes a Gehmann front sight. Information on these rifles is a bit hard to come by, other than in British palma forums. Wikipedia does have a brief article.

The Springfield Armory® XD® Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol has all the same great features as the standard XD pistol, only with a 5"" barrel. The 5"" barrel provides a longer sight radius for enhanced accuracy, and faster recovery between shots to keep the shooter on target during rapid fire. This is a full-sized semi-automatic pistol meant for law enforcement, home defense, field carry, and tactical deployments. The ergonomic design of Springfield XD pistols optimizes pointability and shooting control. XDs have durable polymer frames and a Melonite®-coated forged steel slides. Checkering on the frame provides a solid grip to keep the pistol in place when shooting, and dual slide serrations provide a secure hold when loading or clearing the weapon. A grip safety (similar to a 1911) blocks the weapon from firing unless the safety is depressed, which happens naturally when the pistol is held correctly, but automatically goes ""on safe"" when the shooter's hold is released. An articulated safety lever built into the trigger blade backs up the grip safety. A loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition. 3-dot, steel sights on this semi-automatic pistol provide rapid sight acquisition, and are dovetailed into the slide for easy replacement with after market night sights; and, an integral rail on the frame allows the attachment of aftermarket tactical sights and lights. An ambidextrous magazine release accommodates either hand. The Springfield Armory XD Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance."

Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain worldwide acceptance with shooters in both professional and civilian circles. This GLOCK 31 is a Gen 3 that features a comfortable grip with finger grooves and a rough texture for optimal ergonomics. GLOCK also added a universal light rail to the pistol so that shooters can add their choice of light or laser.  Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 31 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments.

These are premium rifles with excellent components and triggers from one of the best names in modern sporting rifles today!!The MC6 was designed from the ground up to be an ultra-lightweight and rigid multi caliber platform with inherent accuracy capabilities across a wide spectrum of field applications.Manufactured from billet aluminum all efforts were made to reduce weight at non critical points without sacrificing strength or reliability. The MC6 featuring a 16"" profiled barrel with the 10.5 inch rail system weighs in at 6lbs. The upper receiver on the MC6 features a barrel nut lock up system that is free from contact with the rail. This in turn allows for a true free floated barrel assembly that is not dependent on a timed barrel nut that contacts the rail. There are multiple benefits to this method of securing a barrel to the upper receiver. The first is reduced heat transfer. With no barrel nut transferring heat directly to the rail system the shooter will notice that the rail does not become uncomfortably hot even after long strings of fire. Secondly, bipods and other accessories no longer impact accuracy as the rail does not come into direct contact with the barrel nut which is in direct contact with the barrel extension. This makes for an inherently more accurate system when compared to more traditional AR upper receiver groups. Since the barrel nut is not the anchor point for the rail system these two components can also be made lighter on the MC6. Finally, the design of the MC6 allows for a continuous picatinny rail interface on the top of the gun from the front of the rail system to the rear of the receiver.The lower receiver on the MC6 accepts all standard mil spec parts and features a true wire EDM magwell for precise tolerances. A user adjustable ambi-safety is standard as well as a large button enhanced bolt release. The receiver extension is a maritime profile and uses an enhanced castle nut and melonite coated QD sling mount.An enhanced bolt carrier group is designed to reduce carrier tilt during recoil and has fewer points of contact resulting in less friction area and a slight increase in mass to extend dwell time to ensure reliable extraction. A suppressor optimized ported ambi charging handle makes manipulating the action an easy process using either hand.The MC6 also comes standard with a proprietary single piece billet dust cover that rides on a “c” clampless carbon fiber dust cover rod."

These bush guns were some of the greatest made and are hard to find nowadays and the current ROCK-OLA's do not feature chrome-lined barrels either. This gun started off one hundred percent USGI and still is aside from where I upgraded the recoil and gas assembly to smooth out and take the slam out of the .308 round going off. Very soft shooter. This is a super-low serial number from one of the finest original runs of USGI mil-spec receivers forged by Bula Defense and the Criterion bore is in laser-beam pristine condition. Please understand that this gun is NOT an 'M1A', this is an entirely different animal in both materials and construction, accurized and built for hard use, not bench-plinking (though you can do that as well and not be disappointed). If you can find a whole one out there you're probably looking at 2300-2500 dollars plain jane.

The G19 is a mid-size pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The GLOCK 19 is a short-recoil operated, striker-fire semi-automatic pistol. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The main frame of the GLOCK pistol is constructed of high-strength polymer that is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body, or kept in a holster for extended periods of time. The slide cycles on 4 hardened steel guide rails within the frame. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and is drift adjustable. GLOCK pistols fieldstrip easily without the use of tools. The GLOCK G19 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for concealed carry, at home, or on duty. This model G19 comes with two standard 15-round magazines."

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."
