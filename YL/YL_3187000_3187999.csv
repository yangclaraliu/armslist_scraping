1937 BSW K98 with a very tight muzzle and great condition bore. Would make for a wonderful range K98 that will go up in value more than a typical K98 RC. Stock has Heer (army) marking on it with very vivid and clear waffenamts on it. This is a rare K98 which is in great shape and appears more original to the eyes than some heavily sanded RC K98s. $435

1953 dated Type 53 which is a trials Type 53. Personally this is the only 1953 Type 53 I've come across and I paid a premium for it when I got it. It isn't your typical Type 53 and is a Navy Arms import which were known to ship in much nicer ones than the current. The stock is very smooth on this one and has an old rack number painted on the side. Also the trigger honestly will make a Finnish M39 jealous. This is among my favorite Mosins to shoot at the range. A nice, accurate, rare Type 53 here. $220

Will ship insured with tracking number to you.
No trades. need cash.

Comes without magazine.

Okay, now the build details:
Built by Turbothis AKA MYguns. 
US-made Turbothis receiver.
Tapco G2 FCG.
US made slant brake.
Chinese chrome-lined and threaded (14X1LH) MAK90 barrel, GB and FSB with bayo lugs ground off.
Red Bakelite Chinese furniture, hanguards, pistol grip and sidefolder.
Sidefolder has included cleaning kit inside (hard to find I believe).

Problems: 
Receiver is blued, looks better than pictures show (coming in next post in a few hours), but it is very thin bluing, I went with a paki-build on it so wanted it thin to see the inner rail welds,etc. and the bluing didn't take around a couple rivets.

Dustcover is too short. It ""fits"" but sortof wedges and isn't easy to pop off. 

Dustcover and gas tube are dark thick bluing VS the thin bluing on receiver.


Overall, I love this gun. Shoots great, has nice heft and haven't had a hiccup with it.


I am wanting $1100. That includes insurance and tracking. I think it's very close to fair, full-on 56S sidefolders are going for around $2400. This includes an original Chinese CL barrel, Turbothis receiver and bakelite furniture. I've seen the furniture sell for $600 itself."

SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber.

I bought it from the guy who made it. I've only put 50 rounds downrange. It's been a safe queen since I got it. It features a heavy 4.25"" bull barrel. This is the most accurate pistol I've ever owned. I took the sights off to put new ones on, but I ended up ordering the wrong size. Just haven't got around to putting new ones on yet. Clarification: NO SIGHTS. They're easy enough to find. (If you want Trijicon night sights, the model # is CA02) My asking price reflects the lack of sights.

Rifle is equipped with a Elzetta Charlie c 333 900 lumen weapon light mounted in a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. Check Elzetta out on the web they are the main suppliers to SF units and these lights are unbelievable bright even in the day light at night it will blind you for at least 15 minutes when your hit with it. Saving the best part for last is a AIMSHOT LS8300. Yes I said LS8300. These are only sold to SOCOM and other SF Units on military POs only they are no longer sold even to LE Agency's. You can verify this by calling Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta. This laser is amazing the green dot his the brightest I have ever seen. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from Star Wars. Yes it will light a match. Comes with zero tool and two different tail caps.

The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. This shotgun features a Realtree Max-5 camo finish, a ventilated rib, a white bar front sight, a cross-bolt safety, and a cylinder choke tube.

Aston and Ira Johnson, both of Middletown and the Palmetto Armory of Columbia, SC, produced some 24,000 of these fine horse pistols from 1845 through 1852.

This US Henry Aston 1846 Model 1842 .54 caliber single shot smooth bore percussion pistol retains about 10% of its metal finish. The barrel is almost all white, with a mottled appearance and scattered erosion. The hammer and lock plates have a thick patina over some old erosion. The action functions correctly and the spring is strong. The original swivel hinge and steel ramrod with a button-shaped head is complete and functioning. The bore is surface rusted. There is no severe pitting. The brass hardware shows a few dings and depressions, with a mild darkening. The markings are legible. Overall, this handgun is in good, unmolested condition. This is an acceptable example of an early Martial arm. 

The right lock plate is marked ""U.S. / H. ASTON"" in front of the hammer and ""MIDDtn / CONN. 1846"" behind the hammer. The trigger guard, backstrap and stock hardware are marked ""H"". Overall length is 14” with an 8.5"" barrel. The left side of barrel is marked “US GWH P” with “1846” on rear top. There are two government inspection oval cartouches on the left side of stock. The front sight is a brass blade. There is NSN.

I have a Marvick Arms (based out of texas) pump action 12ga that has the barrel cut down to 18.5in and the plug out so it holds the extra shells in the tube. I replaced the buttstock with a matching black pistol grip so the whole gun only measures 27-28in total. Clearly only good for a home defense or under the seat truck gun. Condition is fair to decent. I really just looking to see if there is any interest in this gun at all on here before I put an asking price because I realize its an off brand. It does shoot and perform well though minus the hand pain. Sorry no pics in ad.... just email and I will send a few. Make an offer and we ll see where it goes from there. Thanks guys - Jason

They are Blackhawk so you know they are good quality. I have a pair in the gray color that are 100% brand new in the box and have never been worn once (still have the tags on them too). They are in size 12. I ordered them based on how great the reviews are so I could not try them on first, but I need a size larger. They are $99 or more everywhere, and well worth it. I got these on a sale for $75 and I will sell them for $70 if anyone would like them to save me the trouble of returning them. If you need some awesome lightweight breathable shoes that are durable, super comfortable, and great for everything from the range to around town to hiking on the trails or in the woods, you can't go wrong with these. I am actually paying $30 more to order them in a larger size for $100. I researched it before ordering them and they are they best for the price, especially for someone that wears a 12 and can take advantage of this reduced price of only $70. Cash only and that is the absolute lowest I will take, otherwise I will just send them back. If anyone would like them, let me know quickly, before I return them."

In 1912, the British started purchasing some 1911 pistols from Colt. With the outbreak of hostilities, it was decided to purchase additional pistols and by 1919 in excess of 17,000 had been delivered. Pistols in both .45 ACP and .455 Auto Mark I were obtained. The former were marked with a ""C"" serial number prefix while the latter had a ""W"" prefix. 
This 1911 serial # C-4649 caliber 45 acp was made is 1913 and a letter from the Colt archives states it was one of 20 pistols shipped to the London Armory Company on May 4, 1914. This was prior to the opening shots of the War which occurred on July 28, 1914. This pistol undoubtedly saw service in the hands of a British Officer during the Great War!
The frame and slide have the British proofs. The over all finish is about 30% with the trigger, hammer, slide release and safety showing about 50% of the nitre blue finish. Barrel is marked HS on the lug and the letter P. Rifling is excellent! Grips are in good shape for a 101 year old War veteran. The magazine is a two tone correct punch and saw cut with lanyard loop.
With the approaching anniversary of the start of the Great War July 28,1914 - November 11, 1918 this is your opportunity to own a piece of history. While it has not been researched yet it may be possible to discover which British Officer carried this pistol adding to the collectible and increasing the value!
The Colt letter verifying the shipment information is included
June 28,2014 is the 100 year Anniversary the start of WWI.Sure this fine Colt was involved."

Product Information
Shop more Hornady products Custom-grade ammunition from the factory. Built to the tightest tolerances for peak performance rivaling and sometimes surpassing handloads in many guns. Loaded with the Flex Tip eXpanding bullet, the same used in the Hornady LEVERevolution cartridges, this custom load features a soft polymer flex tip that's tough enough to stand up to a jacketed bullet, but soft enough so it won't dent the primer of the round in front of it or cause accidental firing in a lever gun.

The patented Flex Tip bullet features an interlocking design that keeps the core of the bullet and the jacket together creating a deeper penetrating, more humane kill. Not only that, they offer controlled expansion, enhanced accuracy and the delivery of flatter trajectories. These bullets are safe to use in all tubular magazines, as well as any other firearm. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

Here is the first authentic looking Rimfire copy of the venerable U.S. .30 M1 Carbine to hit the market since Erma’s and Iver Johnson’s demise 25 years ago. Manufacturer is Chiappa Firearms Ltd. / Kimar Plant in Brescia, Italy. Importer is Legacy Sport International of Nevada. Distributor and Warrantor is Chiappa Firearms of Dayton, OH. Service address 6785 West Third Street, Zip 45417, and that address is on the back of the instruction manual. Construction is a two piece sleeved steel 18 inch 1:16 rifling barrel; steel bolt and hammer and springs; polymer receiver; plymer operating handle and trigger group; polymer rear aperture sight with steel screws for windage and elevation adjustmet; polymer collar type post front sight; polymer magazines; polymer barrel band and bayonet lug; zinc alloy trigger; and dark stained Italian hardwood stock that holds a steel butt plate. This rifle is cosmetically faithful to the U.S. Carbine. Its only departure that is readily conspicuous is the grooved receiver that is capable of holding 3/8 base scope mounts, and that is an advantage. Overall length is 35 inches, with a 13 1/8 length of pull on the Buttstock. Weight empty is 4 pounds 8 ounces with center of gravity at the magazine. Magazines hold 10 rounds of .22 Long Rifle caliber ammunition, and each M1-22 comes with a total of two magazines. This little rifle exceeds its Erma ancestors for looks and balance, and it matches them on performance. We test fired the photo specimen, and got up to 3 consecutive shots on Remington Golden Bullet High Velocity ammunition, and up to 7 consecutive shots on Winchester Super X Copper Coated. That is on a par with the Ermas, from our poor memory. If a person wants better feeding than that, the best thing for a new owner to do, is to get a return authorization and send it to Dayton, perhaps a time or two. This is a looker, after all. If a person wants a shooter, best to stick with the most prolific product from a different factory on Sunapee Street in Newport, New Hampshire. Own the M1-22 in the photos, or one of its identical mates for only $ 329.00. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.

I have a Sig Sauer p250 2 sum.  It usually comes with 2 frames -  a sub-compact and a full size.  I also have a compact frame so it is actually a 3 sum.  Both slides have night sights.

you get Sig Sauer quality in a 3 gun package.

I just bought it/tried it and am just more of a striker fire guy.

Both sets of night sights are still bright.  You can see that in the picture but they look better in person, hard to take a picture of 2 sets of night sights.. try it some time.

1 - 12 round magazine - only works on subcompact - this is standard with the package
2 - 15 round mags - both work in compact - 1 of them has spacer so it will work with the subcompact - BOTH of these are extras that normally don't come with the package
1- - 17 round mag  - for the full size but it will work for the compact and subcompact frames - this is standard with the package

I also have an inside the waste band holster holster for it only 1 week old - bought for $60.  I will keep this and get different kydex if you don't want to buy it.

the normal 2sum price for nightsights is $700

2 of these  - the extra 15 round mag is $40 new - http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/8-SIG-MAG250C915N
so that is an $80 addition
plus $15 for the pieces that makes it work with the subcompact frame so you can hold 15 round for carry.

Compact frame new is $44 - http://www.topgunsupply.com/sig-sauer-p250-grip-module-assembly-9-40-357-compact-frame-medium-grip.html

New Holster - white hat holsters - only works with the subcompact - $60 - http://www.whitehatholsters.com/microtuck-jet-black-cowhide/

so a new total is around $840 without holster and $900 with holster
