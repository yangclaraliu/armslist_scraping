Asking $1,500 or best offer. MSRP: $1,646.Buyer must 1) show current driver's license and Virginia Concealed Carry permit or 2) consent to a background check. Summary of the TRP from the Springfield Armory website:""TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission."""

I literally just paid $124.99 plus shipping for this thing and never installed it or took it out of the box. For clarification, this is just the flash hider, not the suppressor. This does not require the suppressor to work. This is not an extended flash hider. The flash hider has a collar that covers the threads. It adds just over 1.75"" to the overall length of the barrel. The BLACKOUT® flash suppressor is the most efficient design available. The proprietary features eliminate muzzle flash, even on CQB-length barrels. The BLACKOUT® is inherently stronger and more impact resistant than four prong designs, while not being subject to the rapid erosion of closed-ended units. A high strength corrosion-resistant aerospace alloy, and ultra-hard Nitride finish provide the highest level of durability. Military tested and selected. Incorporates xthe M.I.T.E.R. System™ for use with our SPR/M4™ and SCAR-H SD™ silencers.This is the 1/2x28 version that will work on any threaded 556/223 barrel. Comes with the factory packaging. Yes, I'll ship."

Colt re-tooled their production to re-make these with all the period correct classic parts. They come with A1 flash hiders, if you want the Colt Vietnam 3 prong flash hider instead of the A1 I will give you one of those instead (Genuine Colt). These guns had an MSRP of $2499 and regularly sell for over that. They WERE NOT offered as just an upper. If you do not know about them do your research. I WILL ship at buyer's expense.

Perfect candidate for a WWI German Mauser restoration. 1917 Efurt K98az with Weimar police district stamp on buttplate. No import marks. Action is numbers matching including bolt, trigger, and sights. Stock, though cut down, is original to the rifle with matching buttplate. Trigger gaurd assembly does not match, but matches itself. Bore is very bright and strong. Being a police rifle it probably saw very little use. Does not have the 1920 stamp or any other markings to indicate it was used post WWI. Likely a bringback rifle. The only part missing is the rear sight slide catch button. All that is needed to restore this rifle is a correct stock and hardware. $300 firm. Bolt alone is worth most of that.Trades considered. I do have a soft spot for mosin-nagants."
