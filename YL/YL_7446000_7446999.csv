Like the rest of that transaction it was a lie and I was conned. I should have walked away from someone so sketchy but I wanted to trust him and in the moment I gave in to pressure. I paid full price for an optic that was clearly mounted on a rail and used to some extent. I have no idea how long it was on the rail or if shots of any kind were fired with it. I would assume that with the other lies I was told, this has been shot with at some point. It would obviously not harm the sight but there is some wear on the mounting bracket where it rides the picatinny rail. Other than that the optic is in tip-top shape and runs great. I have never used it other than turning it on and checking to see that it works. I need the money more than I need the optic at this time so my loss is your gain. This is a high quality AMERICAN MADE optic from a reputable American company that offers an excellent lifetime warranty. Excelent large window view clarity and revolutionary quick detatch, low profile electronics housing directly bellow the anti-glare and scratch proof glass held in a vacuum sealed, argon gas impinged, holographic reticle enclosure. A full hood and tapered housing allow for the smallest footprint with the largest field of view possible at 1/3 cowitness. This type of housing eliminates nearly all light footprint from the muzzel side of the optic. This means the glass will never fog up and even if you were up against someone with IR night vision, they wouldn't see your optic light until they saw your muzzel flash. Also capable of using a waterproof Micro USB port to recharge a battery inside the optic. Check the reviews online, this thing is really incredible.This is worth around $500. Asking $450 OBO to try and cover some of that.I apologize for the terrible photo but due to Armslist photo restricitions, that is what 've got. I can send much better photos of this item on request.Included with this bundle: One - Vortex Razor AMG UH-1 ""Huey"" Holographic Optic with battery, cleaning cloth, manual and original boxSee below for my long list of trade preferences.

There are no yearly production numbers by year known for this model, and the manufactured date is estimated; about 1/4 of the way into production that began in 1870. The frames on these derringers were both nickel and silver plated. The nickel plating has a shiny appearance, with 99% remaining; with just a few light marks on the left side around the 2 screw heads. The back strap, where you would expect to see wear, has all of the original nickel plating. The checkered hammer and trigger show good traces of the original case hardening colors; with a fine & crisp action. The 2 1/2"" round barrel has an excellent bore, with the barrel address, ""- COLT -"" on top. The opening and closing action of the barrel and frame works perfectly, and is crisp and tight, and has a strong ""clicking"" sound when closing due to almost no wear and a tight fit, and the ejector works perfectly. The barrel has about 30% of the original patchy charcoal bluing; thinning overall from light pocket carrying. The bore is excellent. The 2 frame screws, the large screw on the underside of the frame, and the grip screw all have original charcoal bluing.

This rifle was made in 1872 and is one of 10,001 rifle made. It has a 36 inch barrel. For a gun that is 145 years old it is in very nice condition. It looks like this rifle was never issued and I believe from what I read that is true most were not. The barrel is smooth brown and has a spot or two of very very minor rust. Not sure if the correct finish is brown but if it is its thin in a few places. One spot is the balance point for carry one handed. There is one nick in the metal top of the barrel about mid point between the bands. The case color is a bit weak on the receiver but not so much from ware. The wood around the receiver show very little ware. The wood on this rifle is solid with some dings and dents but was never messed with. It has sharp clear cartouches on the butt stock on the side and bottom behind the lower tang. The detail of the small cartouche on the under side is hard to photo but shows some detail. Too bad S.B. had to engrave his initials in the stock. I can think of one thing SB stands for that might fit. There a couple of very minor cracks (I think) on the left side behind the receiver in the area of the cartouche. The bore is bright and shiny but has a few spots in it of light pitting. Judging but the tightness of the action and face of the block it looks like it was fired little. One of the interesting things about this rifle is when you open the action and load it is when you flip the block back in place the hammer falls forward just enough that you can not open it up again with out pulling the hammer back that amount. It will not fire unless you pull the hammer back as well. So it really is a automatic safety that holds the breach block locked closed. Interesting"

The loading lever connector broke at some point in its life and it was fixed with a piece of copper. Other then those issues the rifle isn't in too bad of shape. No major pitting on the components besides the bore which isn't in the best shape. Overall the carbine is a nice affordable collectors piece for someone who doesn't want to spend $1200+ on an excellent example. It is an antique so can be shipped without an FFL. I will ship but payment will need to be up front. I will drive up to 40 miles to meet FTF. I would rather trade but will consider selling.

The Model 1816 was the largest production of U.S. flintlock muskets, with an impressive run from 1816-1840. Both national armories, Springfield and Harpers Ferry, were involved as were about 16 different contractors. Conflicts during this period included numerous encounters with Native Americans, as well as the Mexican-American War.The lock is marked with a federal eagle over “U.S.” The back of the lock is marked “HARPERS/FERRY/1828”. The front of the trigger guard appears marked with a “7” as is the hardware on the left side of the stock, opposite the lock. There is a “V/MB” mark in the wood behind the trigger guard. “VP” federal proof marks are on the left side of the barrel. The bayonet is also marked “US”.The overall condition of this musket is good. The iron surfaces are very dark with age. Markings are legible. The walnut stock is also quite dark and is solid all the way through. It shows a lot of use, which is to be expected after surviving military service preceding the American Civil War. The bore is smooth and clean. The action is very strong. Here is a fantastic example of a US military musket with a ton of history.Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.Barrel is 42 inches in length.Caliber: .69Overall condition as seen in photos."

The Double Deringer was made by Remington from 1866 to 1935—a testament to the design as well as the commercial market for such a trusty and concealable firearm. The Deringer was sturdily built and simple in operation. A lever on the right side of the frame swings so that the barrels may open upward on a hinge for loading and unloading. There is a single firing pin that moves from one barrel to another with each cock.The Remington Deringer has been made famous, especially in the old Western films, but use of these guns really was widespread. Lawmen and gangsters alike would carry them as backups or something to stick in a pocket. Civilians loved them, as well as those in the military. In fact, the NRA Museum has a specimen in their collection which was carried as a backup by a pilot during the Korean War in the 1950s.The overall condition is fine. The nickel finish is virtually complete. The markings are clear and legible. The mother of pearl grips are gorgeous and very fine. The bores are in good condition, rifled, clean with some light pitting. The action is strong.Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.Barrel is 3 inches in length.Caliber: .41 rimfire short"

529,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7446529,For Sale:  CIVIL WAR Antique COLT 1849 Pocket Revolver,"Indiana, New Albany, Indiana",$ 800,"Listed On: Friday, October 13, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here we present an antique Colt 1849 Pocket Revolver, made in 1864 in Hartford, Connecticut. Over 280,000 of these were produced by Colt’s factory at Hartford by the end of the American Civil War in 1865. These were very popular and saw a lot of use on the battlefield, on the home front and in the West. These were some of the smallest, handiest pocket revolvers of the time.One of the most aesthetically pleasing aspects of this revolver is its cylinder scene. Cylinder scenes during this period were common, especially for Colt, not only for their visual appeal, but because it made a revolver more difficult to forge. The scene on the 1849 Pocket is that of a stagecoach robbery. The focal point is the stagecoach drawn by four horses. A woman in a dress is seen framed in the doorway of the side of the coach. The driver is standing alongside wielding his pistol against multiple assailants as the horses rear and struggle against their harnesses. Several of the bandits lay dying on the ground, one tries to control the horses, two are running away and one is in the process of falling dead after being shot.Though not a primary military arm during the American Civil War, handguns were commonly privately purchased by soldiers for use on the battlefield. Whether legend or fact, it is interesting to note something commonly read about pocket revolvers of the day: that while they could be used for self-defense against the enemy, many soldiers kept them on their person to defend themselves against an unwanted amputation in the primitive field hospitals that were notorious, even in their day.This specimen features a 6 inch barrel. The bottom of the grip strap is scribed with an “H”. The overall condition is good. The metal surfaces have a mottled gray patina. The markings are mostly clear and legible. The cylinder scene is about 75%. The walnut grips are smooth and in good condition. The bore is fair. The action is strong.Own the original! This is a legitimate antique and not a reproduction.Barrel is 6 inches in length.Caliber: .31 percussionOverall condition as seen in photos."

G. Anschutz GmbH, Ulm, W. Germany Model: Match 54 Serial Number: 76328 Year of Manufacture: 1969 Caliber: .22 Long Rifle Action Type: Single Shot Bolt Action Markings: The left side of the barrel at the receiver is marked with an “Eagle / N” nitro proof, a “69” date code and an Ulm antler proof. The left side of the receiver is marked with “Eagle / N”, “76328” and “Made by J. G. Anschutz GmbH. Waffenfabrik Ulm/D. West Germany”. The top of the barrel is marked “Anschutz – Modell Match 54 / --Cal. .22 long rifle—“ and the top of the receiver’s chamber ring is marked “ANSCHUTZ”. Barrel Length: The heavy target grade barrel is 27 1/8” long and has a recessed crown. There are lathe marks about 2 ¾” inches from the muzzle as though the front section was screwed onto the rear section, but we can see no line in the bore to indicate the barrel is in two pieces. The barrel measures 0.943” behind the lathe marks and 0.960” in front of the lathe marks, so there isn’t enough metal to support threads in any case. The top of the barrel still has its markings, so the barrel wasn’t turned after marking at the factory. Sights / Optics: The top front of the barrel has a male fore-aft dovetail installed with a large globe sight clamped to it. The sight has provisions for the use of different sight inserts and the current insert is a donut style sight. There are two male fore-aft dovetails 0.475” in width screwed to the top of the barrel for attaching scope rings and the top of the receiver is grooved for scope or iron sight mounts. There is an Anschutz target sight mounted on the top of the receiver with micrometer adjustments for elevation and windage. The left side of the sight base is marked “ANSCHUTZ”. The sight has a screw-in aperture marked “1.1” with a tiny aperture and an outer diameter of 0.985”. Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is one piece walnut with a varnished finish. The buttstock has a thumb hole with palm heel cut-out on the right side and has a checkered vertical pistol grip with a palm swell. The front face of the forend is undercut and marked with white paint with “16”. The buttstock also has an alloy buttplate that provides an adjustable length of pull via a thumb screw. Various recoil pads or pronged metal buttplates may be attached to this buttplate. The forend has a 14” long grooved alloy accessory rail inlet into it and there is a short 1 ¼” grooved accessory rail inlet into the right side of the pistol grip. There are a few dings and scrape marks in the smooth palm heel cut-out on the right side of the stock, several dings and drag lines in the buttstock area, deep drag lines under the cheekpiece on the left side of the buttstock and wear with a few tiny chips missing at the bottom front edge of the pistol grip. There are multiple dings, bruises, drag lines and scratches in the forend. The grip checkering shows light to moderate wear with a few light mars. The LOP measures 10 ¾” from the front face of the trigger to the rear edge of the buttplate at its center when screwed all the way in, and 12 ½” when extended. The stock rates in about Very Good condition. Type of Finish: The barrel, receiver and bolt are blued. The trigger guard has a matte gray finish and the accessory rails and buttplate are unfinished alloy. Finish Originality: All Original Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling shows extremely light wear. There is no erosion. Overall Condition: This rifle retains about 95% of its metal finish. There is thinning and a few light handling marks in the front 3” section of the barrel and a few tiny marks through the finish in the remainder of the barrel’s finish. There are a few scratches in the top of the receiver’s chamber ring and a few light marks at the front of the trigger guard. The bolt knob shows a spot of thinning. There are screw marks throughout the accessory rail in the forend. Overall, this rifle rates in about Fine condition. Mechanics: The action functions correctly. It has a very light single stage trigger set at 4.3 ozs. We have not fired this rifle. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance standards. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: The Anschutz micrometer sight is included. Our Assessment: This is a Anschutz Model Match 54 single shot bolt action rifle intended for prone position target shooting. It has a single set trigger that is currently set at 4.3 ozs., an adjustable buttplate, an Anschutz micrometer adjustable rear sight and a long globe front sight. The rifle features an Anschutz action, a target grade barrel, and a heavy thumb hole walnut stock with a vertical pistol grip inletted for the heel of the palm. The rifle is in about Fine condition with about 95% of its finish remaining. The bore is bright with very light wear in the rifling and no erosion. We think this would make an excellent rifle for benchrest or prone target shooting, especially with its micrometer sights and ultralight trigger. The receiver sight alone is worth more than some people are willing to pay for a plinker, so we think the serious target shooters will be very interested in this rifle. CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: This rifle can be transferred in California."
