The feed ramp was split down the middle with a chunk missing the slide lock inoperable being the biggest. I tried to call and text but he ignored me untill i began messaging his family asking a way to contact him. When he finaly called me back he said that i was being a crybaby and i should man up and accept the trade had been done.I am simply warning you that he does not mind trading your working gun for his junk and then not being willing to make it right.

The rounds snap in to the moon clips - so they're just as secure as a traditional speed loader. Competition revolver shooters swear by moon clips, because they're such a fast reload.Chambered in .45 ACP - a powerful round, but without the muzzle climb of a magnum. Extremely comfortable and quick to shoot. Best of all - being a revolver, it will shoot anything you feed it from super expensive, to super cheap steel or aluminum case ammo.Beefy full-lug barrel on the large S&W N-Frame, matte stainless finish, gold-bead Patridge front sight and adjustable rear sight.

This was a 4+1 capacity gun from the factory. I've labeled this listing to be unique because there are not many 26 inch barrels available and I put the package together myself for my own use. Mossberg doesn't sell the 26 inch barrel seperately, nor do they sell it in a 2-barrel package.The long barrel is ribbed with a fiber optic bead. Also included is the original Mossberg 4-shot spring, spring end cap and screw cap shown in the pictures. mars: a small amount of finish is worn off the trigger housing from mounting an accessory and removing it. The same thing for the Choate +2 tube under the end cap.the bayonet mount does not work to mount a bayonet because the tube is not long enough for the bayonet's front ring mount to go on. but the bayonet mounts in the back lug. another issue with the bayonet mount is that the cap mount will not go on correctly because the breacher part of the tube is too thick. so the tightening lug has to go down or to the side to mount it. if it's down, theoretically, a bayonet would not mount even if the tube was longer, so I put it to the side.I left on the bayonet attachment for looks and the rail mounts. everything comes in the original 930 box.Delivery: you can pay cash for pick it up locally. For the local pick-up option, you also must be legally able to purchase this firearm int this state and show me your ID and sign a firearms sales receipt.2nd option: send me a check or money order that I cash and I ship to your designated FFL in your state.

There are photos of everything posted. Please let me know if you want any specific photos. Also, all information is to the best of my ability and I included many close photos of every bullet type. I am sure many know much more than I do, so if there is anything that looks incorrect, please let me know. Three boxes of vintage very early 60s 264 Magnum ammo. THERE ARE 2 of the 1962 lot number full boxes of Winchester Super Speed ammo. This is W2641 ammunition. The third box is another early 60s Winchester box but has 13 R P vintage rounds of 264 Magnum ammo that has a slightly longer bullet with a small flat soft point. There are 5 additional rounds from other boxes with 2 being the same ammo as the 2 full boxes. All of this ammo is from the same few years as the entire lot of this caliber was bought with the rifle by the original owner at the same time. He bought a Winchester Model 70 with 12 boxes of factory ammunition and I am selling a few of the boxes. There is a 4th box with brass available also, see below. The boxes are all pre Child Safety Warning which supposedly began in 1962 but the 2 boxes from 1962 are from January 3rd. This is from the lot codes on the inside end-flaps. I never had a rifle in this hot caliber and was surprised to see the cases are belted like a Weatherby. The 2 original boxes are listed as 100 grain Soft Point with 3700fps and 3040 foot pounds at the muzzle. The 3rd box should date to 1965 BUT there is no safety warning which is strange but the ammo inside is 13 factory R-P plus 2 factory Winchester brand from the other 2 boxes plus 3 R-P rounds. The 2 full boxes have the Olin Mathieson logo on the rear. ROUND COUNT WIN SUPER SPEED 100gr Soft Point (44) R-P Longer Bullet Small Flat Tip (13) R-P 100gr Soft Point (3) TOTAL (59) The two full boxes from 1962 are a great collector item as the empty boxes sell on Ebay BONUS---Also Included is a 1960 Win Super Speed box missing one end flap but with 14 vintage fired brass cases. The rifle was a Winchester Model 70 **NEW AMMO is $45 a box???** PLUS SHIPPING (on GB)Just looked on Grafs and $40-$50 a box for the US brands.

Barrel is marked ""June 1944,"" has 2 grooves, and is in very good condition. Stock is marked ""OG"" indicating Ogden Arsenal rework (straight stock). The rifle is a re-commissioned honor guard rifle, so there's a slight mar on the finish where the magazine cut-off was reactivated. Comes with a Remington front site hood which was used to protect front site when in armory, a proper M1 bayonet (Union Fork & Hoe), a new MI USGI-repro sling (OD canvas).  Price is $775 cash, sold as package only, no trades, and price is  firm. I will meet buyer part way at most west metro 2nd amendment friendly parking lots (i.e. Fleet Farm, Dick’s, Bill's, etc.). If ad is up, rifle is still available. I will only respond via phone call, so include phone number. Thanks for looking"
