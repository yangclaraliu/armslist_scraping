The .22 caliber Heritage Manufacturing Rough Rider Combo is one of those Single Action Army revolvers that take you back in time. The six shot cylinders, spur hammer, simulated case hardened finish, and laminated camo grips elicit images of Cowboys and Indians or perhaps Tough Lawmen. Being a combo kit this Rough Rider incorporated additional flexibility by including both .22 Long Rifle and .22 Magnum cylinders. This provides flexibility with some serious potential for fun at the range with the family.

The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. The SR-556 employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. 

Every SR-556 is built with a cold hammer-forged, mil-spec 41V45 barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. The smooth, trim, lightweight ergonomic handguard features a flattop receiver with a Picatinny Rail. A 6-position telescoping M4-style buttstock is mounted on a mil-spec diameter tube. Each SR-556SE comes with one Magpul PMag 30-round magazine and a soft-sided case.

For sale is a wonderful condition and very collectible Colt AR15a2 Sporter II. Colt made this in the 1980's and are no longer produced. Everything on this rifle and every part is original to the rifle and Colt manufactured. This is a very nice collector's item. Barrel markings reads ""CMP 5.56 Nato 1/7"" Comes with the original sling, maintenance kit and magazine. Also comes with a Tapco mag (both mags are 30 rounds). Perfect working condition with very few signs of use and perfect bore. According to Colt this was made in 1985 and is therefore preban. This will only go up in value as they are no longer manufactured. If you have any questions please let me know."

Interested in trading? Its a AR pistol (AM ) custom made by Anderson MFG and SOTArms. The Anderson MFG is known for how clean and how easy it is to clean with just soap and water with no oil. Crazy i know but i looked it up and people love them and the SOTArms is made for precision accruracy. It is still new with only two mags fired from it a week ago and never had to be cleaned just yet. The guy I got it from was older and had it custom built and it has a redjacket mag so idk if that was who built it or not but it also has a M16A1 Bolt Carrier Group and heavy springs for Hot loads. When we test fired it has no probs with .223 or .556 and runs like a dream. Thanks, josh.               

It's a pistol and you can't put a stock on it. But you can add a arm brace on it and a and barrel shroud to give it a rifle look. Or you can attach a actual stock to it and tac weld the barrel shroud on it and as long as it meets the right length you have you a legal SBR without having to do all the ffl paper work. I have it like this so i could carry it in my truck loaded.  So for around 100$ you can make it how you want it by just adding two parts. Barrel shroud and stock."

943,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3107943,For Sale/Trade:  Alpha Thor CCW Jacket,"El Paso, El Paso, Texas",$ 200,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 27, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Stealth Exterior: Jacket exterior is made from a quiet (not crunchy) softshell in a black, IR-signature reducing matte finish that blends into the landscape.Covert Styling: Exterior pockets and panels are designed to be subtle and not print as a tactical-styled jacket. Removable exterior branding completes the slick exterior look.Rapid Access Panels (RAPs): The RAPs provide access to a mid-layer of pocketing without needing to unzip the jacket. They are completely ambidextrous, and are also pockets themselves, sized to carry an iPad or even a laptop. These cavernous pocket panels can be used as a dump pouch for mag changes or even for evidence collection or foraging in a survival/wilderness E&E situation. The lower 2/3 of the panel interiors are lined with tricot (non-crunchy soft side loop material as on the interior of camera bags) for attaching hook-side accessories like holsters, mag holders and pouches. These panels are the heart of your CCW pocket system and provide flexibility to customize how you carry gear based upon your mission. Read the Operator Manual for holster suggestions and gear ideas.Sleeve Dagger Pockets: Taking a page from the OSS, long, narrow, tricot-lined pockets are concealed on the inner wrist of each sleeve to hold a sleeve dagger like the Benchmade SOCP. They also hold small flashlights, pens and similarly-sized items.Hidden Tech Features: There is an interior clear touch cell phone pocket so you can see your touchscreen phone (and use it) through the clear material without removing it from your pocket. All pockets include SeV's patented Personal Area Network (PAN) to route wires for power or communications from any pocket to any other pocket.RFID-blocking Pocket: The jacket contains one secure travel documents pocket with a color-coded large locking zipper. This RFID-blocking interior pocket is sized to hold a passport and wallet and constitutes a strong first line of defense against RFID skimming tech attacks. Check out the Operator Manual for more details about the RFID pocket (page 5). If you want full-spectrum electronic signal blocking, check out the ShieldSak, which can even take your phone off-grid.Warmth The Alpha Jacket is designed for use in ""chilly"" weather down to cold weather. While warmth is ultimately subjective, our warmth chart shows about where we think it falls on the spectrum.Water-repellence The exterior is 100% poly softshell material. The Alpha is not designated as ""waterproof"" because it does not have sealed seams, but the material itself is very water resistant. It has a TPU membrane, which prevents water from soaking in to reach you even if the exterior gets wet. We tested this during a freak torrential rain/hail storm at our headquarters in Idaho in September, 2013 when we ran outside in the Alpha for 5 minutes. Some rain soaked into the outer shell, but not a drop made it inside."

I have seen trench guns appraised in poor condition for 1200-2400 and read the training model may be worth up to double but they can't really say as they weren't as abundant as trench or riot guns and few have been sold ( The only ordered a few from what I've read in this configuration) I need the money and will take 900

Martially badged (By U.S Government) remington model 10 

Is rare air gunner anti aircraft training model used by the U.S during WWI and WWII 

The anti aircraft training model is of the rarest variation of model 10's made for the u.s

This is an early order U-159347 I be leave it's between 1916-21 it has U.S flaming bomb insignia as well as u.s stamp the barrel is prior to date stamps which started in 1921 on remington shotguns

Has a lot of bluing left though it's never been refinished.

I would rate it at about 75% out of 100% on condition

Function wise everthing operates as it should.

The gun is equipped with the 32 inch full choke D grade barrel which is mostly why they are valuable most u.s model 10's were used as trench or riot guns and came with a shorter barrels in the 18-26 inch range making it ideal for training airgunners. 12 gauge

The stock is has checkered engraving but has not been recut or re laquered 

The gun is in an in restored state and I believe restoring it would be a waste as it is in really good shape overall for being around 97 years old.

This bike is in excellent condition for its age. I have not seen another one in this condition. In 1984 Honda made a 350cc, Dual Carb version of their most popular on/off road bike. It has never been wrecked or layed down. all plastic, paint and decals are factory original. it has never spent one night outside. It cranks on the first kick and runs perfectly. The only one I have found near the condition mines in is $1800. I'm asking $1400, but cash talks. I gotta get it gone this week. Call or text REDACTED. I can send you pics,  but its better in person. Thanks, Mac
