Dual Lever Left side 30mm 
 
DESCRIPTION
 
Dual lever mount that was initially engineered for the FN SCAR weapon family. We also use this mount on AR10/SR25 type weapons as the upper receiver is long enough to establish proper eye relief with most scopes. Levers can be configured on left or right side. We recommend levers on opposite side of cocking handle. If cocking handle is on the left for example, then order mount with “RR” suffix, meaning levers on the right. Left side levers will have the “LL” suffix.
 
DESIGN FEATURES
 
The Precision Optic Mount features the Patented [US Patent 8,567,105] BLAC™ lever system which was designed around the following parameters:
 
Must be compatible with any 1913 Specification Rail, to include systems that are out of specification (within reason) and this includes Weaver rails.
Must be completely tool and user adjustable free. It needs to be 100% self contained and mate securely to any rail without the user having to tailor the pressure/engagement position.
Must lock with enough pressure to positively attach any device or optical instrument to a rail without movement, static or dynamic forces not withstanding.
The rail must not experience any deformation due to user error. This must include synthetic (plastic/polymer/composite) rail systems.
Auto Index capability. The device must also index parallel to the bore. The unit must always repeat the forward shift (recoil forces direction of influence) not only to maximize zero repeatability, but to take this step of installation out of the users initial mounting sequence. Index must be redundant.
Unit must not shoot loose due to improper mounting or a mechanical bottoming out.
The system must incorprate a safety that prevents the lever from being accidentally opened. The safety must be able to be manipulated in conjunction with the lever rotation, so that only one hand is required to open it.
The unit will utilize constant force to ensure required pressure in all conditions. The force must be substantial to prevent any shift forward/aft left/right.
The pressure must be applied in a linear direction centered in the main body to prevent cocking of the mount.
It must be easy to manipulate by gloved or fatigued hands.
It must be extremely robust, and withstand shock and impact to the system housing.
There were others, but by listing them we would compromise our trade secrets.

You'll have nearly identical ergonomics to the Whiskey-3 with only a little more time involved in adjusting the different aspects like the length of pull. Furthermore, you'll have all the standard benefits of a chassis like the use of AICS magazines, a variety of mounting points for slings, barrier stops, etc., and V-bedding for the action while not having to sell off a kidney to pay the price of admission.  To accomplish our design intent, we kept the features that everyone wants and needs and eliminated those that weren't necessary. Then we utilized efficient manufacturing processes to keep production costs down and in turn keep the price to the shooter down. The end result is a hybrid aluminum and polymer chassis that we think you'll love.  We're proud to present the X-Ray chassis, the result of years of careful design, thought, refinement, and hard work."""
