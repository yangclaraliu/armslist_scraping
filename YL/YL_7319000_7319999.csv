Proven Burris engineering combines with state-of-the-art refinements for accuracy and precision. Its 5-times zoom system provides a wide field of view and powerful ranging. The front focal plane reticle design allows accurate computation of distances at any magnification. It also provides both trajectory and windage reference points. Accurate and repeatable quarter-MOA adjustments allow for fine-tuning. And side-adjustable parallax lets you instantly correct parallax while maintaining your shooting position. Features: – Designed for serious big game and varmint hunters– Its Ballistic Plex E1 FFP Varmint reticle provides a precise platform for measuring distance and determining target size; it provides MOA tick marks across the horizontal crosshair and across the upper portion of the vertical crosshair– Trajectory compensation has been calculated out to 700 yds.; wind dots represent a 10 m.p.h. wind adjustment at every hash mark below the vertical center point– Multi-turn target knobs offer up to 15 MOA of adjustment per rotation– The 50 mm objective allows for maximum light collection– Versatile 5-times zoom system provides a larger field of view at close ranges and better target acquisition at long ranges– Front focal plane reticle design allows the reticle size to increase or decrease as magnification is increased or decreased; trajectory compensation is always correct and proportional for the selected power setting; also called first focal plane or FFP– Reticle measurements remain correct and proportional to the target, regardless of power setting– Reticle features are useful for determining target size and distance to the target, and for trajectory compensation at multiple magnification settings– Progressively Thick Crosshairs (PTC) are very fine in the center and progressively thicker away from the center, for ultra-fast target engagement in low light at close ranges; effective at any magnification– Zero Click Stop adjustment knobs allow a quick, easy return to the original yardage setting without counting clicks– Advanced windage and elevation adjustment matches the reticle’s MOA measurement system; adjustment is accurate, repeatable, fast, and easy– Ergonomic side focus allows for easy-to-reach parallax adjustment from 50 yds. to infinity– High-grade optical glass provides excellent brightness and clarity with lasting durability– Index-matched, Hi-Lume multicoating provides low-light performance and glare elimination– Double internal spring-tension system allows the scope to hold zero through shock, recoil, and vibrations– Waterproof– Nitrogen-filled body tubes prevent internal fogging in the cold and rain– Precision-gauged and hand-fitted internal assemblies maintain a consistent point of impact through the magnification range, regardless of shock and vibration– Solid, 1-piece outer tube is stress-free and durable—withstands shock and vibration from even the heaviest-recoiling calibers– 30 mm body tube Specifications: – Magnification: 5x-25x– Reticles: SCR MOA– Knob Style: MAD System MOA– Objective Lens Diameter: 59 mm– Clear Objective Lens Diameter: 50 mm– Ocular Lens Diameter: 44.25 mm– Finish: Matte– Focal Plane: FFP– Main Tube Size: 30 mm– Field of View: 21 low – 4.3 high (ft. @ 100 yds.)– Eye Relief: 3.50″ – 4.25″– Exit Pupil: 10 low – 2.0 high (mm)– Click Value: 1/4 MOA– Elevation Adjustment, Total Capability: 64 MOA– Windage Adjustment: 30 MOA– Parallax/Focus: Side focus/PA– Adjustable Parallax: 50 yds. – infinity– Length: 16.4″– Weight: 28.2 oz."

Without a doubt, the Browning Cynergy began as the most technologically advanced over and under shotgun available. It has been called ""revolutionary."" And when you shoot one it could very well transform your shooting abilities. Truly Innovative Even on the rack, a Browning Cynergy sets itself apart from other over and under shotguns. Open the breech and you’ll know why. The low-profile Cynergy is a new experience in over and under shotguns with performance, recoil control, speed and reliability that you must shoot to fully appreciate. Reverse Striker Mechanical Trigger The Cynergy features the innovative Reverse Striker ignition system; a striker-based, mechanical trigger that offers the benefits of a crisp feel, reduced locktime and less overtravel than other over and under shotguns. Because inertia is not needed for the hammers to set, the design eliminates the possibility of the second barrel not firing. Cynergy target models are equipped with the Triple Trigger™ System, allowing you to adjust the length of pull and switch between styles of trigger shoes: Wide checkered, narrow smooth or wide smooth canted. The Inflex Technology recoil pad system provides long travel recoil reduction for a massive 25% decrease in felt recoil on 12 gauge guns and makes recoil virtually non-existent on small gauge guns. A slick Parylene coating prevents the pad from snagging on clothing and allows the recoil pad to remain soft. Longer, tapered Vector Pro dimensions minimize shot deformation and maximize pattern uniformity, consistency and density. Back-boring increases bore diameter specifications and decreases friction between the shot cup and the bore to maximize shot pellet velocity and to reduce felt recoil. Reducing constriction from the forcing cone on the shot column results in fewer deformed pellets for more uniform patterns, and keeps more pellets in the central part of the pattern where they’re needed to bag more upland birds, waterfowl and clay targets. The strong MonoLock Hinge design is the engineering behind the Cynergy’s low profile receiver. The MonoLock Hinge is the integration of the monobloc and the hinge, and has up to 300% more surface area to pivot on than traditional trunnion-style hinges. Rectangular locking pins provide extra strength and feature a “Wear-In Relief” that keeps the action tight. Jeweling adds a beautiful appearance, smoother function and improves durability. Impact Ejectors are aided by the punch of a secondary striker spring for more positive, reliable ejection of fired hulls from the chambers. Unfired shells are elevated for easy removal. See the pics; I show it all so you know exactly what you are buying, nothing hidden & NO surprises.

If you have trades let me know what you have.For 850$ I will include the Ruger 5 round magazine, one 30 round Ruger magazine, and one 20 round off brand magazine (never used the offbrand magazines yet)For 1150$ I will include all of the magazines pictured which is seven 30 round Ruger magazines, the 5 round Ruger magazine, and five off brand magazines. I will not sell the extra magazines without first selling the gunI will not ship."

Makes cleaning the barrel and receiver a breeze too since you can easily remove it with no tools. This is the kit only, doesn't have the handguard with it. You can buy the handguard from Pantheon Arms or you can use quite a few different Yankee Hill Handguards. You can check the PA website to see which ones are compatible.

The case is in about Fine condition. Our Assessment: There is a great line in the Crocodile Dundee movie where Dundee pulls out his large knife saying “That’s Not a Knife – This is a Knife”. Well, this is certainly a rifle. From Barrett’s website: “Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again. Available in both .50 BMG and .416 Barrett, the Model 99 brings new levels of long-range precision shooting. Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.”. This is a Barrett Model 99 rifle with a 32” barrel chambered in .416 Barrett. It has a 3 port fan shaped muzzle brake, M1913 steel Picatinny optics rail, a detachable bipod with adjustable legs, a match grade trigger and a bolt with enough threads on it to lock-up Fort Knox.

I've cleaned every single speck of cosmoline out of it, checked the headspace, and made sure she fires properly. I picked this rifle specifically out of a crate of about 20 or so, specifically because it has a good bore, a hex receiver, and it has slightly rarer brass bands on the top handguard that I polished up a little bit to make them brighter. Someone who is a little more adventerous than I with solvents could likely polish those brass bands up to a nice and bright gold color. The shellac coating on the wood has a bit of wear, but it's probably been sitting in a crate for eighty years, so that's not surprising. Every single part is matching, even the buttplate and bayonet.Comes with the rifle, it's cleaning kit and tools, and a few stripper clips.I'm the first owner of this rifle since it's importation, and I'm just tossing it up for trade since I don't shoot it that much.
