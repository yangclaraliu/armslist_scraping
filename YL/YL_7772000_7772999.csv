The Classics bring timeless and coveted models back in production. Each model, known for its legendary performance, has been enhanced with modern advantages. Smith & Wesson Classics embody the best of both worlds.This small revolver, designed primarily for plainclothesmen and off-duty police officers, made its public debut at The International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in 1950. At the conference, the Smith & Wesson sales force asked the police chiefs to vote on a name for the new revolver. The most commonly suggested name was .38 Chief’s Special®. Designed with the needs of law enforcement officials in mind, the Chief’s Special proved to be a popular revolver for personal protection due to its size and weight. When Smith & Wesson adopted model numbers in 1957, the Chiefs Special became the Model 36.Smith & Wesson J-Frame revolvers have had your back since 1950. These small revolvers were designed to fire full power rounds and are as simple and easy to use as they are reliable. Available in various calibers and with three diverse hammer designs, it is no surprise that the Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular, small-frame, defense revolver on the market."

The entire gun is blued and polished, the pictures don’t do it justice, it was heated to give it a multi color and dipped in oil to blue it. The gun is in fantastic shape and very accurate! I made it to look old but it’s a brand new gun! I can make grips for it if you’d like. Make a cash or trade offer. Text me at 417-251-one six seven three"

Prefer a 700 Will trade my conceal 1911 45 ultra compact 45 in box with 2 mags slide is ported but not the barrel for the rifle. I do not want to add cash just straight trade.   I do not want to sell this gun anymore due to the lowballing lunatics on here so trade only. This has been a carry gun for years so NO it is NOT brand new in perfect mint factory condition but also isnt rusted or pitted or dinged up if you want a gun thats in mint condition never fired and perfect you need to go to dealer and buy brand new  instead of on here. This finish is a polished stainless 2 tone on slide though. The bluing on top of slide is worn but easy reblue job if your worried about it. I can re blue it myself but its a carry gun so no point in it.  Other than that the function of the gun is flawless. So please dont play the 100 email question game.  Its exactly what i am posting and if you cant keep your word and trade do not email me.   Im easy to deal with i just dont play the games 90% of people on here play. Im not worried about making money on a trade nor do i plan on trading you to resell for profit i just want the rifle im looking for.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line.Now, specific to the one for sale............I purchased this item brand new and have fired only a few mags through it.  It is very smooth, reliable, and surprisingly accurate.  Never had a hangup ever, but I've decided to keep my G36 as my primary CCW instead.  The item includes the Hogue grips shown and the original rosewood grips, case, papers, etc.  Also includes a nice Kydex IWB holster!Like new.Email me or call with questions.  Must present a valid firearms license at time of purchase.

I wanted to add a single stack gun so the XD-S was a no brainer since it had all the same features. I bought a XD-S and out of the box the trigger felt a little gritty when dry firing. I ordered and installed the PRP spring upgrade kit and polished a lot of the internals while I had the gun apart. It now has a much smoother trigger with a nice crisp break. I also bought an additional new Springfield 9rd mag with sleave at a gun show ($45). I was all set and took the gun out to shoot it for the first time. It shot very well however after just a few rounds the second nuckle on my second finger was hurting. Due to my long thin fingers, my nuckle rides right into the side of the trigger guard because of the undercut guard and thin grip. I have since tried single stack Glocks and they do the same thing. I have not heard complaints on line about this so I think it is just my hand size and shape. Anyway with the gun you will get an additional 9rd brand mag, a 7rd with grip extension, and a 7rd with both flat plate and extension; installed PRP spring kit and polished internals; Unused Springfield paddle holster and mag holster; both backstraps; and case with all paperwork. If interested I can send more pics and answer any questions. Small print: cash only, ftf, I must see current IN Driver’s Lic and prefer carry permit, and will have bill of sale. No BS from me and I expect none from you. Thanks"

STI continues its push for honest, game changing innovation with the introduction of the Costa Carry Comp. Its island comp BBL is machined from a single piece of stainless steel, which eliminates timing issues and the potential to come loose. The front sight is attached to the compensated BBL—making this the first ever barrel with a compensator in front of an island sight. The technology further reduces muzzle jump and enables you to keep eyes on the front sight rather than the blast of the comp. The comp reduces recoil by 63%. The STI RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system further reduces recoil, effectively making this the flattest, smoothest shooting pistol on the market."

Appears this one saw service in our Civil War, and is in good condition. Over 300,000 were acquired by the North and South, second in quantity only to the British Enfield. While many were issued in the original .54 caliber,this one was bored out to @ .58 Cal.  The wood is beechwood. The iron mounts are generally smooth. The bolster, rear of breech and forward part of the lock plate show typical evidence of firing with corrosion from the percussion caps. The date “860” is visible on the lock - the Austrians used only the last three digits of the year, indicating the gun was made in 1860. Front sight is in place as is the original ramrod.  Example of a typical Civil War infantry arm acquired for both Southern and Northern Units in lieu of Springfields and Enfields. Many were acquired early in the War for to arm infantry regiments being organized by the Northern states (my ancestor reportedly carried one in the 3rd Mass Infantry, 1862-63).  Southern use included the Army of Western Tennessee, VMI, et al."
