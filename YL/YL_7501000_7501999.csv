All work done to this pistol was done by a local professional gunsmith. This is not homebuilt.This is a Macon Armory blowback upper that was cut down and rethreaded. The lower is a YHM and it has a KAK brace. The builder is a Cerakote applicator and he painted it the sniper gray. It has 6 (maybe 8 i'll have to recount) 21 round magazines and a hard case. This pistol preforms. It has minimal kick and very little rise. It is an absolute beast. I will sell it in a few different ways1. Pistol only 13002. W/ YHM bui's 13753. W/ Vortex Spitfire 1x - 15254. W/ buis and Vortex - 16005. W/ Inforce 800 lumen no sights - 14506. W/ entire package - 1725 (I will include some Hornady Critical Defense rounds with this package)Again this is not a homebuilt junk ar pistol, this is a professionally built pistol and it shows. Do not lowball me. If it doesn't sell at the advertised price it will not sell.  I am not interested in trades. I will only meet in a very secure location, preferably a gun shop that I am familiar with.  I want to see an indiana drivers license (no id's must be a valid drivers license) this is a pistol so over 21 only, and I want to see your indiana LTCH. I prefer to meet in Columbus. This one is worth the drive.  You will not see another one like this. No Checks, Cash only.  This is the gun that will make your friends jealous and keep your home protected. Prefer text to email but either is fine eight one two 560 zero seven three five."

Barrel was treated in the same fashion as was the lower receiver. So the rifle was/is uniform with one type of lube/clp This AR is 100% U.S. manufactured including the upgraded parts.  The following upgrades have been added and include receipts: $150 LT3 Single Stage drop in trigger with a 3lb pull and that’s about as minimal in movement as it gets. $67.99 5.56/.223 Heart Breaker Muzzle Brake in black Cerakote threaded on and crush washer used. $159.99 Vortex StrikeFire 2 (4 MOA) Both Red and Green dot with various brightness settings, flip up lens covers with a Cantilever AR-15 Mount on the Picatinny rail.

Outside range bag pockets each have six hidden magazine pouches. Carry handle, but also includes back-pack straps on the back side of it. (I paid $89) Still has the tags on it Includes 100 rounds of Magtech CBC 5.56mm Nato M193 55 Gr Full Metal Jacket Again, this AR-15 is not only manufactured beyond many of the Mil-Spec tolerances as the manufacturer is Layke Aerospace/Tactical who also manufacture with the same machinery complex aerospace and missile technological parts and used the same methods on their AR receivers, etc.  Some facts about the manufacturing/production: This rifle has a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer on it. It is also one of the few fully American made AR-15 rifles that are made beyond “mil-spec” standards as they are built to Aerospace Precision tolerances. Layke Tactical, aka Layke Aerospace is known in the complex aerospace and missile industry for the highest quality products and produce their firearms the same way. These are some of the finest AR’s made and again, there’s no parts on this gun made outside the U.S. Layke Aerospace/Tactical is here in Phoenix and gladly shows its customers a tour of their facility if you visit to see exactly how they’re made unlike many other manufacturers
Over $1,700 at my cost. I’m firm at $950.00 (which is $350 less than just the stock rifle by itself on sale and not counting the furniture) Please understand I am selling the rifle and all installed upgrades for that price. The extra’s (ergo case, bullets etc are just thrown in for good measure and have nothing to do with the price I’m asking). Thanks for your inquiries."

Obviously the Sphinx is a little unique, so please do your research if you haven't heard of them. Ultimately, it's a Swiss made, many parts hand fit, CZ 75 style pistol. I had a dealer purchase this for me, sight unseen. While the pistol lives up to everything the internet/YouTube reviewers say, I train more with a striker fire pistol than a DA/SA style firearm. I swapped the sights for a 10-8 Performance blacked out rear sight, and a ZR Tactical fiber optic front sight. Included in this set up is a (new) Surefire XC1 and a High Threat Concealment inside the waistband holster with 4 different belt clip options. I literally never carried it. I took it to the range once and dry fired it a handfull of times. My ""trial and error"" could be your opportunity to snag something really nice.I cant find these pistols less than $750 (gun broker), and I actually paid more for mine. The XC1 was about $230 from Amazon, and the holster was $130... Add taxes and transfer fees, etc... I have well over $1,100 into this. I am looking for $800OBO (or best REALISTIC offer) I still have the original box and paperwork for the pistol. I am not really interested in shipping, so if you're out of the area, you're going to have to make it worth my wild.

I have ALL original springs, as well as two other lighter springs if you wanted to get crazy... The pistol is in excellent condition and has only been fired maybe 20 rounds. I have the original box and paperwork. If you're unfamilar with the revolver, I suggest you look it up a bit. This is a j-frame snub from S&W's Performance Center and is fairly unique.

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."
