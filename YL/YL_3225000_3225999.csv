**((SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY PLEASE**

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

Wow, what can I say, this is an incredible gas-piston platform complete and ready to use today on your complete ar-15 lower. This is NOT a kit, this upper came directly from Adams Arms 100% assembled at their factory with their parts. I can't say enough good things about this, if you are not familiar with gas piston Ar-15s, basically there is a spring tension piston that is forced backwards working the bolt carrier group, instead of hot gases and unburned powder entering the chamber in your traditional direct impingement system. The result is a drastically cleaner, faster cycling action, and the hot gases are expelled FOWARD of the operator through the gas system. It is adjustment to 3 positions, full strength which you would use most of the time, a 2nd setting for suppressor, and closed third position which basically will not cycle the bolt after fired and turns it into a bolt action. It sounds complicated but it is actually brilliant and very simple!

This technology is incredible and this upper is great and functions flawlessly for me, the only reason I'm selling is because I spent too much damn money on it, and I decided to go in a less expensive direction with my build. I'm asking a fair price for setup that is 100% ready to use right now with your complete lower, with no work required. Buy it to have an incredible gas piston alternative to your current rifle, or use for your own build to finish an incredible project!

I must clarify, my asking price of $775 INCLUDES the excellent Magpul Mbus Pro (Steel low-profile) sights, but if you don't want these I will gladly pop them off and take off $150. ($150 is my FIRM price on the sights, if anyone is interested). 

This is a great deal guys, here is what these cost from the store...

Per Adams Arms Website: $799.26 (16'' Carbine Base Upper)
Per Magpul Website: Mbus Pro Front: $84.95, Rear: $104.95
Carbine Length MOE Handguard: $24.95
TOTAL MSRP OF: $1,014.11

Realistic Dealer Prices (What I paid):
Adams Arms 16'' Carbine Base Upper: $719.33 (This seems to be the standard dealer pricing I've seen on multiple online stores such as Brownell's, Cheaper than Dirt, Palmetto State Armory etc...)

Magpul Mbus Pro Front: $80.70, Rear: $99.70, Handguard $23.70(from AIM Surplus)

So a total Retail price of $923.43 for these items.... So I'm giving $150 off and your saving about 25 % off a MSRP of over 1K!!

My loss your gain, please email me with addition questions or information desired. Thanks for your time, hope to make a deal soon."

CANNOT BE MADE TO FIRE

Made in Japan
This is Non-firing model that can that can be loaded and disassembled just like real FG42/I. Cannot fire projectiles or BBs.

 This is museum quality replica of German WWII-era paratroopers rifle, FG42. Full metal and wood construction that will satisfy any collector or re-enactor. Includes English manual.

 Full metal and wood construction. Functional spike bayonet, bipod and stock. Fully functional field stripping and assembly just like the real FG42. 

 This replica does not fire plug fire cartridges or projectiles, and it has been specially-designed not to be convertible to a real firearm.

 HISTORY 

 The Fallschirmjaegergewehr 42 (""paratroop rifle model 1942"") was specially requested by Luftwaffe for the German paratroopers after combat experiences had shown the need for specialized small arm for paratroops. Despite long list of difficult requirements the German industry was able to deliver the fully automatic and lightweight FG42 that was ultimately to become one of the influential small arm designs of the war. The lightweight Fallschirmjaegergewehr 42/I (FG42) was a cross between an automatic rifle and a light machine gun that provided Fallschirmjaegers with a powerful automatic weapon chambered to rifle cartridge. The Luftwaffe's requirements included that the weapon be a compact size (for transport inside planes), sufficiently durable, semi & full automatic, weigh no more than a standard rifle, and possess capabilities for hand-to-hand fighting, grenade launching and sniping. All these were achieved but FG42s were produced eventually only in very limited numbers and hence had little impact on overall war effort despite their advanced features. 

 Mechanism wise the FG 42 was considered to be a air-cooled and gas-operated weapon. The straight-line configuration of the weapon mechanism was intended to reduce the recoil of the weapon system, but due to the relatively lightweight and heavy caliber, the FG 42 was difficult to control when fired in full automatic. 

 Despite the limited numbers manufactured the FG42 saw combat in major battles such as the Monte Cassino, Normandy and the Battle of Bulge in Ardennes. 

 REPRODUCTION 

 This is a museum-quality replica FG42 that is fully-functional and field-strippable like the real FG42. It features a functional spike-type bayonet (replica), functional rear & front sights, a cartridge ejection system and an operational cocking lever and system that uses dummy 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridges. The highly detailed and sophisticated full metal and wood construction of this reproduction will satisfy reenactors for its details & quality. Indeed, this reproduction model is displayed in renowned war museums in Europe and is every bit as good as the famed MP44 reproduction. 

 Limited production of FG42 rifle grenade attachments with dummy rifle grenades and ZFG42 scopes have been manufactured for this model (ask us for availability). Spare 20rnd magazines and 7.92x57mm Mauser cartridges are available as accessories. Spare parts are also available for special order.

I'm including a DeSantis OTWB leather holster, 20 rounds of Winchester PDX1 Defender 95 grain JHP ammo, 115 rounds of Winchester 95 grain FMJ target ammo, and 50 rounds of TulAmmo 91 grain FMJ ammo (cheap stuff). S&W doesn't make these with the laser any more. The new without the laser retails at $380. I'm asking $400 for this entire package. It makes a great pocket gun and is excellent for ladies to carry.

Mine is used in the photo because the new ones are currently being built. This rifle is made by a CURRENT member for the US Marine Corps PWS shop in Quantico, Virginia, where some of the finest sniper rifles in the world are made. This is one of only a few rifles that will be for sale. The rifle will come with the rifle and base. It will have the * McMillan HTG non textured forest camouflaged sniper fill stock with sling swivels and brown presentation pad, * Remington 700 clip-slotted short action chambered in M118 7.62x51mm, * Hart 1:12 right hand twist 25” barrel (24” past the recoil lug), * Modified Winchester M70 trigger bow and floorplate, * smooth 3-3.5 lbs trigger , identical clone Unertl MST-100 one piece base/rings, * propper recessed crown, * proper Black Oxide, * all correct markings, USMC Weapons Record Book and PWS proofing test target. This is as real as you can get. No wondering if the prior owner took care of the rifle or broke it in properly. You will be the FIRST OWNER of a true piece of American history to change the modern battle field. This is possibly a chance that you may never get again. Price is $4,300.00 shipped if you use a discrete PayPal payment, if you pay using the ""Goods/Services"" tab, you must add 4%, sorry. The build time is WAY better than the half a year or year that other places quote you. Most places can’t offer that. Why wait half a year or a year for a copy when you can own a REAL M40A1? This is just in time for the limited run of 100 new Unertl MST-100 clone scopes that US Optics is making. I prefer PayPal to protect all parties involved from fraud but will accept US POST OFFICE money orders. The rifle must be shipped to an FFL. Please feel free to ask any questions."

     I am a huge fan and collector of Mosins and copies of the same. I've been collecting Type 53's for a good while now, and some of them don't quite reach my level of standard to 'stay in the safe', what with the luck-of-the-draw surplus firearms, so I'm putting one or two of the rougher rifles up for sale. To clarify, the rifles were hand-selected originally for metal quality. I would rate 'Very Good' on both. These carbines are great little shooters, and more rare than your average 91/30.

    Note, all rifles have been cleaned at least to some degree, both may still have cosmoline in nooks and crannies, and there are most definitely layers of the stuff deep in the stock. It's an afternoon project, but well worth it. No more sticky hands after shooting!

   To clarify for everyone, includes:

         -Type 53 Carbine
         -Ammo Pouch(2)
         -Sling(Unfortunately, the dog collars were apparently not included in the cosmoline covered 'kit'. Weird)


The picture is a stock photo; meant to represent rough condition of the rifles in question. I hand-selected them for quality metal, I didn't really care about the stock, as I planned to refinish them anyways.



Contact me anytime via email, and we will work out the details from there. I also have plenty of spare 7.62x54R lying about if you need ammo.

 This is basically a brand new rifle, as it has seen very little use. Literally not even a full mag down the pipe just to make sure everything works. I recently bought an AK and that is now my focus so something has to go. This gun is a solidly built gun and features an all metal lower, receiver and removable carry handle. The only plastic on it are the stock, handle and forend heat shield. It comes with 2 full setups, 1 being the detachable carry handle with iron site and 2 being the tactically scoped (Simmons Whitetail, 1.5-5 magnification, tactical finish optic) and railed (UTG riser rail and Milltet tactical scope mount) option. This provides point of site with the scope for range or the iron front site for close range shots. Both are awesome setups and they should provide infinite flexibility at any range or under any condition. I am also throwing in 2 metal mags filled with 60 rounds as well as another 80 rounds of boxed WOLF ammo to round out the package. This is one hell of a good deal and will make someone very happy.

Clean No Lien title.

No body rust and only 138k miles 90% highway. Runs great starts every time. Would trust my life going cross-country with it. Original owner was chevy dealer in Illinois used for hauling used autos on trailer, second owner was uncle who used it to travel throughout the states with camper, I have used it to haul motorcycles between MN and WI and daily driver for a few years, maybe 5,000 miles put on by me. Mostly stored indoors and never beat on.

Full tow package, leather seats(no third seat/huge cargo area), comes with security shade and cargo net, floormats, interior is excellent, power everything, new running bars(top of the line no rusting ever), custom black billet grille(one of a kind), bumpers in good shape, new 4x4 control module, new gear shifter linkage, new rear and parking brakes, front brakes 75%, new deep pan, tranny fluid and filter, new u-joints, new oil changed every 6 months, no error codes, 4x4 works great, no leaks of any kind, tires 75%, exhaust in good condition, dual air/heat(very cold a/c and great heat) defrosters work, OnStar equipped(never used it), newer optima deep cycle battery, suspension good(not air ride, so if you ever needs shocks top of the line like Blistens or similar they run 200-500 instead of 2k+ to fix or replace air ride), new headlight, taillight and bumper light housings, new bulbs all the way around(HQ headlight bulbs), made in Janesville, WI not Mexico like the newer gens. MPG 12-15.

Any questions ask. I don't want to get rid of it but I have a new daily driver and I use my dad's superduty when I need to haul motorcycles a few times a year. No room anymore.

Asking $4,500 lowest I will go. Book is $5,600 not including add-ons.

Call/Text or message anytime. Suburban is available for viewing most hours of the week. VIN available at request.

I am dowtown Orlando during days and Oviedo, nights and eves.
I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

This is a 4MOA battle rifle don't let them ar guys tell you anything a ak dose exactly as it was designed to do. It was needed to be a combat rifle meaning it had to shoot the vital zone of a person at 100meeters wich is a 4inch circle where your heart is or the Tbox in your head which is exactly what it dose, 4MOA =4 inches at 100m, now let me inform you of a little kept secret the AR guys don't want you to know, the ak is a 30cal low recoil rifle that is more reliable weapon system than an AR and here's the kicker if you take the most expensive most accurate AR in the world 1/4MOA (1/4inch &100m) and throw an eotech on it guess what it shoots, that's right it becomes a 4moa gun. A gun 1st is only as good as it's shooter and 2nd only as good as the optic on it. All eotechs are 4moa combat sights
So then why is it bad that the ak shoots 4moa with iron sights (built in not removable) and every AR guy wants to put a eotech on there ARs making them 4moa?
I love this rifle more than I can express and have well over 1500 invested into it. It comes with everything I have

The Ruger GP-100 revolver was first introduced in 1985 as a 2nd-generation of the Ruger Double Action revolvers, with intent to replace successful Ruger Security / Service / Speed Six line of revolvers. The GP-100 was a serious improvement over previous Ruger guns. It was made even stronger, with intent to fire an unlimited number of full-power .357 Magnum rounds, and was produced in many variations, with three basic barrel lengths (3"" / 76 mm, 4"" / 102 mm or 6"" / 152 mm), various barrel profiles, with fixed or adjustable sights etc. GP-100 revolvers also are offered in two finish/material variations - blued carbon steel or polished stainless steel. Like most other Ruger guns, GP-100 revolvers are exceptionally strong, reliable and durable, and are great self-defense, security or practice weapons. The Ruger GP-100 revolvers are double-action guns with exposed hammers and swing-out cylinders. No trade."

The benefit of having an AR that is built from a registered lower is you can change the configuration legally into a pistol if you wish. You can not do this with an AR that was sold as a complete rifle. I will include 1 - 30 round magazine for the above price of $600.

For an additional amount I can include 3 more magazines, 60 rounds of Winchester 5.56 ammo, case(your choice of 4 colors) and Truglo red dot optic. If you want everything the price is $750.

Now for the legal stuff you must be a resident of Arizona with ID and CCW is preferred also you must be 21 years old. I am an FFL holder and can transfer this to you that way if you wish but this is part of my personal collection so is not required but I will require you to complete a bill of sale for purchase as I have had past experience with Law Enforcement calling me about a firearm I had sold years before.

Cash is preferred but I do have the ability to take a credit card as well but you will have to add 3% for card fees! You may contact me through email at REDACTED or by phone REDACTED. If you choose to contact me by phone I do prefer text but if you call and I am unable to answer please leave a message and I will return your call"

993,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3225993,For Sale:  CRKT James Williams fixed blade Hisshou knife,"Wauwatosa, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 175,"Listed On: Saturday, July 26, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Knife is like new Display case has not been opened. Knife is un-sharpened and has not been used to cut anything. Here is the description from CRKT:
Let us be clear: the Hisshou™, designed by James Williams, is a specialized tool that is intended for military personnel and special forces operators. James developed this design to meet the specific requests of coalition forces overseas for a more powerful tactical tool than his CRKT Hissatsu™, which is in wide use.

Historically, military swords have been sized to fit the fighting environment. Long swords, such as the English broad sword and Japanese katana, could only be used effectively on open fields of battle. Fighting in close or confined quarters required shorter swords, such as the sailor's cutlass and the Japanese wakizashi, which is similar in size to the Hisshou.

The Hisshou comes into play when the operator's firearms cannot be used, as often happens in entry and search operations. It is designed for multiple carry options depending on the choice of the operator.

The Hisshou's 13"" full-tang dual grind Tanto blade is YK-30 high-carbon steel, high satin finished. The long, tapered tip grind is designed for maximum slashing power combined with superior penetration. At 16.4 ounces, the Hisshou also offers superior slashing ability as compared to the Hissatsu.

James has followed centuries of Japanese tradition in designing the classic cord-wrapped handle with ray skin underlays, which compares very well to more modern handle materials, giving excellent grip under all conditions.

We have designed a custom Kydex® sheath with a patented* quick-release belt-mounting system for the Hisshou. The sheath has detents which grip the knife securely and wide entry lips which allow the knife to be returned to the sheath with one hand.

The belt clip can be attached with the Chicago screws provided for vertical carry. Simply press in the injection-molded nylon retaining clip for instant attachment or release.

The Hisshou demands respect, and is certainly not a sport or work knife, but it can truly be a lifesaver for the military professional. This is a knife that would have been carried by the Samurai."
