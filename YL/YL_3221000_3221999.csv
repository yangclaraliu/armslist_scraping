In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING SHIPPING:

I AM HAZMAT CERTIFIED AND AM WILLING TO SHIP TO ANY STATE  IN THE US EXCEPT ALASKA AND HAWAII. The HazMat fee/surcharge that I have to pay ($28.50) plus ground shipping charges will be added to your order total (ground shipping is $19 for up to 4# and an additional $2.50 for each additional 2# or portion thereof - see table below)

To Place An Order for Shipment: Email a list of the items you want, along with your full name, shipping address, and the email address and phone number where I can best reach you. You will then receive an order confirmation email from me with your total due and detailed payment instructions. 

PLEASE NOTE:  Requested items are made available to other customers if product is not picked up or payment is not received within 7 days and special arrangements for delayed payment haven't been made. 

If you were referred to me by a friend, please let me know so that they can get 10% off their next order as a thank you. If you refer me to a friend or shooting buddy after your order is received and they give me your name at the time of their order - you will receive 10% off your next order. 

Payment is by check or money order. Personal checks and brands of money orders other than US postal money orders must clear before shipping. If payment is made by US postal money order, your package will ship out the same day payment is received.

Offers for amounts other than the price that is listed CAN NOT be considered as all product is priced based on what I have invested in it. The prices for my long list of available powders start at $29/lb and go up depending on how much I had to pay for the case that you are buying from. I am paying the same jacked up retail prices that most of us are having to pay and I travel extensively through multiple states to find supplies for my base of established customers. 

I do not have the ability to buy wholesale and buy only factory sealed cases from established retail outlets and vendors. I CANNOT AND DO NOT **BUY FROM INDIVIDUALS** OR **TRADE PRODUCT** due to my commitment to providing factory fresh, quality, and intact product to my customers. 

I answer emails Monday through Friday, except major holidays. I do arrange for local pickup on weekend when possible- but I take time off to focus on my family and attend church on Saturdays and Sundays."

I am paying the same jacked up retail prices that most of us are having to pay and I travel extensively through multiple states to find supplies for my base of established customers. 

I do not have the ability to buy wholesale and buy only factory sealed cases from established retail outlets and vendors. I CANNOT AND DO NOT **BUY FROM INDIVIDUALS** OR **TRADE PRODUCT** due to my commitment to providing factory fresh, quality, and intact product to my customers.

327,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3221327,For Sale:  INERT-M2-A2 LAW TUBE,"North Nashua, Nashua, New Hampshire",$ 250,"Listed On: Thursday, August 21, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"M72-series LAW is a lightweight, self-contained, antiarmor weapon consisting of a rocket packed in a launcher (Figure 2-1). It is man-portable, may be fired from either shoulder, and is issued as a round of ammunition. It requires little from the user— only a visual inspection and some operator maintenance. The launcher, which consists of two tubes, one inside the other, serves as a watertight packing container for the rocket and houses a percussion-type firing mechanism that activates the rocket.
. Outer Tube. The trigger housing assembly (which contains the trigger assembly) is on the upper surface of the outer tube. So are the trigger arming handle, front and rear sight assemblies, and the launcher's rear cover.

b. Inner Tube. The inner tube telescopes outward toward the rear, guided by a channel assembly that rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube's trigger housing assembly. The channel assembly also houses the firing pin rod assembly, which includes a detent lever assembly. The detent lever assembly moves under the trigger assembly in the outer tube, locking the inner tube in the extended position and cocking the weapon. All this must occur before the weapon can be fired.

THERE IS NO ROCKET.  Once the rocket is fired. the Tube is thrown away. It cannot be re-loaded.  Again for nervous types. This is an EMPTY TUBE. Bought Surplus at a gun show a few years ago.  Makes a great display piece on a wall.

 normally retails for $915 but only asking 490 if paying cash. if want to trade i would like to trade for equal retail price  so if your gun retails brand new at $900 then it would be a fair trade. the reason that the cash difference is so different is because obviously nobody wants to purchase a rife that is used for a price that is too close to the retail price of a brand new rifle that has never been fired.  also i am substantially dropping the cash price for the rifle to make a cash buy more attractive and a trade would potentially more work for me to sell if i choose not to keep the firearm. I like to fire various types of guns and not keep them long due to the fact that i have so many. so I'm open to trades as long as they are fair or if you just want to buy the gun then i feel I'm giving more than a fair price. more than 50% off the MSRP, not including all the accessories.  if you are suggesting a trade please send a picture and DO NOT send in a trade that is worth $400 trade value and cash value are 2 different things and will not entertain any unfair trades.  This rifle is practically brand new and cost roughly $1000 after tax and definitely about $1100 with all the mags and red dot. so please do not try and suggest any ridiculous trades"

It is in like-new condition; it has had about 3 mags run through it and cleaned well. It is the same as the top model listed here: http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=526&CFID=403930263&CFTOKEN=82486042

The one extra factory option I had done when RRA was building it was bead blasting on the outside of the stainless barrel so it is a matte grey color. I also added a Magpul B.A.D. lever and some 45 degree offset irons to it. It currently has a scope on it which isn't for sale (which I mention only because it would likely still be on it when/if you wanted to view it).  

This is an *extremely* accurate AR (like holes touching at 100 yards accurate) with a 1/8 barrel twist and a Wylde chamber. It is the perfect platform to build an exceptional 3-gun rifle out of or use it for hunting. The muzzle brake on it works very well and combined with the soft recoil of the longer gas system it makes 2-3 shot quick taps easy in a 3-gun match. The RRA 2-stage trigger is a big upgrade from a stock milspec AR trigger - short and smooth with a 2.5 lbs. second stage. 

I will include 4 30 round magazines with this rifle, new-in-packaging. 

Please let me know if you have any questions! The retail price on this rifle is $1370 (plus $35 for the bead blasting), so I feel that $950 for a like-new rifle is a really good deal."

It shot perfectly with no malfunctions of any kind and very good accuracy. The EOTECH EXPS2 is the model with the quick release lever mount.  It is a truly amazing sight and you can hit quick with it....almost to easy! It as well is just out of the box and comes with all the original box/paperwork as shown.

The gun is on a Core CXV lower, has the storage grip and a really nice metal trigger gaurd. Has a M4 colapsable stock as shown. Upper is a complete PSA 16"" M4 heavy barrel. It has the low gas block with the 10"" MI floating handgaurd.

This is the one with the removable insert so you can add a flush fitting pressure swith for a tactical light. The upper also has full metal BUIS sights included. The front sight does co-witness with the EOTECH perfectly if you prefer to shoot with it up. 

As mentioned the gun is nearly new and shoots great. If you looking for a well dressed AR with quality components at a fair price then this is for you.

Price is $1250 FTF in Clayton or Raleigh.

It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

""This is easily one of our most popular items by a huge margin. The Original S.O.E. 2 layers of resin coated scuba webbing make for a super stiff belt that will still fit thru belt loops. Lining the inside of the belt (part near your body) with loop velcro makes it even stiffer and it prevents sliding by allowing all belt attachment SOE pouches to lock into place. This belt has a 1.5"" cobra buckle.

We recommend a belt the same size as your pants. If you wear 32"" pants then order a 32"" belt. These belts will adjust outward several inches, but don't get much smaller than the size you order.

Getting out of the AK Game and trying to fund an IWI Tavor.  These are both awesome AKs and both are surprisingly accurate.  The Romanian 1989 Dated CAI import shows some signs of use as it has been used a bit, wear is as would be expected.  The Underfolder is THE tightest locking underfolder I have seen to date.  It locks up SUPER tight, less than 1/10in of movement, and mags have very little to no wobble depending on make.  Alright, down to business.

Trades I would be interested in would be a Tavor, maybe a quality AR15, Beretta M9/92fs, H&K P30 9mm or USP/c or P2000, M&P's or gear.  That's about it, but try me, and please only quality tactical stuff, no jennings, hipoints, hunting rifles, shotguns, bows, etc

The design is based on scaled down Webley Mark 6 “break-top” frame, with cylinder chambered for 6 .38/200 rounds. The hammer/trigger group was redesigned, with manual hammer safety lock added, and with separate cylinder lock. This revolver was adopted for British Military service in 1932 as Enfield revolver, .38 caliber, No.2 Mark 1. After 1938, almost all No.2 Mk1s were converted into No.2 Mark 1* configuration. Enfield No.2 Mark 1* were developed in the late 1930s for British Tank Corps, and are distinguished from early Mark 1 by spurless, Double Action Only hammers, lighter mainsprings, and re-shaped grip side plates. The spurless DAO hammers were required by Tank Corps command to avoid snagging the hammers on tank internals. Enfield No.2 Mark 1** appeared in the 1942 as a simplified, wartime design. These guns were similar to No.2 Mark 1*, but without the hammer stop. After the 1945, all those revolvers were recalled and converted into No.2 Mark 1* configuration.

I fit an Ed Brown match grade barrel and bushing. It locks tight enough into the slide that the recoil lugs click and lock into battery with zero movement whatsoever. I polished the barrel throat and feed ramps, along with fitting the barrel hood. I fit a Wilson Combat barrel link (#4 I believe) and grinded it to a perfect fit. I polished the extractor and refit it. I changed the angle of the ejector for perfect ejections every time. I stoned the sear and adjusted the trigger pull to 4 ½ pounds with no creep. I filed the hammer for perfect contact with sear. I crowned the barrel to 11 degrees and reamed it for perfect headspace. I fit a new safety and it functions very crisp and cleanly. I also hot salt blued the gun on 6/26/14. 

This is a series 80 gun, but I milled a spacer out of 10/18 steel to convert it to a standard series 70. I’ll sell it as a series 80, but I’ll include the spacer for conversion. This gun is a must buy for any bullseye shooter who wants a well-priced match grade gun. I know you'll be happy with this gun. 

I may be able to travel to you for sale.

In particular, I revere the utter humility I experience upon entering into negotiations with some who only knows their particular firearm should sell/trade somewhere between the amount they paid for it at retail, and eleventy-billion dollars (11-tee, 000,000,000 USD).  This is a number one of my friends in high school made up years ago, and it remains my adopted, standard expression for a stupidly high amount of money.  

The hints of this negotiating style are subtle, but follow me on this journey to enlightenment.  It will be just like Back to the Future, except you won’t meet your older mom, dad, or sister's self and Biff is just some guy who doesn’t know how to value guns.  Besides that it’s exactly the same, but Doc isn’t warning you not to change things, and you won't assimilate yourself into doo-wop culture because you slammed some reefer addict's hand in a 56 Belair's door and then have to play four chords of Earth Angel before ripping off Chuck Berry with an Eddie van Halen audio-over.  Still, the similarities are striking.  I share with you the tactics of the masters of this domain:

Tactics (In no particular order)

Tactic # 1: The ubiquitous “Offer” price.

This lets you know that no matter how much you offer, it won’t be enough.  A Glock 19 with an “offer” price tag?  Never fear the uncertainty associated with not using numerical values or specified currencies to indicate desired prices:  You can simply give him double the amount of retail and all the displeasures of private sales can be avoided.  If you offer any less, he will be offended, or as this author has previously coined Armslist related offer offense injury outcomes: “butthurt.”

I imagine each of you has read, memorized, and had reminder notes tattooed inside your armpits the secretive strategies and procedures outlined in the “Proposed Armslist Legislation” posting circulated on here some months ago.  So when individuals get butthurt, you know what to do.  The revised legislation sets forth that you should deploy a “hurt feelings report” and a loading dose of Midol.   Since many of you do not carry those items or possess the wherewithal to deploy them via wireless internet connections, paying double retail is the next best thing to keep the seller from getting Nutella in his man-panties.

Tactic #2:  The fabled “A + B = that gun I really really want.” 

In this trading scenario, the other individual has two guns he wishes to dispose of in order to obtain another one.  Usually this means two out of production long guns for a current production handgun. While nice guns in their own right, these long guns do not sell individually at retail, on the used market, or in the grey market at nearly fifty percent of the used value of the object that “Mr. A+B” desires.  Gun A and Gun B may sell used at around 150 to 200 dollars apiece, far more than the pawn shop would give them.  These fine single shot rifles or entry level shotguns are great to buy at a fair price and use; in fact I would like to buy some of them just to knock around or tinker with.  But they do not command the price of a Glock, XDS, or Dillon Mini-gun.  Nevertheless, notice that when the powers of Gun A and Gun B are combined into a single unified force (not unlike those rings on the old Captain Planet cartoons which harnessed earth, wind, fire, water and heart), they are force to be reckoned with.  At this point, your higher value pistol has been devalued to two entry level long guns.  Should you resist this devaluation, “Mr. A+B” will entice you with odd things such as airsoft or gaming systems.  Just think, instead of owning a handgun you paid retail for, you could trade it for two deer killers which you won’t use because you’re addicted to playing Sonic the Hedgehog.

Tactic #3:  The tactic of “I admit I don’t know about what you have on trade offer, but it ain’t as good as mine….so I’m gonna need some more cash on it/I’m gonna have to have a range day (at your expense of time and money) before I can comment on this matter any further.”

That title may have explained itself.  You notice a gun you want, such as a Glock.  Everyone knows Glock.  I get it.  Great guns, no explanation needed if you’re reading this.  However, it is not the only decent brand.  If it was, no one would list them on here!  I won’t get into what is “best.”  The best is the most reliable one you have in the next 10 seconds.  But when you offer some Glock owners (but not limited to Glock owners, thus I’m not hating on you Austro-philes) an FN or CZ on trade to do an even swap, they employ the tactic of “I don’t know much about your type of gun, so it’ll be an even swap plus 150.”  The even cuter version of this is “We’re way apart on money (on top of your gun).”  And when you ask “how far are we off, ” the comment is “I don’t know” or “I’d need you to take me and your gun to the range before I could name a number.”  This is where I might advise them to simply say, “Never heard of it, thanks but no thanks.”  This is also where I might say, “I’d buy you a beer to talk this over, but you’d probably drown.”  

	So here we have three arguments for simply looking up MSRPs on the guns people are offering and paying double to avoid these types of projectile diarrhea inducing negotiations.  However, if you enjoy not trading or buying the conditions are suitable for you to lose or grey your hair along with increasing your overall stress levels.  This should be an enjoyable hobby, sport, collection, or whatever you call you amassing of arms and munitions.  No matter what you call it, I support it and hope we can overcome the silliness and emotional treatment that many people insist on giving the sale, buying and trading of these sorts of items.

If you encounter theses types of of folks, feel free to trade guns where they hammer you and make money off of you (and vice versa)  But I beg you, don't take their guns in trade for MREs.  It will just prolong the problem for another generation."

said he had only run 2 mags through it, i bought it without any mags
these two mags i am including in the trade i bought through gunbroker.com
they are brand new except no longer in the plastic, and i have never been able to load the mags with 25 like the plastic (which i will bring to the trade) indicates on the label,,

there is a miniscule amount of rust around the outside of the muzzle,
which i should take about 5 minutes with say some metal rescue and just fix - i figured whoever gets it would want to do that, it is no big deal, it is less than 1mm
hardly worth mentioning, the furniture and all is in excellent unscratched unopened shape, it has yet to go through break-in period,,

the extra receiver i got from a gunsmith from Tennessee with some other parts i do not bother to mention so far,, bolt, pins etc, it is an extra and it has some wear, like he had taken it apart and put it back together a few times,, the extra receiver looks a little scratched and dinged, but useable and intact, the extra receiver works and it c*cks and the pull of the trigger makes the hammer slam forward and all
