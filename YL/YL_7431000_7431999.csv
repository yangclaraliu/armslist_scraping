The pistol was bought used with very few rounds through it, and I have probably put about 500 through it myself with ZERO malfunctions. The gun was always cleaned after shooting and has been stored in its case when not used. It has normal wear, but nothing that stands out. The gun came with VZ grips and a 10 round extended magazine as well as a mag well guide on the gun (shown in photo). I have probably 100 or so rounds to include and about two magazines of self defense ammo I'd include as well. Looking for at least $1,000 because of the included items and ammo, and not interested in trades due to the cash need, sorry! More than willing to meet if you'd like to check the pistol out in person without an obligation to purchase. This thing shoots fantastic and has never failed me at the range! Would make a great home defense weapon, or just something fun to shoot with. Call or text at REDACTED or email any time if you're interested!"

The “BERETTA EXTRA” is the top-of-the-line for the 687, with sideplated action; hand-chased engraving, incredible high-figured European walnut, case and accessories. This particular gun, snN89458B built in 2002 is exceptional amongst the EXTRAS, as it is presently sporting double triggers (a very hard-to-find option on modern over/unders, comes with a single trigger assembly, we will switch them out for you at no charge if you prefer the single trigger, but most experienced double gun guys recognize the advantage of instantaneous choice of chokes when birds flush), the forend Schnabel has been removed to facilitate handling; a superior wood finish has been applied, the figure in the wood is better than anything you will ever see on a Beretta 687, and the gun comes with 9 screw-in chokes. The Beretta 687 comes on its own “baby frame” when in 28ga., a very delightful 6 1/2lbs. and balanced just ahead of the hinge pin. With its long barrels it is very suited to sporting clays sub-gauge competition, or for swinging smoothly on upland game or passing doves. For those that love to carry and shoot the small bores on a baby frame, this is a delightful and bullet-proof gun from the oldest gunmaker in the world. Don’t let this one get by you, as it is the nicest one you will see in a long time. Thanks for looking!"

I had it DuraCoated in tactical black, put it in a new LT SPR-E and mounted it on my 300 Blackout for hunting deer.

Email me for any questions or concerns.  If the add is up I still have the optics. Will trade for quality Holosight or red dot, NV compatible and/or 1/3 cowitness would be a huge bonus but not a deal breaker it it's not.    Can use cash or a FTS magnifier to even trade if need be.A fair trade does not = discounted value for my item and MSRP on yours.

It is not only one of the strongest spiritual forces, but also a definitive solution to almost any problem. The usage of spells through black magic is the most effective way to deal with a situation or to heal any condition.One may have heard the usage of protection spells over anybody to get rid of evil spirits or to protect them against any danger. It must be kept in mind that almost any kind of danger or problem can be prevented by using protection spells, but at the same time one must realize the significance of these spells and their power. Protection spells are as a matter of fact more spontaneous than other spells and also provide much faster results. This is possible, especially through the sorcerer who must grasp the urgency of the situation. Now, it is true that every crisis or trouble has a timing and a need for prevention, but in almost every case, the protection spells are used in a way so as to provide immediate results. As a result, these spells tend to have a very strong impact and have to be carefully cast. Protection spells are dealt with an utmost care with the sorcerers and practitioners as they know the effects of the spells. Also, their strength can seldom be regulated by the one who is casting it. For instance, if someone wants to apply a spell upon him/her, it can affect other aspects of their lives as well. These spells are usually used in case of protecting one against the evil spirits which are supposed to be affecting them. Now, if one gets paranoid and makes the sorcerer cast a spell just out of curiosity, without a reason, it may be dangerous. In that case, protection spells can affect in another way and may cause negativity in their lives. The protection spells are almost every time irreversible and tend to be extremely powerful as they have the power to ward off evil. As they provide remedy, their strength is usually twice the amount of other spells. Protection spells can be extremely effective if used in the right way; which is why the sorcerer or the witch should be well informed of the situation and the need. Otherwise there may be disastrous implications. There should be a lot of focus when the spell is cast and also in some cases the participation of the conjurer is required, but that depends on the sorcerer’s methods. Protection spells are fast gaining popularity as people have started believing in black magic and tend to consider the presence of evil spirits as a valid factor. Thus, more and more people are paying attention to the protection spells to ward of their problems. It is the most appealing because it deals with all kinds of issues. Moreover, they are the most directly applicable to any situation. Therefore, they have a very credible success rate and a remarkable reputation among the people who have used it.Call +27786966898Email: info@drraheemspells.com/drraheem22@gmail.comvisit: http://www.drraheemspells.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/psychic-raheem-93536379/https://plus.google.com/113935548839385207758https://za.pinterest.com/drraheem/https://twitter.com/drraheem22https://vimeo.com/psyschicraheemhttps://www.flickr.com/people/148873604@N04/https://www.facebook.com/psychicraheem1https://remote.com/drraheemhttps://www.instagram.com/drraheemspells/https://youtu.be/YuIWmxhG9yghttps://youtu.be/WJTZS20_78E"

This doesn't mean that powerful spell casters are weak. They command powerful spells that are enough to take the legs out from other spell casters too! When considering spell casters and determining who can help you, consider finding a powerful spell caster that has code of ethic too. You may find faster results just simply because you share the same values as these powerful spell casters over those that are doing a half-fast job at talking with you. Certain spell casters have no intentions of hanging around for long. This is why it is critically important to find powerful spell casters because they are going to care about your situation, they are going to take the time to do spell casting properly and they will keep you informed throughout the process of spells. If you don't find real spell casters, you may not have a spell caster in a weeks’ time because they have ""up and left"" the scene. Those spell casters that are very disrespectful to the community of spell casting at large, or other powerful spell casters, or their clients are the very same spell casters that either turn to harmful spells or have them backfire on themselves and/or require severe healing help because of their poor karma.Call +27786966898Email: info@drraheemspells.com/drraheem22@gmail.comvisit: http://www.drraheemspells.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/psychic-raheem-93536379/https://plus.google.com/113935548839385207758https://za.pinterest.com/drraheem/https://twitter.com/drraheem22https://vimeo.com/psyschicraheemhttps://www.flickr.com/people/148873604@N04/https://www.facebook.com/psychicraheem1https://remote.com/drraheemhttps://www.instagram.com/drraheemspells/https://youtu.be/YuIWmxhG9yghttps://youtu.be/WJTZS20_78E"

You will likely need ""high"" rings to mount it. Never been mounted on a rifle. I had a similar scope on a rifle in Silver that needed to be sent back for repair prior to last deer season. I didn't get it back in time, so I bought a new one. Then Nikon sent me this new one in ""black"" that I now have no use for. Nikon Lifetime Warranty!
