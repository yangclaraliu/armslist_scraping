Has Plano Hard case as seen in the picture as well as the original box from the manufacturer. The foam in this case has been modified to hold this gun. You could scrap the internal foam and cut a fresh piece for a different rifle if you like. A Nue-Trigger has been installed to the trigger pack to smooth out the trigger pull and it works nicely. It can be removed very easily and you can be back to the factory set up. Due to the nature of the bullpup design, any help with the trigger pull is helpful... Feel free to email with any questions.

The upper receiver is a Gen 2 Upper with a beefier look and feel to them that compliment the enhanced lower.

 Custom Builds are accepted and usually can be completed within 30 days unless custom finishes are included in the request then add another 30 days but we aim to surprise you and be faster if we can.

 AR-15 Pistols.... WHY would you deal with the hassle of NFA paper work and get a SBR ever again! The AR-15 Pistol is a great platform to run and have fun with and the recent ATF Determination Letters about Shoulder firing an AR-15 Pistol seals the fate of this great item. Why deal with the hassle of registering your SBR everytime you move, if you want to travel out of State on short notice and want to take your SBR - it wont happen, and why wait the length of time to get a response & tax stamp required in order to even purchase a SBR?

 SOoo I have become a fan of the AR-15 Pistol platform and what it now offers.

 We also build Competition Ready rifles with precision 18"" Hvy SS Fluted Barrels and...
 a Designated Marksmen Rifle with a precision 18"" barrel as well.

 More things to come on the PHNX-52 receivers.

Literally not even a full mag down the pipe just to make sure everything works. I recently bought an AK and that is now my focus so something has to go. This gun is a solidly built gun and features an all metal lower, receiver and removable carry handle. The only plastic on it are the stock, handle and forend heat shield. It comes with 2 full setups, 1 being the detachable carry handle with iron site and 2 being the tactically scoped (Simmons Whitetail, 1.5-5 magnification, tactical finish optic) and railed (UTG riser rail and Milltet tactical scope mount) option. This provides point of site with the scope for range or the iron front site for close range shots. Both are awesome setups and they should provide infinite flexibility at any range or under any condition. I am also throwing in 2 metal mags filled with 60 rounds as well as another 80 rounds of boxed WOLF ammo to round out the package. This is one hell of a good deal and will make someone very happy.

Very good rifle. This gun cost me right at $1,000 new after taxes and fees and was pretty difficult to find. I have put maybe 100-150 rounds through it and cleaned/oiled it after every shooting session. It is very well maintained, but there are some scuff marks on the stock from where the bipod was mounted with some other minor marks on the stock here and there from when I took it hunting through brush. If you plan on using a bipod, this won't matter at all. No damage to any parts that would affect the performance of the gun.

SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED (although the talley scope mounts/rings are if you want them which were somewhere near $100 and were advertised as their heavy duty mounts...I don't recall the model name or number).

The reason I am selling is because I don't really have a need for it any more and have other things I need to spend money on. If interested, shoot me an e-mail. See pics below (let me know if they don't come through)

Hey all,
I have up for trade or sale a awesome little conceal pistol. I have a kel-Tec p3at in the more rare bright pink finish. It is a fantastic little pistol chambered in the potent 380 acp cartridge. I took this out and shot it and was very happy with how it shot and the feel of it, it is just not for me. So, I'm putting it on here so that someone who needs it more than me can enjoy her! It will come with one mag, factory box, and factory manual. Need to be able to meet in Norman on this one. I would also consider trades for a PF9, LC9, or possibly certain other pistols (would love to get another yugo tokarev with extras). Would also entertain offers for very large lots of 45 auto or 7.62 Tok ammo. Honestly, just shoot me a message on here or a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Worst I can say is no!
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!"

I bought this handsome monster in 1991 but it sat forlorn in various closets till the week before last, when I finally took it to the range to finally fire it. A mere 20 rounds suggests this .44 magnum is just too much gun for me: there isn't much recoil but the very loud BOOM makes me flinch. And my bills were more than I'd expected so...

It's in great shape, with a cross-bar safety, a blued finish, the standard walnut stock, a hammer extension I see no need to remove, and a Micro-Groove barrel. (Wikipedia says ""in the mid-1990s, Marlin changed the .357 and .44 barrels from 12-groove-or-more 'Micro-Groove' rifling to 6-groove 'Ballard' style rifling."") The only things wrong with this gun are that the folding leaf rear sight somehow broke off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight base from where I tried and failed to install a replacement (see second photo).

UPDATE: I went ahead and ordered another folding leaf rear sight from Midway; they say it shipped and will be here within a week. If somebody buys my rifle before then I'll mail it to you quickly to complete my end of the deal."

Highly rare turn of the century French 12 gauge double barrel. Everything on this gun appears to be original, all markings appear correct and point to French maker.
I have not fired this shotgun , so due to its age I would recommend that you spend $100 and have it properly inspected by trained gunsmith. 
I did test the basics: the trigger is crisp and clean, safety works properly, there is no rust or pitting, no cracks in frame or furniture, no chips or dings anywhere (appears to have been a safe queen), main components appear to work as they should.
What should be checked due to its age: sear, firing pins (seem to work well but I'm not an expert), test firing.
There may need to be additional things that should be checked but I believe the items above would be good start.
I ended up acquiring this shotgun at an auction and just couldn't pass it up given it's age and overall condition ( it looks and feels absolutely immaculate).

I am interested in revolvers (357, 44 mag, 454 casull smith and ruger preferably), Glocks,hk's, AK's or AR's.

Serious inquiries only. This is an collectors item and would make for a great collector conversation piece. True one of the kind double barrel beauty!
Before making silly offers understand based on pictures and information I provide that this is not your everyday gunbroker, tgt, gunsamerica, armslist or your local bubba piece. I am not in hurry to get rid of it and will not give it away, as charitable as I tend to be.

I could do a 'two for one' if your trade interests me. I received both of these guns used in trades and just do not use them. 
The Hi-Point has had its feed ramp polished and will come with three magazines ( one 8 round and two new 10 round magazines that have never been in the gun. )I also have 175 rounds of fmj ammo,a cheap range holster,a hogue grip sleeve and a zip up gun case that can come with the gun. I have fired around 120 rounds through it and have had no failures of any kind. 
The Rg-14 is a 6 shot 22 lr 'saturday night special'. This gun's claim to fame is that it is the same model of gun that President Reagan was shot with in 1981. I have only shot 24 rounds through this one, but it worked perfectly for those. From what I was told when I got it and the amount of wear on the gun, I believe this gun has fired less than 100 rounds total in its life. I can add a couple of hundred rounds of 22lr if needed too sweeten the deal.
Mainly looking for trades right now. Not for sale.
Value of the guns together is between $300 and $350 depending on how much ammo I include with them.

I bought it last summer as a spare sear host and I ended up with one too many “K” model spares. Like anyone can have too many guns, but that is where I am now. I have had excellent luck with all of my Bobcat/Coharie pistols. My only issue ever has been a weak extractor spring but this one seems fine. It is unfired by me. Under the fore grip is a 3-lug barrel. I see no finish missing or wear on the paint which looks great. It also comes with its original box.
It needs to go to someone who will use it. This type of pistol sells for about $1,800-$2,200 new, depending upon manufacturer, phases of the moon, internet hype, etc. Prices have not come down and in fact are rising a little bit. Unlike the most recent MKE import, no coordinated rework is required to use this pistol as a sear host. You will also not have to acquire parts and wait to have one custom built from a flat. My price is a reasonable, quick-to-sell $1,400 plus shipping."

Just when you thought it couldn't get any better than the TAC30, Burris brings added innovation with the Burris MTAC rifle scope. The MTAC is designed to stand up to the hard use of tactical shooters. This scope features a superior light gathering glass than the TAC30. These high quality lenses with hilume multi-coatings provide a crisp, clear picture from dusk to dawn. Another major improvement in the MTAC is the independently moving power ring, separate from the ocular bell. This improvement lets the shooter adjust the power range without any visual interruption. Double-spring tension and an oversized ball-joint secure the hand-fitted internal zoom-assembly. The main tube is constructed of aircraft grade 6061t6 aluminum. Each scope is purged with laboratory-grade nitrogen to eliminate internal moisture and sealed with Burris-exclusive quad seals. The adjustment system is positive and repeatable with audible clicks ensuring unfailing shot-to-shot accuracy in all environments. The long range additions to the MTAC line feature the G2B Mil-Dot reticle for precision holdover and hold off at any distance. These models also feature an ergonomic adjustable objective with easy grip knurling and no added bulk.

- If ANY firearm was PURCHASED, period, it is no longer NEW! Shot or not, when you bought that sucker, it's no longer a new firearm.
- Following rule 1, since it's no longer NEW, it will not bring a NEW price tag. 
- SALE is a noun. SELL is a verb. Please establish which one you're using. You're 4th grader would probably slap you in the mouth for being an idiot. 
- If you bump your listing more than twice, no one wants your crap. Take it somewhere else.

Hello,
