The IC-A5 is the latest model in the IC – Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and the longer 12” SPR style rail system on the same rifle. We listened- the IC-A5 is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of our longer modular rail system.
The upper rail section on the IC-A5 is an aesthetically pleasing special cutback version which allows us to use the low profile gas block and at the same time keep the full 12” modular rails available on the sides and bottom of the hand guards. This IC-A5 brings together features of both the IC Enhanced and the IC-SPR in one package.
Like all IC models the IC-A5 is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws.
Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5.  LWRCI™ Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard.  Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. 
Our IC-A5 uses LWRCI™ manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter.  The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling.  Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity. 
The LWRCI™ IC-A5 comes complete with, LWRCI Skirmish™ Back Up Iron Sights, Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCI™ Adjustable Compact Stock, Magpul® MOE+ Grip and A2 Birdcage flash hider."

This is one of them. I bought this for home defense, but I think I'm going to move back towards the 5.56 AR home defense setup. This thing is completely decked out and really doesn't need anything else to be perfect. Tailhook brace kit (They've been sold out for 6 months, highly sought after), HB extended charging handle, Apex grip, Apex ambi safeties (Has the Apex safety on the right side, factory on the left. I have the left Apex safety too it's jut not installed), Inforce WML light, Vortex Venom red dot, CZ Custom Co-Witness mount (Only way to get a co-witness with the low factory sights on these), an Alpha Battle Carrier bag, and 5 magazines. This is one hell of a package.I bought this unfired, and have about 300-400 rounds through it. It's in near mint conditon with no wear, scratches, or dings. All of the extras are only a few weeks old, except for the Venom which I've had on a few different guns but is still in great shape and works perfectly.Below I'll list all of the extras and what they cost. The prices listed are the cheapest prices I could find online:- CZ Scorpion Evo Pistol ($799)- Tailhook Brace Kit w/Factory Folding Mechanism ($250)- HB Industries Theta Extended Charging Handle ($55)- Apex Grip ($30)- Apex Ambi Safety ($45)- Inforce WML ($130)- Vortex Venom ($240)- Cz Custom Venom Co-Witness mount ($80)- UTG Alpha Battle Carrier Bag ($70)- 2-10 round magazines that came with the gun.- 3 Extra 30 round magazines ($20 ea so $60)- Mythosaur Rail Cover ($30)- Factory box, factory grip, factory safety, factory lock, and factory boresnake.As you can see, I have approx $1790 into this gun and that doesn't even include tax, shipping, and FFL fees...so add about another $50-$80 on top of that.Asking $1000 for this. That price is WAY too low but I'm trying to sell it within the next few days.***PRICE IS FIRM AND I DONT WANT TRADES.

Any trade offer or cash offer less than $1000 will result in your number/email being blocked.Not looking for trades at this time, trying to fill the massive hole in my pocket for the buying spree the last few days. Keep in mind this is a PISTOL, not a rifle, so paperwork is required. Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy.

S. Model of 1917 in 45 ACP cartridge.  This revolver has its original brushed finish with all frame and barrel markings clear and crisp.  The barrel is 5-1/2"" long with clean, strong rifling.  U. S serial number is 339XX.  Research indicates this revolver was shipped 02/16/1918 to Ordnance Base Depot, U. S. Government, A. E. F. France, Ordnance Store #45, Bush Terminal, Brooklyn, N. Y.  This is one of 3600 revolvers in the shipment.  Originally these revolvers came with tapered chambers in the cylinder which required use of half-moon clips.  Above serial #30400, the chambers were given a shoulder to allow the 45ACP cartridge to be headspaced correctly and could be fired in an emergency without the half-moon clips.  The half-moon clips are still required for the ejector rod to work.  The Colt serial # for this revolvers is 184XXX.  I am not sure if the grips are original to this gun, but they do carry the Colt serial # written in pencil on the insides.  Overall, this revolver is in very nice condition.  Apparently this gun did not see service in WWII.  When removing the grips, a small hand-written slip of paper was found indicating the gun was purchased from Marshall Fields in Chicago on 4/2/42.  The buyer's and salesman's names are also listed.  Numerous photos available on request.  Price is shipped FFL to FFL."

OUR SUPPLIER HAS GONE TO EXTENSIVE LENGTHS TO DEVELOP A SUPERIOR 1911 .45 MAGAZINE!!  We are very pleased with these new magazines.These are the result of over a year of product development. Listed here are the quality features of this new magazine:  Produced on a computer controlled high speed link press.This provides a stable platform for progressive dies & uniformity. Body tooling has 6 stages & follower tooling has 16 stages.This assures an accurate & repeatable process with less metal stress, when fewer, less radical bends are made.  Latest technology parallel feed lip design for proper timed release of cartridge.Special for semi wad cutters, although per technical feedback semi wad cutters may require additional timing.  Welding is done on a Yasakawa computer controlled robotic arm argon welder.Unlike some .45 magazines you cant see the seam weld on the back.  In house quality control gauges to national standard are used for checking every stage of the production.  QC inspection involves a 2/5D video measuring machine enabling checking of every specification & keeps the record in memory.  Springs are tested to 20,000 cycles.  Dimple designed as a mag catch override for easier mag insertion.  Latest rounded follower design.  Magazines are processed in a hot bath of sodium hydroxide, nitrates, & nitrites at 141º centigrade - This converts the surface to magnetite.  All process done under specification of MIL-DTL-13924 & ASTM-D769 & ISO-11408.  The tube is carburized (case hardened) by nitriding (heat treated in a nitrogen atmosphere).This retains a tough core (ductility, flexibility, springiness & resistance to stress fractures) while producing a 46-48 HRC surface hardiness, creating scuff resistance, fatigue & corrosion resistance.Most important, it eliminates any chance for deformation of the front of the mag from cartridge inertia.  For use in all Govt & Commercial 1911 pistols 1911, 1911A1 - Govt Series 70, Series 80, commander, Essex, Rock Island, etc. - Also the many, many, many aftermarket 1911s. These magazines are new from the factory & clean/dry, they may require the application of a few drops of your favorite gun oil where the follower meets the back/inside of the magazine body. This is half the price of most reasonable .45 magazines!There may be an additional charge for state and local tax. To buy these magazines and more follow the link below:https://www.apexgunparts.com/1911-magazine-7rd-45acp-steel-matte-blue-new.html To dowload our App go to:For Android, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shopgate.android.app27425&hl=enfor Apple, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apex-gun-parts/id1088792453?mt=8.&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=The+Best+Deal+on+the+Market+for+AK+Magazines%21&utm_campaign=Standard+Newsletter+2-4-18"

This is one of the rare pistols that was actually sent to China. This particular gun was delivered to Shanghai in late 1945. The pistol is in excellent condition, although it appears to have been reparkerized at some point during its life. Armory refurbs were quite common. The gun is all matching and has it's lanyard and original magazine with aluminum follower and the split back floor plate. The pistol comes with a very nicely made wooden stock/holster, but after much research, I believe this stock to be a reproduction made by the Chinese in 1952. On the inside of the leather there is a stamp in Chinese characters which roughly translates to ""Made in China 1952."""

These firearms were made between 1991-1998, and were actually designed to compete in the trials for the FBI's new service weapons. It didn't win, and was sold to civillans instead. It's a cool gun, with lots of awesome features that were way ahead of their time. The main one is the switch on the side of the gun, that switches the gun from SA/DA, to DAO. It's a feature implemented to try and ease police/agents away from revolvers and into semi-autos. Other cool features include a decocker/safety lever, and the fact that the frame where the grips are is actually cut out to make this grip even thinner than a Glock 19!It's extremely reliable, has a great trigger, and shoots whatever you put through it. It's definitely an amazing design...it was just way ahead of it's time. This firearm is in great condition, with just a few scratches and some wear which can be seen in the pictures. Mechanically, it's perfect and barely looks like it's ever been fired.This comes with two factory 10-round magazines (made during the ban era) and one EXTREMELY rare factory pre-ban 15 round magazine. I've only seen 2 of these pop up for sale and they were both listed at $150. In fact, there was one that sold on Gunbroker two weeks ago for $150+shipping which is a hefty price for a magazine!Also comes with the factory box and all original paperwork!The only two-tone models for sale right now are on Gunbroker, only have 10-round mags, and are listed at $575 & $699.I'm asking $500 FIRM for this, and that comes with the extra 15 round magazine. This price should be MUCH higher than it is. Priced low to sell fast, as always.***PRICE IS FIRM AND I DONT WANT TRADES. This is clearly stated in my ad, yet I keep getting lowball emails or trade offers from Armslist. Any trade offer or cash offer less than $500 will result in your number/email being blocked.No trades at this time, trying to recoup some of the money from all of my impulse buys the last few weeks.Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy. Face to face only, no shipping.Must be 18+ w/Purchase Permit or CPL.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time. Thanks for looking!~ Mike"
