The PA-63 is the soviet copy of the PPK, and is chambered in 9x18mm Makarov.  This gun is a sweet shooter, I can easily make headshots on proportional targets at 10 yards offhand every time.   The recoil is easily manageable for my girlfriend and the stopping power is almost the same as a 9mm.  It fits in the front pockets of my jeans without sticking out at all.  If you check online for silver bear ammo you can buy quality hollow points at about the same price as fmj rounds, making it economic and practical to shoot.  I always advise practicing the way you would need to fight if the situation occurred, and you can do this on a modest budget.  It is a great concealed carry pistol.  It has a steel slide and components with an aluminum frame, making it light to carry and easy to handle.  Being mostly a rifle shooter I have only fired about 200 rounds through this pistol with no problems at all, spent between 2 sessions.  I honestly don't want to sell this gun, but I need the money to customize another firearm, so I am willing to make a deal because I don't regularly carry a pistol concealed.

This one was made with the original grips. Comes with six mags, 5 German Sig zipper back mags and one slightly newer Sig mag made by Mec-Gar under Sig contract. All are in great condition and function flawlessly. This was an LEO duty weapon so it has some wear marks on the slide near the muzzle from holster wear. Comes with the Sig ""Law Enforcement Only"" hard case. 





The holster is an authentic US Navy SEAL worn and modified Safariland drop leg holster (right hand). The guys tend to wear SERPA holsters now but a while back they tended to wear these after modifying them by removing the top strap, shortening the belt loop strap, drilling a hole and adding a bungie to be slipped around the grip for parachuting. Yes, this holster is real.

At 5in tall with a barrel length of just under 4in, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4in off the length and about 1/2in off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

22 magnum ammo
Hey all,
I got real lucky and just had a big order of mag ammo process and it is on its way at a really good price. As a result of it I can “shift” the price and average it to all of what I have 22 mag wise, which lowers the price that these cost me and thus what they’ll cost you! That being said, here is what I physically have on hand right now, and I will be getting a decent amount more in in the coming week or so. 

I'm selling it at cost to me with shipping and tax so price is for pick up in Norman only. Would also consider trades for certain pistols (derringers in bigger bores mainly), looking specially for a PF9 actually, and even trades for certain other ammunition. Would also consider trades for 45 auto ammo. (Probably a 1-1 ratio depending on the ammo) Here is what I have available as of now:

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Armscor precision 22mag-$16 per 50 rounds (1.350 rounds in total) 

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Fiocchi Performance 22mag-$16 per 50


I will break it up however you would like to buy it box wise or you can buy it all. It is all the same to me. It is not the best price in the world, but at least I found some I could get available to y'all. Shoot me a text at REDACTED if you would like to arrange a trade or pickup. Or just shoot me a PM on here. Thanks and happy hunting!"

The GLOCK 23 Gen3, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen3 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

The G42 is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

I plan on picking up one of the models w/o the thumb safety later this year, so I'll certainly have no need for 3, and yes, my unfired Shield does have the safety.

It will come in its original box with the 7 and 8rd magazines. It's a mid April 2014 production gun I believe.

I'm only looking to trade this one. My interests are below:

-Gen 4 G23 (I'd add mags/ammo/perhaps an agreed cash amt)

-Ruger 10/22 Takedown- I'm only intersted in the Takedown models, I can buy one of these new for $280-$299 these days so please keep that in mind when offering a trade (meaning I expect some cash thrown in from your end or a good amt of accessories/ammo to go along with the 10/22)

-I prefer to take back another firearm in trade so you can try me with various 9mm pistols (not really interested in any Kahr, Taurus, Bersa, etc. or DA/SA guns) or .40s or .45s, but keep in mind please that I don't really care for 1911s (not that I think a Shield is worth a quality 1911) and I don't want something like a police trade in g22. I have my long gun needs fairly well addressed at the moment, but you can try if you dare with an offer, just know that I'm not in the market for any shotguns right now.

-in addition to another gun, I may be intersted in .223/5.56 ammo, a Spyderco Paramilitary 2 knife (little off the wall here), Aimpoint optics

All NC laws followed. I'll present my CCW and NCDL and expect you to of the same or give me your original pistol permit and we both sign a bill of sale. FTF Matthews/Indian Trail/Southeast Charlotte area only."

This has been my primary home protection weapon. I should have my CCW in 2 weeks, and need something smaller. Not really looking for a trade. I'm very fussy about my gun purchases. That being said, I hate to see this one go, but need to fund my next one. This is my second 6904. Lost the first one in the divorce. I'm very loyal to what works. The gun did, she didn't. 
This one has been ultra reliable. Never a jam of any type. I'm a lefty, and love the ambidextrous safety. Pictures were taken this morning, and accurately depict what's being sold. Additional pictures can be taken on request.
