This unusual and uncommon model of the infamous Browning Hi-Power Mark III features a full Carbon Fiber effect finish on all exposed metal parts of the firearm.
When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability. Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever. Sure, there are many, many other full-size 9mm pistols on the market that are made to meet many different requirements. But in the end, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. Having and shooting the best just means something.
The Browning Hi Power is one of the most revered pistols of all time. This ground-breaking firearm was originally designed by John M. Browning and perfected in the years following his death by Fabrique Nationale’s prolific designer, Dieudonne Saive. The Hi Power has proven itself around the world in the hands of law enforcement, military, special operations forces and law abiding citizens. Add a legendary piece of functional firearm history to your collection now with a Browning Hi Power.

I am open to fair trades, and willing to throw in money if the offer is right.  

The P226 has probably around 500-600 rounds through it.  I shoot it quite often, but typically 1 or 2 magazines at most.  I bought 200 rounds 2 years ago, and still have almost 100 of them (which I will throw in, unless the trade is for another .40).  There are some very slight dings, one on each side of the front rail, one near the trigger, 2 on the beaver tail.  They are easily touch-up-able, but I would let the next owner do it so that I am not hiding anything.  It has Hogue rubber grips, I have the originals somewhere, but I wouldn't even know where to look.  It does have Sig Night Sights.  It will come with 2 magazines, a 12 round, and the standard 10 round.  It will come in a basic Plano case.

If you would like more pictures, just let me know, and I will get them to you."

The only legal way to get a real Russian-made AK 74 apart from a saiga what you have to convert. And anyone who owns a Vepr will tell you they are made a world better than any Saiga, as nice as Saigas still very much are! This is all based on the typical super heavy rpk bulged receiver and heavy trunion. All receiver metal is based on 1.5mm thick steel all around. Barrel is substantially thicker than any 74 I've seen. Nice baked painted finish. Gorgeous wood stocks. Anniversary model just means it has a woodland vine like engraving in the rubber of the buttpad which is shown in the photobucket pics. This is a genuine Molot buttpad and marked as such, not aftermarket.  This version has a ak74 muzzle break installed by Atlantic arms that is on correct LH threads. In addition,  this rifle has one major other good thing going for it. Most Vepr rifles can only take Molot factory mags which are overpriced and hard to get sometimes. But this one has had the mag well opened up to be standard AK 74 size and I had checked it. All AK 74 mags work perfectly. This saves you a Ton of money getting magazines and not being stuck to the Vepr mags. This is also an Anaheim California import with a nicer finish that I've seen before. Not the usual TGI import where most came in through.

I have 6 fantastic magazines. The least exciting one is the simple black Tapco polymer 25 rounder. After that we have two brand new black excellent Bulgarian 30 rounders which are the metal lined polymer covered type that feed perfectly and are Glock reliable. There's two brand-new Uber rare Circle 21 Russian red/brown 30 rounders and one holy Grail factory bakelite 40 Rounder!  The 60 rounds of wolf AK 74 non corrosive steel case ammo in the pic come free.

You can have it one of two different ways: 
1) $1050 FIRM for everything CASH
2) $925 FIRM for the gun, two black Bulgarian mags & the black tapco mag CASH
If you actually do your research and check the prices of all of the stuff right now you will see this is a dang good deal!        For several more high-quality pics check this link out to my Photobucket.  http://s144.photobucket.com/user/aaroncohenproductions/slideshow/

I purchased this sidearm at the Indy Gun and Knife show on October 19th, 2013 from a dealer.  I had it inspected by a Glock Armorer, Glock Brothers.  He's been doing this for decades.  He said it wasn't really necessary, but if he were to do anything at all to the gun he'd replace the safety plunger.  We did that on the spot and he said everything else was functioning perfectly.

** Rare 10 or less *** Ruger New Bearcat blue and stainless .22lr limited edition factory NIB

This was a ruger factory assembly mistake of at least 3 and 10 or less made. What happened was the blue bearcat got a stainless barrel and a blue sight installed on it.

I have been in contact with ruger several times over the last 4 months  and talked and emailed them. The ruger person validated how many were made and assured me this one  and the two serials up from this one, but not more than  ten or less before the assembly line was stopped and the stainless barrels were removed from the line and the correct blue ones put back in. 

This is new in the box.  There has been a rugerforum dot com thread about it discussing this so a web thread is available for you to read. 

email me with cell and best time to call to discuss if you do desire.

The value of this is pretty unknown other than you could own a special piece of ruger history. Just think of it. I now own a one of ten. How second kind of cool would that be.

I am not a collector, this deserves to be in someones collection to be treasured and passed on for generations. Things like this  rarely come to the open market. They usually are sold or traded in circles of few."

HISTORY
In the early 1950's the People's Republic of China decided there was a need to develop a carbine for issue to the People's Army. The Chinese looked to their new friends to the North, the Soviet Union, for assistance in the matter. As the doctrine of the ""Human Wave"" was shared by both nations, a bayonet would be an essential item on any carbine to be issued. The Soviet Union of course offered the Model 1944 Carbine as a logical solution . The Soviets were in production of the SKS at the time, but they did not want to share this new development with the Chinese. It is thought that Soviet machinery was sent to China for commencement of Type 53 production. The facts also seem to suggest this was also done in Eastern Europe as the Model 1944 Carbine production also began in Poland, Hungary, and Romania during the same time frame. The movement of the Soviet machinery allowed the Chinese to produce the Type 53 independently, which was important to both Chinese national pride and the self-sufficiency of China. This also allowed the Soviets to aid their Chinese ally without giving away a large amount of weapons technology.  Chinese production of the carbine began in 1953 and the designation of this new carbine was the Type 53 . The early proofs on the barrel shank of the Type 53 will have both Chinese characters and the number 26 or 296. The Chinese characters translate to "" 53 Year Type "" and the 26 or 296 are the stamping of the State Factory at Chongqing."

Mine shoots very accurately with Norinco ammo. Trajectory identical to a 150gr 30-30Win. Although not as flat shooting as the 223, it's 30cal bullet does a nice job. Sighted in at 225 yds it's ±4"" from 0 to 300yds. which is good enough for medium to large game. And superior at busting through brush. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3VRrc2n0NXg

I've bundled the rifle with the mags most people will want. And it's priced fairly. No price gouging here, just a great package including the PLANO carrying case, manual, and nylon sling. Consecutive serial numbers are available.

Shipping will be actual cost to your zip code + $5 handling. Payment must be US Postal Money Order or ""Popmoney"" if your bank offers this. I will accept credit cards with a 3.5% additional fee. No taxes are collected so you'll save over most other ways to purchase.

624,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3009624,"For Sale:  1915 ""Coliat"" Colt Army Special (Spanish Copy)","Santa Fe, NM, New Mexico, United States",$ 200,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 30, 2014",Handguns,no type,38 S&W Special                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Yes, a ""COLIAT"" lol!

 This one is marked on its pressed horn grips with the trade name ""Coliat"". In some forums this has been translated as ""Goliat' which means ""goliath"" in French. I don't believe that to be true. In this case, ""Coliat"" seems intended to fool non-English speakers into thinking they were getting a Colt. They were made by Antonio Errasti in Eibar. The revolver is intended to be a visual copy of a Colt Army Special but with S&W style lockwork. The cylinder release operates like a Colt as well.

 Errasti made these revolvers in 1917 -18 for the French army, and they were used by them in WWI - chambered in the smaller 8mm Lebel. These were already an existing design and production model for Errasti in 1917 - and it seems this one was made before that. This is because it is chambered in .38 Special. Errasti went out of business in the glut of arms that followed WWI, and with the tightening of gun control laws in Europe in that period.

 Here is why I bought this revolver in the first place: On the barrel are two great legends. The left side says "".38 SPECIAL AND US SERVICE CTGS"". On top of the barrel it reads ""BEST AMERICAN CARTRIDGES ARE THOSE THAT BEST FIT THE A.E. REVOLVER"". Hilarious. The left side has the A.E. logo entwined to look like a S&W logo. This is the type of revolver that probably got US lawmakers to insist that foreign makers put their country of origin on their guns. There is no ""Made in Spain"", no ""Eibar"" marks, and no import marks at all on it. I find it to be an interesting piece from this time period.

 These guns were made of questionable steel and I have never fired this one, nor do I recommend it. It is a collectible and a conversation piece. if you absolutely HAVE to shoot it, I have a friend who loads about 10 grains of black powder substitute into .38 Special cases and then uses a lead bullet on top. That should be safe, or perhaps target wadcutters would also work. These guns are loose and even the crane's fitting is sloppy. If you have to shoot it, keep it light!

I think it is a neat piece of history from the WWI and before era.

The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 7 1/2 pounds.

Of course, all the provenance documents and the Cody letter go with the gun.

I'm not a dealer so be sure that your dealer will accept a shipment from a private individual. I'd ballpark shipping with insurance at $100 and any used portion of that will be refunded to the buyer via personal check. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee."
