Dan Wesson, STI, etc. I'm putting the trade value of these two together at $1,500. I'm wanting something that was maybe $1,800 to $2k new. I can add some cash for the right trade. If yours, being used, is not worth at least $1,500 I may consider it, but you may have to bring a few bucks to the table.Want to buy instead of trade? $700 each. Firm! Cash!"

Here's an early Colt Model 1873 Single Action Army revolver that was manufactured in the 1870's. Chambered for the .45 Colt cartridge, this revolver has the ""U.S."" military property marking on the left side next to the two-line patent markings. The two-line patent marking was in use between 1873 and 1876 when another date was added and it was changed to 3-lines. The barrel measures 5-1/2"" in length and was likely cut down from 7-1/2"" during the government rework program between 1895-1903. The parts are matching however the serial numbers marked on the frame, trigger guard, and grip frame are not original and these parts have been renumbered to match the original cylinder. The cylinder itself is serial numbered 6667 and has the tiny ""A"" stamp which indicates inspection by Ainsworth. Ainsworth inspected the earliest U.S. Single Action Army revolvers, serial numbers 1 to about 15,000, which means the cylinder has to be original to gun #6667 and would have been issued just after those guns used by Gen. Geo. Custer's 7th Cavalry at the infamous Battle of Little Big Horn. The serial number markings on the frame, trigger guard, and grip frame use numerals very similar to those on the cylinder and on quick inspection appear to be authentic. Closer examination shows that the original numbers were carefully removed, the new ones stamped, and the areas surrounding the new numbers ""aged"". The barrel is of somewhat later production, inspected by David F. Clark in the 1880's. The one-piece grip is an original that carries a faint script ""JEG"" cartouche of Ordnance Inspector John E. Greer, also from the 1880's. The cylinder base pin and a few of the screws are replacements. This revolver shows plenty of use and it appears the frame was blued at some point in the distant past. Little finish remains and the gun is mostly a mottled grey with some blue finish along the ejector rod housing and on the original hammer. There are some significant dings to the cylinder and some light pitting to the barrel near the muzzle. The grip has been sanded but is free of cracks or large chips. This revolver functions fine with good timing and only slight play at lock-up. The bore rates very good with strong, sharp rifling that shows only a moderate amount of light erosion. An unmarked black leather holster that is in very good condition and fits the gun well is included. Perfect for the reenactor...this revolver should make a great shooter with light loads!"
