Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro compact .380
automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind,
the DB380 features a ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending)
with a mechanical firing pin block, a stainless steel magazine catch to
secure a sheet metal magazine, and real windage adjustable sights, all in a
lightweight pistol. a steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a
crisp, smooth, five pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA
(Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than
any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and
the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than
ever. The slide barrel and internal parts are all hard coated to resist
corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

I'm not looking for a lower end gun with 500$ in accessories. I want to trade quality for quality. What I have is a LNIB Kimber Stainless Pro Raptor II. It will come in the factory Kimber box w/ paperwork, 1 standard Kimber magazine and (7) Kimber PROTAC magazines and 320rds of ammo. (300)rds of FMJ and a box of Hornady Critical Defense. If you have any questions/offers please reply to this ad. I'm looking to get back into 3 gun competitions so a Glock 34 and a Glock 41 would be nice, but I am open to all reasonable offers. I have over $1500.00 tied up in this package. I do realize I will not get retail value, but I will also not be lowballed.

It is way too much to list here so if anyone is interested in getting into reloading, AR-15 rifles and pistols, .223 and .308 Win. etc.,  I probably have all that you need.  It's all good stuff and I'm not going to give it away or allow cherry picking.  This is a once in a while opportunity to set up completely in single stage press reloading and building or repairing AR's and Rem 700.s.  I am strictly a hobby builder and shooter and reloader and not a professional.   But I have most every tool and part that the hobby AR-15 lover would need or want.   If  SERIOUSLY interested email and we'll go from there.     BTW:  I am going to add pics.   The pics only display a PART of the lot.  There is a bunch of stuff here.  It is NOT for someone who wants to buy and resell and make money.  But for someone who wants to get into reloading and not have to purchase one single part to get started.  You can add as much at anytime as you wish but this will get you started TODAY reloading PRECISION .308 and .223 ammo.   I bought everything in this lot myself brand new.   The retail cost of all of it is $4887.00.  I mention that not to even suggest a price but to show that it is all quality stuff.  Selling price is going to be in the area of 30% to 35% of my investment unless someone comes up with a deal that I just cannot refuse, and I doubt that is going to happen.  I have completed an itemized list and will get it posted as soon as I figure out how.   SERIOUS buyers can email and I will send a copy. It is 8 pages long and probably too long to post anyhow.        Thanks for the read.

ADDITION, 6-08-2014:   I have decided to keep most of the tools that I use for rebuilding but they were not included in the price given or on the list anyhow.  SOME tools are included but most that I am keeping can be purchased from any of the shops such as Brownells anyhow.  That's where I got mine and they are a few gunsmith tools and just basic tools that can be purchased anywhere, so that does not affect the original list.
Just trying to be completely clear.....You hear ""once in a lifetime deal"" all the time.....Believe me, this is one of them."

Brand new in package Magpul Battery Assist Device (one finger bolt release) lever. No modification to your weapon is made, it just mounts on the existing bolt release paddle. 

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.

Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

Alright guys here is the deal. I am located in southern illinois and only post in STL because arms list in southern illinois is a ghost town haha. I'm looking to sell my FNP 45 TACTICAL. This is the Flat dark earth color and has been meticulously cared for. I originally posted ads saying this handgun  had seen about 1500 or so rounds. After counting my brass it's closer to 800 rounds down the tube.  Comes with factory case and everything. Barrel is bright! 

I will ship anywhere in the USA as long as it is legal in your area. I will not accept PayPal as a form of payment, it is against their policy! So I will only accept a certified money order or cashiers check. I am looking to sell quickly for $800 and $25 shipping. So the total would be $825. If you're located in St Louis you are more than welcome to drive to me and we can take care of the transfer in person at my local gun shop! 

Again this is priced to sell! I don't think you will find a nicer FNP 45 TACTICAL IN flat dark earth cheaper than this guy's, so snag this while you can. Times are tough and I need money for bills or else I'd keep this handgun. 

Thanks for reading! 

No PayPal or Western Union or the likes. 
Certified money order or cashiers check mailed to me please.  Cash must clear before I ship. Any questions feel free to email me!

The 0301 also features a 3/8-inch hex head pivot shaft nut that makes field adjustments fast and easy with minimal tools.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

420,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3122420,For Sale:  Own a piece of the Civil War,"ABQ Area, Albuquerque, New Mexico",$ 500,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 18, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Own a piece of the Civil War. Up for sale is a 32 caliber black powder rifle that has been restored for shooting in 1958. This piece of history was found at the Pea Ridge Battlefield in Arkansas in the late 1800's. The restoration was done by Jackson Arms in Dallas. The outside metal pieces were plated to strengthen. The hammer was welded and also plated for strength. The stock was cleaned to reveal a beautiful piece of burled wood and an epoxy finish was added to seal in the wood. It could be restored to the original condition if it was so desired. This would include removing the epoxy and giving the wood an oil finish and having the metal refinished to a brown or rusty appearance. The rifle was shot successfully in 1958 and hasn't been shot since. Any further shooting should be done after a complete look over by a gun smith since the metal is over 150 years old. After doing some research into the battle it appears that a Cherokee Chief and 400 warriors fought tenaciously for the Confederate cause. Its theorized that this rifle was used by a wealthy Indian in the battle. The two regular armies facing each other had larger caliber weapons with bayonet attachments. This rifle, although likely made in a small gunsmith shop, was obviously well crafted and expensive far above a federal issue army rifle. It would seem reasonable that this deer caliber rifle was used in the battle by an Indian and not a Confederate or Yankee soldier. The Indians were fighting to preserve their acquired wealth and property in farming using slaves, a fact not known by many Americans. Some of the personal effects of the Indian Chief at the Pea Ridge Battle can be seen at the museum in Jefferson, TX.
 There is documentation for the rifle and a photo copy of a map where the rifle was found. Not sure what the value of the rifle actually is we will be taking offers for the rifle. Please no low balls and only serious offers. If you have taken the time to read this then you know as well as I that anything with documentation to the Civil War there is an added value placed on the item. Asking $500 for the rifle. That is the best deal. If it is shipped then the buyer pays for shipping."

This gun is semi auto so it's good for Wisconsin deer hunting and quick follow up shots. I replaced the stock recoil plate with a pachmayr decelerator but i will include the stock recoil plate. The scope on it is a 3-9x40. I hunted with this rifle for many years and have taken lots of deer with it. The only reason I'm selling is I don't hunt up north anymore and haven't for a while. The area I hunt in is shotgun only due to local rules and will probably never change. I really enjoyed hunting with this rifle and I'm sad to see it go but I have no use for it anymore.

Now yes I know that the expiration date on QC Gauze is 6/14, but I called the guys at 
Z-Medica Corporation and they explained that the active ingredient is inorganic and except for it being very hydroscopic is relatively inert. Nothing to age out. Other than the packaging which with prolonged exposure to UV light and or constant molesting could damage it. The contents will last 10 years or better. The FDA requires an expiration date on ALL medical devices, medicines and supplies. And thinking about it, it also helps the manufacturers bottom line.... Making money. Now you can buy from the source and have a warm fuzzy feeling for $35-45 apiece or be smart and buy from me.

No one is using this great gun and I can picture another young boy or girl out shooting with mom and dad or either or for the first time using their very own gun.  I just located the original Tasco 4x15 scope for the rifle and will put that with the package. It wouldn't be complete with out that item.
