Has standard import marks from Georgia. Also comes with original holster, lanyard, and 125 rounds of Fiocchi ammunition. Sideplate markeing (see picture) is from the Izhevsk plant in Central Russia. These pistols were introduced under the Tsar and carried by Russian officers through both World Wars. They are actually still in service today with some Eastern European security services (postal police, railroad police).This revovler is a ton of fun to shoot. Unique thing about these revolvers is that the cylinder actually moves forward and seals with the barrell when the hammer is brought back, reducing recoil and also allowing it to be one of the only revolvers that can take a suppressor. You can also buy the ammunition separately from me for $40. Ammo is readily available online."
