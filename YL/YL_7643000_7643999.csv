The powerful CREE XM-L2 cool white LED produces a bright 600 lumen max output capable of 142 yards of throw, making it great for up-close and mid range lighting. While the CREE XP-G3 high CRI LED is produces 450 lumen capable of a 92 yard throw and creates a warm colored light that more accurately resembles the natural colors of objects when illuminated, making it great for everyday carry. A single-side switch located near the head of the unit offers easy access to five brightness levels, so you always have access to the perfect amount of light for various scenarios. The light can also be locked out during travel to prolong battery life and avoid accidental activation.   When the battery is nearly depleted, a low battery indicator located in the center of the side-switch will illuminate to signal when it’s time to charge or change your battery, so you’re never without light. And when it’s time to charge, no external charger is needed. The included RCR123A battery can be charged directly via the built-in micro-USB port making this a great flashlight for travel. The flashlight is constructed from an aluminum alloy uni-body to protect the light from everyday wear and tear, natural elements and accidental drops. A pocket clip, lanyard and magnetic tail cap are included and offer multiple options for hand-free use making this an ideal light for work and daily use.
