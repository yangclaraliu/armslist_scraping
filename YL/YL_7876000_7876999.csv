Here's a very nice original WWII Colt 1911A1 that was manufactured in mid-1942. This pistol appears to be 100% correct throughout. It carries the ""WB"" inspection mark of Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg. The slide is correctly serial numbered beneath the firing pin retainer to match the frame and has the original U-notch rear sight with the rounded front sight. The WB inspection is struck through the finish and the feed ramp is milled ""in the white"", both signs indicating original finish. There is no ordnance ""crossed cannons"" final acceptance stamp behind the right grip...this practice did not begin until October, 1942. The barrel is correctly marked ""COLT 45 AUTO"" beneath the chamber and has the small capital ""G"" ahead of the lugs. The grips are correct Coltwood with hollow backs and mold numbers. All of the various other small parts are correct for a Colt in this serial range with the single exception of the WWII contract magazine made by Scovill Mfg. Co. and marked ""S"" on the toe.The factory original parkerized finish shows only minor sharp edge wear from being holstered. There is no rust or any pitting present. It does appear that a small amount of cold blue was used to touch-up some of the areas of finish wear but it has mostly worn away and is not obvious. I'd grade the original parkerized finish at about 95% overall. The stocks are in very fine shape with light wear but no cracks or any chips. This pistol is in excellent mechanical condition and the bore rates very good with strong, sharp rifling that is very lightly frosted in the grooves. Internal finish wear at the contact surfaces between the frame, barrel, and slide indicates the barrel is likely original to the pistol. The original finish on the magazine shows a little more wear than on the pistol itself. According to Colt records, this pistol was shipped to Springfield Armory on May 26, 1942."

Please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.
I purchased this rifle new, back in 2014, and have been the only owner of it since then.  I have fired less than 100 rounds through this rifle.  All rounds fired were brass cased, non corrosive.  This model has the composite stock - not wood, and not fiberglass.  This is the Socom 16 model. 
Included with the rifle is two 20 round magazines from Checkmate Industries. 
This following boxed in (with my little dashes) portion is how the manufacturer describes this firearm on their website here (http://www.springfield-armory.com/m1a-series/) :
----------------------------------------------------
The world of tactical rifles forever changed in 2004 when Springfield Armory® introduced the M1A™ SOCOM 16. 7.62NATO power in a package this small was previously unthinkable. Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the M1A™ SOCOM 16's unique design.
The M1A™ Socom 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the M1A™ SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.
If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the M1A™ SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™.
----------------------------------------------------
Next, what follows is my FULL DISCLOSURE portion of the listing.
 
------------------------------------- FULL DISCLOSURE Portion:
With the rifle unloaded and the bolt locked to the rear, I can tilt the rifle fore and aft and hear something sliding up front.  Not sure if that is common to all Socom 16s or what it is, but something slides back and forth and I can hear it.  I took a short video clip of this and can email it.
In my limited experience shooting this rifle, I believe the front sight post is too short.  I bottomed out the rear sight, and fired a 3 round group more than once, and found the grouping to be about ten inches high at 100 yards.  Puzzled, I did a little bit of Google work, and from what folks are chattering about on forums, it seems like it is common knowledge that Springfield Armory makes and ships SOCOM 16s with a front sight post that is too short to be compatible with the rear sight aperture at 100 yards.  Go figure.  Since I discovered this, I list it here so a buyer can have full disclosure and can make their own decision with that knowledge on board.  I care more about doing honorable business than making a quick sale.
I notice some yellowish streaking on the underside of the bolt.  I believe it to be brass fouling from the bolt rubbing the next round at the top of the magazine during cycling.
 
End of FULL DISCLOSURE PORTION
--------------------------------------
 My Escali kitchen scale says this rifle weighs 8 pounds, 6.2 ounces, with the rifle unloaded and no magazine inserted. Transfer will go through FFL.  That FFL will be South Carolina Gun Company (SC Gun Co) at 242 W. Wade Hampton Blvd, Greer, South Carolina. 
In the event I'm shipping this, whatever the buyer's cost is to receive it from their FFL will be on the buyer.  Transfer going through FFL is non-negotiable.  I took several more pictures than the 3 I can post with my free Armslist account.  If you want more, I can email them.  If I am to ship this rifle, I will accept USPS money order, and I will turn that into real cash money in my hand before I ship anything anywhere.  Sorry for the extra time and hassle, I'm selling a legit product and I want to ensure I have legit payment to avoid getting burned here. 
If we meet in person at the FFL, I'll accept cash, and cash only.  Buyer of a rifle needs to be 18 years of age and able to pass the inquiry of ATF Form 4473.
In the event that buyer wants me to ship this firearm to their FFL, buyer assumes burden of responsibility of knowing that this firearm is legal for them to possess (whatever the particulars of their state's laws and statues are on the subject).  Buyer also ensures that he or she is legally able to possess this firearm (is mentally competent, has not been convicted of even a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and all the other qualifying points on ATF Form 4473).   In the event that buyer and seller agree to a sale, I (the seller) receive payment, package up the firearm, take it to the FFL, transfer the firearm to the FFL so that the FFL can proceed to ship firearm to the buyer's FFL, and then it turns out the buyer cannot take possession of the firearm for whatever reason - we (buyer and seller) agree that I (seller) will refund only half of the money.  I know this is ugly talk, but it's just and it's simple: I'm a regular guy with a life to live and job to pursue, trying to liquidate a couple items, buyer needs to know if they can pass the checklist to take possession of said firearm (i.e., I respect your time, hard-earned money, and hassle; I expect you to respect mine).
I will not sell firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL). Again, do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."

It is a top to bottom collector grade example. It was obviously unissued. The original blue finish rates 99% with very light scattered handling.

The color casing on the hammer and trigger retain most of their brilliance. The wood grips are in the same excellent condition as the gun itself.
