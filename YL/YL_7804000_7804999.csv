The Rifle Dynamics AK to M-4 Stock Adapter (Gen II) allows for the replacement of any standard fixed stock AKM (see exceptions below) to work with an AR buffer tube assembly. The angle of our adapter is designed specifically to position the buffer tube, allowing the shooter to easily access proper sight picture with iron sights and/or optics.This feature also allows many different sling-mounting options for the individual users. Any sling adapter that fits on the AR buffer tube should work. This adapter is easy to install without modification to your AK-47, AK-74, AKM and with no need to permanently alter the stock tang.
The Rifle Dynamics RDAK to M-4 stock Adapter is designed by Rifle Dynamics and made in the USA!
Buffer tube, castle nut, end plate and buttstock sold separately.

Because of this it has had less than 5 boxes of Pmc brass fmj run through it. It is very nice and looks new. I have decided I would rather have a nice ccw pistol so I am selling it. I just did a thorough cleaning of the rifle although it didn't really need it. I choose not to lubricate it after cleaning, I will leave that up to whoever purchases it so they can use their lubricant of choice.I will list specifications below. I am not a dealer, this will be a private face to face transaction that will take place at either the Andover PD parking lot or an East side substation.

Let's play ""Who is the moron"".  Here are your options: 1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons).  I actually own this same model pistol. Next to my vintage Star, Super B, the JA32 is my favorite pistol to shoot. Look all you want, but I am the only dealer selling this model brand new with these custom grips.  The sights are extremely simple and basic, but they work well. Very easy to keep on targe. recoil is more controled than a .380acp. Still a big enough round for self defense. Until the late 1980's, most European law enforcement used the .32acp round for their primary hand guns. Time tested design, which is basically the same as the old Jennings, Lorcin, and Bryco guns, but finished better. Comes with two 6 round mags.  Very hard to find, as the factory seldom makes this model."
