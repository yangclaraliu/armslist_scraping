It has a painted wood stock, angled picatinny rail scope mounts with a 3x9x32 scope and a Harris bi-pod. It has no more than 75 rounds through it and last time I shot for groups I got around 1/2MOA. I hate to see it go but I'm in need of money pretty bad right now and I haven't used this in years. It has been maintained though. It gets stripped and cleaned every 6 months and just had a JB bore polish treatment done. I'm selling it for $250 or best offer to try and move it fast. Preferably this week.

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

54,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3180054,For Sale:  Mil-A-Spec 46100 Body Armor With Condor Carriers,"Tucson, Payson, Phoenix, Tempe, Maricopa Az, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, June 16, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The available colors of the vests are ""Desert Tan"" ""OD Green"" ""Black"" NOTE: If you buy 3 or more sets I will offer a discount. If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

This pistol is the limited ""NIB-X edition"", so it has the nickel boron coating on top of Glocks standard tennifer on the slide, internals, and barrel. In case you are unfamiliar with nickel boron, it is an ion bonding process that results in a finish that is like stainless steel in appearance, however, it has a lifetime warranty to NEVER chip, crack, or rust. This stuff is near indestructible. I have seen torture test that are unbelievable. People have left guns with this coating in Salt water for 12 months without a single spot of corrosion. They also say you don't have to ever clean or lubricate the gun because the nickel boron has high lubricity. All you ever do is give it a quick wipe and pass a patch down the barrel. However, having said that, this gun has been cleaned regularly anyway.

This pistol is in like new condition. I bought it new and have put only 75 rounds through it. I'm only selling to make room for a new purchase. The pistol comes in the original box, with two magazines. One of the magazines has a finger grip extender that makes drawing and firing much easier. The grip has a rubberized talon decal to help with the grip, but if you don't like it you can remove it. Also comes with the factory speed loader and a nice leather in the waistband holster from Tagua. Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking!

In case you are not familiar with '6BR'.....
From E.A. Brown website:
""6mm BR Norma - The 6BR was THE Benchrest favorite until 6mm PPC came along.
But now, Benchrest competitions are going to longer distances, and there is a resurgence in popularity of the 6mm BR using the heavier 100-105 gr. bullets and renamed to ""6mm BR Norma"".
Our 6mm BR Norma barrels are throated for these long, heavy bullets and done in a 1:8 rifling twist especially to suit 100-105 gr match bullets.
Really a fun, heavy hitting tack-driver""

Photos show a brand new specimen of FMK’s new 9C1 pistol, a distinctive piece that reminds us of several others. Manufacturer is FMK Firearms of Placentia, CA. Type is striker fired, blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel slide, barrel, and most internal parts mounted in a polymer frame. Slide to frame mating is achieved with integral parts and with a slotted metal trigger insert. This pistol’s slide rails measure at .735 inch on the front and .565 on the back, considerably more metal contacting the slide than many similar pistols, notably the Glock 19. Magazine release is steel as well, not capable of being reversed for southpaws. Trigger is .415 wide combat, with a service width .265 center trigger safety. The 9C1 also has a firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped. Sight system is conventional 3 dot, with the front sight doubly anchored with a stud and a Phillips screw from the underside. This pistol comes with no fewer than 5 replacement rear sights, for center aim, 1 inch right or left windage, and 2 inch right or left windate. It also comes with a total of two or three, depending on the specimen, front sights for elevation correction. Rear sight is semicircle base slotted into the slide. Barrel is service length 3.87 inch, .562 outer diameter, 1:16 Left Hand Twist 6 groove. Overall length is 6.85 incheas; height is 5.09 inches from the magazine floorplate to the top of the rear sight; weight empty is 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity empty where the trigger guard intersects the frame. Frame is integrally rail equipped, and grip frame has moderate finger grooves on its front strap, and pliable back strap insert for sure grip and for arresting recoil fatigue. Slide width is 1.07 inches; maximum thickness 1.15 at the slide release lever. Action is full time double action, of course; trigger pull on the photo specimen gauged at a uniform 6 pounds of pressure, with 17 mm travel distance. Magazines are both 14 shot steel body with rounded polymer floorplate and white polymer cartridge follower. The FMK had solid reviews in its 2010 maiden year; since then, the 2nd generation triggers are much improved. Similar pistols command prices upwards of $600 per unit. We’re offering the FMK 9C1 Gen 2 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 319.00. Not transferable to civilians in MA. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 14 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement, we will sub 10 rounders if we have any, or $30 off with no magazines

Photos show a brand new specimen of FMK’s new 9C1 pistol with Desert Colorized Frame, a distinctive piece that reminds us of several others. Manufacturer is FMK Firearms of Placentia, CA. Type is striker fired, blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel slide, barrel, and most internal parts mounted in a desert tan polymer frame. Slide to frame mating is achieved with integral parts and with a slotted metal trigger insert. This pistol’s slide rails measure at .735 inch on the front and .565 on the back, considerably more metal contacting the slide than many similar pistols, notably the Glock 19. Magazine release is steel as well, not capable of being reversed for southpaws. Trigger is .415 wide combat, with a service width .265 center trigger safety. The 9C1 also has a firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped. Sight system is conventional 3 dot, with the front sight doubly anchored with a stud and a Phillips screw from the underside. This pistol comes with no fewer than 5 replacement rear sights, for center aim, 1 inch right or left windage, and 2 inch right or left windate. It also comes with a total of two or three, depending on the specimen, front sights for elevation correction. Rear sight is semicircle base slotted into the slide. Barrel is service length 3.87 inch, .562 outer diameter, 1:16 Left Hand Twist 6 groove. Overall length is 6.85 incheas; height is 5.09 inches from the magazine floorplate to the top of the rear sight; weight empty is 23 1/2 ounces with center of gravity empty where the trigger guard intersects the frame. Frame is integrally rail equipped, and grip frame has moderate finger grooves on its front strap, and pliable back strap insert for sure grip and for arresting recoil fatigue. Slide width is 1.07 inches; maximum thickness 1.15 at the slide release lever. Action is full time double action, of course; trigger pull on the photo specimen gauged at a uniform 6 pounds of pressure, with 17 mm travel distance. Magazines are both 14 shot steel body with rounded polymer floorplate and white polymer cartridge follower. The FMK had solid reviews in its 2010 maiden year; since then, the 2nd generation triggers are much improved. Similar pistols command prices upwards of $600 per unit. We’re offering the FMK 9C1DE Gen 2 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 319.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of the United States. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 14 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement, we will sub 10 rounders if we have any, or $30 off with no magazines.

I only put about 200 rounds through it. I love this gun but I don't have a good area to shoot a 30 round magazine. My local ranges have round limits  and I just don't know anyone with large enough property to let me shoot.  This Ak47 is a little bit different than other Ak47s I have seen and shot. The receiver on this gun is thicker, the stock is longer, and there is an extra button to release the dust cover. From research it is because this gun used to have a grenade launcher so the guns were built with that in mind. The receiver is 1.8mm thick. (most ak47s stamped are 1.0mm). When I bought the gun It was missing a retention spring that holds the pins in. I replaced that part with a tapco retainer plate. This makes it easier to get back in then the old style spring. I also put on a bushnell red dot scope. You can read the details on google. I also put a side scope mount on. It's  quick release and it really works well with taking off the red dot to clean the gun then put back on . It's always dead on again! I never had a fail from this gun. Not sure what ak47 does fail. LOL. The gun comes with two magazines- a 30 round steel and  the other one is 40 or 50 round plastic mag.  I never used it. It was given to me by a friend.  I also have 450 rounds of tula 7.62X39 that can go with the gun I have no use for it. I would like to sell in PA. If the gun must be shipped you are responsible for all shipping cost and fees. This gun is like new. Very clean and no scratches.  
I'm asking $600 for just the gun, mags and red dot. If you just want the gun and mags then I will let that go for $525. I would be willing to let the ammo go for $75."

To top it off, the trigger has also been smoothed out and lightened by SIG's head gunsmith back when I used to work there a few years ago. This gun is solid in every way and is a great gun. There's a reason why they are so popular, they are great guns. 

This package includes everything you would need to comfortably conceal or bring to the range.

It was originally intended to be used as the U.S. military sidearm, but the U.S. government couldn't afford them, so they gave the contract to another company. The M9 has a 5 inch barrel, which makes it a little more accurate. It's basically spot on at 25 yards, provided you are a decent shooter.

If you want just the rifle the way it looks in pic, I'm asking $1100 obo.  The price for the whole package is below after what it includes.

You can email me for add'l pics and I can email you back or I can text them.....You can also text me, my number is at bottom of listing.

Mulitiple GLocks, Glocks plus cash, Sig P238 in FDE or Desert or Scorpion and other handguns I might consider plus cash but must be new or like new and not junk brands.  I really only would consider other hand guns in 1911 only if it was a great deal for me as I would likely sell it later, but would still need cash on top, I cant do even trade, sorry.

Also could consider a little ammo on trade too. .308,5.56, 223, 9mm, 45 or 22lr



Please don't waste our time with full retail on your gun as I'm not asking full retail, I can just keep this and sell it whenever someone is willing to pay a reasonable amount.  I value NEW unfired Glocks at $450-525 depending on model and features, I dont need 6 holsters with it and 20 mags, I'll take them but I cant give them much value since I dont need them.  No  offense, but I have plenty of all of that.

The Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle, also known as the Semi Automatic 22 or SA-22, is a takedown rifle produced by FN Herstal based on a John Browning patent. The rifle is currently produced by Browning as the Semi-Auto 22. Production began in 1914 and continued through 1974 in Belgium and production continued in 1976 in Japan by Miroku.[1] It was first exported by FN for the American market in 1956.  The SA-22 was the first production semiautomatic .22 rifle,[2] and is regarded as a classic firearm.[2][3] It has been offered in several ""grades"" of engraving and gold inlay, and is a widely collected gun, especially those manufactured in Belgium.

The Semi-auto .22 is a made from blued steel and walnut, and ejects spent cases downward. This feature was intended by the designer to keep the user's face ""protected from gasses and flying particles while firing"", at which it succeeds.  The lack of a side-mounted ejection port also leaves a large ""canvas"" for engraving.[2] Factory engraving was done by hand at FN Herstal, and is done by laser engraving with hand finishing at Miroku.

L-3 EOTech XPS3-0 holographic red-dot sight provides rapid heads-up-both-eyes-open target acquisition. Sporting a shortened form factor to save valuable rail space, the XPS3-0 is configured with a Picatinny/Weaver compatible mount.

Because it's powered by a single transverse-mounted CR123A battery, the XPS3 is shorter than the N and AA battery versions - yet it delivers the same parallax-free sighting capabilities. This sight requires a mere 2.75"" of rail space, and the battery compartment is raised to accommodate the Delta Ring of most M16/AR15 platform firearms. The battery cap is a simple screw-type cover that's o-ring sealed and tethered to the housing.

The control buttons are positioned on the rear of the rugged aluminum housing for ease of operation. The illuminated reticle is configured with a 65 MOA circle and a single 1 MOA dot - the illumination system provides the operator with 30 brightness levels to choose from, 10 of which are compatible with night vision gear.

Designed for today's modern battlefield; the XPS3-0 is submersible to a depth of 33', and it's repeatable to 2 MOA after remounting. The rear window is a 3/16"" thick shatterproof laminate with anti-glare and scratch resistant coatings, and the front lens is 1/8"" solid glass. Because the optical system is based upon transmission holography, parallax error is not an issue

Optical Performance
Front Window: 1/8"" solid glass
Rear Window: 3/16"" shatter-resistant laminate
Optical surfaces feature anti-glare lens coatings
Heads-Up Display: eliminates blind spots and constricted vision
Transmission holography - instantly visible in any light, parallax free
Even if the laminated window is obstructed or damaged, the HWS remains fully operational. Provided a portion of the window is intact/visible, the entire reticle pattern will be seen on target, and the POI/POA will be maintained.
Use and Handling
Powered by 1 CR123A: 600 hr run-time
Operating temperature range: -40 to 150°F
Automatic shut-down: 8 hr, programmable to 4 hr
Battery check indicator: flashing reticle at start-up

Illuminated A65/1 Reticle: 65 MOA circle, 1 MOA dot. 30 Brightness settings with scrolling feature, 10 NV compatible settings
Construction Details
Color/finish: non-reflective black hard-coat

Submersible to 33.0'/10.1 m, fogproof internal optics
Durable housing features a rugged aluminum hood assembly

Photos show one of the first specimens we received of Ruger’s new SR45 series pistols, and Sturm Ruger’s Germanic genes showed up in this pistol’s resemblance to the classic Heckler & Koch P9S that was introduced 40 years ago. Manufacturer, of course, is Sturm, Ruger & Company of Prescott, Arizona. Construction is Stainless Steel slide and barrel, and steel internal parts all in a steel reinforced polymer frame. Type is striker ignition, blowback semi-automatic pistol, full time double action. Safety system is familiar center of trigger lever, firing pin safety, and ambidextrous low profile main safety. Barrel is 4 1/2 inch, 6 Groove Stainless with 1:16 rifling. Extractor is top centered and doubles as a loaded chamber indicator. Trigger is .375 wide, smooth face with lever center; Sights are white 3 dot, blue steel, dovetailed into the stainless slide. Rear sight is elevation adjustable, and drift adjustable for windage with a lock screw. Front sight forward cant facilitates rapid deployment from a holster, and the rear sight’s surfaces are no snag style. Maximum overall length is 8 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut; height is 5 3/4 inches from the top of the rear sight to the magazine floorplate. Slide width is 1.16 inch; and frame width is 1.27 inches at the port, and the levers maintain that very thin profile. Magazines are Ruger matte blue finish steel body, steel spring, with polymer floorplate and cartridge follower. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of .45 ACP caliber ammunition, 10+1 capacity. Weight empty is 30 ounces, with center of gravity just forward of the magazine release. Grip frame is contoured checkered surfaces on front strap and side panel areas, and the SR45 is unique in having a reversible grip frame back strap, that allows grip circumference to size down from approximately 6.5 inches to 6 inches. An HK P9S commands pricing in the 4 figures. Fat competitors Glock and Smith & Wesson command prices upwards of $700 apiece, and they don’t offer stainless slide variants like this one. We’re offering the Ruger KSR45 in the photos, or one of its identical mates for only $ 389.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States.

The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, (5) 26 round Alexander Arms magazines, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo, I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then we go to a local FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested. If one carbine is not enough for you, I have two Alexander Arms consecutive serial number carbines waiting for that father sons hunting trip. I would be happy to sell both to you for $1000.00 each.

22 magnum ammo
Hey all,
I got real lucky and just had a big order of mag ammo process and it is on its way at a really good price. As a result of it I can “shift” the price and average it to all of what I have 22 mag wise, which lowers the price that these cost me and thus what they’ll cost you! That being said, here is what I physically have on hand right now, and I will be getting a decent amount more in in the coming week or so. 

I'm selling it at cost to me with shipping and tax so price is for pick up in Norman only. Would also consider trades for certain pistols (derringers in bigger bores mainly), looking specially for a PF9 actually, and even trades for certain other ammunition. Would also consider trades for 45 auto ammo. (Probably a 1-1 ratio depending on the ammo) Here is what I have available as of now:

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Armscor precision 22mag-$16 per 50 rounds (1.350 rounds in total) 

-20 boxes of 50 rounds of 40gr JHP Fiocchi Performance 22mag-$16 per 50


I will break it up however you would like to buy it box wise or you can buy it all. It is all the same to me. It is not the best price in the world, but at least I found some I could get available to y'all. Shoot me a text at REDACTED if you would like to arrange a trade or pickup. Or just shoot me a PM on here. Thanks and happy hunting!"

If you're looking for non-magnetic 7.62x39 range ammo, then Sellier & Bellot's 7.62x39 ammo is an excellent choice.
