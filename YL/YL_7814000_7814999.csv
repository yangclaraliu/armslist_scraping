This is an ""Off Roster"" pistol, but it has been registered in California, so it can be sold in California in a face-to-face transaction. Please refer to pictures for questions regarding condition. Per Colt, this pistol was originally made in 1972. I didn't start this build. I purchased it used, so I don't have a round count. It comes with a Barsto Barrel, what appear to be Wilson Combat controls, an upgraded beavertail safety, light weight trigger, Hogue Aluminum smooth grips ($112 value), and the frame appears to have been reblued. The frame does not match the high luster slide, but it looks great. Kind of accents the slide. The sights and guide rod looks original. Guide rod is not a full length version. Comes with 2 Shooting Star Chip McCormick blued 7 round magazines. Sold as is. So please view pictures closely. Buyer responsible for transfer fees. (If you're a SF Bay Area buyer, I do my transfers at Old West Gun Room in El Cerrito. No trades, cash only.) For sales requiring shipping, I accept USPS Money Orders only, no personal checks, cashiers checks, credit cards, or trades. I am a private seller, so UPS requires non-dealers to ship overnight.

But it's a extremely light and smooth shooting rifle and I've added multiple upgrades to it as I've had it for about 8 months since buying new. And I still have the original s&w box and pprwork.Upgrades are as follows.......Changed out the moe stock  for a FDE CTR STOCK Added a Magpul b.a.d lever, Magpul extended mag release, ambi qd duel l&r sockets on the BUFFER tube, Daniel defense qd socket to the handguard, Magpul FDE xts handstop kit, Magpul FDE k grip, Magpul type 1 mlok rail covers,Magpul FDE ladder covers, and 4 OEM s&w 15-22lr 25 round magazines. And lastly a 3 chamber competition muzzle brake..... lol not needed for recoil as we all know but it does add just the right ammount of weight to the front end of this LIGHT rifle and keeps it super flat when shooting. Its literally less recoil than a bb gun.Just look up the price of these rifles without all the upgradrd parts and 25$ magazine's and you will see my price is more than fare. Thanks if interested text me 678-681-4519 comes with the rifle case in the pics. Also I have brand new Magpul moe VFG's and AFG'S in black if you do not like the handstop setup.

But it's a extremely light and smooth shooting rifle and I've added multiple upgrades to it as I've had it for about 8 months since buying new. And I still have the original s&w box and pprwork.Upgrades are as follows.......Changed out the moe stock  for a FDE CTR STOCK Added a Magpul b.a.d lever, Magpul extended mag release, ambi qd duel l&r sockets on the BUFFER tube, Daniel defense qd socket to the handguard, Magpul FDE xts handstop kit, Magpul FDE k grip, Magpul type 1 mlok rail covers,Magpul FDE ladder covers, and 4 OEM s&w 15-22lr 25 round magazines. And lastly a 3 chamber competition muzzle brake..... lol not needed for recoil as we all know but it does add just the right ammount of weight to the front end of this LIGHT rifle and keeps it super flat when shooting. Its literally less recoil than a bb gun.Just look up the price of these rifles without all the upgradrd parts and 25$ magazine's and you will see my price is more than fare. Thanks if interested text me REDACTED comes with the rifle case in the pics. Also I have brand new Magpul moe VFG's and AFG'S in black if you do not like the handstop setup.

Very very low round count. I bought it for my daughter as a present so we could shoot together...... well we went twice and she lost interest in it. And it's not my cup of tea. But it's a extremely light and smooth shooting rifle and I've added multiple upgrades to it as I've had it for about 8 months since buying new. And I still have the original s&w box and pprwork.Upgrades are as follows.......Changed out the moe stock  for a FDE CTR STOCK Added a Magpul b.a.d lever, Magpul extended mag release, ambi qd duel l&r sockets on the BUFFER tube, Daniel defense qd socket to the handguard, Magpul FDE xts handstop kit, Magpul FDE k grip, Magpul type 1 mlok rail covers,Magpul FDE ladder covers, and 4 OEM s&w 15-22lr 25 round magazines. And lastly a 3 chamber competition muzzle brake..... lol not needed for recoil as we all know but it does add just the right ammount of weight to the front end of this LIGHT rifle and keeps it super flat when shooting. Its literally less recoil than a bb gun.Just look up the price of these rifles without all the upgradrd parts( look at pic bellow) and the 25$ a peice magazine's and you will see my price is more than fare. Thanks if interested text me 678-681-4519 comes with the rifle case in the pics. Also I have brand new Magpul moe VFG's and AFG'S in black if you do not like the handstop setup. And I'll throw in about  50$ worth of ammo 300 rnds of a.e 22, 150 cci, 100 Remington thanks for looking."

Will need to be shaved down more or be replaced with conversion catch.For some reason, the rifle will jam on every 3rd or 4th round. I've tried running various mags to troubleshoot & I think it runs the best with Chinese steel mags. I'm about 95% sure the issues are being caused by the bullet guide. Will either need to figure out which mags run the best without failures or maybe have the bullet guide redone. I paid almost $900 for this rifle in the sporterized configuration & with the money spent in upgrades it's worth at least $1100-1200. I know I won't get all my money back but I feel like $700 is a fair price considering the work that may need to be done to get the rifle 100% operational shouldn't be too much especially if you fix it yourself.

The receiver is very thick and heavy. Full-auto ""X"" mark is visible, as mentioned before, it's sourced from the same military plant that arms the Serbian Military. I have 3 magazine, two are military surplus with packing grease still present(soak in warm water to remove). There's also a Romanian drum, but the spindle(inner piece) need to be replaced. Also included is a door breacher, Browning Machine Gun attachment and ammo(loose and boxed). Good deal for $650. First come, first serve.
