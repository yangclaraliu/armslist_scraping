Additional screw placements on top of the receiver provide for secure attachment of a scope base or Picatinny rail. The T3X uses a 2-lug bolt with a 75º lift that cycles smooth as silk. The 75º bolt lift aids in keeping hand and gloves away from the scope and speeds the cycling process. An enlarged ejection port facilitates feeding rounds one at a time. A single column polymer magazine feeds reliably, and facilitates in loading and unloading the rifle. A single-stage adjustable trigger breaks crisp and clean, allowing hunters to make quick, accurate shots under field conditions. The Tikka weighs under 7lbs! making this rifle an excellent choice for hunters. LOG:43637"

This is the solid set screw style. Item is in very good condition only used for a couple weeks with less than 50 rounds fired with it. Comes with gas block and pistol length piston op rod only. Does not come with Superlative Arms bolt carrier group. Ships to lower 48 U.S. States only.Here are the specs per the manufacturer: The Superlative Arms patented “Bleed Off”, Gas Piston System for the AR15 platform adjusts the gas flow by bleeding the gas out of the block instead of restricting the flow like conventional adjustable blocks. Results: The pressure used in the block is reduced only to the amount required to drive the bolt carrier. The remaining gas / pressure are bled out of the block allowing the system to run much cleaner and cooler. Reduction of felt recoil. Patented adjustment detent is located outside of the block and therefore no contamination. The gas adjustment screw does not restrict the gas flow; therefore there is no erosion or seizing of the screw / no loss of detent due to carbon build up. Although it is removable, we have added a safety mechanism, which stops you from unintentionally backing the screw all the way out. When using SBR’s and / or suppressors the bleed off port allows the excessive pressure to be exhausted out of the block reducing blow back. DATA: Firearm Type: AR15 Gas Length: Pistol Barrel Diameter: 0.750"" Piston Block Attachment Type: Solid, Set Screw Piston Block Material and Finish: 416 SS, Melonite Gas Adjustment: (Patented) 30 Locked Positions, Front Of Block Bleed Off Port: (Patented) Front Of Block"

Chambered for the .22LR cartridge, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Green Laser/Light. This has been mounted on a pistol but never shot with it on. The Green Laser is incredibly bright and projects farther than most handgun caliber bullets will fly. The light is 500 lumens of blinding light with a very tight beam, and 1.5 hours of tactical runtime. The selector switch on bottom allows you to select the Light only, Laser only, both on, or both off. The thumb screw makes for easy on, easy off deployment, but can be locked down securely. This is THE top of the line Surefire Weapon Light System and feels great. Much lighter than it's predecessor, the X400 ULTRA GN is worth every penny.
