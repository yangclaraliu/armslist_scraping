This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. This isn’t one of the crappy new ones they are producing. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish. And before he got it, it had just returned from Taurus were I had them replace all the internals that showed signs of wear, which was the firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up. Thank you."

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound less due to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no manual safety lever, the relatively longer and heavier first round trigger pull requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. It has snag-free, fixed 3-dot sights. Other features of the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps, and a loaded chamber indicator.
