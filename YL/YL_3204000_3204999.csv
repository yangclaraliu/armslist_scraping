List of items is as described; Ruger SR22 Pistol, two 10 round magazines with interchangeable bumpers on the bottom, two grips from the factory, users/owners manual, neoprene protective zip case, a small universal holster (OWB) and the lock w/key. Also included in the trade/sale will be a stainless steel guide rod/spring combo that was purchased from Brownells and manufactured by Galloway Precision. This part is currently installed on the pistol and is factory spec, non-performance, just a lot more durable than the plastic toothpick that was originally in it (which will also be included). We WILL meet face to face for the transaction and at time of trasaction you must present a valid Kentucky drivers liscense. CCDW is not by any means necessary but is preferred. Price is $350 firm, both cash and trade and I will deliver to you for no extra charge within reason and allow you to test fire at your own expense. I don't need this gone, I simply have other items of interest."

Other minor things of note, has the 5th amendment dust cover and a ""don't tread on me"" laser engraved into the trigger guard. Even with the slightly raised reflex mount the backup sights are still clear through the optic and are dead on for shorter range. It has some character, so minor scratches here and there seeing how it's actually been used and not a safe queen. Comes with one full magpul magazine with green tip ammo.

Everything was installed with care and the gun itself has been well maintained. In extra parts alone your looking at around 700-800 dollars. Add in cost of the rifle, you're looking at 1300+ dollars. My asking price is 950 for the lot, optic included but I'm willing to barter on prices. Trade wise I'm not too interested in pistols/shotguns unless you've got a VEPR 12. Rifle wise I'm looking at other battle rifles, CETME, FAL, PTR91, VEPR's in .308 or 54r, etc. But cash is preferred.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Detailed Description]

General:
For sale is a brand new Benelli M4 with authentic M4 collapsible skeletonized stock.  This shotgun needs no introduction and I think most will agree that this is one of the most sought-after firearms in the world, and in its most desired configuration.  I really, REALLY did not want to sell this but my financial situation has left me no choice.

This gun is in perfect condition both functionally and cosmetically and has only been test fired twice: once by Benelli and once by myself (5 rounds) just to function test after making it 922r compliant; otherwise it was literally a safe KING and bragging rights piece.  Take a look at the picture below to see the spotless chamber.

----------
Price:
I feel my asking price is fair considering the research and work required to make this M4 922r compliant and legal to own in any configuration in CA...not to mention the overpriced $400 stock.  I've spent many hours searching forums and websites to learn the legal complexities of this gun as well as the gunsmithing that's required for the conversion, so if anything the price factors in time, labor, and legal knowledge too.  I'm willing to take trade-ins from the list below and offers for how much you want for them:

Glocks any model, Gen 3 or 4
Walther PPK, any caliber
S&W Models 10, 15, or 36
Remington 700, any RH version in .308
Steyr Scout in .308
IMI Desert Eagle, various models
IMI Tavor in FDE
AK-74s, various models
HK pistols, various models

----------
922r Compliance:
There are complex legal issues with this gun due to it's import nature and fame, 922r compliance being the most important to understand.  For a more detailed explanation about this law please check out these sites:

http://freedomfightertactical.com/922r-faq/
http://www.tapco.com/section922r/

For the conversion I've acquired and installed these 3 acceptable parts:
Hammer - http://geissele.com/benelli-m4-super-90-hammer.html
Magazine body - http://davesmetalworks.com/m4.html
Magazine follower - http://nordiccomp.com/retail/shop/followers/nc-low-drag-follower-12-ga/

I'll be more than happy to teach interested buyers about all the legalities of this gun, especially the laws regarding the collapsible stock, but in summary this gun is now 100% legal to own in CA with either stock (traditional or skeletonized) and either magazine capacity (standard or extended).

----------
Terms:
You'll have to provide a phone number that I can reach you at and preferred calling time if you have one. I'll also be calling from my personal cell phone.  I won't deal with anyone who's not willing to speak over the phone first.

Face-to-Face Transfer -
1. I live in Chino, CA and require any interested buyers to meet at the Turner Outdoorsman in Chino Hills. I've conducted many private-party gun transfers there before and know that it's a great and safe location to meet and conduct PPTs at.
2. You are responsible for all the private party transfer fees.
3. I prefer cash but given the high price of this item I will also take Paypal if you trust me enough.  With Paypal you would have to pay me IN FULL AND IN ADVANCE before meeting though, but at least you have that buyer protection Paypal offers.

Shipping to FFL -
1. I can have this shipped from my FFL dealer to yours.  I will need to verify who your dealer is and it will help if he/she works for a business I can easily look up online or call.
2.  You'll have to send a copy of your FFL dealer's license to both me and my FFL dealer.  I can discuss those details over phone though and I won't deal with anyone who is not willing to chat over the phone first.  I'm also aware of the possible scams people run on sites like these so don't even try.

I apologize for the strict terms but I've bought and sold enough guns online to know what people are capable of and just want to protect myself and any potential buyers.  Otherwise I consider myself a nice and trustworthy individual and only want to deal with others who are the same. 

----------

If you've made it this far and are still interested, please send me a message with your name and phone number and I'll respond as soon as I can.  My name is An and let me know if you're interested or have any questions.  :)"

      I am looking to purchase an SKS rifle; I would prefer Russian or at least European-made, but I am also open to Type 56's and other copies. I should mention at the start that this will be a regular shooter. I'm not looking for so-perfect-Stalin-himself-would-cry museum quality pieces. In fact, I would prefer ones with damaged stocks; part of the fun of getting a new gun is cleaning all the muck off it.

    I will consider 'sporterized' SKS', but I am primarily interested in an unaltered rifle. Essentially, if it's still in the cosmoline because you haven't gotten around to it, it's perfect.

In addition to cash, I also have up for trade two rifles. The first is a Winchester, Model 94, chambered in .30-30. It's in 'Very Good' condition, really all it needs is a thorough cleaning with a cleaning rod; I don't have one small enough to fit in the barrel.

The second is a yet unidentified Lee Enfield, chambered in .303 British, and apparently made in India. There is some light surface rust on the front sight, but otherwise it's in excellent shape. I am researching exactly what type of Enfield this is, but it's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

If none of those appeal to you, I have plenty of 7.62x39mm, as well as 7.62x54R.



In my first ad on Armslist, when I asked for Mosins, over 100 were offered up in a matter of weeks. Let's see what you've got, Portland!


The picture below is meant to show roughly what condition rifles I will consider. Of course, I'll always take a look at what you have.

    Regards,

This is a quality heavy duty solid steel construction pistol with a mint tight action, mirror bore and an awesome finsh. There is a thumb safety located on the left side of frame and a rock solid dependable half cock hammer safety feature. The pistols action is very smooth and tight. Its from my personal collection and i believe it to be unfired. I will recomend cci high velocity ammunition in pistols like these, as low velocity ammo may not cycle the blowback action. I have heard astra made alot of colt jumior 25 acp pistols for colt in the 60s or70s on colt machinery.'dont pin me down on this' but i have a few astra slides that say - made for colt's by astra 'NOT COLT', maybe a spanish typo lol...  Also i am almost sure the astra cub .25acp parts are useable in colt pistols and astra in colt... 
Either way its a good pistol for your c&r collection or cc cary for yor wife. 22 short rimfire is quite potent as i have tried it in other similar pistols. 
Either way a few high velocity rounds in the liver and cranial mass of your attacker will keep you or your beloved safe.

Also I will not respond to any more offers of junker AKS will only accept offers for preban norincos or polytechs or milled receiver arsenal's only. Thanks so much.
This FN15 is nw in the box never fired and has a TRIJICON TRI POWER sitting on top of a new LARUE LT150 Tactical quick release mount. It has a ELZETTA C Charlie 333 900 lumens weapon light. ELZETTA calls this light the scorcher once you see it you will know why. Forget about seeing if you get it with it at night and even in day light it will have you seeing spots for 15min. Its sitting in a ELZETTA ZSM mount with optional side rail. Last is a AIMSHOT LS8300. These are only sold to SOCOM and other Elite SF Units they are no longer sold to LE Agency's and only sold to the military on official POs only. You can contact Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify this. This is the brightest laser you have ever seen you can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Comes with two tail caps and zero tool. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking."

I am looking for serious buyers because too many people playing games and either not researching things about this weapon or wasting my time. Just to let you know there is plenty of 9mmx18 makarov rounds in stock everywhere and easy to get as not many people use this size round and is way cheaper than 9mm luger. This firearm has upgraded wolff springs and is fully field stripped and cleaned. It has low recoil and this comes to the advantage of a newer shooter or someone who wants a small carry 9mm with out the hassle of missing your target. I really do not want to get rid of this masterpiece and have hit hard times and must sell to make ends meet.

(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

I have for sale an original and superb example of a 1944 Tula arsenal PU sniper, this is one of the early to middle (90's) Century imports that does not have those big ugly billboard import marks(it does have a much smaller and much more discreet import mark by the front sight).

As mentioned in the header it is all stamped matching numbers(no line outs and renumbering), it has a sharp shiny bore and a crisp clear (updated to 91/30 spec.s) SVT40 scope.

The stock is also correct with the Tula arsenal stamp and the 1944 date.  

The only known flaw is that some shellac was scraped off on the top hand guard while removing the rear barrel band(very common with these).

I have plenty of pictures but I will not spend a whole lot of time with bunches of pic.s due to prior potential buyers wasting my time(sorry). If your interested in a great rifle come see it, you won't be disappointed.

You can find one cheaper but not better quality and if you know what this is you know it's worth it.

Comes with correct lens caps and I can throw in an original scope cover, a sling and loops.

The SureFire 618LMG replaces the original forend of your Remington 870 shotgun. Compact 6-volt (2-battery) system features a virtually indestructible LED emitter focused by a TIR lens, which produces a brilliant beam optimized for close- to medium range applications. Three switches are integrated into the forend: a momentary-on pressure pad switch (right side), a system-disable rocker switch (right side) and a constant-on rocker switch (left side). The 618LMG generates 200 lumens of output and has a tactical runtime of 2 hours per set of batteries, with gradually decreasing output afterward. The tough polymer body features a molded-in high-friction pad for enhanced grip in wet or cold conditions.

749,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3204749,For Sale/Trade:  Black Mathews ZXT LOADED with SKB TSA approved case,"picayune, Kiln, Bay St. Louis, Nicholson, Gulfport / Biloxi, Mississippi","$ 1,150","Listed On: Monday, June 23, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I purchased this bow new and had it set up last fall in September from the Mathews dealer that I have always used (my 3rd Mathews) in Virgiinia.  I have loved all of my Mathews, but this one is the smoothest, fastest (320+ FPS), and most forgiving of them all!  You will not find a quieter bow that will shoot a cleaner paper than this bow!  
After about 3 weeks I hurt my shoulder at work and still can not shoot it.  There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the bow (if there is as much as a tiny scratch, I'm unaware of it).  I shot it probably 150 or so times before I got hurt.  There are too many things to list, if I miss something, please email with questions, I will gladly answer them. The pictures will tell you more about the bow that I can, but I will do my best.  I have and can take more pictures if needed.   
Black Mathews ZXT was in the shop from factory with 60lb-70lb (currently around 65ish) and a 28"" draw.  Being the only black one, I had them put a 29"" cam on it for my draw length.  It comes with everything in the pics which includes (but not limited to): 
QAD Ultra-Rest HD Pro Series drop away rest 
Trophy Ridge Micro Cypher 7 pin lighted fiber sight 
Mathews dampened quick detach Arrow Web T-Series Quiver 
12 Bone Collector arrows (I'm not sure, but I believe there may be 1 that is from my older bow mixed in accidentally) with 100g practice tips 6 G5 T3 broad heads (never shot except a couple with practice blades into ""The Block"")
Tru-Fire Hardcore Buckle fold back release 
There are a few red Tracer Knocks, some the batteries have died in, there is a new pack of 3 batteries included 
SKB ATA Single Parallel Limb Bow Case (at the time, and as far as I know, they still do not make a hard side TSA approved case specifically for this bow.  There are some that advertise for z7, z9 and zxt, but you have to cut the water jet foam for the ZXT to fit without forcing the cams.  That in turn voids the content protection from SKB) 
After only a few shots, I had found the feel of the bow and was consistently cloverleaf grouping at 30 yards.  The peep is perfectly matched for sight picture for one or two eye open shooting with the Trophy Ridge sight.  
Before you think I'm nuts with my price, understand the case alone was $300.  You can check current prices of the equipment, but here is my rough cost; Bare bow $799, QAD rest $200, Trophy Ridge sight $200, Mathews quiver $100+, release $100, arrows $115, broad heads $65, Tracer Knocks $70.  I know that this bow is considered used but is as close to new as one will ever be. I don't expect to recoup near the full amount, I'm selling it for about 1/2 of what it would cost to buy the same new. 
I do not see any relief in the near future for my shoulder, so I am selling this to free up some invested money for bills.
** I will NOT part it out.  I have no use for the case without the bow and will have no way of protecting the bow without the case.  I'm selling it cheap enough to sacrifice it all!**"

Hi, for sale is a really nice Smith and Wesson 1911 chambered in .45 ACP, it has everything that came with it at the original purchase and as shown in the pictures.

It has not been fired since leaving the factory and was purchased brand new in 2012 and has been stored in a controlled environment since.

Any questions please feel free to ask. (note: last couple of serial edited in pic.).

****Added description:****

There were only 500 of these made and I have never seen another just like it. 

Talo, purchased these and upgraded them by coating the slides and adding custom grips. 

This information came from the Smith and Wesson forum. 

Impact Guns is selling this model for $1,075.00, shipping and taxes not included(but out of stock).

This nice piece has been reduced for ""quick sale"" and is available for $975 FTF sale. This is a nice ""as new"" firearm, you will not be disappointed.

I have some ammo for it.

Thanks for looking!

This one goes back in the vault after a couple of weeks if a deal isn't reached. So don't miss out.   I am the second owner of this masterpiece of a firearm.  The original owner stated he fired under 500 rounds.  I have not fired it once.  An appraiser at the Custom Shop said the gun was manufactured in 2003 and is valued it at $2200.  Comes with the original box and paperwork as it did new.  I am asking $1800.  Please leave your name and number for the fastest response.

Received this as payment for a job, but I need the money to tidy up a few other projects worse than I need another classic rifle.

These are pretty rare, considered to be maybe less than 300 ever made.  This one includes a leather sling and a Weaver scope.  Often referred as a ""gill gun"" because of the vented chamber on the left side.

Not perfect but any means, but a clean old rifle that is hard to find.  This one has number 92 stamped into the butt of the stock, under the metal plate.  Action feels good and cycles rounds just fine.

Email or call with questions.  Be happy to show it to you or send additional photos.  Make a great display piece or a fun shooter.

See my other listings; I'll make you a smoking deal on a package!

I have 15 boxes of Sako ammunition. 70gr Hollow point boat tail. 6mm PPC cartridges. This stuff is as rare as hen's teeth. They brought it in very briefly about 5-7 years after the cartridge was designed by Lou Palmisano / Ferris Pindell in 1975. 

What's it worth? There was a guy selling two and a half boxes of this stuff on gunsamerica awhile back. It sold in a week for $100.00. Another lot of 12 boxes sold on gunsamerica for about over $500 and some of it was once fired and reloaded. Lastly, there was a guy that had one box for sale on 24hourcampfire and he sold it in less than a week for $60 for a single box of 20 cartridges.

So one sale proved it was worth $2 a round with missing pieces and open boxes. Another shows $3 a round in large quantities although once fired and reloaded. Lastly, a fellow sold a single box for $3 a round plus freight.

I'm going to make this simple. The whole lot goes for $2.17 a round.  We'll go with $650 for the whole lot properly packed and shipped to you via UPS ground or local pickup. Your choice.

Will I break up the lots you ask? Yes. But then you'll pay $80 a box delivered for the aggravation.

The rifle offered here is very special.  The stock features a slightly greater drop at the comb than the standard Model 70 as iron sights were used.  All rifles came with a Winchester designed receiver sight.  It is important to remember that at the time scopes were still not as reliable as today and it was easier to go with a proven sighting system. The stock featured a well developed floating groove which in the popular shooting press was often referred to as a canoe shaped forend.  There is pressed checkering top, sides and bottom of the forend as well s the pistol grip was prexsnet .  A generous recoil pad shared the butt stock. The reciver is marked RCMP.
Go for this rare rifle in an uncommon configuration.  Avoid disappointment and future regrets by buying now.  Questions welcomed."
