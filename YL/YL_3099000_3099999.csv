I clean it every time so it's still pretty pristine. The Hogue grip adds a nice comfortable grip and finger groves for even more recoil control on this gun. 

If you're looking at this, you probably know about the reliability, accuracy and bomb-proof ness of the P95. I have an Uncle Mike's Kydex paddle holster for it, 3, 15 round capacity magazines, all the original gear that the gun came with, AND spare hammer springs. I accidentally bought 3 more 22lb (standard) springs from Wolff Gun Springs, then I bought what I meant to buy, a set of 3 reduced weight hammer springs,  21lb, 20lb, and 19lb. I haven't installed these but was going to play with the hammer tension a bit. They're all yours to do as you wish. I am selling it because I decided to carry a S&W compact 9mm and need the money to find a .45 ACP. 

All I will need is a bill of sale with your OR DL# , CHL a plus."

The open top, combat style Scout is rough side out to provide additional stability. This design also provides a smooth leather holster pocket for a faster, smoother feel on the draw. The Scout carries the handgun in a vertical orientation, with no cant or angle, so it can be used strong side, crossdraw, or in front of the hip (appendix carry). Additional features include stitched leather sight rails and a Generation II injection molded nylon J-hook that locks onto the belt. Constructed of premium saddle leather, the Scout fits belts up to 1 1/2"".

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.    

Below I listed a handful I do not have yet and would not mind owning, but also listed are ones I would not mind having more of and will consider if the deal makes sense, so feel free to offer as I like a bit of everything.

Semi-auto pistols or revolvers in .357 mag & .44 mag.

Maybe ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but not going to give retail value as I do not need any.

Includes a Gould & Goodrich B803-G19 Gold Line Three Slot Pancake Holster which is great for Concealed Carry. 
I have to make sure, but I believe I have 50 rounds of ammo. 
I bought this gun last year and carried for a while, but have replaced it with a Springfield Full-sized XD45. 
The gun is in great condition, has a little holster wear but does not affect the way it performs. Main reason I am considering parting with it is I need some tattoo work done really bad!
I have taken it to the range about 6 times, so it has had about 300 rounds through it. 
The gun has Night sights, 2-13 round magazines, and factory box.
The holster is a black leather Gould, that works great with a retaining snap and strap. 
I need any deals to be a reasonable distance from North Cullman, travel is difficult with wife's work schedule. 
I know tattoo work will probably require going to a shop, but any other trades or anything.

Looking for some professional tattoo cover-ups, have had the work appraised and both will run around $600. 
The right arm needs a panther crawling up it (or something similar), the current tattoo is a basic outline tattoo that measures 9""x 5"". This one was appraised at $450. 
The left arm needs a color Taz devil (or similar) with my son's name under it in a ribbon or something to make it look good. This one is about an 1.5"" x 4"", it is also a basic outline. this one was appraised at $150. 
Both are on the upper arms. Mistakes of younger days when I didn't think first.
These estimates came from Ink City in Decatur. 
The gun will have to cover the cost, because I don't have any extra funds (that's the reason I am considering using my Glock as a trade).

If I can't get tattoo work for the gun, I might consider a trade for a revolver. 
I might consider other guns also, just depends. 
Just shoot me a message and we'll go from there.

This gun has about 100 rounds through it.  Was my conceal carry gun last summer hence the belt clip but that can be removed if so desired.  I personally found the clip and the IWB carry mode convenient and very concealable.  Not pictured are the replacement front sights (stock plastic version) and the hardware for replacing the holding pins if you remove the belt clip.  Of the extended mags, one of them doesn't hold the 8th round but I bought them more for the extension to better grip the gun.  Bottom line, 7-8 rounds in the mag (depending on which you load) and one in the chamber gives you 9 rounds at the ready.

Also included are (3) 7 inch rubber Magpul ladders. I purchased this new and had it cerakoted. I just decided to go another route. Also would consider trading for a new or like new Magpul ACS-L milspec stock in black or a set of flip-up sights in black. I paid $127.67 for the rail and Cerakote and another $30 for the set of ladders.

From Shadow Ops Weaponry:

QUAD RAIL is crafted from hardened 6061-T6 Aircraft Grade Aluminum and Mil-Spec Anodized, our Quad Rails are built to last. These quad rails mount using your existing barrel nut. Not needing to remove your existing barrel nut makes these easy to install, not requiring a vise, torque wrench and other tools to dissassemble your whole barrel assembly.

Cerakote is a ceramic, colored coating that adheres to metal and non-metal surfaces.  It is a remarkably durable coating, capable of withstanding high temperatures (~1200 F, as per their technical literature) and protecting the underlying surface from abrasion and corrosion."

A must have for all Saiga 12 shotguns. The DPH Arms Improved Gas Plug Regulator was designed to improve the cycling of all Saiga 12 gauge Shotguns regardless of the barrel length. It will work with all factory 12 ga shotguns to the ultra-shorty Short Barrled Shotguns.The 6 gas settings allow you to tune your firearm correctly to the shell that you are shooting for optimum performance. The DPH Arms Improved Gas Plug Regulator is simple to install. Simply unscrew the factory plug and replace it with the DPH Arms Gas Plug. Our gas plug utilizes 6 different gas settings instead of the factory 2. With the wide range of 12 ga loads available today, the additional settings will allow you to better tune your shotgun�s gas system to the type of ammo that you are using. SETTING GUIDE The lower the number, the less gas it allows into the system. Setting #1: is normally used for all 3 inch shells and some heavy 2 3/4 inch. Setting #2,#3: are normally used for all heavy 2 3/4 inch buck shot slugs. Setting #4,$5: are normally used for 2 3/4 inch high brass bird shot hunting loads. Setting #6: allows the most gas into the system and is normally used for the low brass shells. These settings may vary depending on the ammo and the firearms. - See more at: http://dpharms.com/products/saiga_accessories/saiga_12_improved_gas_plug_regulator_by_dph_arms.html#sthash.4KCFzIsx.dpuf"
