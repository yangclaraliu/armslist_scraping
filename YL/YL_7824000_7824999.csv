W/  high quality Rings.,"Bayville, New Jersey, United States",$ 150,"Listed On: Thursday, February 15, 2018",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Bought this a few years back from Midway for long range and my deer rifle. Has been Rock solid on my 30-06 under recoil. Scope is FFP so it is perfect for range finding, and the 1/10 mil click adjustable turretts and side parralax make it deadly accurate way past 200 yards.Scope comes with sunshade and heavy duty rings for Weaver/Picatinny mount rail.Attached manuf specs.. I'll add actual pic later this afternoon. BSA productsAvailable only at MidwayUSA, the BSA Tactical Mil-Mil Rifle Scope is perfect for tactical applications, long range target shooting or for use on a 22 trainer. The Tactical Mil-Mil is not your average BSA. Made with premium components and designed to withstand the rigors of tactical use, this scope features fully multi-coated lenses and a glass etched first focal plane reticle. The side focus makes parallax adjustment a breeze while the resettable finger adjustable turrets allow you to easily return to zero. This scope features resettable 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a MRAD reticle. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the MRAD reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each long line is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 MILs low the shooter needs to convert the MILs to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With this rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 MILs low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 MILs or 15 clicks. The MRAD reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is. These features are usually only found in very expensive scopes, but MidwayUSA has worked with BSA to bring you this exclusive high quality scope at a very reasonable price. The BSA Tactical Mil-Mil Rifle Scope is covered by a limited lifetime factory warranty.

The receiver of each of these Franchi shotguns is precision machined from a solid billet of aluminum alloy, which is steel reinforced in critical areas. Extra material is removed, and the final product is an over & under 12-gauge shotgun that weighs an incredibly light 6 pounds. Until now, an over & under this light was unheard of because no lightweight alloys were strong enough to hold up to steady shooting without delivering punishing recoil. Now, however, Franchi engineers have developed an innovative Twin Shock-Absorber™ recoil pad with a special gel insert that absorbs up to 44-percent of the felt recoil.Three models, the Renaissance Elite, Renaissance Classic, and Renaissance Field, have walnut stocks with classic Prince-of-Wales pistol grips, cut-checkering, and traditional oil finishes. They are available in 12-gauge and 20-gauge with either 26"" or 28"" barrels; and in 28-gauge with a 26"" barrel. The Franchi Renaissance redefines the over & under shotgun with a blend of high-tech innovation and traditional design.Specifications:Item Number: 40605Gauge: 12Chamber Size: 2.75""/3""Barrel Length: 28""Stock: WalnutOverall Length: 44-5/8""Average Weight: 6.3 lbs.MSRP: $1659Receiver Engraving: Left–duck flying, silver.

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/fallkniven-ltc-pen-knife-black-handle-plain-wwood-gift-box/ Description: The LTC (Legal to Carry) is a neat pen-knife which you can easily carry in your pocket. To conform to knife laws we have deliberately designed this folding knife to feature all the elements required to enable the user to carry the knife in most environments. This means that the aluminum handle lacks special grip surfaces, the blade lacks a conventional blade locking device (yet is still held in place by a steady spring), that the blade is short and narrow and that it cannot be unfolded with one hand. The quality remains the same as any other Fällkniven knife. We have spared no expense when it comes to the blade quality for instance. We are the first in the world to introduce a penknife with a blade in our now famous laminate powder steel 3G! The blade has grooves on both sides of the blade, making it useable for both right and left handers. The LTC is presented in several attractive colors and is supplied in a nice solid wood gift box.  Features  Blade Length: 2.32 inch  Overall Length: 3.19 inch  Blade Style: Folding Pen Knife  Blade Material: 3G  Handle Material: Aluminum  Weight: 1.16 oz.  Wood Gift Box"

Don't mind having two, but thought I'd see if someone was looking for this package.Canik TP9SFx, 5"" barrel, competition-oriented and optics-ready pistol. Do some searches on this gun, and you'll see it's getting rave reviews and high marks for cost vs. performance. The trigger is simply outstanding. I've been wanting one of these for a while, so of course, I end up with two of them. LOL.This particular one is like-new, the previous owner had mounted the Vortex Venom on it already, and told me he shot maybe 100 rounds total. It will come with everything you see, including the original boxes for the gun and the Vortex red dot, and two 20-rd magazines. And the included paddle holster (not pictured).So, $700 takes the entire package. It's about what you end up paying after taxes, shipping, FFL fees, etc. etc. I'm comfortable keeping it as a backup competition gun as well, so not in a rush.The only trade I'd consider is a Walther Q5 Match. But hey, if you want to throw some ridiculous offers my way, I'll listen!Texas CHL preferred. Be over 21 and legal to own a pistol; Bill of Sale required if not a CHL holder. F2F near west-side of Houston preferred; willing to drive reasonable distances. Will ship to your FFL for an additional $55, which is what my FFL charges me."

As I have gotten offers for 'other' units let me clarify a few points:I am not interested in Colt 1991's or Series 80's.I am not interested in other brand 1911's. I am not interested in Blued models or any other finishes. I am not interested in Pistols that show wear or scratches.
For me to buy a pistol it must be in 97%+ condition.  (A Colt 1911 ""idiot mark"" would put condition well below my threshold of what’s acceptable - sorry.)Offering $1,100 for a nice Colt 1911.  I would pay more or a particularly exceptional pistol or one from the Colt custom shop."

I got a newer bow and no longer want/need these. I would really like to trade them both for a recurve, must be at least 40 pound draw. For the bows...1) the crossbow is a SA sports recurve inferno fury (I know it’s not a Cadillac) it does shoot very accurately and strong, I would have no qualms taking a deer at 30 yards with it. Comes with 6 bolts, 1 I use as a dead bolt for de-cocking. 3 of them have aluminoks on them, it also has a 3 dot red dot.2) is a buckmaster G2 right hand 70#, it is a little bit older of a bow (not ancient by any means) still in great shape and shoots well. I made it this year without replacing string but it will need to be done. I also took my other test off of it and put a cheap one back on it, it serves but I would probably get a wisker biscuit or something. Known for being really quiet, I was getting 275 FPS from it. (740)243-405zero I can send pictures upon request"
