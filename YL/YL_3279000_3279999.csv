This AR15 ships with a padded gun case, one Tapco 30 round magazine and a UTG red/green dot QD optic. I purchased this Rifle end of November 2013,it has never been fired and has been kept in a Gun Safe the entire time. AR-15 Rifle .223 / 5.56 NATO Caliber Semi Auto Flat Top Rifle W / M4 Barrel, 30 Round Mag and Hard Case by Bear Creek Arsenal Chambered for .223 Wylde which accommodates Std .223 Remington as well as 5.56 NATO rounds. Beautiful Smooth Parkerized Finish. 1 in 9 twist rate on barrel is highly accurate with a variety of bullet weights. This is bar none the best AR-15 Rifle Value in the U.S. today. We have torture tested these rifles and I would put them up against anything being sold for reliability... In fact we are so confident in these rifles that we offer a full one year repair or replace bumper to bumper warranty directly from Classic Firearm on every rifle sold. Now don't get me wrong... There is nothing fancy here... Just a basic M4 AR-15 Carbine... But if you want a great entry level AR, at a really great price.... Give this Bear Creek Arsenal AR-15 a try. Ships complete with a Carbine Length AR-15 Hard case and 1-30 round magazine.... Standard M4- Flat Top Rifle.... ships with one 30 round mag in a hard shell case, plus a UTG Red/Green Dot for Free. The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 NATO is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

Here’s The Story… Bear Creek Arsenal is owned and Operated by the Moore Family. They have a long history here in our North Carolina not only as master machinist but as shooters, armorers and craftsmen. Until now Bear Creek has been mostly known behind the scenes in the firearms community for making custom barrels, complex receivers, and high end private label rifle parts for builders across the country. More recently, their sister company , Moore’s Machine, introduced a base level AR-15 to the market. This is a rifle that we carried for a while, stopped carrying, and then re-introduced after extensive testing and becoming comfortable with their new found level of consistent quality. After being re-introduced, they were a huge success… Recently, in their ongoing effort to produce the finest rifle possible, the Moore family has taken the entire MMC operation and moved it to there dedicated custom facility at their Bear Creek Arsenal location. At Bear Creek Arsenal each rifle is built from the ground up on dedicated equipment and under the direct oversight and quality control of the Moore family. Since we re-introduced the MMC rifles in late 2013 the quality has always been good, but now under the new Bear Creek Arsenal banner we think it is even better. Buyers will notice a nicer finish, smoother lines, higher quality markings, and a more professional fit and finish than ever before. They feed as smooth as glass and the accuracy rivals that of many custom guns… We are convinced that these are the best bang for the rifle buck of any gun in America… For Shooters, By Shooters, That Is Bear Creek Arsenal….."

The Invader is packed with features normally found on much more expensive crossbows and has the speed to effectively harvest any big game animal in North America. The Power Touch trigger yields a smooth 3-1/2 lb trigger pull and the Dry Fire Inhibitor virtually eliminates the possibility of dry firing your crossbow. The CNC machined riser yields superior strength to traditional molded or cast risers and Wicked Ridge's new Acura-Angle Technology promotes accurate cocking for pinpoint accuracy. Add in the new Acu-52 integrated cocking system and you have one of the easiest to use and deadliest crossbows on the market today. Included in the package with the crossbow is the ACU-52 rope cocking system, Truglo  Red Dot, and a 6-arrow quiver."

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

The gun has all markings visible, as it should, with the addition of a GA stamped near the butt of the stock. I've spoken to Keith Rush at Trapdoors.com who said that this was not any sort of factory mark. It does appears to have been there for a very long time, and is not carved, so the origins are unknown. 
The S/N is correct for the 1889 stock. 

The rifle is not in 45-70 as it should be. The end of the barrel measures .515 and slight rifling is visible, but it does not appear to be a .50cal either. It is possible it was bored out to be used as a shotgun, but I don't know what gauge shell it would take. The firing pin is also frozen in place (possible that it could be freed with oil, but as I could not determine the ammunition, I haven't tried).

CONTACT ME FOR PRICING THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT HK HAS DESIGNATED A SD VARIENT IN 40 YEARS!! RELEASED IN VERY SMALL NUMBERS TO THE PUBLIC. VARY RARE SUPPRESSED GUN PER HKMR556A1-SD
The new HK suppressed MR556A1-SD is equipped with a cutting edge next generation of suppressor technology from Operators Suppressor Systems Inc. (OSS). It is coupled with HK’s unique new Modular Rail System (MRS) to provide the shooter with a high performance integrated weapon system.

The modular rail system (MRS) for the MR556-SD allows the shooter to place individual rail components and accessories anywhere along the length of the seven free sides of the forearm using the slotted interface. HK has been working with OSS to develop the next generation of advanced suppressors for the HK MR series of rifles and carbines.

These suppressors are comprised of two modules, a Back Pressure Regulator (BPR) and a Signature Reduction Module (SRM)™. The BPR1425™ on the MR556A1-SD captures and controls expanding gases instead of simply trapping the gas with baffles. To further reduce the sound signature of the MR556 and eliminate flash, the OSS SRM4 module can be added to the end of the BPR1425.

Important Features of the MR556A1-SD

MODULAR RAIL SYSTEM (MRS)
Repeatable rail segment mounting in any position along the 14 inch forearm (9 inch MRS also available)
Self-captured rail segment hardware
Two integrated Quick Detachable (QD) sling attachment points just forward of the receiver
Optional positionable QD mount attachment
Octagon profile allows the OSS suppressor to be installed/removed with the rail in place
MRS provides more comfort to the shooter’s support hand
OSS SUPPRESSOR
Typical 18 dB reduction with the BPR module installed without SRM
Less than an inch of increased weapon length with just the BPR
Eliminates up to 95% of the back pressure created by traditional suppressors
Attenuates the noise signature without adversely affecting the operating system
Redirection of expanding gas within the BPR reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise
Greatly reduces weapon fouling
Little increase in bolt speed
Reduces component wear and overheating common to legacy suppressor designs
Reduction in back pressure greatly diminishes toxic gases expelled back at the shooter
Better weapon balance with over the barrel mounting of the BPR module
Typical sound reductions measured at the shooter’s ear with the BPR and SRM4 installed <139 dB
Components are designed to self-tighten during firing to prevent loosening
Little to no impact shift transitioning from just BPR to BPR and SRM
Typical MRTF (mean rounds to failure) 8000 rounds, semi-automatic
Internal parts on both the BPR and SRM can be replaced
The HK MR556A1-SD gives the shooter the same outstanding MR rifle performance with the added benefit of more ergonomic handling and noise comfort of the new MRS rail system and OSS advanced sound suppression."

I have about 250 rounds through it, no more.

Scope is stock, holds and the rifle is very accurate (more accurate than an out of the box 10/22). Plenty of custom parts and stocks and fun for these rifles, if not as much as 10/22s.

Retail on all this is over $420, over $475 after tax/shipping/FFL/fees. 

My kids are getting a bit bigger and we're switching to 9mm carbines and .38 revolvers, so I'm selling some of the .22 stuff to help fund that.

I am interested in trades, but only very specific ones. partial/cash, whatever with anything I'm listing this week. I am interested in .32ACP pistols of good manufacture (colt, walther, CZ, zastava, MAB, mauser, etc.) that are not chromed or nickeled. (unless I get a really good deal. I don't do shiny)

Please do NOT ask for the ammo separate from the sale. I am listing some of the excess of .22LR ammo separately. This box goes with the gun.

Bought it to carry at work. Rather have a Glock. Comes with everything it came with new. Gun has been loaded, chambered, and carried but never fired unfortunately. This is dead serious ZERO ROUNDS through it. I know its a no-no to carry a gun without shooting it first but I haven't had the time. This is a POST RECALL XDS so no worries there. 

Have a Blackhawk pocket holster and a Foxx ""Little Foxx"" holster with it too. This is my only 45 so I can throw down some ammo if the trade is worth it.  This is the real world. Please know what your gun is worth."

$340 (and that's an excellent deal on the ammo) To purchase, that's $65 in .22mag, $30 to $40 in .22LR, $300 in pistol after tax/transfer (maybe more.), and an extra $40 grip set. 

Nevada residents ONLY, with DL or CCW.
