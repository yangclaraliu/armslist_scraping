Finally the Nikon P223 scope with bullet drop compensator is mounted in a one piece Burris P.E.P.E.R mount.  This is a great combo, I have another setup just like this on two of my other rifles.  The one pice mount eliminates tension on the scope tube that you would otherwise get from normal two pice scope rings.  This allows the setup to retain its zero better and increases the life of the scope.  This setup works great for both calibers.

I will sell the 300 black out for $950 for the rifle alone.  If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB), a Benelli M3 Super 90"

All that is needed is to swap out the bolt and put the other upper on and you can switch from 300 black out to 5.56mm instantly.    Both uppers have Wilson Combat Match Grade Stainless Steel Barrels with a 1:8 twist.  The 300 is a 16’’ barrel and the 5.56mm is a 14.7’’ barrel.  Another upgrade on this rifle is a Hyper touch trigger. This is not you standard MIL SPEC triggers, it breaks at about 4 Lbs. and is extremely smooth; If this doesn’t improve your accuracy, nothing will.  This is a great way to diversify your shooting capability with out buying two guns.
Other features include a Troy free floating Rail for the 300 and Magpul green drop in for grips on the 5.56mm.  This set includes a complete set of furniture for each upper.  The 300 has all Flat Dark Earth fixures and the 5.56mm has all green fixtures. Each setup is pictured below. All features are quality and interchangeable.

NO BOX




Leupold CQT. The Leupold Mark 4 1-3x14mm CQT is a revolutionary optical sight for tactical firearms such as the AR-15 and M16. Developed in cooperation with both the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies, the Leupold CQT combines the strengths of a red dot sight and a variable power riflescope. Incredibly tough, 100% waterproof, and devastatingly accurate, only the Leupold CQT is ready and able to handle the variety of close-contact situations common to both law enforcement and the military. 

The Circle Dot Reticle
The Circle Dot reticle of the Leupold CQT is designed to offer fast target acquisition in any environment. Reticle is visible without being illuminated. No power is required to see the reticle.

Estimating range using the Circle Dot reticle is simple. Place the target inside the circle of the reticle. At 3x the diameter equates to 6 feet in height at 100 yards. At 200 yards, 6 feet is measured from the dot to the edge of the circle.

Dot Size: 3 MOA at 3x, 9 MOA at 1x.

Circle Size: Edge to edge, the subtension of the circle is 18 inches at 25 yards, or 6 feet at 100 yards when set on 3x. From the center of the dot to the edge of the circle, the subtension is 6 feet at 200 yards when set on 3x.

Circle Line: The width of the line creating the circle is large enough to be easily visible, but thin enough so as not to obliterate an 18-inch object at 500 yards when set on 3x.

Comes with Flat top or carry handle mount, Flip-up lens covers and AA Battery & Battery compartment.

Note: CAN ONLY SHIP TO U.S. AND APO



Features

•True 1x setting functions as your non-magnifying, illuminated sight for tactical scenarios or engaging targets at extremely close range
•2x or 3x settings give you the additional power to accurately engage targets at medium ranges
•Leupold Circle Dot reticle is a bold aiming point for the operator, and also provides range estimation
•1/2-MOA adjustments for windage and elevation
•Ten reticle illumination settings to match any light conditions without overwhelming your natural low-light vision
•Two low-intensity settings work with night-vision devices
•Attach accessories using the integrated MIL-STD-1913 rail mount cross-slots
•Large field of view for fast target acquisition and tracking of moving targets
•One AA battery powers the Leupold CQT for up to 600+ hours at medium setting

This is a Enfield Mk III* from Lithgow Armory Australia. Most parts including stock are matching serial numbers, and is dated 1941. Many military stamps and cartouches are from all over the rifle and stock. It has one import stamp on the rear right receiver that is very light and difficult to read, N.A. RDGFLD, NJ. The bore is lightly pitted from the corrosive ammo used during the war, but the rifling is still sharp. May require re-crowning if so desired. Includes military magazine, no paperwork, no ammo

This was the first rifle I ever purchased as a teenager in 1990. At the time I had it checked for proper head spacing at Williams Gun Sight. When I used it, it was still very accurate. As a youngster I carefully painted the some of metal to prevent rust, it can be removed with turpentine, the finish below is thin and worn as would be expected, but no rust. Other then a yearly cleaning and oiling the rifle has not been used since 1991.
I read a little into the markings, history rifle. There are no rejection stamps, It was back at Lithgow Armory in 1946. Matching numbers on bolt, reciever, nose cap, stock and barrel. MA VII markings on band, barrel, receiver I was told meant it was capable of using high velocity ammunition. HV marked barrel rear sight. There are many marking from the Armory and units. While I'm used to working on vintage US rifles many of the markings on this rifle I'm unfamiliar with.

Restrictions apply on higher capacity magazines in some parts of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines, hit Buy It once and you’re buying 3, not one. Winning buyers, however, may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping. Since its inception in 1974, the Ruger Mini 14 has been the most reliable and least finicky of all .223 Semi-Autos; and Ruger’s factory magazines are one big reason for that. Here are factory 30 shot magazines to fit any Ruger Mini 14 rifle. Manufacturer is Sturm Ruger’s Southport, CT plant. Factory letter code is MAG-30; sku is 90035. Construction is serrated side blue steel, with high impact black cartridge follower. Blue steel floorplates bear the Ruger Phoenix logo; these have the bird on them. Each magazine holds 30 rounds of .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO caliber ammunition. These magazines will fit any Mini 14 Rifle chamberd in .223 Remington Caliber. They will not, to our knowledge, fit any other firearm. Factory 30 rounders like these have never been easy for us to come by. Single magazine price is $49 each. We’re offering them in lots of 3, however, at only $43 per. Own 3 for only $ 129.00. Not for sale to civilians in jurisdictions where 30 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement.

I got this Molot built 7.62x54R VEPR Hunter from the original owner over a year ago. It had approximately 200 rounds through it when I purchased it, and I have taken it out a total of ONE time, putting another 50 or so rounds down the barrel. All PRVI Partizan, no corrosive ammo. 

For those who don't know the background, this is a premium rifle that was briefly produced by the Molot factory in Russia. It features a 21"", chrome lined heavy, fluted barrel with an integrated muzzle brake, walnut stock, and a much nicer trigger than typical AK pattern rifles. The milled receiver and removable trigger pack are completely unique to the Hunter model and of a much higher quality than any other VEPR model. They were deemed too expensive to make a profit by the Molot factory and were discontinued.

It comes with everything it came with from the factory: Rifle, scope mount (never mounted) cleaning rod, and (2) 5-round magazines. The box has seen better days but the rifle is very nice. Any damage is visible in photos. Some kind of mottling to the finish on the bottom of the handguard (on the area that is already textured) and a couple of small nicks to the stock here and there. Bolt carrier and hammer are barely worn, and there are slight rub marks in all the usual places. Probably not even broken in yet!

Let me know if you have any questions or want any other pictures.

Price is $1,400 + actual shipping.

Thanks,

The only legal way to get a real Russian-made AK 74 apart from a saiga what you have to convert. And anyone who owns a Vepr will tell you they are made a world better than any Saiga, as nice as Saigas still very much are! This is all based on the typical super heavy rpk bulged receiver and heavy trunion. All receiver metal is based on 1.5mm thick steel all around. Barrel is substantially thicker than any 74 I've seen. Nice baked painted finish. Gorgeous wood stocks. Anniversary model just means it has a woodland vine like engraving in the rubber of the buttpad which is shown in the photobucket pics. This is a genuine Molot buttpad and marked as such, not aftermarket. This version has a ak74 muzzle break installed by Atlantic arms that is on correct LH threads. In addition, this rifle has one major other good thing going for it. Most Vepr rifles can only take Molot factory mags which are overpriced and hard to get sometimes. But this one has had the mag well opened up to be standard AK 74 size and I had checked it. All AK 74 mags work perfectly. This saves you a Ton of money getting magazines and not being stuck to the Vepr mags. This is also an Anaheim California import with a nicer finish that I've seen before. Not the usual TGI import where most came in through.

This rifle is in unfired condition. It is still in the original box with all of the original accessories and owners manual. This is exactly how it would look if you were to purchase it and take delivery of it from your local gun-shop.

The Arsenal line of rifles are known as the ""Mercedes"" of modern sporting rifles in the AK pattern. Top notch fit and finish, top to bottom, front to back. Don't take my word for it, do a minimum of basic research and see for yourself.

This rifle is also being sold with a PKA-Venezuela red-dot sight. This is a military-grade optic designed and built by Russian factories for the Venezuelan armed forces. It is built like a tank, extremely easy to zero. This attaches to the side scope rail of the rifle and allows for easy mount/dismount and retainable zero.

Please look at www.k-var.com for a thorough description of the rifle specs and go to www.kalinkaoptics.com for a description and reviews for the red-dot. They give a much more accurate and complete description of these can I could possibly give here.

I am asking $1400.00 for the pair and really want to sell them as a set. This is basically retail with two major exceptions: No sales tax. No shipping charges or FFL transfer fees.
These are new, never used items being sold face-to-face with a handshake agreement.

I don't really want to sell this combo and don't have to but I have an opportunity to purchase a pre-ban Ak pattern rifle that has been near the top of my wish list for a long time and need the cash soon or the chance will be lost. If this ad is up, I still have the rifle for sale. If the other party sells the rifle I want to buy, I'll pull the ad and keep what I have. If you are interested, please don't delay.

Very clean and has been sitting in safe for a couple years. Took to range, fired 40 rounds and loved it. Amazing trigger and everything is basically new. I just don't have anywhere to shoot it, I am moving and expecting a new baby. These rifles have all the advantages and durability of a high end milled AK but are a Swiss design. Bolt is an upgraded version of an AK bolt and charge from the side the same way.Firing pin is spring loaded to avoid slamfires. It is basically like a high end milled AK with far nicer fit and finish but in  5.56. I will include a  nib 40 round gen 3 pmag along with the original Sig Sauer 30 round mag and surefire 60 round mag. I also have a 350 dollar set of POF sights on it with dove tail conversion kit. The gun shows almost no wear and has been stored for a while. the only wear is the inherent ejection port wear which in no way effects the functionality of the rifle. Accepts all AR variant mags. Ambdextrious safety and controls. If you can find one of these in the store, it would go for 2000.00 or so plus the extras. The newer ones are no where near as nice. This one produced in 2008 and used twice since. The best factory trigger I have ever felt. 4 position collapsable stock,-Swiss style furniture with rails built in. This is one of the nicer  built ones that did not get recalled. I also have a new in box green laser sight and a decent red dot sight to go with it as well. Will send pics to serious inquiries. I have new lake city ammo to add for the right deal. Will sell rifle alone with Sig mag and red dot sight for 1250 obo.
