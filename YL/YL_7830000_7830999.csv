They are one of my favorite AR-15 stocks. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ (commonly called the Super Stock) is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. It will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle. These are similar to a Magpul CTR stock but better in my opintion. Colt used to use them on their rifles until they started using cheaper parts after they went bankrupt."

I have only removed the stock 1 time to install the scope mount. The rifle is $1400 new, the scope mount is $100 the rings were $30 and the scope was $400 after tax or transfer fees you’d spend $2000 on this set up and it wouldn’t even be zeroed or have the scope mounted up correctly. It comes as seen with a 10rd mag and I have a check riser as well not pictured.

Looking for serious trades mainly looking for an AK pistol, I can be open to other trades instead of the AR pistol such as AR rifles, 9mm mac, 9mm glock, or even .22lr replica of ak, uzi rifle, mp5. Would also trade for a Fullsized AR 15 with Tac-Con trigger or BFS trigger plus mags and ammo. Let me know if you’d be interested not looking to sell either"
