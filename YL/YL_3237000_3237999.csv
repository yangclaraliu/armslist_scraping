**((SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY PLEASE**

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. If anything the Military use AR500 for target practice, I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

I absolutely love this gun but I have a few vacations I need to pay for and selling it goes a long way to paying for those so it's time to go. This was my safe queen. It has less than 150 rounds through it and I am the only one that has ever fired it. It's a beautiful gun and a great shooter. It also has 4 mags with it. I'll leave the ammo in one of the mags in case you don't have any 9mm yet but the ammo in the other three mags don't come with it unless you want to buy it as I can use it in my M&P Shield. If you're interested in it send me an email and I'll get back to you quickly. Thanks guys.

Compact (pocket sized), high-intensity LED flashlight for tactical, outdoor, self-defense, and general use. Its virtually unbreakable light emitting diode (there's no filament to burn out or break) generates a smooth, brilliant beam with four times the light of a larger D-cell flashlight—bright enough to temporarily blind an aggressor. And if 80 lumens of blinding light is not enough to make your point with an aggressor, then the 6P LED Defender features a crenellated Strike Bezel® as another line of defense. The electronically regulated, super-efficient LED doesn't just generate a lot of light; it continues producing useful light levels for 11 hours on a single set of batteries. A strong yet lightweight, anodized aluminum body resists crushing, bending, and the elements, and O-ring seals keep dust, dirt, and moisture out. Its compact size, high output, extended runtime, and its Strike Bezel make the 6P LED Defender a great choice for personal protection, but it's also perfect for tactical applications, the great outdoors, and ideal as an everyday carry light."

I have put this together over the last year and have just found it to be too big of a caliber for my needs. I don't have the time, inclination, money, or skill to operate this as it should be, so I am moving on to closer range applications. This is the big Steyr HS 50. It is in good condition, some evidence of use and handling but overall in very good shape. I got it used and sent it to Steyr prior to shooting it for a factory inspection. Steyr’s gunsmith Herbert inspected it, gave it a clean bill of health and sent it back. I selected the Nightforce NXS 12-42X56 scope with the NPR-1 illuminated reticle, it has the sunshade and Nightforce lens cloth. Scope is in perfect condition, no scratches to lenses or finish, and function is perfect. Galileo observed the rings of Saturn using a telescope with a magnification of 20, this scope can observe .50 cal holes in varying targets a long way off! The NPR-1 reticle is very clean and unobtrusive, fine line gradients make ranging clear and concise, and the illuminated reticle makes low light shooting possible. I have it mounted on a LaRue QD LT107. This mount has 3 cams and a 20 MOA cant to take full advantage of this guns range capabilities. No need for lapping these rings, they are the best on the market, very precise and built like a tank. I have plumbed and leveled the reticle perpendicular to the bore axis, and torqued the mount screws to the advised 30 in/lbs. The whole gun breaks in half by two captured screws; the scope is mounted on a Picatinny rail on the barrel so zero is not affected. The muzzle brake and weight of this gun make recoil a slow push, the sound however will raise some eyebrows on the range. Trigger is two stage and factory set to 4 lbs. The Bi-pod is a work of art, very solid extensions, broad foot base, full swivel, quick disconnect/install, and easily stows along the barrel length. I lapped and installed a spacer between the Bi-pod and stock as there was some play there and could allow the recoil of the gun to jump the tooth on the QD mount. With the spacer installed it takes a slight push to get the Bi-pod to mount up or dismount and tightens the whole assembly up perfectly. Whole package is form fitted to fit into a Pelican 1750 case in OD green. It is a brand new case and is the only way to go with a set up like this. I am also including the tools for this gun and accessories. The LaRue tactical entry tool, useful for loosening the cams on the scope mount, the torx wrench for the scope screws, an extra screw for the scope mount, the 3/8 wrench for the cam tensioners, the T-handle wrench for the gun disassembly, and a canister of milspec multiviscosity M1A grease for use on gun parts in varying climates. I have shot M33 and M8 through this gun with groups as tight as 1 MOA at 300 yards. I know that is barely far enough for the powder to quit burning, but that is part of why I am selling it, I just don’t time to get to ranges that this thing is capable of. I am not much of a long range shooter and can’t really speak to what this gun is capable of. I have not shot it off anything but the Bi-pod, and have not run any truly precision ammo through it. Bore and chamber are clean with no evidence of mercuric primed ammo ever being used; brake is in perfect shape and the gun cycles great. This is a heavy package and not a set up for the inexperienced or faint of heart. Everything is sighted, turnkey and ready for someone who can appreciate its capabilities. I do have a cleaning set for it as well as a fair amount of ammo that I can work on price if buyer is interested."

Rather than a mere presentation of boring legal material, the seminar illustrates how the law of self-defense is applied in real court cases involving real people. In addition, the seminar is structured to engage students with scenario-driven applications of the legal principles governing the law of self-defense. Students leave the seminar armed with the legal knowledge and analytical tools necessary to apply the law of self-defense in a practical and actionable way to situations that arise in their daily lives. Students also leave with a written summary of the self-defense laws for each jurisdiction covered in the seminar.

Andrew F. Branca, Esq., is the foremost expert in U.S. self defense law across all 50 states, whose expertise has been used by the the Wall Street Journal, the Chicago Tribune, NPR, numerous other media organizations, as well as many private, state and federal agencies. He is a Massachusetts lawyer, Life Member of the National Rifle Association (NRA), and Adjunct Instructor on the Law of Self Defense at the SigSauer Academy in Epping, NH.

This handgun has less than 200 rounds through it.  It has slight holster wear on the slide but is otherwise in great condition.  Selling because I never use it and it just sits in the safe.  It comes with night sights, both the threaded and the standard barrel and has 2 custom kydex holsters that are included, the original box and 2 mags.  1 holster is for just the pistol, the other is for the handgun with a Surefire X300 attached to it (Surefire light not included), both holsters are set up for the threaded barrel so they can be used with either configuration.  Not looking for trades as this is being sold to fund another project. Thank you for the interest.  Please contact Michael @ 503-7zero6-ootwo4"
