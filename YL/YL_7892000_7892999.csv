Once in Glocks hands based on the age of the plastic, Glock insisted on a complete rebuild and and gen 3 frame upgrade at no cost to me.  What great customer service. Glock replaced most every part except the slide and barrel.  The serial # is that of a frame replacement. Included will be all paperwork stating the original frame was destroyed and a 2 page listing of all parts replaced.  Included is one high cap and a 10 round that Glock sent back with the gun. 44 rounds fired to test function after bebuild and since just sits in the safe.

My kids got into archery 2 years ago and now I travel with their team and that has taken all of my time (in a good way). As you can see from the pics it has the Surefire, tan finish and Magpul stock upgrades and a Vortex Razor HD 5-20 x 50 mounted with matched rings. And it also comes with a soft case. I believe it has the Geissele trigger upgrade too but its been a while. I am in Northern Virginia and used to shoot this out at Peacemaker in WV for those who are out that way you may remember this rifle. It is lights out. I found the best round for this rifle was the 6mm Creedmoor 105 Berger Hybrid from Copper Creek. I have 15 full boxes of this ammo included. This is $585 worth of ammo and I am not selling the rifle without it. Sorry. If you have questions let me know and I will do my best to answer.....all of my knowledge is in archery now...lol.

This pistol has been to the range twice, with 150 rounds through it (and no issues ever). It has never been holstered or carried, so no concern with holster wear or sweat. The trigger is phenomenal. No creep or steps. 100% predictable every time. I have honestly never handled a gun with a nicer pull. The rail and frame fit is equally amazing. The whole gun feels like one piece with no unnecessary movement. Tritium sights front and rear, and Wilson Combat starburst grips with stainless hex screws. There is nothing you would need, or want to change. Included is everything that came from the factory, as well as a total of 4 magazines. Two are WC brand (with bumpers) and two are Kimber brand (w/o bumpers). All function perfectly, of course.Will ship to FFL. If you're willing to pick it up in my area, I'll include 400 rounds of Winchester 230 Grain Full Metal Jacket ammo."

I can tell you that the one on my 22-250 works great, yes 32 is a LOT of magnification but for some stuff like hitting bottle caps at 300 yards it makes it a lot more doable and I can always dial it back to like 20 or 8 iif i need a bigger feald of veiw. And these are normally a 450$ or more scope but I don't need this one and I need cash to get my phone fixed. (s7 edges are suposed to be water proof, well theyre not) Anyway I've got a one new in the box I littleraly never even took it out of the plastic inside. I could even bring my 22-250 to show you I do have one mounted on my gun and it works great. I'm a little flexible on the price but don't try to lowball me these are beautiful scopes. really really clear, honestly the best I've ever had and used, I figure $300 less than what they usually go for is a steel for someone out there who wants a good optic.Also it's the 30mm tube not the 1 inch so it's brighter and has a bigger elivation and windage agustment.This is the EXT reticle not the duplex basically a xmas tree reticle so you can do holdovers easly.Unfortanetly my phone is dead so text and calls won't work I know that sounds scetchy.

$800 firm in cash.  Folks are asking several hundred more+ on GB, so not responding to lower offers.  Cash only, unless it's a worthwhile trade offer as I will likely list anything I get in trade right now for sale to help grow a business.  On trades, let me know what you have and EXACTLY what the deal is up front and I'll get back to you either way.  No reason to go back and forth only to find out the deal doesn't make sense, I'm sure most know where I'm coming from. Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX and have valid ID.Thanks for looking!"

837,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7892837,For Trade:  Wolf 7.62x39 unreliable,"Irving, Dallas, Texas",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, February 2, 2018",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is, I'm guessing, about 600 to 700 rounds of Wolf FMJ 7.62x39. I only ever shot this ammunition from one rifle, an SKS, but about 3 out of every 10 rounds failed to fire. I'd guess it's the primers that are faulty as they were always fully struck but I'm not an expert. Most of the time the round would fire if I tried to shoot it again, but some of them wouldn't fire no matter what. I don't have a rifle in this caliber anymore so this stuff is just sitting around. I've been questioning myself whether it is ethical to sell/trade faulty ammunition but I decided to put it out there for two reasons.1. Having gone through about 300 rounds of this stuff I know that even though it's faulty it's not dangerous and I've fully disclosed my experience that it is unreliable.2. Even if nobody would want to shoot this ammunition there's probably a reloader out there who would be interested in a ton of bullets for next to nothing/for free."

I've gone to a CZ compact which seems to fit me better. This RAMI is like new and only 200 rounds thru it... not even broken in yet. You'd be hard pressed to find a better one with all the extras. Looks great with the Custom grips. The pictures don't do justice to the beauty of the pistol.(See description below)* Custom made to order grips from Marschal Grips. (took 3 months to get from Europe)* Holster- by Hidden Hybrid Holsers. This is an Extremely comfortable holster for CC inside or outside the pant. After tons of research, I settled on this after finally watching ""Hickock 45's"" reviews of about a dozen carry holsters he reviewed that he had on his review table. He was right.* Pearce Estension Grip- This is a must as far as I'm concerned for the second shorter RAMI mag. (the other larger one comes as a 14 rounder). The extension is a little tricky to fit, but after install the grip definitely has more room for the hand, and more stable too.* I had CZ-USA install a new trigger spring and tweek/smooth-up a few internals while in there. Not a big deal of a job, but noticeabley improved the trigger pull for me.* Includes factory box, second magazine, original instructions and everything that came new in it (Armslist only allows 3 pictures is why it's not shown)This ia s very well taken care of and equipped RAMI, and again I'm selling the whole package...ie the holster, custom grips etc, all.Sorry I won't ship. I'm in Longmont and I'd like to do the transfer at Phoenix Custom rifles in Longmont. They do for $27. BTW the CBI charge is going up to $15 from $6 after Feb 1/18.
