I kept it oiled and clean and it never let me down on the hunt.  It patterened well/evenly when I bought it (I checked).  I never shot over BB sized through it either.  If I knew how to refinish (blue) actions, I'd reblue and refinish this gun (then probably never sell it ;) as it's mechanically sound and has lots of life still left in it.  But I'm deciding to let this go and learn how to use my NEW 12g ;)  I might regret it like I did selling my old pick-up truck off a few years back realizing they don't make 'em quite like they used to, but someone can use this gun and enjoy working with it knowing it's a good design because it's a Browning... so it will probably be shooting long after I am gone ;)I'd take $260 cash if you come my way, or I'd meet-up on a weekend in NE Kansas face-2-face for a bit more (and when my time allows).Happy to shoot this for a buyer if they come my way."

Great for fishing around mangroves, islands, and inter coastal waterway shorelines. Plus has all of the features you've come to love from LakeMaster, but now allows for aerial image overlay on high definition waters. Now you have the ability to use quality aerial photography to view the entry and exits of creek channels, see how far a reef or weed line extends, pick out shallow water rock piles, steep drop-offs and other features of the lake you've been missing from traditional maps. LakeMaster PLUS gives you the freedom to choose how you want to use the aerial imagery. The Satellite - Only This layer shows only aerial imagery and no other map information. The Satellite - Land This layer shows the LakeMaster map and the aerial imagery that extends around the body of water. The Satellite + Contours This layer shows the aerial imagery and just the LakeMaster contours so you can still pick out those features in the water while still seeing your depth. Each map card Edition covers some of the most popular water bodies in the region and the PLUS series also gives you access to all of the LakeMaster features including the following: - i-Pilot Link compatible - Easy to read contours - Depth Highlight Range - Water Level Offset - Shallow Water Highlight - Scrollable Lake List"

Some would argue, that the Seneca was the most lovely black powder gun ever produced by Thompson Center. It’s the perfect size for a youth or lady. This rifle has been fired, but was obviously lovingly cared for and is in excellent condition with 99% bluing and case colors. It has adjustable double set triggers, which will fire from front trigger alone or by setting the rear trigger first. The TC lock uses reliable coil type main and sear springs. Lock tumbler is stabilized by a case hardened bridle and has a fly, to prevent the sear from catching on the half-cock notch when firing. Quick release, hooked patent breech with front wedge tenon, allows the barrel to be removed for cleaning, without tools, in just a couple of seconds. Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The beautiful American black walnut stock, with raised check piece and brass cap box, has no blemishes that we can see. The barrel is 13/16 across the flats, 28” long and rifle’s overall length is 44”. We believe that the bore’s rate of twist is 1 turn in 48” right hand, which is best for a patched ball.

This is the classic high quality USA made rifle that started the Thompson Center phenomenon and established it as a leading sporting arms manufacturer. The right side of the barrel is marked: THOMPSON / CENTER ARMS ROCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE CAL 45 The left side of the barrel is marked only with the serial number. These are the only markings on the barrel. It is not marked Hawken, nor are there any of the later ""Blackpower only""....""read the manual"", etc. type nonsense. This rifle, sn 13808, has the desirable earlier features, such as fully inlet lock bolt and barrel wedge escutcheons, single screw nose cap and the more sharply defined forward comb area and cheek piece. The bluing on the barrel is in about 80% condition with scuffs and some scattered freckling. The breach area right around the nipple has no finish remaining and has some shallow pitting. Has adjustable double set triggers, which will fire from front trigger alone or by setting the rear trigger first. The TC lock uses reliable coil type main and sear springs. Lock tumbler is stabilized by a case hardened bridle and has a fly, to prevent the sear from catching on the half-cock notch when firing. Quick release, hooked patent breech with front wedge tenon, allows the barrel to be removed for cleaning, without tools, in just a couple of seconds. The nipple is in good condition and threads out effortlessly. An access screw is provided in the side of the bolster / snail, at the breach. Invaluable for those times when you ram down a ball and forget to put in powder! Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The unbreakable ramrod has brass tip on one end. The American black walnut stock with a raised check piece, has numerous small scratches and compression marks. At some point, the original brass trigger guard must have broken, because someone replaced it with an iron trigger guard from a Renegade. There are always plenty of brass Hawken trigger guards on Ebay etc., should you want to restore it back to a brass trigger guard. 29” barrel, 46” overall length. We believe that the bore’s rate of twist is 1 turn in 48”, which is best for a patched ball. We inspected the bore with a “drop in” bore light and it’s mostly shiny, with some scattered shallow pitting. A lubricated patch on a tight jag, passes smoothly through the bore.

562,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7600562,For Sale:  I will help you build an AR15 and supply the tools,"Marysville, Columbus, Ohio",$ 50,"Listed On: Sunday, November 19, 2017",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have built 3 custom AR pattern rifles in the past few years. From my experience, I have learned a lot about choosing good components, assembling the parts without causing any damage, and tuning the built rifles to cycle reliably. I can help you through the custom build process and make sure you end up with a gun that you are happy with. I charge $50, which is less than a quarter of what it costs to buy headspace gauges, a vice block, vice, torque driver, torque wrench, and armorer's wrench. I will also be supplying the thread locker compound and anti-seize grease, saving you that cost. Working with me WILL save you time and money if you don't have these tools. I also know when/where to look for the best discounts on most parts.Here is the process:1) You email me a list of components that you really want in your build and tell me a budget.2) I will review your list and check everything for compatibility. I will finish out the build sheet with everything that we need. You will have a list of everything and how much it costs before spending a cent.3) You order the parts. When they have arrived, you can drive out to my place and I will help you assemble it without breaking any of the tiny springs and also torque everything down, correctly. We will check the chamber for correct headspace, to make sure that everything is safe. For legal reasons, you will have to do the building. I can only supervise and advise.4) I take you to an outdoor range where we can test and tune the rifle as needed. If your rifle is not functioning 100% perfectly, you don't pay me anything.The aim of this service is to make it so that you don't have to buy specialized tools that you will only use once. This is supposed to be cheaper than doing it yourself. Also, having a second pair of eyes on everything will help you avoid assembling things incorrectly or scratching the sides of your receivers. This is a win-win venture!"
563,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7600563,For Sale:  Muzzleloading percussion target rifle Navy Arms Not Pedersoli Creedmore Rigby Gibbs target rifle,"30179, Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 750,"Listed On: Sunday, November 19, 2017",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Relisted. Here's a Navy Arms replica of an English Creedmore, Rigby, Gibbs type, precision match rifle. The rifle comes in a fitted case with accessories. This rifle has been fired. A drop in bore light shows the bore to be bright and shiny. Using a lubricated, tightly patched jag, we found that there's an area toward the bottom of the bore, where the bore doesn't seem quite as smooth as the rest. So being used, there could be some shallow pitting that we just can't see with a bore light. The rifle was made in Spain by Intermarco S.A. Since Navy Arms put its name on it, you know that it was made to a very high standard of quality. The ¼ octagon, ¾ round barrel is 32” long and is 1” in diameter. The “Rigby Profile” rifling has a 1:24 rate of twist. The bore size is .451. This type of rifling and rate of twist are intended to use a conical lead projectile with a paper “slug gun” type patch. We believe these work best with a .451 bullet mold, with the projectile pushed through the sizing die, to its final diameter. Overall rifle length is 49”. The length of pull is 14 ”. Drop at the comb is 1 ½”. Rifle weighs around 9 lbs. The lock and all of the furniture have rich, vibrant case colors. The lock plate is engraved “Creedmore Match”. All of the metal finishes are in 98% condition. The barrel is highly polished with a deep blue finish. The walnut stock has one or two minor compression marks. The pistol grip wrist and the forearm have skillfully executed hand checkering. The rifle comes with a Long Creedmore, adjustable vernier tang target sight and a front globe sight that’s adjustable for windage. The case with lockable latches, is 34 ½”x9”x2 ½”. The velvet inside the case shows some normal wear as does the exterior surfaces. Accessories include two keys for the case, a sizing / swaging die for the projectile, a combination bullet starter / swaging press, combination nylon ram rod / cleaning rod. The inside diameter of the bullet starter is lined with brass, so as not to scuff the blued barrel.

Understand if $1350 is more than you'd want to spend on an AR-15. That's cool, I just don't need to recieve emails about it. But am willing to entertain trades if they're something I might be interested in. If a mil-spec trigger is not to your liking, I can throw a Giessele G2S in for an extra $120. And if you need a case, I have a nice plano all weather case, with foam cut out. I'd happily get rid of it for $40 (my apartment is getting a bit cramped). Also have a scope and a mount if someone wants to really complete this thing. It's a fun rifle, and that combination of a muzzle break and the A5 buffer system renders it almost recoil free. But I don't shoot rifles nearly as much as I'd hope. I hope someone else can give it a good home.If you're interested in this thing in the form of parts (ie, just the upper or just the lower, or the lower sans the stock, that can be discussed too!). Trades also ok; looking for a CZ805 Bren in particular."

This is the full length version of the rifle and is a true WWI era piece -- it does not have any of the WWII-era changes applied to it. It is also less common than the carbine versions you commonly see. I would rate the bore as fair. The gun is in great operating condition. 6.5x52mm ammo is extremely easy to find at your typical sporting goods store, as Carcano rifles have been popular for hunting for decades.I'm selling the rifle for $300 (or best offer).

Steel-rated Intermediate Mod and Light Mod. 2 lead rated Mod.-2 boxes of steel #2 shot, and some #7.5 game loads. -Box of low recoil slugs.-Padded gun sleeve.Sad to see it go, but it'll make you happy.

His first collaboration with Spyderco features a “flipper”—a novel blade-opening device that was pioneered by custom knifemaker Kit Carson. A Carson Flipper consists of a small lever that extends from the base of the Southard’s CTS 204P hollow-ground blade and protrudes from the back of the knife’s handle when closed. Pulling on it with your index finger creates a tension against the detent mechanism that holds the blade closed. When the detent is overcome, the blade rotates on a special captive ball-bearing pivot system and snaps authoritatively into the open position. The Southard’s handle combines a medium-textured black G-10 scale and thick titanium liner on one side with a solid titanium scale on the other. The titanium scale forms the foundation of the knife’s sturdy Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) mechanism and features a small inlaid G-10 panel that acts as an overtravel stop when releasing the lock mechanism. It is also home to the knife’s matching stainless steel clip, which supports right-side tip-up carry. It features a durable titanium carbonitride coating on its blade, handle scales, and other hardware. Offering an amazing synthesis of ergonomics, functionality, and state-of-the-art materials, the Southard is one of the most advanced Spyderco folders ever produced.
