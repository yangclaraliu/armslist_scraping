Would really like one 100% brand new in the box but would be OK with one lightly used and preferably stock, some extras are fine but if its stippled or heavily customized I wouldn't be interested. Wouldn't mind BFG but black is always good too. I have a SIG P225-A1 9mm Nitron Compact, G10 grip model with the usual SIGLIGHT sights and Short Reset trigger, that's still practically new and comes with the case, manual, sticker, lock and two 8rd mags. Love SIGs but since I carry a revolver most of the time it doesn't get used and where its my newest SIG I'm not to attached yet. I would trade it for a Glock 43 if you don't mind adding cash since both are in the not approved category which leaves the SIG running a bit more. I would like to use a FFL for my side since I'm not sure if I'm going to keep one or two of my rifles until the 1st. Let me know."

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.

I purchased it specifically for a bear, elk, and cougar hunt in Oregon this year, it performed as expected. Comes with a mounted and zeroed 3x9 Tasco World Class scope, and 70 rounds of high end hunting ammo. (Barnes and Nosler bullets) It is zeroed for 300gr bullets at about 2,000fps and will stack rounds on top of each other from 100 yards. I only shot 20 rounds out of it, has a minor scratch on the foregrip from my trip to Oregon. Other than that it is like new. The guns sell easily for $600 scope isn't much $80 I think, ammo is usually about $2 per round. As fun as this is to use, I just do not see myself using it again. $650 firm. The only trade I will make is for a 6.8 SPC AR. Thanks. REDACTED"
