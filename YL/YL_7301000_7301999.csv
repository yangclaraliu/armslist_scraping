Aqui esta un revolver excelente, la modelo Astra Police. From its E2 Spanish date code, it was manufactured in 1985. Manufacturer was Astra Unceta y Compania de Guernica (de España). Importer markings are inconspicuous on the barrel shroud bottom, and Astra .38 Spl. on one cylinder chamber. Other markings are original Spanish proofs and date code. Type is traditional double and single action swing out cylinder revolver. Frame is Large N size, .655 lateral thickness with 1.773 cylinder length and 1.571 cyl. diameter, amply strong enough to withstand pressure from +P ammunition. Grip frame is square butt with radiused back strap. Construction is entirely steel metal and Spanish walnut grips. Chambering is .38 Smith & Wesson Special, with 6 round cylinder capacity. Barrel is one piece 3 inch medium with integral pin shroud, pinned into the frame, with right hand 1:16 rifling. Front sight is steel step blade, double pinned onto solid serrated rib, with frame integral fixed notch rear sight. Cylinder capacity is 6 rounds. Ignition is .475 long serrated spur flat face hammer against floating firing pin, with a .350 smooth faced combat trigger. Frame is distinctive Astra five screw, with yoke retention screw and four screw side plate. Overall length is 8 3/8 inches by 5 1/4 inches height. Weight empty is 37 1/2 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger. Finish is blued steel, with worn case colored hammer and trigger. Grips are Jordan type, press checkered lateral walnut, with nickel plated factory medallions, and with worn semi gloss finish. They will accommodate a 10A or 586A Speedloader well enough. Surface detractions on this Astra Police model are minimal to moderate, principally edge wear and finish wear to the right grip panel. We rate it as Very Good, 75 to 80 percent vicinity by my estimate. Bore, cylinder chambers and mechanism are all bright and clean. Blast effect to the top strap underside above the forcing cone is minimal, and cylinder face carbon is minimal. Cylinder times correctly in all six positions both double and single action, with hammer movement to spare. It has no lateral play whatsoever with the trigger fully depressed. Cylinder face to forcing cone gap measures .005 to .006. Double action trigger pull is smooth 11 pound vicinity, with crisp 4 pound vicinity single action pull. I estimate this revolver has been fired fewer than 500 times, no rounds at all for an Astra. From its PMV Marking, this Astra served with Airport Security at the Margarita Airport in Venezuela."

It is chambered in .30-06. Its serial number  2442620 places manufacture in January of 1944. This one was rebuilt at Springfield Armory in November 1963 according to the ""SA 11-63"" electro penciled on the trigger housing. It looks like the barrel was replaced at that point with a barrel from 9-63.This Garand is in very good condition. Most of the original finish remains with finish wear on the edges of the metal - especially in the high-use areas. There is NO evidence of rust or pitting. The bore is bright and clean with strong rifling, the barrel has been re-crowned, and the barrel now measures to 23-15/16”. The action is solid and smooth, the safety functions as it should and the trigger feels like a stock, unmolested trigger. The rear sight adjustments move freely. The stock is solid and crack-free.The walnut finish is uniform and appears to be original and not refinished."

Most of the original finish remains with finish wear on the edges of the metal - especially in the high-use areas. There is NO evidence of rust or pitting. The bore is bright and clean with strong rifling, the barrel has been re-crowned, and the barrel now measures to 23-15/16”. The action is solid and smooth, the safety functions as it should and the trigger feels like a stock, unmolested trigger. The rear sight adjustments move freely. The stock is solid and crack-free.The walnut finish is uniform and appears to be original and not refinished."

It's still almost an Ak type gas piston system making it very reliable, but fires the 5.56mm NATO and .223 rounds. The American semi aito variant takes normal AR mags where the military variant takes a special proprietary magazine. So, ANY AR MAG WORKS FINE with this rifle! It also has a gas regulator where if the rifle were very dirty and could not be cleaned(a feature from the military version)  under emergency situations where you need more power (due to the powder and other buildup) but cannot stop to clean and need to keep shooting... you wouodmjust turn the regulator in front unail you hear a click and are back in business.  This allows you to continue firing and again inemergency situations. However,  unless something drastic happened, I like to clean my fireaem after shooting. So, it's never been an issue for me other than just temporarily turning the regulator to the other setting and back a few instances to test it out.You basically get all the reliability and tough charteristics of an AK, with benefits of an AR and look that is pretty cool. I always had  someine ask when I took it shoooting. If  is heavier than a normal AR, but you feel no recoil.  I am including a 3Xs optic that came from Sig Sauer along with a hard case, and two 30 round magazines  and 100 rounds.THE Rifle has a folding stock as mentioned. It is in very good condition. I have fire 100 steel case wolf and Tula .223 ammo out of it to test it. THere were no fail to fires, fail to feeds, or fail to extracts.  Other than that one instance to test it , I have only fired brass 5.56 and .223'  out of it. The twist rate of the barrel also allows it to handle heavy .223/5.56 ammunition rounds  up into the high 70 grain weight. As with the small amount of steel case, there of been no malfunctions. It's actually fairly lightly used as i haven't had a a huge amount of chances fo take it out over the years due to a crazy work schedule and some health issues.i paid $1600 at Vances outdoors on Cook and Cleveland when they came out, and it had a  a $300 rebate from Sig.i am asking $800 for it and everything else included.
