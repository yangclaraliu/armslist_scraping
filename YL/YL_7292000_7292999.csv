The Cherries Multi-Ride Deep Concealment Holster (Patent Pending) is the next evolution of concealed carry holster. It is the World's First Appendix Below-The-Waistband (A-BWB) holster designed for deep concealment with total retention and a fast draw. Improved upon our original best-selling Deep Concealment BWB Holster, our new GEN-3 is leaner, meaner and even more adjustable and is now fully injection-molded.GEN-3 Holster Highlights:State-of-the-art fully injection molded shell body. (Means laser precision lines with factory-grade quality.) Can now be run both standard IWB (inside-the-waistband) or our cutting-edge BWB (below the waistband) if/when added concealment is needed. Our main shell body will fit 80% of your Glocks. So all of your Glock 9/40 standard, double-stacked mag bodies including the: 17/17L/19/22/23/26/27/34/35. The ultimate ""gut-friendly"" appendix holster (allowing you to carry comfortably while seated for prolonged periods of time) while maintaining a high level of concealability but with quick access to your firearm.SOME ADVANTAGES TO BWB (BELOW-THE-WAISTBAND) CARRYTotal Concealment (Below-The-Waistband)Total Retention (Will Never Be Pulled Off You)Sub-Second Draw (Barrel Assisted)Extremely MinimalFinally A Gut-Friendly Appendix HolsterPATENT-PENDINGThe Cherries Multi-Ride Concealed Carry Holster uses our patent-pending BWB, Zero Print™ rapid draw, deep concealment system. This holster is designed specifically for deep concealment where extra retention and concealment are needed. ZERO PRINT (TM) CARRY Using our patent-pending design, our holster sits securely below the waistband for 100% total concealment. No more fussing with your shirt, or worrying whether or not your printing; It allows for any type of shirt to be worn without any hassle.PERFECT FOR THE ""GUY WITH A BIT OF A GUT""Lets face it, we all put on weight as we get older. The Cherries Multi-Ride Deep Concealment Holster allows ""the guy with a bit of a gut"" to finally run a firearm appendix carry, without the weapon cutting into your gut. The weapon literally rides below the waistband, and therefore rests on the inner part of your thigh, which makes sitting with the weapon extremely comfortable (especially when you spend allot of time behind a desk or in your car). To access the weapon while seated, simply pop up your weapon ever so slightly which will allow you to get to it quickly, then reset the weapon back into the holster when you're ready to get out of the car.FINALLY A HOLSTER FOR ESCALATION/DE-ESCALATION (ARMED & UNARMED THREATS)How often are you drawing your firearm while you everyday carry? Hopefully never...And while it's important to train hard to defend yourself against armed attacks, the majority of self-defense related conflicts are unarmed. The deep-seated, full-retention design of the our holster allows the user to defend themselves during an un-armed attack (without the worry or risk of his/her firearm falling out of the holster while going to the ground). We think this is a major deficiency with more high cut, speed-draw oriented appendix IWB holsters. Great for the range, not in a fight...They will fall out easily, and just as easily be ripped off you. With our patent-pending, Zero-Print™ design, your weapon is securely holster'd below-the-waistband where it wont fall out, or get pulled off you. Theres simply no holster to grab. Having said all that, the sub second pocket or groin assist draw will have your firearm out of the holster in under a second. (see draw video above for proper set and recommended draw).FULLY DEPLOYABLE FOR FULL-SIZED FIREARMFor concealment, many people realize the importance of being able to carry the ""Big Gun"" whenever possible to improve one's offensive capabilities. Yet, one of the common drawbacks of traditional concealed carry methods (such as A-IWB and 3 or 4 o'clock concealed OWB/IWB) has been the necessity for carrying a smaller framed handgun in order to minimize printing. This problem has been solved with the Cherries Holster; it's a game changer as it not only allows the use of a full-sized firearm to be used for concealed carry, but fully concealed carry. Our first-of-a-kind, patented-pending, raised belt clip design, allows all full sized and compact pistols to sit comfortably Below-The-Waistband (BWB), with absolutely zero printing. When worn appendix-style carry, the longer barrel of a full sized or compact pistol rides in between the left inner thigh and groin (for right handed shooters), virtually disappearing below the waistband. Additionally, the longer barrel allows for a rapid Medina Pocket-Assist Draw, which is ideal for offensive special-operations (targeted assassinations, snatch/grab.) Additionally, the unique thigh/groin holster seating position enables the larger handle of a full-sized firearm to sit comfortably- at approximately 1/2 inch below the waistband- across the pelvis area. This gives the user total accessibility and deeper concealment of his firearm. Finally, the longer barrel increases the ease of our Pocket-Assisted Draw, since there's more barrel access. For example, you will notice the difference of an easier pocket-assisted draw of a Glock 19/23 versus a pocket-assisted draw of the shorter barreled Glock 26/27. With The Cherries holster, you might even actually prefer carrying a longer barreled Glock 17/22!ZERO MOVEMENT Running below-the waistband ensures that your weapon stays in exactly the same place you originally mounted it.FULL RETENTIONThe Cherries holster is the first ever true deep concealment full retention holster. The holster sits Below-The-Waistband (BWB), which includes a full trigger guard for total retention safety. Using our custom Kydex design, the Cherries holster allows the user to carry appendix style while drastically reducing the risk of accidental or negligent discharge. The are 2 specific, unique design features that create this added retention:FULLY ENCLOSED TRIGGER GUARD MOLDThis is the first ever below-the-waistband holster to use a fully enclosed trigger guard. The shape of the holster fully encapsulates the trigger housing mechanism, and actual trigger itself.... reducing ALL risk of accidental discharge while worn fully-seated in the holster.AS SEEN IN TRAINING WITH KEANU REEVES FOR JOHN WICK 2"

This bow would also serve as a good down and dirty hunting bow if you don't want to mess up your expensive one. Limbs are are solid and string looks pretty dang good. Extremely minor fraying but I'll wax it up nice for the buyer. Will also toss in a half dozen Victory V force arrows with field tips because they are a tad long for my new bow and wouldn't be worth cutting just that little bit off. Willing to to let go for a lot less than I paid for it."

These Axes come as cold steel heads before I strip off of the terrible finish and hand fit them to their own handles. The first is a Viking style bearded hand axe that has some light file work and a distressed ""battle worn"" head finish. This was fitting to a longer than average oval style handle, wood burned with rings all the way up and wrapped with jute cord. Added the leather cord at the end for a nice touch. Ace is finished in Jacobean stain and sealed with a teak oil blend. Second is a forresting style tomahawk with some heavy file work on the head. This one was done in a walnut finish with some wood burning and wrapped with metal grey dyed jute cord. Finished with a leather cord and some light blue beads. Also sealed with teak oil. Had a leather over strike guard but I found they don't hold up. Both are hand sharpened to offer a deeper belly than the factory bevel and have a tool sharp edge done down to 3k grip whetstone Trying the waters to see if there is any interest before I start to produce more. Viking - $80Tomahawk- $100will not ship yet but may on my next run. These take a lot of time to produce so it may be a while before others are posted will meet locally"

Scope has a great drop compensation reticle that you can plug your factory ammo or reloaded ballistics into Zeiss website and it will tell you exactly what power to be on for the drop compensation to work. With the 270 round it averages between 10 and 13 power which is great for those long shots where you would really want to use the drop. It also has holdover points for windage. Scope has a wrap on it now that would come off if you don't like the matching look.   The Hells Canyon has a very short bolt throw which is smooth as butter and allows for quick follow up shots and comes in hand when wearing winter gloves. Bought this gun/scope around January of this year to be my new deer rifle and in case I get a chance at elk. Going through a divorce and need funds now though. The whole set up cost you around 1900 before taxes and that's if you find it on sale. It is a great light weight rifle with a very crisp trigger pull. DO NOT LOW BALL ME. This price is very fair and I will prob not take less than asking price....if I do it will be VERY little wiggle room.

The exclusive Cobblestone texture further enhances all Hogue stocks by providing an efficient non-slip, non irritating stippling pattern. OverMolded Stocks are constructed by molding a super strong, rigid fiberglass reinforced skeleton or “insert” that precisely fits the guns’ action. This rigid skeleton is then OverMolded with a durable but soft synthetic elastomer (rubber). During the heat and extreme pressure of injection molding the elastomer adheres chemically as well as mechanically to the skeleton, resulting in a permanent bond between the rubber and the insert. The super strong skeleton gives the stocks their strength, and the precise molded dimensions provide a perfect drop-in fit of your rifle or shotgun. The state of the art elastomer material used on Hogue stocks won’t harden with age and is virtually impervious to all oils and solvents found around firearms, providing years of dependable service.

If you know anything about Kahr, this pistol is better than one NIB because it has been broken in already and you can trust your life to it. About 350 rounds have been fired through it, and you can 'slingshot' it to chamber a round.     Exc+ cosmetic condition!  Exc+ operational condition!Feed ramp and barrel have been polished. Traction Grips have been installed on the firearm grip panels. Gun fires with a round in the chamber without a magazine inserted.  Extractor protrudes slightly to indicate there's a round in the chamber. You can feel it. There are no manual safeties, just point and shoot, but use the sights because they're great and provide a nice sight picture. Or you can just aim with the laser sight without even raising the gun to eye level!Comes with like-new Crimson Trace Laserguard (LG-437) laser. The laser has already been zeroed by me at 10 yards shooting HST 147gr. defense ammo. You will also find it shoots 115gr range ammo at that distance very well.Comes with two 6-rd and one 7-rd OEM magazines along with the original Kahr hard case with accessories and the owner's manual.I will also throw in two ambidextrous pocket holsters that fit the firearm with Laserguard- DeSantis Nemesis and a Uncle Mike's #4 pocket holster!This is a top-of-the-line concealable pistol!  Retail value of the package is over $930 new. You won't be disappointed!Sorry, No Shipping at this time.  PPT preferably in San Marcos, California. Buyer pays all transfer/DROS fees of $35. Gun is subject to prior sale as it is listed elsewhere.I have over 850 positive (100%) feedback on eBay, all positive on GunBroker, about 49 positive (100%) on calguns."

Its gracefully upswept CPM S30V stainless steel blade not only faithfully replicates Brend’s legendary custom grind lines, it highlights them with a contrasting two-toned finish of black titanium carbonitride (TiCN) coating on the bevels and a satin finish on the flats. Special ball bearing washers in the pivot provide an extremely smooth action and allow lightning-fast openings with the blade’s integral flipper or its Trademark Round Hole™. The knife’s unique flipper design offers exceptional opening leverage and also serves as a rock-solid hand guard in the open position. An impressive fusion of style and ergonomics, the Brend/Pirela Mamba’s handle is built on a framework of thick, skeletonized titanium liners that also form the basis of its sturdy LinerLock mechanism. The liners are flanked by meticulously machined solid twill carbon fiber scales that are both visually stunning and provide a solid, comfortable grip. A contoured, custom-designed pocket clip completes the package, offering right-side, tip-up carry and guaranteeing immediate access.   Overall Length 9.24″ (235 mm) Blade Length 3.76″ (96 mm) Steel CPM S30V Closed Length 5.48″ (139 mm) Edge Length 3.76″ (96 mm) Weight 6.7 oz (190 g) Blade Thickness 0.173″ (4.4 mm) Handle Carbon Fiber Clip Position Right Tip Carry Position Tip-Up Lock Type LinerLock Grind Hollow  Sheath   Origin Taiwan"

It can go from an almost flat profile when compressed to over 1400 cubic inches when completely expanded. With a slightly larger capacity and full peel open design, the Flatpack PLUS paves the way for full customization. The interior features a full field of velcro and sets the foundation for the new Flatpack accessories (SOLD SEPARATELY) this allows the end user to build the pack around their mission or lifestyle. In its compressed state, the D3 FlatPack PLUS can run a 1-liter hydration bladder in the main compartment with additional small items like batteries, energy gels and chem lights stored in the dedicated admin chamber. When expanded, the main compartment can fit a fully loaded D3CRX™, a helmet or a jacket while the admin can fit electronics and small binoculars. The FlatPack PLUS features a new chest strap to add stability and comfort while under load. It also integrates with a D3CRX™ or D3CR-H™, replacing the X harness with the pack straps, creating a light reconnaissance, patrol or an EDC worst case scenario rig. Although designed with the Special Operations end user in mind, the D3 FlatPack PLUS also makes an excellent everyday pack for civilians looking for a very compact bag that doesn’t scream military. Able to safely transport electronics such as a full size laptop or tablet (15”)  the padded inner chamber can also hold a number of items ranging from books and periodicals to digital cameras.

Besides offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge, it sports a tough and durable stainless-steel finish. This double/single-action autopistol it is perfect for deep concealment or used as a backup second handgun. Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. The controls of the 3032 Tomcat Inox are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand. The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range. Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat Inox were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense."""
