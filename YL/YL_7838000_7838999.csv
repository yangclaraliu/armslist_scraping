Colt manufactured over 185,000 Lightning Rifles, but there hasn't been a new one made since 1904 - that is until now. The Lightning Rifle by Uberti is a replica of the original Lightning, but by using modern steel the Uberti Lightning will safely stand up to modern ammunition. The Lightning Rifle is available in .45 Colt or .357 Magnum, all with luster finished walnut stocks and a choice of blued or color case-hardened receivers. When it comes to speed it can still beat a Winchester - or as Colt used to put it ""nothing is faster than Lightning.""

I've put about 50 rounds through it. I love this gun, but I bought a suppressor ready version so I have no need for this anymore! Does not come with Inforce APLc light for the listed price, but I'll include an IWB holster for $500. If you want the APLc, I'll sell the set for $625. Thanks!"

I did an decent stipple job on the pistol grip. The LPK and buffer assembly is a brandless gun show buy. The Upper is a 223 wylde stainless steel 7.5 inch barrel made by radical firearms. The BCG is from AIM surplus. The flash hider is actually a muzzle projector from damage industries, (projects all sound and explosion forward, which is nice on these short barrels). The brace is a Sig Sauer gen 2 brace. The black and OD rattle can job has held up over the years but can be easily removed with solvent. It comes with a covert case (tennis racket case) with a added pouch for two mags. I will entertain offers with trades but no less than 250 cash with 100$ value in trades.

But if there is a combat and tactical pistol for which this term is absolutely appropriate, it is the Beretta M9. This legendary semi auto handgun has not only won the historic contract with the US military in 1985, but has achieved a triumphant contract renewal after more than two decades of hard use in the world’s toughest and most extreme conditions, from the scorching deserts of Iraq to the frigid heights of the Afghan mountains. A contract renewal after this kind of use and abuse means a product that has kept its promises--and then some. Simply put, there is no pistol today that is as durable, reliable, dependable, easy to use, safe and accurate as the Beretta M9, the handgun that has rightfully earned the nickname of “World Defender.”"

It comes with the hard case that it came in originally, an extra 10rd magazine that cost me $50, a holster that was $30, and 100 rds of Winchester ammo. If your not familiar with the Firefly, it's the same exact gun as a Sig Mosquito, just re-branded by German Sports Guns(GSG) and American Tactical Imports(ATI). Price is $250 firm, but I will consider trading it for a 9mm in decent shape. And yes i know that the gun by itself can be bought online for a little less than what I'm asking for it, but if you do buy it online, you will still have to get it shipped to an ffl dealer of your choice, where you will then have to pay the taxes on it, plus the $45 transfer fee, and pass the background check. So in the end you will actually end up paying more. I'm thinking that people do not realize this. Anyway, If you are serious about purchasing the gun please call or text REDACTED. Thanks"

The original sights and sight hood are present as well as a fine set of SAKO scope rings attached to factory dove tails on the receiver.

There is one very tiny ding in the wood finish on the right side of the stock that is hard to see. Excellent original checkering and SAKO butt plate. This would NOT be an easy FINNWOLF to upgrade unless you had one with its box. Insured shipping available on request.

My feelings on As Delivered to the Military, verses Mix-master M1 and M1 Carbines.If you want a War Relic, you want a Mix-Master. I can say with certainty, that 99% of any of these rifles that served in Combat, will be a Mix-Master. There were a very high number of these that were mixmasters when delivered to the Military to meet production requirements, and were surely made into mix-masters during group cleanings and repairs. All of theses that were returned, inspected and repaired for reuse or resale, were future disassembled and repaired.The only ones that did not go through this process, were either presentation ones, or non issued ones. Even the Non Combat ones that were used in the States for Training, were dissembled and mixed.If you are buying a War Relic, it will be a Mixmaster, or a rifle that someone destroyed the history, and Made it All ""Correct"".My feelings: I would much rather have a True War Relic, that had seen battle, went through rebuild, and had the needed improvements done to it, than a recreated All Original.Inland front sight (n) Sa amco bayonet lug  trigger housing Winchester (w) Winchester push safety (ew) Underwood bolt (.u.)

This is a dissipator, meaning the gas system is calibrated for 5.56 gas pressures, so that recoil is the lightest you'll ever feel from an AR. I fed it 62gr. with no problems. It being tuned for optimal 5.56 recoil levels means that .223 will not cycle though, given the reduced powder load.A dissipator is a rifle length gas system on a 16"" barrel. Benefits include the even softer recoil of a rifle length gas system vs. that of carbine or mid-length, even more so given the reduced dwell time, also a longer sight radius for more accurate shooting with irons. If we lived in a free state, this would be an ideal set-up for a supressor too.-Fixed 10 round ASC steel magazine-Del-Ton Upper (The BCG and CH too)-UTG rifle stock-PSA Lower Parts-Anderson Receiver-Includes PSA Foam lined box for storage and transport$580 Cash, includes BCG and charging handle,  includes transfer fee, would like to do it through The Firing Pin.
