Includes a factory hard case and Galco holster specifically made for the C9. Neither of these are standard with a HiPoint. Also included are two magazines and a ghost ring sight. I have very few problems with this gun. The reason I'm putting it up is because I'm trying to thin the pistol herd and I don't like the 8 round capacity. The only problems I've had with this pistol is one stove pipe and one magazine related issue. Some wear is on the bottom of the grip.Note: Due to the recent high amount of inquries from residents of other states, I will need to see a GADL or GWCL to prove Georgia residency. I will happily sell to a resident of another state, however we will need to meet at an FFL to conduct a legal transfer."

This pistol has been very good to me but I am looking to continue my journey in customizing my Glock. Comes with original box, manual, spent case, lock and keys, Hogue grip, four 17 rd Ruger mags, magazine loader, lifetime warranty.This gun has a 3.5 lb Ghost connector and a stainless steel guiderod. You will also get factory spring and factory trigger connector.The gun is in great shape and eats everything I've fed it, EXCEPT Winchester White Box ammo. There tends to be failures to eject with winchester. I usually use federal or blazer at the range. It loves the cheap aluminum federal ammo, I have not had one issue with it. This would make a great gun for a new shooter, as it was the first full size 9mm I learned on and it taught me a lot.This gun is also an amazing value because of all of the bells and whistles it's packing (striker indicator, loaded chamber indicator, adjustable rear sight, thumb safety, trigger safety, mag release safety, low bore axis, super comfortable ergonomics, firing pin drop safety, easy takedown, accessory rail, more).Although I am ultimately looking to sell, I am open to trade offers. I can throw in more if the trade calls for it.I'm mainly interested in .22LR pistols and/or long guns, subcompact 9mms, .45ACP.  I will be happily entertained by any other firearms/gear/ammo you have to offer.I have a current CCL and WI DL and will only do business if you have yours as well.A bill of sale will also be required to obtain this firearm from me."

Germany manufactured Sig Sauer P220 Double/Single Action 45 ACP Single Stack Handgun in the Nitron finish. We know it is a West German model because of the Proof Marks on the frame and the fact it is stamped ""Made in W. Germany"" on the slide. Located on the ""slide chin"" there are three stamped Proof Marks. The top one is for the Kiel Proof House that tested the firearm that is located 17 miles from Sig Sauer’s manufacturing facility in Eckernförde. The middle mark ""Eagle-N"" shows that this firearm was Proofed in W. Germany and tested with Nitro Loads, and the bottom mark, ""JJ"" tells us it was Proofed in 1988. The serial number of this firearm also dates to 1988 and is stamped on the frame, slide, and barrel (3 locations, all matching numbers). Includes two magazines - one 8 round factory mag and one 8 round ProMag, a cable lock, and Sig hard case. This is not a new gun at nearly 30 years old. I would rate it a 7 out of 10. If your looking for a W. German Sig P220 that you can use and carry without worrying about getting a scratch on it, you cant beat this one for the price. Price is $450.00 Cash FIRM.
