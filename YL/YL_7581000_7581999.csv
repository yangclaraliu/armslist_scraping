I posted a link of the rifle from where I purchased it at the bottom so you can see the specifications for yourself, the only thing that is aftermarket is the muzzle brake and extended charging handle, it's a Lantac dragon and a Leapers charging handle.  I have two windowed 25 round pmags, about 200 rounds of ZQI 7.62x51 rounds and 60 rounds of softpoint ammo. I will be keeping the scope, mount, bipod and soft case for other rifle. I'm looking to recoup some of my money back, I will sell for $1600 and have about $2100 invested in all.https://aeroprecisionusa.com/m5e1-complete-rifle-18in-cmv-rifle-length.html"

Comes In Hard Plastic HK Case The VP Series is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired HK since the P7 series pistols introduced in the 1980s. It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VPSeries integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. VP Tactical models feature a longer and slightly heavier threaded barrel, come equipped with night sights, and include three (3) magazines.

It is in almost perfect condition for the year. I have shot steel cased and brass cased ammo through it, cleaning after every outing. It cycles flawless with good brass ammo, but had a couple hiccups with the steel cased (tula) ammo where the slide would not completely close to fire the next round. Just good to know in case you need to depend on this pistol. Otherwise, this is a great pistol that is no longer available in California except for PPT at a licensed FFL. The finish still looks new and handles smoothly since I always cleaned it and it was probably a safe queen before I got it.-I would be open to trades for pistols/rifles in the following calibers: 9mm, .223, or 7.62x39-Buyer pays fees for PPT/FFL transferIN PERSON CASH ONLY FFL TRANSFER ONLY.

This specific rifle has the earlier G43 markings that were used during the early part of 1944 production. These were the standard, mid/late war German sniper rifles intended to replace the K98 sniper rifles. It has A forged single bolt guide receiver that is marked on the left side ""G43/ 142c/ac 44"", with a single ""eagle/359"" Waffenamt proof on the right side. It is fitted with the rough forged bolt carrier that has the hold-open latch with the cocking handle on the left side. It has the stamped action cover with the sliding dust cover on top and a single Waffenamt proof on the rear end. The rifle is fitted with a correct wartime laminated stock ( different serial number) with a smooth cupped buttplate. The left side of stock has a partial ""eagle/359"" proof with a smaller one inside the pistol grip. This excellent G43 sniper rifle is complete with a correct WWII ""aye/K43"" marked magazine and leather strap but does not include cleaning rod.  The rifle was recently checked out at gunsmith and is range ready.  Slight pitting in rifling near end of muzzle which should not detriment accuracy.I prefer to meet at local Southern California FFL and do transfer.  However, I will ship to your FFL as an option."

With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide.The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe.The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13.Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users.Features:• Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life• Fluted chamber aids in extraction• All steel construction• Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator• Fixed barrel ensures accuracy• Trigger guard heatshield• Ambidextrous magazine release• Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function• Blued finishHK Package Includes:- HK P7M13 9mm Pistol- Date Code: 1H (1987)- Hk Factory Manual- HK Factory Carbon Scraper- 6 HK P7M13 9mm 13 Round magazines-hard carry case-Holster"

I've been doing this since my 1st issued M-16 in 1975.The factory trigger was pretty rough so I had an ALG Defense Quality Mil Spec Trigger, which is QMS-Tuned by Geissele. I had one on my other Aero and is now one of my favs. Not super light but very crisp.Mostly looking for cash for toys. Not looking for any trades aside from possibly AR parts. No pistols or ammo.I feel $760.00 OBO is a very fair price since I have a bit over $1000.00 invested (I could have done better). You are welcome to make any offer you like. One of two things will likely happen. I’ll say thanks and yes, I’ll take that offer or I’ll say thanks for sharing your ignorance.The reason I’m selling this rifle is that I want a different toy and I want it now. So, I priced this very fairly to move. OH! This isn’t a “Custom” Rifle. I only installed a better trigger on it. Technically it could be and then it would have gone well into the $900 range in value.Thanks for looking, Bill"
