Fully-ambidextrous operating controls instantly adapt the FN SCAR 17 to any user. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of tactical lights and lasers. The side-folding, polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length-of-pull, and is colored matte black.

The gun shot really good. Without malfunctions and issues. Started as a brand new M92 AK-47 pistol, and converted to a fully legal carbine. With 16"" extended pinned barrel/permanently attached muzzle device (as per BATFE Rule if you install a full stock, or folding stock so won't be a Class 3/SBR gun). I double (BATF only requires just one pin) blind pinned and silver soldered the extended barrel/fake suppressor. I double blind pinned the barrel extension to make sure it stays on. Overall, the barrel and all is 16 1/2"". With a U.S. Machinegun brand stock adaptor installed (pictured). The wood stock set (upper & lower handguards, and pistol grip - is a copy of the famous Yugo ""fat"" wood pistol grip) are finished with amber shellac stain. In addition, I installed U.S. made compliance parts; which includes extended barrel, Tapco trigger/fire control group (hammer, trigger, sear, hammer spring, and has a G2 Tapco trigger), and wood pistol grip. Installed the U.S. made parts for 922r compliance. You must be at least 18 years old, or older and a Kentucky resident with a valid KY driver's license (KY CCWL preferred) to buy/trade this gun. No shipping. Local sale/trade only. I like this gun a lot, but I need a handgun, and can use some vacation money. Thanks for looking.

The following stocks are; Manticore, Tromix, or Tapco

I also have a brand new PKA-Venezuela red-dot sight that works extremely well with this rifle for sale. This original Russian production, military-grade red-dot is built like a tank and is night-vision compatible.

Asking $1050.00 for the rifle, $250.00 for the red-dot. I will sell them seperately but would prefer to sell them together.

May consider trades/partial trades if you have something decent in 7.62x39mm, but FAIR WARNING: An SKS with cheap Tapco ""tacticool"" furniture isn't considered decent. Offers of this nature won't be responded to.

I am in no rush to get rid of this rifle, I just have so many 30/06's that I want to see if anyone has anything interesting they might want to trade for this.  It's a savage premier grade 110 with a French walnut stock, roll over cheek piece and right hand palm swell in grip.  This iPad doesn't take great pictures indoors to do the gun justice.  The gun is from the 60's I believe.

It does have the handling marks of a hunting rifle, but is still in great shape.  No rust or pitting anywhere.  The only real flaw is a small split in the wood just in front of the floor plate on the bottom.  I tried to take a pic, it's small and blends right into the grain.  I bought it used with the split, so I don't know how it got there.  Gun shop assured me it would never be an issue or I could return the gun.  I has never been an issue.  It's professionally glass bedded and shoots around 1"" and under at 100 yards with store bought cheap stuff.

Commander sized take priority.  I traded off my last 1911 a while ago and I miss the platform.  I specifically am looking for a Kimber, Sig, or one of the custom shops, dont bother responding and offering me something like an ATI or Rock Island cause I'm trading an AR for it....c'mon man.  I'm also not interested in a .22.  Has to be .45 or 9mm IF it's extra sexy.

AR has had about 200 rounds through it, runs excellent and has not had any malfunctions of any kind.

My gun comes with the following:
1 tube red dot (looks like a bushnell) with 30mm scope rings to mount it to the rail
1 open red dot (random 40 dollar optic from bass pro, but works pretty well and has 4 different sights in both red and green)
1 replacement pistol type grip that I havent installed yet because I cant find a socket around here long enough for it.  You'll thank me for this one because its ALOT more comfortable than the stock thing.

Both optics have served me well, and I am especially impressed with the open red dot...who needs to spend $400 on an eotech?

Factory Bushmaster 30 rd. 5.56/.223 mag
Black PMag with window, also 30 rounds
30ish rounds of 5.56 target ammo
50ish rounds of .223 Remington UMC holowpoints

Only other non-1911 trades I'm interested in:
1) Walther PPK in outstanding shape + cash
2) H&K USP Tactical
3) Sig 226 or 229

Send me an email with what you've got and I'll send you back pictures of the gun.  Emails with no trade offers will be ignored.

I'd also prefer that you come to my home and we can go over the guns in my garage.  I want to look over your gun and you want to look over mine and I dont need to deal with trying to be discrete in a parking lot somewhere."

Brand new never fired with a new Trijicon Tri Power on a new LaRue LT 150 quick release mount. Also comes with a Elzetta Charlie C333 3 cell 900 lumens weapon light yes it will knock your eyeballs out and is totally disorienting. I have never seen a weapon mounted light that's this bright. Its mounted on a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional rail. Now for the best part it is equipped with a Aimshot LS8300 green laser. YES I SAID LS8300 TRY TO FIND ONE OF THESE! They do come up from time to time but they are only avaible to SOCOM and other SFs units and only on military POs. They use to be avaivble  to LEOs but are now restricted to SF units only. If you need to verify this contact Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta. Its the brightest dot and beam I have ever seen on a rifle. You can follow the beam as far as you can see. Yes I have a ton of fun with it out here on the lake after dark. Yes I know the rifle is only 999$ new and if you want just the rifle don't bother me please go see Matt at the ARMSROOM and he will be glad to fix you up with one of these sweet little rifles. If you can build this rifle for 2100 with everything this one has and that's all new add owns and the rifle new from the Armsroom with a new LS8300 you can have this one for FREE.

This is a brand new Beretta 92FS Compact INOX w/ Rail. The barrel is 4.25” long and the pistol weighs 1.96# or 31.4 ounces. It comes with two 13 round magazines, hard case and operator’s manual.
The 92 series semiautomatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time-proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

INOX version:

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block.
External Hammer Design.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever.
Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. 
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm."

LaserLyte V3

Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date.  Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.

Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.

The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

The Subcompact V3 laser is powered by four 377 batteries that provide five hours in constant on mode and ten hours in pulse mode of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

Tristar, importer of Turkish made shotguns, has released a tactical shotgun that is getting some attention. The Tec 12 appears to be inspired by, if not a direct clone of, the classic Benelli M3. Normally the gun is a semi-automatic, recoil inertia operated 12 gauge, but the user can turn a ring in front of the forend (just like the M3) to convert the gun to pump action. Capacity is 5+1 with standard size 2 3/4 inch shells, but the gun also accepts 3 inch magnum shells. - See more at: http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/03/07/tristar-brings-new-autopump-shotgun-option-with-tec-12/#sthash.cOgP0ASB.dpuf"

Wood is very nice with very few small rub marks. Checkering is in great shape as well and bluing on the barrel is in excellent shape. If you are not familiar with the BOSS system it allows you to tune your barrel to the bullet. This controls the harmonic vibration of the bullet to give you consistent shot placement. This was only offered on a Winchester for a few years. I have had this rifle for almost 15 years and it has always been very well taken care of. It just sits in the gun case now so I would like to trade it off for another gun. rifle or pistol. Mostly I would be interested in a long range scope for my .300 win mag. Vortex or leupold.

Technical/Ballistics Information:

This is INCREDIBLE factory new, high-performance, precision-manufactured, SS109 steel penetrator, lead-core ammunition loaded exactly to NATO specs.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.  The ammunition is manufactured in Romania, by Uzina Mecanică Sadu, which is an ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 154-C) and AQAP 2110 certified manufacturing facility.  They have been manufacturing high quality ammunition for 75 years and have been supplying our armed forces and our allies overseas to this day.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

All postings are immediately deactivated once they are picked up from me, so if you're reading this there is no reason to ask me if it's still available.

This is INCREDIBLE factory new, high-performance, precision-manufactured, SS109 steel penetrator, lead-core ammunition loaded exactly to NATO specs.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

Up for sale or trade is my Ruger Mark III Competition Target 22 LR pistol. 

I've had the gun roughly 4-5 years now and have put about a brick of 22 through it, all mini-mags. I just haven't used it like I thought I would. It comes with bases, rings, matching Bushnell 2-7 power scope, 2 magazines, 2 sets of grips (coco bola thumb rest grips and plastic checkered grips), the case and all factory stuff and I'll throw in a 100 round sleeve of mini mags to get you started. It shoots accurately and I've yet to have a jam in it. 

I'm asking $550 OBO for the package. Trades can be plus or minus cash as necessary. Would like to keep the trades close in value if possible. Not really looking for calibers outside of 223 and 40, but it doesn't hurt to try. I usually base trade differences off of MSRP and/or gunbroker to keep things level.

963,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3133963,"For Sale:  9 NIB us palm ak30 ""AK47"" magazines","wilmington area, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 200,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 3, 2014",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 9 new in bag black U.S. palm ak30 polymer magazines and 1 slightly used and modified I will throw in for free.  The one used one had the ribs sanded down at the top just enough to try it in a PTR32 but it did not feed right so I do not need them.  

I am willing to ship with payment through paypal or USPS money order

(Shamelessly copied from U.S. Palm)
The AK30 is constructed of proprietary aerospace polymers, and sets itself apart from other polymer magazines with its purpose-built design and multiple unique features.

By eliminating the removable floor plate we created a stronger design; a five-sided box. This revolutionary design, paired with our advanced polymers gives the AK30 the strength it needs to survive impacts that would destroy other magazines. After the magazine is molded, the body and end-cap are bonded together, so no disassembly is possible or required. The AK30 has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy cleaning and hassle-free maintenance. Just dunk the magazine in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. Dry contamination easily flows free through the vented follower design. The AK30 also features a Mil-Spec spring that is heat-treated and stress relieved.

Internal design
Inside, there is a lot going on! The locking surfaces are reinforced by a stainless steel cage that has been molded into the entire top of the magazine to further ensure reliability for years of trouble free service. We purposely omitted reinforcing the feed-lips with metal, being as our polymer rebounds back to its original shape much more reliably than metal or metal reinforced designs. When examined, the benefit of steel reinforced feed lips was found to be less desirable, as the two dissimilar materials, polymer and steel rebound and flex at differing rates. This can cause delamination between the two materials, which can create an environment for malfunctions. It was also observed that even though the AKM platform is field proven and very robust, attempts at field repairing bent feed lips by end users were unsuccessful.

External Design
Outside, our design team created a magazine that can be utilized by an operator in any environmental condition. The aggressive ridges on the front and rear allow a positive purchase when seating the AK30 into the rifle. The deep waffle pattern on the magazine sides assist in rapid extraction from magazine pouches, and 100% positive manipulation within conditions beyond extreme. Every surface of the AK30 was given careful consideration to benefit the operator working in the harshest conditions on earth.

Platform Specifics
Initially designed to fit AKM-47 rifles that use detachable double-stack magazines, the AK30 has been successfully deployed in other makes and models similar to the AKM as well. We still advise users of mass-produced/domestically produced rifles to test their individual rifles for compatibility, as there exists a very wide set of “standards” to which rifles are manufactured, and in the rare occasion, the AK30 may be too dimensionally specific to accommodate for a wide tolerance stacking issue.
