This example has the rare 'Peterson Cut' that allowed the rifle to be equipped with the Peterson Device which converted the rifle to semi-auto. Very revolutionary design for the WW1 era. The rifle has never been rearsenaled or altered. It is 100% as it was issued in the military. The blued finish is deep and dark and in fantastic condition. The rifling is very bright, sharp, and shiny with no pitting present. The muzzle guages near 0 so it is nearly new. The barrel is original to the rifle as shown by the SA stamp on date of 2-19. The stock has no cracks or chips present and has all the correct military cartouches. I'm happy to provide additional photos upon request.I am only selling it to fund another purchase which is why my asking price is lower than market value. Asking $1,000 but I will entertain realistic offers. Please respond via email and I will get back to you quickly.

It is a special version of the Sig P225 with upgrades to the hammer and a firmer hammer spring for Police use.  This one has the typical Police use wear (shot little, carried a lot).  Rifling is sharp, bore is Bright, pistol operates flawlessly. December, 1997 issue date to North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest of Germany's Police forces. It has the 2nd generation feed ramp designed to handle hollow point rounds that were then being issued to Police units.  This pistol was built towards the end of Sig's contract so it has all of the upgrades that may not be found in early 1980's P6's.I have both stock plastic grips that would have been issued with the pistol, and a thicker set of very nice checkered wood Sig grips.  The wood grips are more hand fllling, the plastic are slimmer.  I've put one grip panel on each side in the pictures so you can see the difference.Von Stavenhagen sights (post and dot), 3 original welded steel Sig 8 round mags, and a set of three Wolff mainsprings to reduce the double action trigger pull.  I left the trigger pull stock, but you may wish to experiment with a lower weight spring.This is a single stack 9mm (8+1) that is about the same size as a Glock 19 or 1911 Commander.  All steel West German design and construction, exceptionally well engineered.  A great way to get into Sig's steel pistols without the $1,000+ for a P226, and without the very large grip of a double stack magazine.You can get more information about this unique pistol and its history at realgunreviewsdotcom, search P6.No warranty expressed or implied, subject to prior sale, if this ad is posted the merchandise is still available.

Buy It Now!! The Specialist is one of the newest additions to the Dan Wesson stable. When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public. A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there. The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear."
