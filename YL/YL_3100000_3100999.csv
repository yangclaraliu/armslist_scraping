	The original, award-winning Zero Tolerance 0777 was a very limited-run knife. Yet interest in it is high among blade aficionados. That's why Zero Tolerance is happy to announce a newer version of that award-winning knife-one that will be much more generally available. The 0770CF offers the style and performance of the award-winning 0777, but in a slightly smaller, streamlined version. For ZT performance, the blade is ELMAX powdered steel, which provides the ability to take a razor edge, excellent edge retention, strength and toughness.

** I don't have any photos because the gun is still at the LGS being DROS'ed so I attached a generic photo taken from the web. Gun was ordered by the gun shop just a few weeks ago so it is the latest manufacturing date. **

Has Trijicon HD Green Night Sights installed. Titanium striker and block for smooth, rapid cycling, and faster reset, when used in conjunction they work very well in producing a smoother cycle and clean break. Ghost trigger system for a clean 4 lb pull, with a Glock factory smooth surface trigger not found standard on the G30. The standard serrated trigger can cause point of impact drift when the trigger finger drags across the trigger face. Pearce grip extensions for better control while not giving up conceal ability . Titanium alloy assembly pins and take down that are drift, wear, and corrosion resistant. Vickers extended and contoured mag release and Glock extended slide release. All original factory parts, paperwork, hardware, hardcase, Glock Holster and mag pouch, two 10 round magazines are included. This G30 is made in Austria with the dark black Tennifer finish that is proven to last longer then the newer grayish finish. This pistol has extremely light wear and only range use and looks new. The pistol has not had enough rounds fired in it to even break it in. I use this same setup in many other Glocks (21, 22,23,27,) and if works flawlessly and holds up perfectly, much better then out of the box.

Any upgrades can be un done. All factory parts are included.

Pistol fires extremely well. It has a crisp, light and clean break with tight groups. While it is outstanding I use the M&Ps and Rugers more which has left the G30 sitting in the safe.

May include up to 400 round 230 Winchester FMJ and up to 200 Defense rounds depending on trade. Also have additional G30 (10rd) and G21 (13 rd) magazines depending on trade.

It has no Arsenal marking and was made before the original /26\ Chinese Arsenal was officiated by the government. *Note that this is a real deal milsurp gun and is not a Norcinco import.*

This gun came packed in cosmoline, which has since been removed and cleaned to working condition. 

The Front Sight Block was canted and the pins were removed and rubber mallet, vice and square used to recenter it. 

There was slight surface rust and pitting below the wood line on the outer receiver which has been removed before it caused any real damage and there is no longer any traces of it.

The gun is 95 percent matching except for the gastube.

Bayonet is in excellent condition.

It comes with a buttstock cleaning kit and original Chinese sling that didn't originally come with the gun. I had to track down originals myself. It also has an original Chinese canvas carrying case.

I tested the gun with 5 shots to insure that it would cycle properly and feed properly from the magazine and it is fully functional.

Trijicon HD Green Nights Sights installed. Titanium striker and block for smooth, rapid cycling, and faster reset, when used in conjunction they work very well in producing a smoother cycle and clean break. Ghost trigger system for a clean 4 lb pull, with a Glock factory smooth surface trigger not found standard on the G30. The standard serrated trigger can cause point of impact drift when the trigger finger drags across the trigger face. Pearce grip extensions for better control while not giving up conceal ability . Titanium alloy assembly pins and take down that are drift, wear, and corrosion resistant. Vickers extended and contoured mag release and Glock extended slide release. All original factory parts, paperwork, hardware, hardcase, Glock Holster and mag pouch, two 10 round magazines are included. This G30 is made in Austria with the dark black Tennifer finish that is proven to last longer then the newer grayish finish. This pistol has extremely light wear and only range use and looks new. The pistol has not had enough rounds fired in it to even break it in. I use this same setup in many other Glocks (21, 22,23,27,) and if works flawlessly and holds up perfectly, much better then out of the box.

Any upgrades can be un done. All factory parts are included.

Pistol fires extremely well. It has a crisp, light and clean break with tight groups. While it is outstanding I use the M&Ps and Rugers more which has left the G30 sitting in the safe.

May include up to 400 round 230 Winchester FMJ and up to 200 Defense rounds depending on trade. Also have additional G30 (10rd) and G21 (13 rd) magazines depending on trade.

I have had his rifle for around 22 years. I have shot it maybe 5  times when I first got it, and it has sit in a safe since then. Using the remington decoder, it appears to be manufactured in May of 1956. I do not have the rear sight, but you can order them from gunpartscorp. It does have some wear, it looks like it had some surface rust on the receiver and someone tried to polish it off and put some scrapes on it. It was given to me when I was around 18 by my father, and I do not know the history. I have one box magazine for it. It does have a scope mount also. I know it's a rare find due to the age and caliber, but it's not in 100% shape finish wise. Functions perfectly though. More pics upon request.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I am, I gather, the only person who feels this way.  

So, here's the deal: I'd like to trade my extended P238 magazine for a flush-fit version (must be genuine Sig Sauer part, in good condition).  It's in great shape, and has probably only been used for 10 magazines worth of shooting.  

You're getting a good deal, as the extended mags cost more than the flush-fits.  Hell, run to the store, buy a new flush mag, and hand it to me for my extended, and end up with a $15 discount on an extended.

Just to be clear, this is the tiny little Sig .380 Auto Pistol.

Mossberg claims the Model 500 is the only shotgun to pass the U.S. Army's Mil-Spec 3443E test, The updated 3443G specification requires a metal trigger and only the Model 590A1s have heavy, ported barrels, and metal trigger groups, fiber front sights and ghost rings.

Bought new locally at Olde English, I haven't shot more than 400 rounds through it, it's hardly broken in. Like New Condition. Extremely meticulously cared for- stripped, cleaned, wood grips oiled after every time at the range. 

Reason for selling: Just got married! Need to trim down my arms collection for some cash. Eventually though I'd like to get something with a higher capacity and a rail for a light. Can't beat the cool factor though- this is just like the James Bond 007 pistol! Practically speaking, it is a very nice size for a concealed carry. 

Most of the PPK/S I see listed for sale online (gun broker, etc.) are around the 540-560 range, with 600-650.00 price for new ones. This is an excellently maintained piece with minimal amount of rounds discharged, overly meticulous maintenance and detailing, fairly priced as such. I don't think I'm interested in trades at this point.

Meeting for Sale: It is my priority and desire to conduct a safe and honest transaction. Know that you are receiving an excellently maintained pistol from an honest, hard working and responsible individual. In return, I reserve the right to choose to conduct business solely with honest, law-abiding citizens. Please take no offense but I do request a copy of driver's license, and will write up a bill-of-sale (complete with both of our information, and serial number) with copies for both parties. Phone call to get to know you before I sell. This is from one trustworthy and responsibly armed citizen to another.
