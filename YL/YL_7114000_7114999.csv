This is an awesome firearm. Yes these are notorious for feed jamming witch is the #1 problem with these guns. When I first perchased this gun I was very disappointed put 10 rounds down range then the notorious feed jam issue popped up. Sent it back to smith & Wesson they serviced and polished the barrel and sent it back. Got her back and went straight to the range to see if the problem was resolved put 250 rounds down range with not a single issue! Gun feels amazing and is definitely one of the more accurate .40 caliber handguns I have fired only 250 rounds through it but looking for something a little smaller to cc. This hand gun is very similar to the glock in many different ways and in my opinion better with the price of these weighing in heavy. I'm really looking to sell price is $350 includes two 14 round mags, Hoppe's bore snake, Alengear holster and some home defense rounds. Will consider trades really looking for a g30 with cash on my end! Any questions feel free to text me at REDACTED thanks!"

This gun is not mint as it has some carry / use wear on the bluing and a few stock dings. The wear seems correct for a gun of this age that has seen use as a skeet or hunting gun. Although it show some honest signs of use, it has been maintained very well. The bluing is excellent overall with thinning on the bottom of the receiver and trigger guard, where you would expect from a gun this old. The stock has a couple of small dings and light scratches, but no big gouges or cracks. The pictures do not do the stock justice. It is beautiful with amazing grain and color. I'm not sure if the vent rib is factory or if it is a period correct, Simmons or Money Maker. This gun does not appear to have been refinished or modified. It has the factory Remington butt plate. It is tight on face and locking lever is right of center when closed. It also has a few thousands gap on the locking ears when closed, indicating that it has a lot of life left before it would need to be reworked. Barrel selector, and ejectors work perfect. Bores are bright and shiny. Both barrels are marked ""SKEET"" in the correct factory stamping. One thing that is interestin is that the ""skeet"" stampings look like they are over ""imp"" markings which is the way the earliest Skeet barrels were marked. Serial numbers match on the barrels and receiver. Serial number is 4407 indicating manufacture of 1937 according to the BB of Gun Values #22. Length of pull is 14 1/4"" to the factory butt plate. I have shot skeet with this gun and it works perfect. Excellent trigger, barrel selector works perfect, and ejection is crisp. I wouldn't hesitate to use this gun as a high volume clays gun. It should be good for 10s of thousands of rounds and any gunsmith who can work on a K32 / Krieghoff 32 should be able to handle any maintenance issues. Make sure your receiving FFL will receive from an individual. If the gun must be shipped from an FFL then add $35 to the total. Please ask any questions"

Also it comes with 2 boxes (100 rounds) of HSM +P (runs $40+ a box), 2 boxes (40) rounds of Winchester Silvertip (runs $20+ a box), 1 box (50 rounds) of Fiocchi (runs $30+ a box), and 1 box (20 rounds) of Buffalo Bore +P JHP (runs $30+ a box). The Uncle Mikes holster comes with the package as wel ($15+). The revolver is in great shape but there is some minor holster wear. The Blackhawk revolvers are one of the few .45LC's that are rated to shoot the +P ammo (which can be just as or more powerful than .44 magnum). Just the ammo and holster are worth right around $200 so I'm pretty firm on $525. No shipping, no trades, and you're responsible for the transfer fee (normally $16) at any FFL in the south Denver area (Ark Tactical, Rapid Fire Bunker, etc.). Thanks!"

Features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.    Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.    Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.    Shallow ""express-style"" windage adjustable ""V"" notch rear sight and large white bead front sight for instant target acquisition.    Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).    Rugged Green Mountain laminate stock is dimensionally stable through environmental extremes, features a soft rubber buttpad with buttpad spacers that allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters or varying levels of outerwear (three 1/2"" spacers included) and wrap-around checkering that provides a sure grip in any weather.    Also includes - rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; barrel band mounted swivel stud; optional forend swivel stud.    The Ruger® Muzzle Brake System includes a removable, radial-port muzzle brake that significantly reduces felt recoil. For times when the brake is not preferred, it may be replaced by the included dynamically-matched muzzle weight. Switching between the brake and the weight will not change the bullet's point of impact for a particular load. The included thread protector may be used if neither the brake nor the weight is desired."
