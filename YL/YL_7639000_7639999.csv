The Classic is fairly rare, and masterfully done, and features many of the same features as the model III Browning Hi Powers. This is such a quality gun that it was standard issue to the Argentine police force. This gun has Crimson Trace laser grips installed but I'll send the original grip with it as well and also include the holster and everything you see in the photo.  It comes with factory magazine and 5 after market magazines that were never opened or used, and any magazine for the browning hi power will work and operate with this weapon as it basically a Browning thru and thru. There is very little wear on this firearm, and the slide and magazine release is very positive. The magazine that comes with it is not drop-free, but it will drop free with other browning high-power magazines.  This is a soft shooter, and points intuitively, and has very mild and manageable recoil.  (I put Browning as the manufacturer because this is closer to a Browning in terms of quality than an FEG, but this firearm is an FM.)Cash only!"

743,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7639743,For Sale:  Original Springfield 1903,"Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky","$ 1,100","Listed On: Wednesday, November 29, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Model 1903 Springfield rifle was one of 31,355 rifles built at Springfield Armory in 1930. It was rebuilt at Raritan Arsenal probably during WW2. The rebuilding process typically involved (1) complete disassembly, (2) inspection of all parts, (3) replacement of worn or out-of-spec parts, (4) refinishing if needed, and finally (5) reassembly.Thousands of 1903s were issued to US Marines during the early days of WW2. Many US Army troops were issued 1903s until production of the M1 Garand grew to the point that there were enough of them for issue to virtually all US Army troops.Thousands more of these rifles were loaned to our allies both during and after WW2.As to the markings: The ""SA / 4-30"" means that the barrel was made at Springfield Armory in April, 1930. Since the receiver was also made in 1930, according to the serial number, we can assume that the barrel is original to the gun and has not been replaced. The M.R cartouche means it was tested at the Mt Ranier Arsenal. Which are uncommon these days. The circled ""P"" on the stock directly behind the trigger guard means that the gun has been successfully test fired and has been accepted by the Ordnance Department."
