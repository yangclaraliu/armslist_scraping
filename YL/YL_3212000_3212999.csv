The weapon light is Elzettas best and brightest they call it the scorcher its 900 lumens and will knock your eyeballs for a loop even in daylight. Check out Elzetta on the web to see this light in action model # Charlie C 333 and it sits in a Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. Last is the best piece on this rifle it has a Aimshot LS8300. Try to find or buy one of these they are only sold to SOCOM and other elite SOF on military POs only. They are no longer sold to LE Agency's. This one was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO in Afghanistan. You can check with Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta to verify the sale of this awesome laser. Its the brightest laser you have ever seen even in daylight and at night it looks like something from STAR WARS. Yes it will light a match. This is top of the line for military only and is not even close to the other crapy lasers you see on here for sale. Once you see it running you will know why. Comes with two different tail caps and zero tool. Thanks so much for looking.

It's my daily driver (3 mile commute) It has 57,400 miles, CD player, AM/FM Radio, Leather Seats, Bose speakers, and is a 5 speed manual transmission.
I owe $4200 on it and need to get rid of it.  I'll be moving to a job that pays much less and don't want to worry about a car payment; plus with the size of my family it's just not practical to have a 2 seater.
The Good:
Low miles, a lot of get up and go, AC blows cold, heat is hot, great on gas, smooth shifting, great handling, and very nice looking.
The Bad
Rag top has a few small tears in it and leaks a little on the driver's side when it rains. Speedometer sometimes goes out.  Front tires need to be replaced.  
The bad has been taken into consideration to the price according to KBB but price is negotiable.

I bought this a couple years ago and it has ~150 rnds through it and has done wonders on big hogs.  286gr at ~2300 fps is serious medicine for anything in N America as well as the dark continent.  I added a fiber optic front sight last year.  It has a very burly action and a great trigger as well as a set trigger, magazine holds 5 rnds.  I had a mercury recoil reducer installed last year locally, not that the recoil is too bad but the reducer helps when bench resting the rifle.

So the rifle is in 95% and the scope only has ~50 rnds through it.

The scope is a Nikon 2x7 and in my opinion is just about perfect for this rifle.

The P250¬Æ, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER¬Æ P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

It has a cross-bar safety, a 20"" Micro-Grooved barrel and the standard walnut stock. The only things wrong with this gun are that the folding leaf rear sight is broken off, and now there are a couple ugly but not fatal scratches on/near the sight from where I tried and failed to install a replacement (see photo). I figured out how to avoid scratching it again but not how to get that damn thing on without breaking it; then again the forums show me a lot of folks buy yourselves niftier sights or install a scope anyway, so instead of going through that again I'm just asking less than I'd planned. The rear folding leaf is $7.99 plus $7.95 S&H from Brownell's if you'd rather do that and can install it without breaking it, I do still have the little sight extender thing. 

I'll listen to suggestions about a partial trade, but as previously noted there's got to be enough cash involved. Sorry about that."

SIG SAUER INC                Ambidextrous    
Sig Sauer 9389BGAMBI P938 Ambi Single 9mm 3"" 6+1 Blackwood Grip 2Tone/Blk
The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 offers the
ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to
the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size
Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet
is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938
easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in
finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO
trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the
1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes.

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. I also sell the side plates which are 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500, if anything they're used as Target practice material only. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

New .50 caliber 8"" AR pistol built by R&J Firearms of McMinnville, Oregon. Features Oregon made billet upper and lower receivers, Lothar Walther 1/19 twist stainless barrel, free float hand guard, flip up iron sights, single point sling and 7 round single stack mag.
Ammo: These are chambered in 502 T-Sabre(not 50 Beo, 50AE or 500SW) We manufacture the ammunition and always have ammo available. 
**NOTE** Ammo sells and ships separately.
Ammo options: 300GR FTX 1750FPS $50/30 rounds, 325/350GR JHP 1650FPS $50/30 rounds, 350GR Dardas cast slugs 1900FPS $45/30 rounds.

 Benefits of our .50 cal AR pistol over other big bore handguns:

-Readily available parts. Our platform uses a majority of standard AR parts and internals. Repair/replacement and maintenance is a breeze.
-The optional free float quad(as equipped on this one) allows for unlimited options to be added.
-Slightly less recoil than big bore revolvers. Being an automatic helps reduce felt recoil but hey.....it's still a
.50 so it thumps a bit! That's why we include a single point bungee sling for stabilization and carry. (Will be FDE or black)
-Most flip up or tactical sights/optics compliment the gun well but we include iron flip up sights as standard! (styles installed may vary from pictures)
-Major stopping power! From bears to hogs to Buicks, the 502 T-Sabre will get the job done!
-Can be carried from the single point sling for quick access under a variety of mounted or on foot conditions.
-Ammo costs start at $1.67 a round. Much cheaper than many big bore ammos. We manufacture all the ammo and ALWAYS have ammo in stock!"

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. I also sell the side plates which are 6""x6"" and 6""x8""
Text Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five
I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. If anything AR500 is used as target practice material, I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

LaRue's web link:  http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-spr-m4-scope-mount-qd-lt-104
The Industry Standard.
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range.

About VFZ Mounts:
VFZ is a new theory in the concept of clamping accessories to MIL-STD-1913 rails. Instead of using a horizontal cross-bolt, the VFZ uses a vertical bolt that draws up a clamping foot against the lower angle of the rail, seating the mount similarly to a fully-closed LaRue lever.

Once installed on the firearm, index marks allow the user to remove the mount, then reattach to the same tension, providing unprecedented return to zero for a non-QD-levered mount. The unique vertical alignment of the clamp allows components that are structurally stronger than traditional cross-bolt designs.

These sell for over $200 new.  
Get this one for $145.  Never used, only mounted once."

I like these guns so it won't bother me to keep them, there's just something I want a little more.

 First up is my tricked out American Classic Commander. The fire control group has been polished and has one of the nicest feeling triggers I've ever shot. It has a ed brown full length guide rod also polished. The outside has been refinished in OD green and matte black teflon/moly gun kote and has houge grip pannels with a pearce wrap around. This gun feels amazing all around and looks and shoots just as good. Cash price is FIRM at $600 trade value may be slightly higher.

 Next is my Taurus stainless Circuit Judge. Yes it is a Taurus not a Rossi. It comes with everything it did from the factory except the box and papers. It is chambered for .410 shot shells or 45 long colt. Not much else to tell about this one. It's a used off the shelf gun that's a ton of fun to shoot. $500

Check out the MFG description below:
The Sako TRG-22 handles a multitude of accuracy tasks: it is a thoroughbred 300 m UIT standard competition rifle, a CISM competition winner and serves the governments of several nations as their primary sniper rifle. More importantly, the Sako TRG-22 was designed and built to be the most accurate field tactical rifle ever. 

Most will agree that it is. The relative light weight combined with the incredible long range accuracy puts this tactical rifle in a class of it‚Äôs own. So whether you‚Äôre a military sniper or a long range hunter, Sako TRG22 rifles deliver results that were never before possible. Expect all Sako TRG‚Äôs to function flawlessly in the harshest conditions and still group sub 1/2 MOA.

SAKO TRG-22 Characteristics
‚Ä¢ Sako TRG-22 calibers include .260 Remington and .308 Winchester
‚Ä¢Sako TRG rifles are built around a cold hammer forged action made from a special ultra hard steel for extra rigidity. Receivers are drilled and tapped for Picatinny rail. Additionally, an integral 17 mm axial scope mounting rail with integral recoil slots is milled into the top of the receiver for use with Sako rails and scope mounts.
‚Ä¢Sako TRG22 actions have a three locking lug bolt, with 60 degree opening angle for fast bolt throw. The Sako TRG-22 extractor and active ejector are the most reliable made. 
‚Ä¢The Sako TRG22 barrel is a cold hammer forged super target grade made especially for extreme long range shooting. The free floating barrel and action come standard with a phosphatized finish that is extremely durable and corrosion resistant. 
‚Ä¢Sako TRG22 rifles come equipped with fully adjustable, two stage target trigger units that feature a quick and reliable safety lever inside the trigger guard. The safety locks both the trigger mechanism and bolt handle, as well as blocks the firing pin. The trigger is adjustable in length as well as horizontal and vertical pitch. The entire trigger group can be changed without disassembling the rifle. 
‚Ä¢Sako TRG-22 magazines are detachable, center feeding two row staggered and feature buttons on both sides providing better grip for easy detaching. Sako TRG-22 magazine capacity is 10 rounds. 
‚Ä¢The Sako TRG-22 offers an aluminum reinforced composite stock designed for both right and left handed shooters. The rear stock is adjustable in height and cast, and features a cheek piece which can be adjusted laterally and with spacers vertically. The butt plate is adjustable for distance and angle through the use of spacers and is also infinitely adjustable in height and pitch.
‚Ä¢Sako TRG fore stocks features an integral slot for fast mounting and dismounting of the Sako TRG adjustable steel bipod. The Sako bipod is an integral part of the Sako TRG system and allows more accurate field shooting due to the low center of gravity provided by the bipod cradle. The fore stock also has a full length UIT rail on the bottom side.

Additional info and specifications:
The Springfield Armory¬Æ operator pistol was the first pistol offered by a major 1911 manufacturer having a light-mounting rail forged directly into the frame. While others have followed Springfield Armory's lead, they still offer the most comprehensive line of 1911 light-rail guns available.
The Standard Picatinny mounting platform readily accepts the most popular whitelight and laser illumination devices used by military spec-ops and law enforcement tactical teams. These fully-capable extreme-duty firearms are truly the best of the best.

New from SIG SAUER¬Æ, the P238 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that‚Äôs ideal for concealed carry. It‚Äôs just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE¬Æ Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P238 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

rail to accept many types of optics or iron sights. The soft rubber butt
pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and
includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and
stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily
disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when

included.
