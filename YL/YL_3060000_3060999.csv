The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington commercial chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability when using the high velocity 5.56x45mm NATO militaryammunition. It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when 
using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.

It is a pump action. Almost as fast to get multiple shots off as the semiauto versions, and is made on a real Milspec Ak receiver. Not a converted and chopped one like almost all semiauto imports are. Thus is is extremely accurate and reliable.

It is chambered in 5.56/223 and is flat shooting. I regularly shoot it at 475 yards with great success and occasionally out to 600. Same. Without the scope it makes a great self defense or plinking rifle. It always works because it is a pump. It is accurate because it is a pump. I have a custom ghost ring rear sight installed and it has about six inches longer sight radius than a regular AK. It is zeroed, and the front sight is fluorescent yellow. multiple front sights come with it too.

With either scope on it, it is a tack driver. Both scopes are mounted and zeroed on their own quick detachable rails. One is a vintage fixed 4 power Lyman All American. The rifle turned out to be so accurate that I installed a Leupold VariX-2  3-9x40 scope on a separate rail. It has been my go-to coyote rifle with that scope on it.

The rifle currently has a folding stock on it which is longer than the standard AK fixed stock. The fixed stock has the original buttplate under a one inch extended pad. No matter your size you should be able to fit this rifle to you. I prefer the folding stock because it gives proper eye relief with both of the scopes and the ghost ring. Your choice though.

There are also four Circle Ten 20 round magazines (highest quality) and the original two hunting magazines. The Circle Ten mags are about $30 apiece, and are fitted to this rifle perfectly. I have never had one single malfunction of any kind with it.

I probably have close to $1000 invested in this rifle, but my shooting and collecting tastes have changed.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and we can arrange to meet so you can see this. I think you will like it very much. If you are a too far away to come in person, I can ship to a New Mexico resident without using an FFL. I would need your driver's license. most people don't know that, so I just thought I would throw it out there. I can also ship out of state to you through an FFL. If you want to use a credit card, that can be arranged by using a discreet online payment. Shipping would be about $25.00.

Factory Part # 01969 Manufacturer:	CZ-USA|Dan Wesson --WE DO NOT CLEAN OFF PACKING OIL FOR OUR GUN PHOTOS, YOU WILL GET IT EXACTLY AS DAN WESSON SHIPPED IT. --Model #:	Dan Wesson ECO Type:	Semi-Automatic Pistol Finish: Matte Black Duty Finish Stock:	Slim Line DW Carry G10 Grips Sights:	Fixed Night Sights, Rear Tactical Ledge Sight Barrel Length:	3.5"" Ramped Bull Barrel with Target Crown Overall Length:	7.25"" Weight:	24.96 oz Caliber:	45AP Capacity:	7+1 Action:	Single Action # of Mags:	2 Packaging:	Plastic Case Receiver:	Anodized Aluminum Frame with Black Duty Finish	 Features:	Undercut Trigger Guard, 25 LPI Checkering Bottom Corner of Mainspring Housing Rounded. There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power. Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer. The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil. Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern. If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

I have for SALE a basically Brand New Arsenal SLR 107-31FR, I have everything that comes with the rifle new including manual, oil bottle, sling, cleaning kit, etc. I bought it brand new three weeks ago and fired it twice, once to zero and once to test accuracy.. Right on at 200 yards. It's cleaned up, ready to go. Bought as a gift for my brother but he picked up another 7.62 without me knowing. The rifle comes with everything new, a factory Arsenal 10 round magazine, and a steel surplus magazine. NO TRADES. FYI, The only thing worth mentioning is the folding stock does not stay latched completely when folded, it came like this from the factory and is common as I have had several other SLR models come this way."

These barrels are for those enthusiasts who don't care about how ""pretty"" their parts are and want to save some cash in the mean time. We sell so many parts that there are inevitably a few here and there that have some cosmetic blemishes ie. dings, dents, scratches, finish issues with phostphate or stainless barrels etc. There may be a slight rub on the threads. We test fit flash hiders to ensure they screw on properly and do NOT need to be rethreaded. There may be one or ten of any item. We have no way of knowning or predicting when these will be back in stock so get them while you can! As always, Thank You for your business.

BPS shotgun that looks like new.  It has a 28"" barrel fixed modified choke and the stock has no blemishes or scuff marks and show high gloss polish.  

BPS. A solid steel reputation for durability and dependability.
Few firearms ever earn the level of respect the Browning BPS boasts. The BPS has a solid reputation for long-lasting durability and an uncanny ability to keep on working in spite of what Mother Nature does to stop it. This shouldn’t come as a surprise because the BPS has what most other pump shotguns don’t — features like rigid dual machined steel action bars, a forged and machined steel receiver, a convenient top-tang safety and bottom ejection for ambidextrous operation, and legendary Browning balance and handling. That’s why the BPS continues to be the pump shotgun serious shotgunners like you can always rely on.

Ambidextrous. That is how many shooters describe the BPS. And it is true. But the advantages are more than just being a great shotgun for the left- OR right-handed shooter. The bottom ejection design and full, two-sided steel receiver combine for a level of durability and strength that is not common among pump action shotguns today. The design is totally balanced, with matching dual steel slide action bars -- one on each side -- that balance forces for very smooth pumping. Top tang safety is functional convenience to the max. The receiver forms a ""roof"" over the action-- there is no opening on either side for an ejection port, so a drenching rain won't drip into the action. When you shoot bottom ejection makes sure there are no empties flying to the side, across your line of sight,  to distract your aim. Those that shoot a BPS are a unique bunch . . . a bit more serious about their hunting guns than most? Yes!

Bottom Ejection and Loading
Bottom ejection throws empty shells straight down, out of the line of sight, and makes the BPS the ultimate pump for right- or left-handed shooters. Bottom loading provides operating convenience.

Reliable Pump-Action
The proven pump-action design of the BPS is sound and reliable. All components are durably constructed of solid steel and are housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. Rigid double slide bars are made from heat-treated steel and eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The result is smooth operation in all conditions and the ability to stay on target while delivering rapid follow-up shots. A convenient serrated slide release is located at the rear of the trigger guard.

Safety
The thumb-operated, top-tang safety on the BPS can be easily operated by right- and left-handed shooters alike, even with gloved fingers.

Magazine Capacity
2 3/4"": Four in magazine, one in chamber. 3"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. 3 1/2"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. A three-shot magazine adapter plug is included.

Back-Bored Barrels
12 and 20 gauge BPS shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.

The trigger was moved forward and replaced with US-made parts while the trigger holes were filled in using the ACE-pattern stock adapter. Parts used include:

-Tapco G2 double-hook fire control group
-Magnolia State Armory stock adapter, takes ACE pattern stocks and can be fitted with a folding mechanism 
-ACE LTD AKFX-E skeleton stock with 1"" thick recoil pad
-Tapco SAW grip

Comes with one factory five-round magazine and two AGP Arms 10-rounders along with  factory manuals and muzzle wrench. I also modified the manual bolt hold open to work with the conversion which allows for much easier reloads. The front rail is a simple affair I added years ago and is simply an optics rail section bolted to the stock handguard, but it's held up perfectly fine since 2006. The receiver around the magwell has been drilled and tapped for the use of a JT Engineering magwell, which is not included but is available for sale (along with modified mags) upon request.

Shotgun was function-checked prior to the posting of this ad with Federal bulk pack (2.75"" 12ga 3 dram eq, 1 1/8 oz #7.5 shot) and cycled fine.

Colin has been working with “black rifles” for over 16 years and has operational and instructor experience in the US, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. Colin has instructed various law enforcement agencies, military groups, and professional protection teams both here in the US and abroad. 

Colin’s instruction style brings his real world experiences to the students and teaches what works and leaves the theoretical stuff at the door. He is an instructor in a variety of fields and holds instructor certifications from Safariland, Colorado POST, USKMA, and other professional and private agencies and groups. When Colin is not “working” he thoroughly enjoys teaching and training others, he believes as an instructor it is his duty to share what he can with those who are willing to receive it. It is typically a rare event for private citizens to receive training from any of the Evo staff but Colin has gladly accepted the opportunity to work with Jim Roshan. 

Jim Roshan has been a concealed handgun permit holder for over 25 years. He hold most of the NRA firearms Instructor disciplines including several Law Enforcement Instructor Certifications. He is a Colorado POST Certified Law Enforcement Firearms Instructor. He also is a Licensed Training Provider for the American Red Cross. Safety Training Institute regularly holds several ARC First Aid and CPR classes too.

Being a full-time firearms and EMS instructor, Jim's ability to 'teach' you what you need to know is far superior to any other part-time instruction you can find. Being in Law Enforcement also adds a ton of value to his classes. You will learn how ""it"" needs to be done correctly!

So, if you have been putting off learning how to use your gun defensively NOW is your chance to finally check this off your list!

If you have any questions you can reach Jim at Jim (at) SafetyTrainingInstitute.us or call or text him at REDACTED

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Hey everyone,
I bought a big lot of 38spl reloads that priced really good so figured id see if any if y'all want some. They are all nickel cased and are 158 grain semi wadcutter lead nosed. These are fantastic for target shooting and getting used to your guns. The price per 50 is $17.50 if you just want them loose in bag. These aren't personal reloads and are all from Georgia arms. I would also consider trades for 45 ammo as well. Or even towards a derringer type pistol. These are pickup in Norman so if you are interested drop me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. I have 200 rounds currently available. But will probably be placing a few more orders as I try more of their calibers. 
Thanks all and happy shooting!"
