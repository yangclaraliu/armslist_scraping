I received the rifle as a complete barreled action and have since doctored it into a nice reliable rifle. The rifle has a Boyd’s laminate stock in pepper color and a Timney sportsman trigger set at approximately 2.5 lbs. 
The rifle is in fair condition. The bluing is worn and the extractor collar is just starting to get loose, but is still functional. The bluing on the bolt and extractor is almost completely gone. The bore is bright and in very good condition. 	
The front sight is a commercial dovetail ramp that was probably installed in the 1960s or 70s. The insert is a 1/16th inch bead. I have no idea what company made it. The receiver was drilled for Williams 5D and Lyman 57SME rear sights. I will include a completely functional Williams 5D rear sight, however I do not have the screw needed to install it. I don’t know how many rounds have been through it, I am not the original owner. Judging by the quality of the bore, the rifle has not been used extensively. I was able to get consistent groups of 1.5-2 MOA with 150gr Winchester PowerPoints. However, those groups where shot with a peep sight designed for hunting. I’m sure that with the right optic, a good shot who could spare the time to work up a handload for this rifle, would do much better.
The serial number is 1,082,XXX making it a “high number” 1903, thus safe to shoot.
I ship to FFLs but no CA. 
Feel free to email me with any questions you might have.

343,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3248343,For Sale:  The French Connection (or should I say COLLECTION.. ha),"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, July 11, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"As I near the end of the process of selling my lifelong military gun collection I struggled to decide whether to sell this immaculate group of French MAS rifles individually or as a group. So I just made up my mind to sell them as a single lot and see if there are any collectors in the area that would like to benefit from the time I spent searching for these.     

There isn't a MAS store out there, and it took me three years to find a perfect, unfired version of each of these 4 rifles. I even had a MAS 44 that was in superior shape although not unfired like these 4, however I sold it to a friend who made me an offer I couldn't refuse.     

So here is what I have:     

MAS Model 1936 - bolt action      

MAS Model 1936/51 - basically a later production & beefed version of the 1936 designed to launch Nato spec grenades     

MAS Model 1949 - this is a detachable clip fed semi-auto that replaced the 1944. It's a full length rifle     

MAS Model 1949/56 - replaced the 1949 and is a carbine length weapon based on the 1949 that's designed to launch Nato spec grenades     

All four rifles are in immaculate and unfired condition. There are a few handling marks but they are quite minor and barely perceptible. All fire the French 7.5 MAS round which is a high power rifle round that's on par with the 7.62 Nato cartridge.     

I have all the accessories that came with these rifles but just couldn't work them into the 3 pictures that Armslist allows. There are bayonets, pouches, cleaning kits, spare firing pins, night sights, slings, oilers, and manuals. Some of these accessories are still sealed in the poly bags that the arsenal used to ship them.     

I can take some additional pictures or arrange for a time for a serious buyer to come and inspect everything. NO window shoppers please.     

I'm asking $2500 for the lot of 4 rifles and that includes all their accessories.     

I'm not really looking for trades although I am planning to get much more into .22 shooting after I retire. So there are a few specific rifles I would take a hard look at if offered in trade:     

Beretta ARX .22     
ISSC MK22     
GSG STG44      
SIG 522     
UZI 22 carbine     
HK MP5 22     

I would also consider a GLOCK 34 as I've just about sold all of my military handguns and will be needing a new night stand pistol.     

These are all being sold FTF only with pickup in the Brandon FL area by a FL resident who is at least 18 years old.

I have a new box of 50 Rounds of .40 S&W Federal/American Eagle 165 Grain FMJ Ammunition. I have some Brand New X-Grip Magazine Adapters that allow you to use Full Size Magazines in the Subcompact Glocks and they look and function perfectly & you get 5-6 Extra Rounds of Magazine Capacity plus you get a Full 2 Handed Grip on the Gun with the larger clips in place- the adapters are compatible with Glock 26, 27, & 33 Pistols and Allow the use of Full Size Glock 17, 22, & 31 Magazines. The G17 9mm Mag adds 7 Rounds (17+1) & the Glock 22 & 31 (both 15+1) Magazines.
  If you're wondering why I would include the .40 S&W Ammo it's.because most .357 Sig Owners buy a .40 S&W Barrel since they are inexpensive and drop in easily and give you 2 Caliber Options and you.don't have to.worry about a thing because the only difference in the Glock 33 & Glock 27 Pistols are the Barrels and the G33 Says .357 on the Slide and Magazines and the Glock.27 says .40. on them. Both Guns have the exact same part numbers inside and all dimensions/specs are Identical so.for only $100 more you can have a Brand New Glock 27 .40 Caliber Barrel and it'll be great having 2 Awesome & Powerful Calibers to choose from.anytime and all I have to do is swap the Barrel which takes less than a minute and you'll have either the Glock Model 27 or 33 to choose from.and I know that most people use the .40 S&W Barrel & Ammo for Target Practice, fun at the Shooting Range, etc. and use the .357 Sig Barrel and Ammo to practice with occasionally and carry the Full Power .357 for personal protection, self defense, home defense, and some concealed carry a few days per week.You need nothing but the New Glock 27  Barrel from Lone Wolf Distributors and that is all, you don't need new magazines/clips or anything else and the Glock Pistol will function 100% Perfectly in Every Possible Way.with either barrel. This is a nice, complete package and you have everything to get started. I have 2 of these Guns and only need one so I am selling the New Glock 33 Gen4 .357 Sig Pistol that I recently purchased. The Gun itself and all extra accessories, etc. are New as well-I paid $643 for the Gun and over $150 on the extra stuff.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

However the function of the firearm is in great shape. The cylinder locks up tight, no pitting in the barrel and the trigger pulls both double action and single action the way one would expect. All serial numbers match the firearm; I do not know much about its story as it was purchased from an estate sale.

I have not fired this weapon, so I cannot attest to how it shoots, albeit from what I can tell - if you have some of the rare 32-20 ammo lying around I'm sure this near-100 year old firearm will shoot as the timing is in sync. These weapons were used heavily by law enforcement during prohibition era; it was also the weapon of choice by Al Capone and the Hong Kong Police Department.

I'm open to trade for more modern firearms - partial trades for .40 and .556(.223) are welcome as well. This would be a nice addition to a collectors group; after some refinishing work. Serial number is 140xxx putting it in the 1916 production year per my research http://proofhouse.com/colt/index.html. As always, you must provide your LTCH Indiana drivers license to purchase this firearm. Asking $450 OBO"

This rifle is very nice and I've made numerous upgrades and improvements.  One such improvement was a brand new DRD hammer forged chrome lined barrel that I replaced the original barrel with in early June.  This was poor timing on my part as it was just weeks before I learned of and finalized plans for my upcoming move.  In any event, the rifle has been taken to the range twice since installing this new barrel with roughly 100-200 rounds having been fired.  A hard case is also included with the purchase of this rifle.

Other upgrades include the Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul Pro Sights, a Fortis compensator/muzzle brake, and a Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced Flat two-stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and a crisp 1.5 lb. second stage (Note that the Geissele trigger is not pictured as it was just installed and the trigger shown in the pictures is a Timney).  The rifle originally came with a shorter 13"" rail, but I had this replaced with a new MI Gen 2 quad rail when the new barrel was recently installed.  In addition to these upgrades that greatly improve the function, accuracy, and aesthetic of the rifle, a Weaver 1-5x tactical scope with offset mount and a Sight Docter mini red-dot sight is also included.  Another nice feature is the upgraded BCG which is a Titanium Boron (TiN) Bolt Carrier Group.  You can see the gold coloring of this BCG in the photos and in addition to improving the look, this bcg is very tough due to this coating, quite easy to clean and maintain, and functions flawlessly. 

The rifle cost me just over $1600 new last fall and the value of the aforementioned upgrades has been well over $1,000.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!"

As some of you are probably well aware, most gun experts have definitively stated that the S&W 3913/3914 family of lightweight compact pistols are probably the best 9mm pistols one can use for CCW.

These pistols are accurate and super reliable. Easily as reliable as a Glock .

The 3913 is the most commonly seen version, and is available in LS, NL, and TSW configurations. The 3914 is the black version most popular with LE, and many who have owned both have stated that the trigger on the 3914 is smoother and accuracy was better. The 908 was the economy version that was released a few years later and not up to the same standards. Thus, the 3914 is the best 9mm pistol S&W has ever made or ever will make. These early pistols have no lock and no MIM parts. You cannot find a better 9mm CCW pistol anywhere.

This pistols has an alloy frame which can withstand +P ammo. This weighs only 24 oz. 8+1 capacity. DA/SA with ambi decocker. Shaved hammer is flush with the slide. Mine has holster wear on the edge of the slide by the barrel and the edge of the trigger guard, primarily left side. Match grade accuracy that is more narrow than a 1911. As you can see in the pics this gun was carried often and shot little. One of the last all metal autos that S&W produced.

The MK 116 is a very nice piston driven system chambered in .223 Wylde and using the PWS proprietary piston design.  This rifle has a 16"" barrel, a 13.5"" PWS keymod rail system, and the rifle weighs less than 7 lbs.  As noted in the title, one of the key upgrades is the Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced two stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and then a crisp 1 lb. second stage.  In addition to the trigger upgrade, I've added 45 degree rapid transition backup sights, a competition muzzle brake/compensator that significantly reduces muzzle rise and allows the shooter to take full advantage of the trigger for accurate rapid fire and follow-on shooting, and a 1-5x tactical scope and offset mount.  

I'm the original owner of this rifle, which was purchased in November of last year.  I've shot the rifle a few times but it has had no abuse and I estimate the number of rounds fired would be no more than 500 rounds.  In addition to the items discussed above, a Drago rifle case is also included with your purchase.

Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for looking."

Condition: I'd conservatively rate the finish at 90%+.  The frame-rails are in excellent shape, and the Nitron finish is barely worn at all.  The only visible marks are on the front strap of the grip, and are small.

Sights:  Sig-Lite green night sights -- glowing well and very visible

This pistol comes with one factory magazine.

Pricing:  $440 + $20 FFL Fee.  I searched gunbroker and online retailers to get an estimate of value.  The lowest price I could find was $450, after shipping/transfer, and that was for a police trade-in with no guarantee of functioning night sights, and unknown frame-rail wear/tear.  Brick/mortar shops priced this pistol at $600+ retail, but obviously no educated buyer would pay that.  I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline trade-offers and negotiations below my asking price.

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."
