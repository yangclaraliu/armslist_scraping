The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

Second:
I know a lot of firearms on this sight are ""LNIB used"" and people want more than what I can buy it new for.  And a lot of people put ""trade value"" above what they're asking over retail.  And for some reason, people want to ask if it's ""still available"" to which I will reply ""yes"" and then no response.  Are you just curious?
With all that being said, I've got this priced at an outstanding price, well below what you'd probably be able to buy it with  your ""connections"", as far as trades go, I may be interested but you must not put you're value at or above what I can buy it new for, as far as if it's still available:  It is if you can contact me via this post.  You're welcome for saving us both time!!  I am located in Springboro, and will not travel far, if you're not sure, and you are reading this post, you probably have internet access to mapquest my location.  You're welcome for saving us both time. And I may be able to add extras for the right deal

This model is NEW for 2014!

The 686 Combat Magnum. Smith and Wesson’s 686 Plus is the perfect all around revolver. Chambered in .357 Magnum the Model 686 also gives you the versatility to shoot .38 special loads without any changes to the gun. The Plus in the name is to indicate a seven round capacity as opposed to the traditional six shot.

 The frame is the ideal size to allow for full grip grip control of the gun, while still decreasing felt recoil. The Smith & Wesson 686 Plus has a smooth trigger with superior balance. The three inch barrel allows for solid accuracy, making it an excellent self- defense handgun for either concealed carry or home defense applications. The fit and finish on the Smith & Wesson 686 are second to none.

Performance Center guns originate from standard designs or are created from the ground up. From hand-cutting and fitting to fine tuning for precision, these firearms are top performers. Products from the Performance Center are the ultimate expression of old-world craftsmanship blended with modern technology. These models come with the Performance Center’s Unfluted Cylinder, Chrome Teardrop Hammer, Cylinder Cut for Moonclips and PC Tuned Action.

You can’t build an effective and correct handgun without first knowing and talking to the actual shooter. That has always been a Smith & Wesson trademark…we listen. Smith & Wesson, the first and most respected manufacturer for womens’ handguns has designed LadySmith™ small frame revolvers because we believe that women should have the power to defend themselves…and that power is best found in a Smith & Wesson.

The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads. Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

Henry H001TM Lever-Action .22 Mag Rifle with 20″ Octagon Barrel, Walnut Stock, 11+1 Capacity

Like stagecoaches, swinging saloon doors and Pony Express riders, there are many innovations of the Old West that have long faded from use and live on only in Western movies and history books.

But there are still a few frontier staples that were so effective and ahead of their time that they remain in use today. Take, for instance, the intimidating octagonal barrels commonly found on the repeating rifles of that period. These heavy-duty workhorses sported added mass and extra weight to aid in heat absorption, making them the forerunners to the bull barrels used on modern target and varmint rifles.

So as a tip of our Stetson in honor of this timeless barrel style, we replaced the standard round barrel normally used on our world-famous .22 LR and .22 Magnum rifles with a classic 20″ octagonal model, like those favored by the cowpunchers, lawmen, homesteaders and outlaws who blazed the trail westward across America. We rounded out this traditional look with an easy-to-adjust Marbles semi-buckhorn rear sight with a diamond insert and a highly visible brass beaded front sight seated in standard 3/8″ dovetail slots. A metal barrel band secures both the barrel and the high-capacity tubular magazine to the highgrade American walnut stock.

(My apologies for the confusion in my earlier listing... learn something new everyday. Especially when it comes to arms.)

The rifle has a vented, two-piece wooden hand-guard/gas tube cover and a skeleton wooden thumb-hole stock. The hand-guard and gas tube cover are almost identical in appearance with the stock made from marine-ply wood.

The riffle is very clean and extremely accurate out to at least 600 yds. ( I didn't have a reason to ever test her limits beyond 800.) For precision shooting, specifically designed sniper cartridges should be used beyond 800 yds.

The riffle is being sold with an IR/Night Vision Scope. The Scope mount  is not included as it was sold separately with another riffle but a new one can be picked up for around $45. I would suggest the side rail configuration as it does not block the view of the sight line and allows the iron sites to remain adjustable even when a scope is mounted.

The four spare magazines are in excellent shape, as is the nylon sling and accessory/maintenance kit for the IR/Night scope.

Serious inquiries only and I would prefer to sell in state. If an FFL is needed than buyer will pay shipping and FFL fees. Thanks for looking"

$325 is one heck of a deal for a brand new shotgun.  For this price I'm saving you anywhere from $50 to $100.

 Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

 Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

 Key Features:
 Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable 
 Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
 SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
 Our softest-shooting pump gun ever 
 Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
 Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
 Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
 28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes 
 Sling swivel studs built-in 
 Includes Modified Rem Choke

 I listed this before, but lowered the price a little. Did some research and I was about a hundred bucks high. Heres all the stuff I have for sale. It's a blast to shoot, but as you can tell by the stockpile of ammo, I just don't shoot it enough. Plus I sold my press so I cant reload for it anymore which makes it expensive. I also have a few hundred pieces of 45lc/ 454 starline brass, but its back in Clovis so I would have to go pick it up sometime down the road.
 I would be interested in partial trades as well. See below

This thing is a beauty, and I'm sorry to see it go, but bills never stop. It has had exactly three owners in my firearms group since it was imported by CAI, and it has only been fired once, to test the cycling of the bolt.


Includes:

   -Mosin PU Sniper Rifle
   -Cleaning Kit
   -Sling w/ 'Dog Collars'
   -Ammo Pouches(3)




The picture is slightly misleading because of the direction of the lighting(and the poor quality of the camera); the rifle has a very odd finish in that it is non-reflective. I am told by fellow Mosin collectors it was made this way for snipers, so they would not be betrayed by a shiny rifle at night. As it is, the finish is extremely smooth to the touch, and very pretty. I have never seen any sniper have this finish before, nor any standard Mosin.


   I have yet to shoot this rifle, but the scope looks fairly easy to use, and the bolt cycles nicely. There is no rust I have found yet, but I have not taken it apart for a full cleaning yet.


Feel free to contact me anytime for more information. The price is firm. I also have several standard Mosin 91/30's, all in 'Excellent' Condition, if you prefer a battle rifle to a full-blown sniper.

1896 - KRAG JORGESEN (30-40) A distinctive feature of the Krag-Jørgensen action was its magazine. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag-Jørgensen was integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, single cartridges were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.

""Almost"" BNIB, but BETTER it has been nicely upgraded. No quad-rails filled with flash lights, and other tactical gadgetry here. Just a nice simple shooter. Gun retails new for $869.99.

I have a M&P 15 Carbine in 5.56, 16"" barrel 1/8 5R twist. This specific rifle also has an M4 feed ramp which you wont find in other ""Money Saver"" A4 style AR rifles. Yet this is a true A4 upper.

MODS:
It has a Hogue grip, a Yankee Hill Front gas block with a flip up front sight so you dont have the A2 front sight post (when using optics), and a Matech rear Mil spec peep sight, plus 7 mags.

There are a few folgers cans worth of wheel weights that need rendered but most is already done for you. Included in this price is 16lbs of Antimony for alloying. While you can't melt it, it does actually dissolve in lead so you just have to stir it into the pot in the right percentage and you'll harden up the alloy quickly.

I also have 2 extra firing pins.  You can no longer find them. So they are now rare unless you find someone disassembling rifles to sell for parts.  Before you contact me check current 8mm ammo prices.  I checked today and its either at or over .50 cents a round for any quantity of ammo. I dont care what ammo went for 20 years ago.  Im already selling the ammo and gun under its value because its taking up space.  I would consider an offer for all the ammo but I won't sell small quantities.

When I purchased the rifle, it was in a sporter stock, but fortunately was not drilled or tap, had original sights, and not aftermarket rear sight sights on receiver or barrel. So with exception of the stock and hand-guard and various pieces of metal, it was a mil spec rifle. This was not a reclaimed drill rifle.  

Remington manufactured rifle January 1943 most major parts are Remington. Here is a list as far as I can tell. 

Remington parts include(""R"" marked):
Receiver
Original matching barrel
Trigger guard/mag box
Floorplate
Mag spring
Upper band/bayonet lug
Front sight blade
Buttplate (NOS)
Extractor
Ejector
Magazine cutoff 

Known Smith Corona parts:
Bolt body and I believe the whole assembly (smith corona mark with an 'x', but did not mark a lot of their parts)

Other manufacturers:
Lower band
Buttstock swivel mount
All 3 swivels
Swivel and band screws

Unknown:
Rear sight(have not removed to look for the marks, so as not to mess with adjustment)

Stock is a WW2 original stock with FJA and (P) proofs still visible. Hand-guard is NOS (new, old stock)

I have taken pictures of known marks, and can email or text them to you. Text being preferred, as yahoo mail does not like my iPhone and I can't always tell if an email sent or not. So please, text if interested 501-240-238four. 

Price is $1000 cash(may be able to come down a little for a quick sale) or trade. I'll take certain trade plus cash, but don't have cash to add to trades. I just bought a house and am looking to free up some money, but realize not everyone has this kind of cash laying around. At $1000 I have 60rds commercial ammo and some stripper clips I will give you."

The ruger has its own post and description.
Other items include: 

-50 round sks Magazine (Needs a new internal spring)
-AK47 bayonet 
-Bent bolt for a Mosin nagant (bolt WILL NOT clear a scope) 
-Mosin nagant dillling & tapping set (missing scope mount includes a bent bolt to replace your straight bolt)

-AR carbine foregrips
-Ipod touch 4gen 16g
-10 ronds  of PDX1 defense .410 shells (out of box)

I know this is an odd mix of miscellaneous items, but they are things I no longer need. One man's junk is another mans treasure.

my ideal trade would be for a smaller pocket pistol that is no smaller than .380. the Ruger 22 pistol would be the main trade item, and the other items would make up any differences.
