This rifle is 100% BRAND NEW and unfired. It was built using top quality parts, properly assembled according to Mil/Manufacture's specs, and it was finished off in a Tungsten Cerakote job by Andro Corp. Since this rifle is brand new I am looking for a Legion in similar condition, if not new then with a VERY low round count, but cosmetically like new. I've been sitting on this rifle for over a year and when I originally started collecting everything for the build it was a seller's market, so unfortunately for me I paid a premium for a lot of the parts. Let's just say I have well over $1800 into this build before having it Cerakoted so this is easily a $2000 rifle if you wanted to build it again today, but finding an original AXTS lower might prove to be a little difficult. That being said I would sell this outright for (was $1600) now $1375 shipped to your FFL, preferably paid with a USPS MO.  Rifle will ship to your FFL once money order(s) have been cashed/cleared to confrm authenticity. I am open to other trade offers but my goal is to get the Legion 10mm so any other trades would have to be mostly cash and closer to my build value because I would just be reselling any trade items in order to get the 10mm, but feel free to shoot me an offer if you've got something in mind.  For this one I'm not looking for any types of ARs/rifles or shotguns, mainly just the few trades mentioned below.--- Here is the complete build list but if I'm forgetting anything just shoot me an email and I can fill in the details. Lower Parts:•AXTS AX556 Full-Ambi Billet Lower Receiver - Cerakoted in Tungsten •P.O.F. Patriot Ordnance Factory 3.5lb Flat Drop-in Trigger •B.A.D.A.S.S. Battle Arms Development 45° Ambi Safety with Long/Short Lightweight Levers (I had to buy 2 sets of B.A.D. safeties in order to get the lightweight levers with a 45° short throw because B.A.D. lightweight safeties only come with a standard 90° throw.  It was worth it because it shaved about 0.0002 grams off the total weight, each!)•MFT Minimialist Stock Mil-Spec •Spikes Tactical Mil-Spec Buffer Tube •Spikes Tactical Buffer Spring •Spikes Tactical ST-2 Buffer •Hogue Finger Groove Beavertail Grip ---Upper Parts:•Spikes Tactical Billet Upper Receiver Gen 2 - Cerakoted in Tungsten •SLR Ion Ultra Lite 13.5"" Mlok Handguard - Cerakoted in Tungsten •BCM BFH ELW 16"" Mid-Length 5.56 NATO Barrel (Cold Hammer Forged, 1/7 Twist Rate, Enhanced Lightweight Profile, 0.625"") •BCM Low Profile Gas Block (steel with set screws) .625""•BCM Compensator MOD 0 •Spikes Tactical Melonite Mid-Length Gas Tube •AXTS Nitride BCG •AXTS/Ranier Raptor Charging Handle •AXTS Titanium Forward Assist •Strike Industries Enhanced Ejection Port Dust Cover --- Extras:•PMAG M3 30rd mag -------------------------------------------------------Upper, Lower, and Handguard were Cerakoted in Tungsten by Jason at Andro Corp. All parts are 100% brand new and unfired (aside from any factory testing).  The only thing missing are some sights or an optic, other than that this thing is ready to go!  The rifle was assembled, cerakoted, and has been sitting in the safe ever since, so it needs someone to give it a good home.My FS price includes free shipping to your FFL, but if we are trading then we will each pay our own shipping and FFL fees.  Please let me know if you have any questions or want some more pics, and thanks for looking!"

Hopkins and Allen were in business from 1896 to 1915. This shotgun is marked ""Hopkins & Allen Arms Company Norwich Conn USA"" which puts it after 1898, and it has a 4 digit serial number, 6687, which puts it probably before 1910. The stock is nice hardwood with a 4 digit number (not matching), refinished with what appears to be poly.The barrel is marked ""Full Choked"" on top of it, and its a liquid steel barrel (i.e. not weak thin Damascus).  Not very many of those in a functioning condition out there... There's some pitting on the buttplate and some dings here and there but other than that its pretty decent, no rust on barrel or receiver. At some point in its life it was refinished but there is still some brown patina on it.Cheap simple shotgun. 16 GA = power of a 12GA with a kick of a 20GA. Additional pics on request. Asking $120. Willing to ship to your FFL.Took it out to the farm to test fire. The gun shoots and extracts the cartrige without any issues. The kick is VERY tame. This would make a great ""throw it in the truck"" shotgun for ""just in case""."

There are two parts to the TTI – an outer dark circle and an inner light circle. As long as the inner circle is still lighter than the outside circle, the MREs are good.  Shown here is a picture of the actual TTI from one of the cases (and they all look like this).  As you can see, the center is much lighter than the Reference Ring, indicating that these case still have a lot of life left in them.  $55 per case or only $50 per case if you buy two or more cases.THESE ARE LEGAL TO OWN, so please don't be an internet lawyer and try to enforce a law that doesn't exist."

There may or may not be some thinning on one spot on the cylinder, you cannot see it with the naked eye but when you shine a very bright light on it you can see something.I don't know if they are all like that or not.  You decide.I got it in a trade so I don't know anything of its history, who ever owned it originally took very good care of it. No box or papers other wise it would be considerably higher.I did a broad advanced search of the realistic retail market for this pistol and its selling price based on condition, finish etc.  You could probably call it 98%.  I want to sell it not try and put my kid through college with it.  I will let the market decide, if I am off the mark on pricing I will lower it accordingly.I will leave it up a couple of days here and if it doesn't move, its off to Gunbroker.This will be a FFL transfer that I will pay for.I will send out more and higher resolution pix to anyone that is interested.Leave a local number if you want to see it in person.Unfortunately there a ton of fake Colt ads on here and the Armslist community does a pretty good job of cleaning them up.  This one is not fake.  I will meet up at any local police precinct for a hands on inspection.Thanks."
