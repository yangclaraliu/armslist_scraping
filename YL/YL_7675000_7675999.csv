Along with that is an AR-7 Industries skeleton stock and a lightweight barrel with a shroud permanently mounted. Along with the 8 shot standard mag that fits in the buttstock, you get a 15 round hicap and then a brand new set of riser scope rings (new so the inside lining is new) So you get 1 receiver but enough parts to make 2 very different rifles. The skeleton stock and light barrel adds up to a complete rifle weighing 2 pounds 7 ounces!(see photo of scale) Sure to draw attention at the range, and when you go camping or way out in the woods or fishing, take the original floating version with the entire rifle stored inside the plastic stock. The used rifles by themselves go for $150 to $170 or so but there is another $100 at least in extras. At AR-7 Industries, the skeleton stock is $42 and an extra barrel with shroud is $85 and the 15 round mag is $38. Thats $165 plus shipping to get what you will receive along with a complete AR-7 rifle. Now add in a new set of machined black scope rings with a 1 inch rise. Theres another $15. This rifle set is priced a lot less as it is not brand new, though the skeleton stock could be. The shroud on the extra barrel has several tiny spots and nicks that have been touched up over the years. Both bores are pristine perfect. I have 4 AR-7s and a box of mags and I will say that the 25 round plastic ""banana"" mags are great! These extended metal ones can need ""fine tuning"" for each specific gun to fit and feed 100%. Mostly the follower angle and sometimes the feed lips need a tweak. Thats the same as when you buy a brand new mag as I have bought many new that needed adjustments with some rifles but not others. This is a great package for the hunter/fisher outdoors type or a perfect beginner rifle for new shooters. The extra parts make it very cool beyond what a boring plain 22 rifle would be. SUPER Lightweight! HOLIDAY GIFT!! SHIPPING-- Ships either Ground Fedex or USPS for a flat $27.00 Depending on your location, it may be less and I will refund the overage if it is more than a couple of dollars."

I initially listed this as “Preban”, but got jumped on by all you experts.  I am fully aware that there is no longer any ban. Some of you experts say our weapons are Preban, ban, or post ban. I was simply going by your own “knowledge”. I also know that it does not have a bayonet lug. However, according to the Polytech serial number database , my 145XX serial number Polytech was manufactured in 1993. The ban was passed 52-48 on September 13, 1994 for s 10 year period. According to my understanding of the definition of “pre” , does that not make mine a Preban???"

The Walther PPQ M1 is great for self defense and target training at the range. The M1 features a European style ambidextrous magazine paddle release. The PPQ M1 is the result of an updated and improved Walther P99 which predated the PPQ by 15 years. The PPQ M1 debuted back in 2011 and was an enhanced version of the P99 RAD for the Polish Military. The Walther PPQ features ambidextrous slide release levers that are low profile and easy to manipulate in either hand. The PPQ features the QDT trigger or (Quick Defense Trigger) which basically means that the trigger system includes a safety tang in the middle of the trigger so that if you don't position your finger properly on the trigger the gun will not fire, nor will it fire if it is dropped. If you are in the market for a high quality, fully featured handgun with fantastic ergonomics and an exceptional trigger, then look no further than the Walther PPQ M1 9mm.""$475 OBO.

These two items are must haves for if you are a cop and intend to use this on duty.Here's the product description from Springfield-
The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™."
