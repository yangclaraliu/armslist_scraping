Short Reset Trigger The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.

Snag Free Sights The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight.
Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.
Mould-Tru Backstraps With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.
Slim Contour Frame The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.
Sure Grasp Slide Serrations The serrations on the XD-S™ not only make this firearm more attractive, they are functional. The slightly rounded design, extending to the top of the slide, limits the possibility of a snag when drawing the pistol."

This is for a dutch Beaumont Vitali 1876 model 71/88.  It is an early cartridge rifle with a bolt action and a fixed magazine.  it holds 4+1 with a magazine inhibitor switch.  it is an 11x52 cartridge that can be made from a sharps 50-90 shell and a 45/70 projectile.  Any knowledgeable reloader should be able to remake this cartridge with a little practice (i may even be persuaded for a nominal compensation). Evey thing is in working order. It is missing the cleaning rod like most beaumonts, and i am looking into getting one made.  A little patina on the metal, but not much.  All numbers are matching for parts.  No excessive wear on the stock either. Nice wall hanger, and im confident it'll make a nice shooter as well.  Any questions, call mike 541-513-nine nine zero one. (don't want to be called daily by a pharmacy in india).  Antique rifle also means no transfer fees or reg. 
Im open for trades for other guns as well.  If i end up getting the cleaning rod made, the price will go up, this is for the gun as is in good working order."

The picture shows a separate set of grips I bought for it that are a little larger than the stock wood grips and really make the gun fit perfect in your hands.  I can include these or remove them and put the old grips on.  I also bought a leather DeSantis holster direct from S &W that includes a stamped S & W logo.  This is optional as well.  In addition, I have 385 loose rounds of .38 special ammo (Winchester WB brand) inside of a plastic ammo can.  All items are new or in like new condition (treated well and cleaned after each use).  Below are my asking prices:

S & W model 60 in factory configuration with original case/papers (no extras):  675.00
Altamont OS Walnut Combat Grips with medallions:  60.00
DeSantis OWB holster with S & W logo:  65.00
385 loose .38 special rounds in plastic ammo can:  154.00 (priced at .40/round)

Total Price:  954.00

For a discounted price for buying the bundle (all the above):  885.00 OBO

This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

The stock is in Fine condition overall with a couple of gouges, nicks, and dings, from many years of military storage.  No chips, cracks, or repairs.

Bought the gun last fall after getting my CCW so I have owned it less than a year. Have carried it ever since and will continue to carry it till someone wants to look at it. Since I have carried it there is slight wear marks on the tip of the gun from holstering but its honestly barely noticeable. Shot about 150 rounds through it since buying it and has just been a daily carry ever since. Looking to buy a Glock 17 and decided to get rid of this before I buy a new gun. Been a great gun, shoots straight and never had a jam in the short 150 rounds I put through it. Cleaned regularly, If I had the money to keep the gun and buy a new I wouldn't be selling it. Asking $450 obo with everything included. I will turn around and walk away with out even saying a word on low ball offers so don't even waist my time. Willing to travel to show the gun but not too far would be best to meet in wauseon. Would only consider trades on a Glock 17 Gen 3 or Gen 4, I don't have an interest in anything else. 

Large public area meetings only during daylight hours. Walmart or large shopping center parking lots preferred. I will NOT bring the gun to your house. If you would like more pics just ask, I can only upload 3 low quality pics but took 6 pics and can have more too you if you ask"

It has two barrels that go with it, the stock 28"" vent rib, and a 20"" (?) rifled slug barrel with iron sights. It comes in the box with the lock and the spacer used to hunt deer, doves, etc. The shotgun was really well taken care of and it is rust free. I bought it when it was new and I have had it since. It was recently taken to a professional gunsmith and was seen to be free of any issues. I am selling because I have lost interest in it and have vehicle expenses to take care of. This was my first firearm and I don't really want to get rid of it so please don't low ball me. It's a nice firearm and should easily bring $250. Thank you for looking and have a nice day.

This gun comes factory backbored and has the forcing cones lengthened to give a great shot pattern and very little kick. All the internals have a Nickle-Teflon coating for smooth and reliable operation. It had a target style wide rib with white front bead and a gold mid bead. 
Takes Remington pro-bore chokes which are made by Briley. It comes with 5 extended chokes in skeet-improved cylinder-light modified-modified-full. Has beautiful walnut wood.
This is a target gun and only shoots 2 3/4"" target and field loads. I reload my own shells and this Remington will kick out even the lightest loads and no kick what so ever. I have more pics on request since I can only upload a couple here.
