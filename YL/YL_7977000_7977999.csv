Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact.

The scope is Mil/Mil with 20* mount, Vortex level and scope caps.  A pivot adjustable bipod and VooDoo Tactical cheek rest were also added. The rifle shoots amazing and is the best I have ever owned.  The glass is fantastic and if you have never used this type of reticle you won't go back to traditional once you do.  The attached group of 4 shots was from 300 yards.  No, I didn't drop one, it is a 4 shot magazine, and I repeated similar groupings on multiple outings.  These were with my developed handloads and practice, your mileage may vary.  I simply do not have time to commit to precision shooting anymore and am parting ways.  I also have reloading components that can go seperately if desired."

The Feather Trigger is simple, and simply the best, allowing no trigger creep, travel or take-up. This single feature alone can make all the difference in putting meat in your freezer this year. Selecting this model of Browning X-Bolt sets you apart from the crowd. At first, this and a few other Browning rifles may not resemble the Browning rifles we have all come to know: High gloss finishes, deluxe wood, deep blueing, fine fitting parts and well-made designs. This rifle looks differently, but there is no difference in its lineage or its features or performance. Try it out. It is a Browning through and through, and always, the Best There Is."
