Description: 	
The X-Bolt Eclipse Hunter features a beautiful laminated stock that offers extra stability, a Monte Carlo cheekpiece for improved eye-to-scope alignment and a thumbhole grip for more consistent finger-to-trigger reach. These few changes result in elevated accuracy potential both in the field and from the bench, without adding significant weight.


• Beautiful wood Laminate stock  with thumbhole grip provides durability and a solid, rigid platform for the glass bedded action and stock.
• Monte Carlo cheek piece improves eye-to-scope alignment.
• Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
• Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
• The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
• Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
• Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
• Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
• 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
• Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
• Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh and hard to find Ruger 10/22 50th Anniversary Design Contest .22lr rifles!  For the past 50 years, Ruger‘s 10/22 has been the gold standard for .22 LR rimfire rifles. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 10/22, Ruger held a contest and asked shooters to send in their customized 10/22 rifle design. The company received nearly 1,000 submissions and eventually selected 10 finalists, asking the public to vote on their favorite design.  This awesome new rifle is the result of that design contest.


I only have two in stock, and have them priced to sell for just $309.00 each.

This gun looks and breaks down just like any Glock pistol. The main thing people hate about them (including myself) is the trigger. I fixed that with a brand new Apex trigger kit. Used this as a ""nightstand"" gun for the last year or so, never carried. The gun is in flawless condition and with the Apex trigger, shoots like a dream. Its had 90 flawless rounds down the pipe, and still looks brand new inside and out. Im only getting rid of this to upgrade to a .45 for my nightstand gun and keep continuity with my mags (M&P). Gun is VERY lightweight and would also make a great carry piece (the size of a Glock 19). 

Includes the following:

- SD9VE 
- (2) 15rd Mags
- Installed Apex Trigger kit ($125)
- Factory trigger and springs
- UTG Tactical quick detach 220 lumen LED weapons mount light
- Factory box with spent casing and all other paperwork and lock.

Will consider a M&P .45/9mm, or Smith & Wesson Shield in 9mm/.40 as a trade. Depending on what you have, I can add cash/ammo to even out the trade. I also have a holster I can throw in. Throw me an offer, all I can say is no."

I will not respond to those that I cannot verify as legitimate, since the scammers would just change their ways. Armslist needs to tighten up their listings by verifying and registering their members so this can at least slow down. This scamming is bad for legitimate sellers, because I no longer do anything but face to face deals. I know Armslist suggests that, but for collectors there just may not be enough desired weapons within driving distance.

That is why it has a NH trigger. 

There is no build sheet on the gun. It has a warranty through the shop that facilitated the transaction between Robert and my self (Larry, the owner, Covert Tactical Resources in Mo). Unfortunately since the gun was built ""off the clock"", Wilson does not have a log of the serial number as a completed gun.

If you have a gun and a 1"" scope, this mount is all you need to put the two together, no additional bases/screws necessary!  Note:  As you can see in the pictures, there is a small amount of metal removed and refinished with Birchwood Casey Aluminum Black.  This was done in order to allow clearance for the erector spring retainer on one of my scopes.  In no way does this modification affect the structural integrity of the mounting base, and the mount/scope combination has stood up to over 150 rounds of 7mm Magnum with no loss of strength or zero!  The refinish is hardly noticeable with a scope mounted.  Also: All fasteners used in mounting the base are present and accounted for!  Thank you for looking!"

It has anew Trijicon Tri Power sitting on top of a new LaRue LT150 Tactical QR mount. The Chevron co witness the front sight post perfectly. The weapon light is a Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens light. Elzetta calls this light the scorcher when you see it on you will know why. If you get hit with it at night you can forget about seeing for 20min. Its even disorienting during the day time. The best part of this rifle is the Aimshot LS8300 try to find one of these. They are only sold to SOCOM and other elite SOF and no longer even sold to Law Enforcement Agency's. Call Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify this. When you see this laser running during the day you will know why and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Yes it will light a match. Was sent back to me from a friend who is a SFO in Afghanistan. I was totally amazed when I saw it on for the first time. It comes with two different tail caps and the zero tool. Once zeroed its good for ever. This is not one of the lasers you see on here now they are all junk compared to this one! Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking.

It's a nearly new FN FNS9.  This pistol already has night sights on it from the factory, making it a perfect candidate for your CCW gun.  

The FNS, in case you dont know, is FN's version of a striker fired pistol.  It's not like the FNX or FNP from their past models with an external hammer and a heavy DA first trigger pull then a lighter SA trigger pull thereafter.  The trigger system on this pistol is more like a Glock or an M&P where every trigger pull is the same weight every time.  

This is the more desirable model with NO external safety lever.  The gun will come in the factory case with three 17rd magazines.  This pistol has been fired 100 times and has been flawless with each trigger pull.  I qualified with it to carry off duty and trust my life and my families life to it.  

With the pistol I'll also include two additional 17rd magazines in the factory box (each loaded and used one time) as well as a quality kydex holster meant for 1.5"" belts.  The holster is an approximately $70 value and the spare mags are $35ea if you were to purchase them on your own.  

I'd like to see $625 from the package.  I am located in Burleson, south of Ft. Worth."

This is everything you need to play guitar by yourself or up to small gigs. The guitar was bought last November and I just don;t have time to play it. I've had the amp and J-Station for a while, but they both have very little use. Everything works and sounds great. I will sell all of it together for $550. I've got close to $1000 in all this so please no lowball offer's. I am located near Holly Springs, MS and I get to Olive Branch, MS? Memphis, TN regularly.

The Guitar is a 6 string Epiphone Les Paul Plus Top Pro in transparent black with chrome pickup covers, they look gold in the picture but that is just the lighting. It features ProBucker pickups that offer the classic Les Paul sound, as well as dual coil tapping so that you can set the sound of classic no humbucker electric guitars as well as that deep Les Paul Sound. Just pull up or push down in the volume controls to switch between humbucker and single coil pickups. The guitar also comes with a Epiphone hard case. The guitar is in excellent condition with very little play time on it, maybe 3 or 4 hours total. The guitar and case would cast about $590 plus tax new. I will sell them for $410.

The amp is a Marshall CD15. They don;t make these anymore. It has the classic Marshall sound with an overdrive channel. It is loud enough for small gigs. It also has Headphone output and an imput jack that lets you plug your CD player, MP3 player, Ipod or Iphone into it so that you can play along with your favorite bands. This amp shows signs of being moved around a lot, but has very little play time on it. I bought it right before I got out of playing Guitar about 10 years ago. It's just sat in the corner since. $75.

Lastly is a Johnson J-Station. This is a amp modeling effects processor. You can get just about any sound you want out of this. It has factory preset Amp effects set ups, you can also set up lots of custom effects and amp combos and store them on the J-station. With the addition of a few cables you can plug this into you computer and record what you are playing. They don't make these anymore and they are pretty sought after. As you can see in the pick there are a few chips in the paint, but everything works great. I've seen these for $250 on ebay. I will sell it for $110.

As far as trades go I'm mainly looking for guns. A Glock 19 or 26 is number one on my list.

Or you can plan on doing a $1500 motor swap if you have one with the Kholer motor. Tractor itself has 688 hours on it and rising because i use it every weekend to mow my lawn. Its just an awesome machine. Freshly serviced, new belts, new blades and runs like a Top. Just a great Zero turn. Just to clarify, this isn't a hope depot zero turn, this thing is a work horse and is extremely well built and would make a great mower for your lawn care business or just mower your yard (what i use it for). Its a nice ride and is very comfortable. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to come and take a look.

NO TRADES PLEASE

 Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

Key Features:
Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable 
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever 
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes 
Sling swivel studs built-in

We know from personal experience this HK platform is the finest piston driven platform in the world.. system expels all gases out front and literally gets wiped out with a cloth after use. By adding the aerospace contract coatings we do not oil the upper or lowers as the lubricity factors in NP3 Plus are stunning. We do routinely clean the barrels however. HK units have 16.1"" match barrels and are guaranteed sub moa, tactical upgraded charging handles, upgraded bolt systems (NP3 Plus), weep ports for water use, German G4 adjustable stocks with soft rubber recoil buttplate (swing out with storage), genuine HK German mfg rail cover port side with ergo covers starboard.

This bundles a FastFire III with 3 MOA dot and a rugged protective mount that is range-ready right out of the box. It's the simplest and most effective way to mount the FastFire III on an AR flattop as a stand-alone sight or as a co-witness for iron sights. The FastFire sits low in the mount and a pair of metal wings on each side of the lenses protects the sight from impact or unintentional abuse. For added convenience, there is a lower compartment for spare battery storage, open-end wrench and Torx wrench. It is fully waterproof and fits any Weaver or Picatinny-style base.

This rifle is built on a Armscorp receiver with a USGI gunsmith inspected bolt head spaced for match shooting, Springfield Armory National Match Barrel with superb rifling, and unitized gas system. Trigger is 3.5 pounds national match along with the iron sites.  All of this installed in a FDE or coyote tan Sage EBR stock with EBR scope mount with return to zero capability after being taken off and put back on. The Sage EBR stock was designed for the military to modernize the M14 and they did more than that. This is the best stock made for a M1A or M14 as it fixes the common problems and greatly increasing accuracy while adding rails for accessories. The boost in accuracy comes from free floating the barrel from the Op-Rod guide forward, Sage's custom ""glass bedding job"", and adjustable cheek rest for scoped shooting. The only reliable way to mount optics on an M14 is the EBR scope mount. If you want one rifle to do everything from point blank to 1000 meters this is it. Sage M14 EBR rifles are used in all branches of the military as semi auto sniper rifles. This sale includes the following:

Coyote Tan Sage EBR Stock - 800$
Coyote Tan Sage EBR Scope Mount - 250$
