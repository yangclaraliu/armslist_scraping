This TP9SF has about 500 rounds through it. Initially there were occasional failures to go into battery. I sent the pistol in to Century Arms and they replaced the trigger bar as it was bent a millimeter or two left of it's regular position. Century also replaced the firing pin block and recoil spring but I don't think it was necessary. Going forward from about round 150 there have been no issues with the pistol whatsoever. In fact, first shot back from the factory at 7 yards was a bullseye (probably luck). It is an excellent full size pistol and I wouldn't think twice about carrying it. I would prefer to keep it but it has been ""recommended"" to me that I only need one carry pistol. The pistol comes with everything included at original purchase, as shown in images. This includes:
Canik TP9SF Two Mec-Gar MagazinesInterchangeable Backstraps (and roll pin punch)Cleaning Brush/RodHolster/Paddle/Belt attachmentCanik Speed LoaderChamber Safety Flag

It is a Whitneyville Armory .22 revolver size/ model no 1. It is uncertain the exact year of manufacturing but there were only 3500 produced between the years of 1871 and 1876. It has a solid brass body with a nickel finish and an octagon steel barrel and other steel hardware. The grips are solid wood and it has a serial number of 2334D.  The action still works nicely as do the cylinder release button and pin. I am not really sure what I would get rid of this for but I am just putting it out there for offers. I would let it go for cash or trade, as long as it was something that interested me. I enjoy all guns, especially revolvers.  Also please do not waste either of our times if you can not legally purchase a handgun. I will be taking a picture of your driver's license and your permit. Also must meet in the Cedar Rapids or Marion Area. If you are not good with any of this then please just keep looking elsewhere.  You can call me at 815-603-5294 but I will not respond to text messages."

I often feature a dollar bill and ammunition in pictures I take of magazines to list for sale.  There is no ammunition for sale here in this particular listing, nor is the dollar bill included in the sale.  Both are to communicate size and scale and my photos.   The firearm in the photo is to show fit, size, and reference I actually know what gun magazine is compatible with.  There is no firearm for sale with this listing.
 
I will not ship magazines outside of the United States.  Sadly, that includes APO addresses (because of ITAR regulations).  I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.  I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  (I have one more picture).  If you want it, please let me know and I can email it. In this case, its just the 10 round mag for sale standing next to the standard size magazine not for sale.

You all act like your guns are worth 10 times more then new ones and lowball anyone selling a highend gun at a decent price. I know you all want to come out on top but it doesnt always work that way.  Then you have the morons who email you asking 100 questions and never buy or trade.  Make offers and then stop responding. Make arrangements to meet and never show. Ive seen some of the same guns on here for 9 months. You ever think maybe you are being to damn picky and expecting way to much in trade for your gun? Then the guys who think everything is custom.  Listen dipshit custom means custom not drop in parts anyone can order and install on a glock or ar15.  And 50 bucks of parts doesnt make your glock worth 800 dollars. Ar15 assholes. Your pieced together ar15 you built with a gundred differwnt parts isnt worth shit. There is no warranty or anything with your gun so stop thinking yours is worth more than a factory built one. And stop calling everything milspec and shit. Its a ar they are all the same nomatter what brand it is.  Next is the cunts who think they can lowball you and say how youre to high only to get your gun and repoat it for more than you were asking in first place. And whats with the fat fuck who always has the best guns in the world that are always rare in his eyes and always posting how hes cleet certified ? Who gives a fuck dude get over yourself and your rare guns are not rare.Then we have the price match dickheads who think everyone is walmart and should match others prices.And my favorite of all you fucking dumbass morons are you who spend hours researching my gun trying to find the lowest price one every sold for in the history of mankind so you can quote that price and really have no idea what your doing and end up quoting a entirely different model pricing. All of you need to stop using this as a damn buisness and stop ruining the gun community with your greed and stubborn ass. If you want what i have make a deal because it wont last forever and i sure as hell am not going to set around waiting on you to stop researching before buying or trading me.  Stop worrying about making huge profits this isnt barter kings show on tv this is real life and sometimes you have to take a loss to get what you want. And most of the time the guns you pass up end up getting traded for the guns you want but you miss out because youre a stubborn prick and expect everything handed to you .

I often feature a dollar bill and ammunition in pictures I take of magazines to list for sale.  There is no ammunition for sale here in this particular listing, nor is the dollar bill included in the sale.  Both are to communicate size and scale and my photos.  There is no firearm for sale with this listing.
No personal identification of a buyer is necessary for this item.
If we meet in person for exchange, then I'll exchange for cash only. Will exchange with buyer at the Safe Exchange Zone Parking spaces (casually reffered to as ""Craigslist Parking"") of Greer Police Department parking lot at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.  (That parking lot is also accessible via S Miller Street)
And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS.  And buyer would need to pay for shipping.
I now accept Square Cash (Cash App) as well as USPS money order. 
I will not ship magazines outside of the United States.  Sadly, that includes APO addresses (because of ITAR regulations).  I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.  I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  (I have several more pictures).  If you want, please let me know and I can email them. 
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order."
