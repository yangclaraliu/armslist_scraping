For example, I have a triple Raven Concealment kydex AR mag carrier - for the left side (right hand shooter), but I shoot rifles left handed.

If you are interested, let me know and we'll see if we can work something out. I'm very reasonable, but I don't want to give this stuff away. I'm also not trying to get the retail price on any of this stuff back either. You might see these on eBay as well. Thanks for looking!1) HSGI Sure-grip padded Belt (30.5) with Cobra duty Belt (35.5) in OD green. Excellent shape. This was close to $200 before I put the two HSGI double decker LT tacos on there ($50 ea). There is a cheap up effective Condor detachable IFAK on the rear ($20) and a G-Code drop leg attachment point threaded in ($50). If this setup or parts of it would work for you, let me know. I will mix and match pieces. Make an offer.2) HSGI Rifle Leg Rig in Kryptek Highlander. Three panel sewn on rifle tacos to secure AR/AK/etc magazines on a Sure-grip leg panel. This is a GREAT tool if you shoot on the same side for rifle and pistol. Doesn't help me.3) S&S Precision Gear Retention Track (GRT) pieces - 4x Molle attach points, 1 adjustable belt slide (1.5,1.75,2.0""), 2x Skeletonized Magazine carriers with the dust cover, 1x Holster extender + 1x spacer (all milled aluminum). If you know S&S, you know they are excellent pieces of gear and carried/used by a number of SOF units. They are definitely over-priced, but it is solid kit. This works really well if you want an adjustable holster that can be belt high or a drop with a push of a button - this is the stuff. Makes a great addition for a duty belt. Works on a load of different holsters - I have used it with Safariland's 3 hole pattern.4) On-Your-6 Designs Double mag holster - Glock - 9mm/.40 - Kydex. 1.5"" belt loops5) 4x Safariland slide on Tan universal mag holders6) Raven Concealment Kydex magazine carriers - 1x 3 AR magazine carrier with 1.5"" belt-loops. This is similar to the State Department rig for overseas low-vis carry. Also can be broken down into a 1 or 2 mag carrier. Raven sells individual carriers for about $50. Also have a right side (LH) kydex single carrier for a Glock mag. These are in excellent shape and didn't get any carry outside of my house."

This pistol has a capacity of 12+1, comes with 3 magazines, a Viridian Weapon Systems C5L-R laser/light combo ($179), and a custom Defender holster by KT-Mech ($45). This gun has served me faithfully, has had ~2000 rounds put through it, and has been cleaned regularly after 150-300 rounds. This gun would be perfect for a home defense gun, or a concealed carry firearm worn at the 4:00 or 5:00 positions with its custom OWB holster. This weapon is ideal for concealed carry as it lacks any external safety besides the trigger safety (much like a Glock), its owner ought to train accordingly. One will immediately notice appeasing and unique characteristics of this beautiful firearm such as its trapezoid sights, its crisp and quick trigger, and its comfortable finger groves.
 
The gun and magazines itself I would sell for $399 (they run $450-500 new), if you want to buy the entire package (including the holster and light) I would sell for $525.

I also have the original 4"" factory barrel and rear sight so the revolver can easily be converted back to a factory 4"" .357 magunum.
