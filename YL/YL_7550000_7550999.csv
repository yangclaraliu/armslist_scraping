The action is good and the timing is right. From what I’ve read on gun forums, it appears that the plunger that holds the cylinder in place could be stuck and need to be cleaned or maybe filed on a little bit. I think that it would be and easy fix but I don’t really feel like messing with it and would rather just sell it to fund an AR project I’m working on. $180. I can meet you around Eugene."

The 0095BW is built with premium quality materials—from its S35VN blade steel to its solid titanium handles. S35VN ensures the 0095BW offers a reliable edge. Added niobium gives this powdered metallurgy steel improved toughness over S30V without loss of wear resistance. The end result is a sharp edge that lasts for a long time. Next, ZT adds a BlackWash™ finish to the 0095BW’s “harpoon-style” blade to give the knife a sleek, unified look and to hide hard-use scratches. The high-performance blade is paired with a titanium handle with wide, contoured chamfers to provide a secure, comfortable grip. A titanium frame lock with a hardened lockbar insert secures the blade open during use. ZT’s KVT ball-bearing opening system lets you open the 0095BW with speed and efficiency. The 0095BW’s pocketclip is reversible for left- and right-handed tip-up carry. Finally, a decorative, two-toned pivot adds a finishing touch to the 0095BW, completing the look of this solid handful of precision.

I have a like-new/mint, super accurate Mossberg 100 ATR bolt action .308 rifle with scope and case for sale. I took this rifle to the range only once and shot at most 30 rounds through it. Afterward, it was thoroughly cleaned and lubricated for storage (a procedure I do with all of my weapons). I am not a hunter. I purchased this rifle on a whim and have no need for it. It comes with a like-new/mint condition Nikon Monarch 3, 6-24 x 50 Matte BDC scope. I have all boxes, manuals and accessories. Also included is a new/mint Cabelas rifle case, a folding bipod, a very durable neoprene shoulder strap, and a ""Shooterpads"" recoil pad (super shock absorbant).

Altogether, if you purchased this package new, you're looking at more than $1,100.00, plus taxes and FFL fees. I'm willing to let it all go for just $495 (cash). Send me a message if you're interested. It would make a great gift, especially since I have all of the original packaging and documentation."
