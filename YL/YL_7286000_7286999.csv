Of the 8 magazines, 7 are Glock factory (3 of them are marked ""LE Resticted"") and 1 is a KCI. Of the ammo, 400 rounds are 165gr RNFP target and 200 are various hollow point self-defense. The night sights have 75% brightness relative to brand new sites on another one of my Glock pistols. The original Glock factory hard case, manual, and lock is included in the sale. This Glock DOES NOT include the backstraps as it is a short frame grip. The gun is an incredibly accurate and reliable shooter that has served well in defensive handgun training classes and action pistol competitions. It is my absolute go-to for the range and has spent many nights by my bed for home defense. It has been cleaned, lubed and well maintained. There are a few very minor scratches from kydex holster usage, but there is no other wear visible on the frame. I am reducing the number of calibers of guns I keep in my safe. This is my only 40 cal pistol. I am reluctantly parting with it. Therefore, I am not desperate to get rid of it. My price is firm and fair. I am offering the same price as a police trade in at places like Buds and Aim Surplus, however I am offering 6 additional magazines and 600 rounds of ammo. Cash only. No trades. No cash + trades. I will ignore low ball offers. I meet buyers at Young Guns in Apex. Buyers need to have a current CCW (no pistol purchase permits) and valid DL. I will take pictures of both of them + provide a bill of sale for the transaction."

I purchased this pistol brand new and have never fired, carried or loaded it. Since purchased new, it has laid in the safe unused so I would rather recoup some of my money or trade for something I will use. For those that aren't aware, CZ pistols can be very hard to come by and the newest 97B is very difficult to find. The last time I searched (just recently) a few of the major gun websites I could only find a few of these available in the US. Again this is new unfired and in phenomenal shape. My price is VERY FIRM at $560 cash as these run anywhere from $750-800 new plus tax IF you can find them anywhere locally, otherwise you will tack on an additional expensive for shipping, credit card fees, and transfer fees. All deals must happen in Mason, cash only, all local and federal laws apply, and buyer must present Ohio issued Drivers License or Ohio CCW Permit which takes priority. Any inquires giving your two cents on the price can expect an appropriate response, and all inquires for a lower price or trades other than listed will not be responded to. If interested please respond to the ad and I will be in contact with you as soon as possible. ThanksNote this is one of only three CZ 97 models on all of armslist (nationwide) and by far the chespest one listed. The last time I checked Gunbroker there were only two others listed as well. This is an EXTREMELY difficult pistol to find******NO TRADES******"

It is available in 34mm or 30mm rings. The height is set for 1.285"" centerline of the scope above the M1913 Picatinny rail. Because the LT120 sits the scopes lower to the bore, they will not align properly with weapon-mounted clip-on night vision devices which sit at 1.535”. Additionally, it will not work with scopes that have an Objective Housing larger than 56mm which is the largest that will fit and still allow the use of lens caps.

Combination rifle cover, rifle carrier and shooting mat, the Hybrid Sniper Rifle Case is ideal for today's sniper. Developed with a vast amount of input from a variety of professional snipers, it features heavy duty #10 YKK® wrap around zipper for added strength and fast opening. It is also designed to roll up and attach to an operator's pack or web gear. Each case comes standard with four detachable and interchangeable panels. There are two available locations for which to attach panels with snaps, in any configuration you need. Snaps are covered to prevent finish from wearing off. 
The four panels are as follows: One flat zippered utility pocket, one zippered utility pocket with elastic to hold ten .308 rounds, and two lammy suede panels. Lammy suede is the only material we have found that has the same friction wet or dry. Other nonslip materials, such as rubber, work great when dry but become very slick when wet.Dimensions: Open: 38"" x 70"" Closed: 51"" x 12""Aaron REDACTED  Email REDACTED"

With the pistol is included the original plastic carrying case and two after-market 8 round magazines.  I'll also throw in 1 box of 50 rounds of .45 ACP as this is the only pistol I currently own in that caliber and will have no need for it once this is moves. (I'm a 9mm guy...)   I'm asking a firm $375 for the handgun.  Given that the MSRP for these is over $500 and average street price is about $450, this is a great deal.  Act quick before this one gets away from you.  I prefer a cash sale, but will consider a limited number of trades.  I'm in the market for a smaller frame .357 Magnum revolver such as a Ruger SP01 or a Taurus 605 as a alternate carry piece.  Thus if you have something along those lines we might be able to work out a deal.  Obviously a low value trade such as a used Taurus will have to have it's value  made up for either in cash or other items.  But let me know if you have an offer that falls along those lines.   The above are just common examples.  I'm open to other small frame .357s as well.Now the boring part...By replying to this add you afirm that you are able to legally purchase a handgun in the state of Texas.  I reserve the right to refuse sale to any prospective buyer for any reason.  If I don't like the look of you, I walk.  Given the extra expense and hassle of FFL transfers, local pickup only, please.  I have had good luck in the past conducting transactions in public places such as the parking lot of a known gun retailer.  (it's safer for all concerned and locals are not likely to be alarmed by the sight of firearms due to the location.)   First come first serve and all sales/trades are final.  Text me at REDACTED if you are interested in a purchase or have a trade proposal.  I work early hours, so will be unlikley to reply to any text before tommorrow (9/5), but will reply as soon as possible."
