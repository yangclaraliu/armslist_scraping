Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times. Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4? sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.

Gun has about 350 rounds through it from the previous owner as I aquired this in a trade. The only wear on the pistol is on the barrel and very minor wear on slide rails. Exterior finish is perfect. Also features German frame. This thing has a very nice trigger with an very short reset so it'll really crank out some 230 grain slugs. Sure gives the good ol 1911 a run for it's money. At this time I'm only looking for trades. These in this configuration are hard to find these days as sig no longer makes them. The elite frame makes it somewhat rare best I can tell anyway. Comes with two 8 rnd mags and one 10 rnd box and docs and a Blackhawk holster and possibly a black point leather wing own holster depending on trade.

The P229c exhibits typical SIG Sauer design—a traditional double-action/single-action, semi-automatic pistol with a decocking lever. The long and heavy initial double-action trigger pull eliminates the need for a manual safety lever, while still providing a high level of safety against an unintended discharge. Until the pistol is manually decocked, subsequent shots fire in single-action mode, with a crisp 4-pound trigger pull—making the P229c as fast and accurate as any pistol in its class, so long as you are comfortable with the heavier initial double-action trigger pull on the first shot. For shooters who like this type of action, SIG’s execution of the double-action concept is about as good as it gets.The P229c utilizes a double-stack, 12-round magazine, which puts it right between SIG’s compact (10-round capacity) and full-size (15-round capacity) pistols. The P229c model is currently available only in .40 S&W or .357 SIG. As you would expect, the P229c can utilize any legacy P229 magazine, as well as any of the larger P226 magazines, which will extend beyond the grip frame.STATS:     SAS Treatment:   Anti-snag treatment that rounds all sharp corners and edges for comfort.

This gun has LOTS of inspector marks, proofs, and just odd numbers. I have been able to determine that it was made in 1947. Does have the mark for nitro proofed. The action locks up very tight with no rattles or wobble. Both triggers/hammers work without issue. Ejector works fine. Barrel/chambers are mirror bright. Has very nice checkering on the foregrip and buttstock. However on one side does look like someone started to re-checker it and never finished it. No cracks in the stock or repairs. Barrels have a nice patina to them, and receiver retains some case coloring. Very interesting engraving/scroll work on the receiver, even on the bolts. Someone prior did cut the barrel down to 20in and redid the brass bead. They also added a custom fit recoil pad to the buttstock. My guess looks like a pachmayr decelerator. But was done well enough it fits the contours of the stock. Included is a black leather sling with someone's name on the inside. I'm limited to how many pictures I can upload here, but if interested, msg me with your cell and I can text lots more pictures on the gun details. Price is set at $200. Nothing more, nothing less. Or Trade for the items listed below. As of right now, I have only fired low brass #7 [2 3/4] shells out of this. Even though its nitro proofed it is still a 71yr old shotgun. IF you wish to shoot high brass (buckshot/slugs.....etc) I would highly recommend having a gunsmith inspect this. Primarily looking for trades only at this time. Located in Howell/Livingston County"
