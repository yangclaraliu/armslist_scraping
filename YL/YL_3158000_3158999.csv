With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine is also included. 

Scorpion, features a flat dark earth frame, and slide, Hogue Extreme G-10 grips and mainspring cover.

This slide is part of the last of our Knoxville neighbors’ last hurrah of the excellent little CZ-82 Pistols that came in a couple years back. The parent pistols were produced in the late 1980s, some of the best in the world. Original chambering for these is the hot little Makarov Round, the 9x18 caliber. The slide and magazine will work just fine with the CZ-83 pistols, but only the ones chambered in 380 ACP caliber. At press time, we had the few remaining CZ82s and their twelve round magazines listed mostly on Guns America, search terms CZ82 Robertson. This listing is for One Slide, but winning buyers may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-slide price and with no additional shipping charges. Photo specimens are part of this lot of only a couple dozen remaining parts guns that TGI had left. All of them are matte black finish with moderate edge whitening. We rate them as Good, perhaps Very Good, and buyers will receive one of the photo specimens or one of its mates from the same batch of 25 some odd that we had at press time. Construction is all steel, with serrated rear area and serrated rib on top of the slide. This slide assembly is entirely original CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, made in the Czech Republic in Strakonice. Importer is Tennessee Guns, TGI of Knoxville, and each slide is importer stamped inconspicuously on its forward bottom edges. These slides are excellent mechanically. All parts are included with the slide. Replacement pricing on a CZ slide is upwards of $200 from many sources. We’re offering the factory CZ82 CZ83 Slides in the photos, however, or their identical mates each for only $ 99.00.

Custom long range Remington 700 built by Broad Creek Rifle Works. Rifle has a 26"" HEAVY krieger free floated barrel, sits in a sendero stock(made by hs precision i believe), trigger work, blueprinted/trued action, and sako extractor. Barrel profile is heavier than a normal factory varmint barrel. Action is super smooth, and round count is low (appx 50).  Included is 1 full box of ammo, 3 1/2 boxes of brass, and rcbs dies. This is a very nice custom rifle. Somewhat heavy at around 11lbs. It's chambered in 7mm dakota, which compares in ballistics to a 7mm stw.

This is a rifle for someone dedicated to long range shooting/hunting and precision handloading. I bought it with all intentions on getting into the long range game, but just dont have time to fool with it and to tweak the rifle like it needs to bring out it's full potential. I bought it, shot it 5 times, and it has sat since. I bought another rifle since, and am going to put my effort into it instead. 

You can not go to wal-mart or gander mountain or anywhere like that to get ammunition for this rifle!!! It must be handloaded or bought online through a custom ammunition company, and it's expensive unless you handload!

However, if you are a handloader and you are into long range shooting/hunting, this is a nice rig.


Looking to get $1800 for rifle, scope, and everything mentioned, and $1300 without the scope. Scope is a leupold vari-x 3 4.5-14x50 with mil-dot reticle and custom target turrets installed by leupold. Open to offers also.

Could be interested in partial trades plus cash on your end. Let me know what you have...

This internal part comes from the final specimens of the excellent little CZ-82 Pistols that came in a couple years back. The parent pistols were produced in the late 1980s, some of the best in the world. Original chambering for these is the hot little Makarov Round, the 9x18 caliber. Dimensions, however, are the same for the model 83 pistols chambered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP; and this factory ejector will function on the model 82, and both variants of the CZ83. At press time, we had the few remaining CZ82 pistols themselves and their twelve round magazines listed mostly on Guns America, search terms CZ82 Robertson. This listing is one part, the ejector. Winning buyers may take any number of ejectors we have on hand at the same per-ejector price and with no additional shipping charges. Photo specimens are part of this lot of only a couple dozen remaining parts guns that TGI had left. All of them are original steel with minimal edge whitening on the top edge of the ejector proper. We rate their finish as Very Good, and buyers will receive one of the photo specimens or one of its mates from the same batch of 25 some odd that we had at press time. Construction is all steel. This part is entirely original CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, made in the Czech Republic in Strakonice. Importer is Tennessee Guns, TGI of Knoxville. These parts are excellent mechanically. Replacement pricing on a CZ ejectorlike this is upwards of $50 from many sources. We’re offering the factory CZ82 CZ83 ejectors in the photos, however, or their identical mates each for only $ 39.00.

It has one scratch in the barrel finish from a latch in the safe that rubbed against it but other than that it is in great shape. I am only selling it to fund a new rifle that I would like to build. It was started as a left handed stag arms 2TL and I have added the following:
- Tango Down QD Vertical Foregrip
- Insight Technology M6X Light/Laser with remote pad attached to Foregrip
- Sightmark Ultrashot QD reflex sight 
- CAA Stock Saddle
- Hogue Overmolded pistol grip
- Badger Ordnance extended charging handle latch
- Magpul Polymer Trigger guard (for shooting with gloves)

I have two Pmags that I am throwing in with the rifle because no rifle should be without magazines. In all this rifle would cost over $1550 to build yourself, so why not let me have done all the work for you and get a nice discount for it. 

Also to think about, I have an Eotech 512 that I had just recently bought for this rifle. It had seen one mag to boresight it. I would be willing to upgrade this rifle from the Sightmark to the Eotech for an extra $300."

The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System™ (MIS™) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The Rapid Deployment Stock™ (RDS™) reduces the overall length of the Tactical Target Rifle by almost 10-inches when the stock is folded.

This combination of four internal parts, is part of the last of our Knoxville neighbors’ last hurrah of the excellent little CZ-82 Pistols that came in a couple years back. The parent pistols were produced in the late 1980s, some of the best in the world. Original chambering for these is the hot little Makarov Round, the 9x18 caliber. Dimensions, however, are the same for the model 83 pistols chambered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP. At press time, we had the few remaining CZ82 pistols themselves and their twelve round magazines listed mostly on Guns America, search terms CZ82 Robertson. This listing is for a group of 6 parts: 1. view #19 Disconnectors; 2. view #21 Automatic Safety; 3. view #34 CZ82 Safety, 4. view #35 Safety Latch, 5. view #36 Safety Spring, and 6. view #37 Safety Pin. Winning buyers may take any number of groups we have on hand at the same per-group price and with no additional shipping charges. Photo specimens are part of this lot of only a couple dozen remaining parts guns that TGI had left. All of them are matte black finish with moderate edge whitening. We rate their finish as Good, perhaps Very Good, and buyers will receive one of the photo specimens or one of its mates from the same batch of 25 some odd that we had at press time. Construction is all steel, ambidextrous serrated safety levers comeplete with the important safety latch piece, the spring, and the pin that holds the assembly in the pistol’s frame. This group of parts is entirely original CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, made in the Czech Republic in Strakonice. Importer is Tennessee Guns, TGI of Knoxville. These parts are excellent mechanically. Replacement pricing on a CZ safety assembly like this is upwards of $150 from many sources.

This combination of seven internal parts, is part of the last of our Knoxville neighbors’ last hurrah of the excellent little CZ-82 Pistols that came in a couple years back. The parent pistols were produced in the late 1980s, some of the best in the world. Original chambering for these is the hot little Makarov Round, the 9x18 caliber. Dimensions, however, are the same for the model 83 pistols chambered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP. At press time, we had the few remaining CZ82 pistols themselves and their twelve round magazines listed mostly on Guns America, search terms CZ82 Robertson. This listing is for One group of 7 parts: 1. view 26 – # Hammer; 2. view #27 – Hammer Pin; 3. view #28 – Hammer Lever; 4. view # 31 Mainspring Strut; 5. view # 32 Mainspring; 6. View # 33 Mainspring Plug; 7. View 6b Mainspring Plug Pin Winning buyers may take any number of groups we have on hand at the same per-group price and with no additional shipping charges. Photo specimens are part of this lot of only a couple dozen remaining parts guns that TGI had left. All of them are matte black finish with moderate edge whitening. We rate their finish as Good, perhaps Very Good, and buyers will receive one of the photo specimens or one of its mates from the same batch of 25 some odd that we had at press time. This group of parts is entirely original CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, made in the Czech Republic in Strakonice. Importer is Tennessee Guns, TGI of Knoxville. These parts are excellent mechanically. Replacement pricing on a CZ trigger assembly like this is upwards of $150 from many sources.

This item is subject to sales tax for NV residents and a 25.00 fee for the background check.  

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development).

Introduced in January 2012, the MR762A1’s Suggested Retail Price is $3,995."

This combination of eight internal parts, is part of the last of our Knoxville neighbors’ last hurrah of the excellent little CZ-82 Pistols that came in a couple years back. The parent pistols were produced in the late 1980s, some of the best in the world. Original chambering for these is the hot little Makarov Round, the 9x18 caliber. Dimensions, however, are the same for the model 83 pistols chambered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP. At press time, we had the few remaining CZ82 pistols themselves and their twelve round magazines listed mostly on Guns America, search terms CZ82 Robertson.

This group of parts is entirely original CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, made in the Czech Republic in Strakonice. Importer is Tennessee Guns, TGI of Knoxville. These parts are excellent mechanically.

You are bidding on a super-nice/clean CORRECT GRADE Springfield Armory M1 Garand. This was purchased directly from the CMP store in 2009. As you can see from the muzzle erosion gauge, it shows the reading is less than 1/2. Since purchasing in 2009, the owner only put two stripper clips through the firearm to test it. So, this Springfield Garand was barely used.

It has a Powder Coat Tungsten Grey paint job all over, which is super durable and looks amazing.  Gun is flawless, no scratches, buffs marks or anything.   It also comes with the best charging handle on the market, the Rainier Arms Raptor ambidextrous charging handle, also comes with a standard M4 charging handle. Also comes with 5 PMAGS.  The rifle alone I am selling for $1500, bought it at jimmy's in fwb two weeks ago for $1856, you can go there and check the prices.  I also have a ton of ammo and gear to go along with it.  I also have 1300 rounds of 5.56 ammunition, 750 of which is 55grain winchester whitebox/independence/pmc xtac/zq1, and 550 rounds are 5.56 62 grain green tipped armor piercing rounds.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including two brand new Ruger 10/22 Takedown rifles, in an awesome Davidson’s Exclusive configuration! The 10/22 Takedown breaks in half, and comes ready for easy carry with a black soft case.This exclusive model features a threaded barrel with flash suppressor, stainless steel finish, and comes with Ruger BX-25 25-round magazine!


I have TWO in stock, and they are priced to sell quickly for only $379.00 each (cash price).


Ruger 11125 10/22 Takedown .22lr Rifle, Stainless Finish, 16.25 Inch Threaded Barrel, Fiber Optic Sights, 25-Round Magazine

**Davidson’s Exclusive model featuring 16.25″ threaded barrel with Mini-14 style flash suppressor, Fiber-Optic front and rear sights, BX-25 25-round magazine**

Readily separated into two halves, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly.

Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other
accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options.


The 4.67 pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37” long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4” when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one 25-round BX-25 magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package.

This is like new! Only 500 rounds of lead free pellets put through it. 
Includes free pellets.

Once you have one in your hands you will agree and won't want to put the air rifle down.  At just a shade over 6 pounds, the R7 is easy to pack around in the field with ease. The gun still packs plenty of punch with velocities reaching 700 fps in the .177 caliber version. The R7 is extremely accurate and has a very pleasant, smooth firing action. In fact, the R7 is a favored rifle among Straight Shooters.

The R7 Standard configuration comes with a 2 piece mount and muzzlebrake allowing you to add your choice of scope and mounts to the rifle. The R7 rifle features a unique double jointed cocking lever which eliminates the customary long slot under the forearm of break-barrel air rifles. This provides a more comfortable grip and a better sling mounting point on the forearm.

Pay attention to the details on this air rifle: Crisp, multi-lever trigger and finest non-drying breech and piston seals. Checkering on the pistol grip and a rubber buttplate. Scope grooves cut directly into the receiver for added stability. Beautiful precision cast trigger guard. And the satin finish on the hardwood stock resists minor scratches. Simply put, there are few guns made with all the features, style and grace of the R7.

All of this ammo was produced at Novosibirsk Low Voltage Equipment plant (LVE) which is where all of their highest quality ammo is produced. All ammo made at LVE bears the head stamp ""188"" and the year of production. 

LVE is recognized world wide for their superior quality ammunition. Their Match and Sniper ammunition uses special powders, primers and bullets. Plus much more care is taken producing it. The results speak for them self and you'll be amazed at just how much more accurate this high quality ammo really is.

Included: 

(1) still sealed 25 round box of brass case 182 grain Match ammo from 1965 - head stamp 188-65. 

(2) 20 round bundles of 7N1 ammo loaded in annealed copper washed steel cases with a special 152 grain boat tail bullet. Bullet has a steel core followed by a dead air space with a lead knocker in the base. When bullet hits it's target the lead knocker shifts forward destabilizing the bullet resulting in a devastating wound. This ammo was specifically designed for the Dragunov, but it's excellent for Mosins too. Head stamp 188-97.

(1) 20 round box 182 grain Extra Match (blue box) ammo from 1971. Ammo is loaded in brass cases with match powder and match grade bullets. It's extremely accurate and has won many matches over the years. Head stamp is 188-71.

(1) 20 round box LVE 200 grain Extra Match. This is very hard to find and offers superior accuracy - especially at extreme ranges. With the 200 grain bullet it's also the hardest hitting 54R available. Head stamp is LVE 10.

All of this ammo has been stored properly and is in excellent condition. It's all sure fire and you will be surprised by it's accuracy.

22 s/l/lr
Great shooting little rifle. This is the carbine version of the H001. Basically it just has a shorter barrel (16.125"" instead of the 18 1/4"" of the standard) and a large loop lever. 
I have installed the Henry sling swivel kit on mine, it will also come with a hammer spur for clearing a scope (if you choose to use one). I have also buffed up the finish of the wood. These rifles are notorious for their overly dull looking wood when new. I have taken the time to buff mine and bring it to a very attractive gloss like finish that shows off the wood grain very well. 

Overall the rifle is in very good condition and has seen less than 500 rounds. I love the rifle, however my recent curiosity is the Marlin 39a rifle and I would like to trade this rifle for one. I am really only interested in the Marlin, but I may be swayed by other lever action rifles. The only lever guns I would not consider would be any Winchester model 94 rifles, I have owned 2 and they are not something that I like personally.

Manufactured to the highest quality standards and featuring a patent pending design, the LANTAC DGN556B Muzzle Brake offers improved recoil management and muzzle rise over competitors products.

Trading off my Glocks 22, 23, & 27. All are Gen 4, all have HM3 night sights, 4 lb Ghost trigger, titanium striker and plunger, pins, extended slide releases. All have factory hard cases, paperwork, all factory parts are included to return the pistols to factory status if needed. Many Glock factory magazines for each pistol are included, many are new. Most mags are new and unused, also have stick mags, all Glock factory. Extra range barrels with each, and 9mm conversion barrels for the 27 and 23, and an unused Glock spare factory barrel for the 23. A Streamlight TRL-1 with G22 pressure switch and many other parts not listed, tungsten recoil springs, titanium take downs and other parts I can't remember at this time . These are all extremely well maintained and have only light wear.  Also includes a Glockmiester sight pusher/remover set. I can include Blackhawk, Kholster, and Safariland holsters however many are left handed which is why I am not including them in the exchange set, but the reciever can have them if they want them. The Glock 23 and 27 both have conversion barrels, recoil springs, and four 9mm magazines to run them as G19 and G26 9mm automatics if needed. Conversion barrels, springs, and 9mm magazines have not been used. All after market barrels are Lone Wolf brand. All pistols and parts were purchased new and I am the original owner, I have all purchase receipts from gun shops and online vendors.

Photo 2 shows most of the main equipment but none of the spare parts paperwork or hardcases.

Photo 3 shows pistols field stripped.  Notice the gold colored striker and plunger. Also no wear on the barrels or slide contact points. 

$2000 is an estimated price. This is a great chance to get 3 great Glocks. All the mod parts are removable to other 9,40, 357 frame Glocks.

Each Glock has a light and crisp 4lb trigger pull, all have been very well maintained and cleaned. They all have have less then 100 rounds fired per pistol and even then we're being used with range barrels most of the time. They were all purchased from early to late 2012, and the Meprolight night sights were purchased at the same time. They have light carry use only, and I only carried them when mandatory. I prefer either Beretta or M&P platforms and seldom used the Glocks. I would like to get rid of everything to one buyer/person who is interested rather than sell or trade each piece at a time or risk getting stuff with left over parts.

Primarily I am interested in purchasing a Savage 10/110 series rifle with the Accu Trigger but would entertain other models such as the Remington 700 or Weatherby Vanguard depending on the deal involved. 

Will pay cash. Price is obviously going to depend on the specifics of the gun and its condition so of course I would pay more for say a barely used Remington 700 SPS than a dinged up Stevens from the 70's. Please note I generally know what guns are worth and will not pay brand new prices for used guns, let alone more than that. Will pay close (say 90%) to a competitive retail price for a gun in very good condition. This means if Academy is selling the gun for $500 I would be inclined to pay $450ish.

I have a scope already so baring an excellent deal on a scope I want my interest is solely in a rifle. Have no interest in paying retail value for accessories I do not want.

Am located in the DeRidder/ Leesville area and would like to meet nearby. Depending on the deal I might be willing to drive a bit though times to do so are limited. Can show ID and proof of residency if you want. -9iijhb

Full size .40 S&W that comes with a little over 300 rounds. I think 320. 100 of these are Critical Duty; A super hollow point! Retains about 96% of weight on impact through barriers like Dry wall, Sheet metal, Hollow doors, Heavy clothes, etc. Very pricey ammo. Another 150 are Smith white box brass, and the rest is steel case. Comes with 3 magazines, Speed loader, Leather magazine belt-loop pouch, and the Glock hard case. 

These Gen. 4's are outfitted with a metal guide rod, and dual recoil spring, along with very aggressive grip, and bigger magazine release button, making them much more combat ready than the Gen. 3 in my opinion. About 200rds down the pipe. I'm the only owner its ever had. I won't split the package, it's all or none, sorry. 

Asking $645 for the whole shebang."
