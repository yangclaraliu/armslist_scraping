Hey all,
I have some range picked brass for sale or trade. I've collected this up and normally would keep it, but I do not reload .40 so I will open it up to y'all. I would also consider trading towards 357 mag brass or 44 mag brass. This is mostly brass with a few nickel. It was hand counted to 1,000 rounds. (Give or take a couple possibly). Any that were noticeably damaged or steel/aluminum so the times should be 100% brass. These are for pickup in Norman only. I'm asking $40 for the full bag or trade for 357 mag or 44 mag brass. This is fresh picked so non tumbled or sized. 
I have more of this as well as other calibers in smaller amounts if anyone is interested. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. 
Thanks
Happy hunting!

Clarity is amazing at all magnification levels. Scope has all the bells and whistles you want... Illuminated Mil Dot reticle, .1Mil clicks, exposed tactical turrets, side focus/fast focus, adjustable objective (10? yards I think - to infinity), sunshade, caps, 30MM tube, matte black finish, etc..! Heck - I'll even throw in a sweet set of weaver rings (as seen in picture) with it if the price is right... To be fair, the scope has one small (practically unnoticeable) scratch about 4mm long on the housing near the muzzle end which has been filled w bluing to match. Amazingly accurate and has held zero after MANY trips to the range with NO problem... This is a great scope and I think the price is more than fair - only reason I am letting it go is that I am no longer BR shooting and don't need it any longer...! Please email me with questions... I will pay for shipping once your cashier's check clears my bank...!"

Stock is REALLY well inletted - with tolerances of about 1mm all around the action. Designed for a bull barrel - but will fit a standard or tapered barrel as well... as the barrel is completely free - floated along its entire length. A swivel stud is mounted under the foregrip (which I used occasionally for a bipod). The stock is fairly light (about 38 ounces to the best of my ability to weigh it!) and works VERY well for both BR and off-hand shooting - especially with the very flat foregrip area... I paid almost $190 for this stock about 10 months ago and believe that it is a fair bargain at $145... Please let me know what you might offer or if you have any questions. I will pay for shipping and get it in the mail to you as soon as your cashier's check clears my bank...! thanks for your feedback / responses / questions / interest...!

Believe me, I will definitely shoot all the ammo I have - I only have a .22 and .40, so nothing will be wasted.  But with the spot price of silver at just under $21, I can afford to try to add to my daughter's collection.  I'm not going to try to screw you on the prices; if you're not sure of the value of what you have, check eBay.  If I had a choice in the matter, I would be looking for Morgan's (""O"" mint mark, because New Orleans is special to me), Canadian Maple Leaf, and Chinese Panda's.  There are so many gaps in our collection that almost everything fits.  Only in 2013 was I able to complete the entire World collection (that's China, Fiji, USA, Andorra, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, and other numismatic silver producing countries, maybe 13 or 14 total).  American Eagle Proofs rock.

Got a random silver coin in the drawer? Let me know what you have (pictures help) and let's see what we can do.  Most interested in numismatic coins, but ingots and bullion can be considered.  We're not going to melt anything.  Of course I am interested in gold coins - who wouldn't be? - but I am pretty sure I can only make an offer on a $5 coin, nowhere near a $20 or $50 piece.

On the table are Federal Blue Box bulk, CCI Blazers / Velocitors / Stingers / Standard, Remington Golden Bullets. .40's if that's your thing.

Very handy carbine; 20"" barrel, 10+1 capacity.

I get it, guns aren't always cheap and most of us don't have several hundred dollars lying around that we can drop on guns whenever we want, even if we'd like to.  But most of us are here to buy, sell, and trade FIREARMS, not random household and lawn/garden stuff.

Normally I wouldn't bother saying anything, but when I get that same list of random stuff emailed to me EVERY TIME i post something, it gets old.  I get the impression that you're on here a lot and appreciate firearms, which is great, but most of us just aren't interested.  If you have so much stuff that you have no use for I imagine having a garage sale would be your best bet to get rid of it and get the cash you need to buy the guns you're looking for.

Anyway, I'm not looking to be mean or publicly shame anybody, but just thought I would say what no doubt many of us here on armslist are thinking.

Serial prefix is UPV, test-fire date of 2/8/13.  This one has the less-matte (more scratch-resistant) finish.  

I am not the original owner, but purchased the gun in essentially new condition, aside from the result of someone thinking about smoothing out the bottom of the trigger guard but then giving up rather quickly.  Basically, it's like the bottom of the trigger guard was run over a few times with some sandpaper so that it is relatively smooth.  A significant amount of material was not removed.  Aside from that, the gun is cosmetically in great condition. 

Completely stock except for steel 3-dot sights (not night sights).  The sights have been on multiple guns in the past, so they aren't that great looking.  But, I think they're better than the stock plastic sights.  

The gun also comes with a Don Hume H721OT right hand belt holster.  The holster is definitely used, but I no longer have use for it.

Also included is 345 rounds of factory new .40S&W ammunition, including:

These are only sold to Elite SOF on official military letterheads only no LE or public can buy them. It looks like something from STAR WARS and even during the day its still the brightest dot and beam you have ever seen Yes it will light a match and get you a free ride to jail and Im sure ATF will need to have a little of this and that with you as well. This one comes with 2 tail caps one pressure and one click as well as zero tool. These lasers are indestructible . It came from Afghanistan from a friend of mine who is a SFO. The only other one of these I have ever seen sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and they were going crazy for it. You have to see this laser running to believe it!

It is in excellent condition. It is a mid size K-frame, all stainless, six shot, fixed sight revolver chambered in 38 special and will also shoot 38+P. It is a pre-lock and pre-mim model. Action is tight and typical S&W smooth. This gun came from the California Department of Corrections and has a CDC serial number professionally stamped on the left side of the frame. These guns were used by wardens and staff officers so they were carried lightly and fired infrequently for qualifications. Comes with new Pachmayr Compac Pro grips with exposed backstrap. This compact gun will make a good concealed carry or home defense weapon and is very accurate for a snubbie. Sorry, no box or papers. Price shown is for a face to face cash sale in the Aiken area."

Round count total, out the pipe is box of 25 used to sight in the adj. sights.


For sale or trade.

My cash price is $645- But, I will consider an LC9, in NRA Camo, Raspberry, Flat Dark Earth, or Two-Tone in the same condition as my GLOCK plus $275- cash. Not interested in a plain LC9.

W/tax, B.G., & accessories, etc., I am in this close to a grand, so, this is NON-NEGOTIABLE! Price is very fair and firm. Add it up, this is, pardon the pun, a lot of Bang for the Buck!

                                          LOW BALL = HANGUP!

You must provide me with proof positive that you are not a felon, the easiest way would be to show me a valid TN CCW permit.
