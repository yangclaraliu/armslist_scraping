The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Other options: the pistol with original black grips and any two magazines $180; or the pistol with all magazines and original black grips $210; or everything you see here in all the photos along with replacement brown grips, 200 rds ammo, and original Phoenix box and manual for $250; or make a *reasonable* offer...

Unless you can give me a good and valid reason to change the price(s), they will stay. I know the price of a new Phoenix 22 pistol and the price for various .22LR ammo. I often look at slickguns, gun-deals, gunbroker, ammoseek and other similar websites. For some time now, .22 LR ammo is expensive or just hard to get. Also consider that I had to pay shipping costs plus pay $20 FFL transfer fee for the pistol alone. The finger grip magazines were $22 or more each. The brown grips were $20 more (including shipping). No this is not a scam regardless of what you may think.

Have never carried or taken a class with the gun (no holster wear, mags haven't been dropped or been dirty), just been a nice range and nightstand gun.  Can also sell magazines separately if interested, these mags work in both the HK45C and USP 45C.  Email any offers, I'll list my most likely trades below but will consider other offers.  I'll email back as soon as I can, thanks for looking!"

I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be.

Beretta PX4 Storm Full Size

Low barrel axis position

Thanks to the design of the direct barrel-slide locking system, the low barrel axis reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise.

Newly designed slide

The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in moist conditions.

3-Dot Sight System

Features a white '3-dot' sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

Simple Field Stripping

Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

External Hammer Design

A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

Ambidextrous Safety (Type F)

The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it's either positively ""on"" or ""off"". The safety lever also functions as the pistol's decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever.) Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block

The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the bloack is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer

No Glare Finish

Beretta's exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish

Slide

The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions

Accessory Rail

The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapic attachment of tacitcal lights and laser aiming devices

Reversible Magazine Release

Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual's hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use

Individual Size Grips

Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large back-straps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

Magazine

High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).

Not to mention better prices in regular brick and mortar weapon stores. Is this site operating because:

A) The sellers are selling to a captive market of stupid people who are not aware of any other places to buy weapons at, or...

B) This site is being run by the mob as a front for laundering money, or...

C) This site is using elaborate codes words and people here are actually selling drugs, prostitutes or illegal guns (in which case, the products are still over priced), or...

D) This site is being used to create the fake appearance of losing money so people can use the fake ""losses"" to offset the legitimate taxes they’re supposed to pay as an illegal method of avoiding taxes altogether (this is why people set up fake ""businesses"" with Amway and Avon), or...

E) This site is used by people who have lost their legal right to purchase weapons (due to felony, etc) and so are forced to purchase weapons as private purchases on this site, or...

Sorry to have to say that to you legit buyers/traders.....

Here's what I have, an Armalite AR30 in .338 Lapua, the creator of the AR30 and it is legit !!! It comes fully loaded and in mint condition, literally mint condition !!! For those of you that don't know it, the .338 Lapua holds the record for longest CONFIRMED sniper kill at 2,707 yards!!! Yes, that's OVER  1 1/2 miles down range!!!
Really want to trade it for an AR10 or a SCAR in .308, I want a .308 AR. But I'm not hurting for $$$ and I don't need to sell this AR30. If you have a legit offer, that means a weapon worth $3,250.00, send the offer, or I will take $3,250.00 in cash. When I say not a penny less, that's gospel.

It has a 4.25"" barrel. This pistol has received many upgrades to include most of its parts replaced with Wilson Combat parts. This pistol is unique because it had custom work done to the trigger guard with the famous 1911 gunsmith Armand Swenson's patented square design. 

Additionally, I also had it coated with Aluma Hyde II with a two-tone balance of an earth brown frame and black slide and all operating controls. The hammer and barrel, however, are stainless. 

The parts of this gun that were updated with Wilson Combat parts and coated with Aluma Hyde are:

- Extended Beavertail
- Extended Slide Release
- Hammer (Skeletonized Blue Stainless)
- Trigger
- Extractor
- Sear
- Disconnector
- Complete New Spring Set
- Recoil Spring Guide Rod (Short)
- Recoil Spring Plunger

All other parts including the mainspring housing (arched), barrel, barrel bushing, thumb safety, and magazine release are all factory Colt and are black Aluma Hyde, with the exception of the barrel which is stainless. I also recently installed a brand new set of black Magpul 1911 grips for it. There is absolutely no signs of usage or wear on this pistol because I just got it back from the gunsmith and have yet to shoot it. The barrel, however, has normal wear on it, but still looks great.

Lightly used Stoeger Cougar. This is basically a Beretta (Stoeger is not listed hence why it is listed under Berettas). Stoeger bought the machines from Beretta to make these. It is slightly different however, the Stoeger version does have an integrated accessory rail located under the barrel. Everything works and the handgun has never had any hang ups with any type of ammunition. The rotating barrel makes this gun a fun shooter. Very little recoil, it feels like shooting a 9mm.

I don't necessarily have a set price in mind, however I've only purchased this gun so my wife could have a good, safe personal defense weapon in the car and such. However, turns out she only likes revolvers unfortunately (seeing as I just purchased this a month ago or so). We both fired one clip of 10, then I did a follow up cleaning of it since then... Other than that, it's brand new and just collecting dust on it's case. 

Just to make it clear, I have the original receipt of the gun purchase and the full case, accessories, 2 clips, almost 2 boxes of 9mm ammo (some shown in picture) and the gun of course.

Please note I also have another post coming up after this in which I will be posting a used Rossi M971 revolver (.357 magnum), in which may be included in a trade or what not."

This pistol is a great revolver and has some real power behind it, however as I haven't pulled it out of the safe in a few months... Figured someone else may enjoy it more. I've also got a post up for my 92FS Parabellum that I am trading/selling. 

Issues with the gun would be more cosmetics than anything, as you can see in the pictures - It could use a good cleaning and a bit of polishing. The scratches on the frame are all very shallow scratches, no real deep ones. The only 'broken' part is the front sight seems to have broken (plastic only). However it still sits firmly in it and shoots straight for me, so still good to go! 

Comes with the gun, a cheapo case I can spare if needed, and the ammo in picture (not much and a few types but it's all I have left for this gun at this time)."

Of course she does!

That's why I'm selling my FNX45 Tactical, even though I've put fewer than 100 rounds through it. (Not really. I'm selling it to build an SBR AK, but the Mother's Day angle sounds better.)

In case you don't know, the 45T was a .45 ACP entry in the recent Joint Combat Pistol program. Its features include 5.3"" threaded barrel, raised night sights (to see over a suppressor), tapped slide for mounting an optic (not included), 15+1 capacity, and fully ambidextrous controls! Even the trigger can be operated with either hand!

It was ultimately not selected because of the unit cost. Plus I think they shut the program down. I don't know. I just know they usually sell for $1k to $1200 new, so I'm asking 900 for mine. No ammo included, but all the original contents of the nylon case comes with it (three magazines and multiple backstraps and mounting plates). That's a snazzy range bag, by the way.

Now you and your mom can get a champion-level defensive pistol, for your home!"
