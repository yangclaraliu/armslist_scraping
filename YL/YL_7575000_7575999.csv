The tough Nitrolon polymer body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. A polycarbonate micro-textured reflector delivers a comparatively wider beam with generous peripheral light. We also make an aerospace aluminum-body version of this light, the 6PX Pro, and a single-output version with a tactical tailcap switch, the G2X Tactical.

Accurate and in Excellent condition.This heavy barrel has had about 200rds total down the tube (slow fire). Note: The 11.5"" barrel provides about 45m of ""guaranteed"" fragmentation range from the muzzle, the range at which the bullet velocity slows down to 2700fps... a 10.5"" is about 9m from the muzzle, with m193/55gr. Remember.. fragmentation is what really makes the 5.56 so devastating. 11.5 is superior to 10.5 in ballistic and terminal perfomance by a long shot and more reliable without being over gassed. Slightly quieter as well.  I dont go any shorter than 11.5 for the above reasons in a pistol/sbr/cqb type platform.Current retail is about $200 for chrome lined barrel and delta ring assy,(185+15). $150 Cash,  not interested in any trades at this time.Thanks for looking."

France was foremost in the field of standardized parts, with the British Empire flagging far behind with their iconic, economical ""Brown Bess"". The newly-formed US Army, having combat experience with both the Charleville and Brown Bess, chose overwhelmingly to adopt the Charleville's features for the first American military longarm, the 1795 Springfield.These are faithful recreations to the originals, down to minute detail. Updates over the M1766 French Land Pattern included a lighter stock, angled pan, and the addition of a cheek groove in the buttstock.Beyond the 1777, models I have available:-1842 Springfield x3-1842 Palmetto x1-1847 Springfield Carbine x1-Brown Bess, 2nd Model x1-1777 Charleville Carbine x1-1766 French Sea Pistol x1Pictured are the 1777's, I have photos available for all models but I can only add a few to any thread. Really the only major difference is wood pattern, which can be all over the place, from very mute to super exotic.Important Information:-These are 90% complete kits. While they are ready to take to the range right out of the box, you may find a cleaning is necessary to get the lock to function perfectly smoothly, not to mention to avoid getting grease all over yourself and the range. If you are a stickler for proper historical wood, the stocks will require a walnut stain (as these are teak).-Made by Rajasthan Manufacturing, same gentlemen who supply all the shops, such as Loyalist. The only differences; I don't clean your firearm, I don't stain your stock, and I don't detail your lock. But, by comparison, Middlesex currently sells their 1777 Charleville for $650, and you have to pay extra for shipping.-Caliber: .69-Stock: Rosewood/Teak-Fixings: SteelFeel free to shoot me an email anytime. Paypal is preferred method of payment, everything ships USPS Priority Ground. I am more than happy to combine shipping, so if you and some buddies have always wanted to see just how fun black powder can be, now is your chance. Prices are firm, obviously. These are the best prices for new muskets in North America, period."

($90) Nikon M223 mount. ($150) Gen 2 FAB Mako retractable bipods. ($160)I have 4 regular MAGPUL 30 regular mags and 2 see through mags that will come with it. I will throw in a Plano hard case if I get a offer. If you are seriously  interested, I have no problem letting you shoot it to see If it's comfortable for you. As you can see I have over $2,500 in this gun. I'm going to have to change the price up to 1800. But I will accept any offer. And I don't need to make a whole lot out of it. I just want to be able to build me a Ruger precision rifle and I already have the scope for it. So please feel free to make me an offer of any sort on it. And if you need any more pics of the rifle just let me know. Thank you so much, Todd Riley"
