        Fluted barrel
        Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel

The Ruger SR-762 Semiautomatic Rifle is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is ideal for those who appreciate the AR-style platform. Perfect for hunting medium- and most large-sized game and enhances the capability of the AR-style platform in defensive or tactical roles. Ruger's patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multistage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler-running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. Two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The round, smooth-sided ergonomic Ruger Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail at the 12:00 position that extends the full length of the handguard. Drilled and tapped for additional rails at the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions, offering ample space for mounting sights, lasers, lights and other accessories. Two additional rail sections included. Folding backup iron sights include a windage adjustable rear sight and an elevation-adjustable front sight. These sights provide a solid aiming system that can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, yet instantly redeployed when duty calls. For accuracy and longevity, the cold-hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel has been precision-rifled and chrome-lined. Barrel is fluted for reduced weight and improved barrel-cooling and features an SR-556®/Mini-14®-style flash suppressor mounted with a 5/8""-24 thread. Chrome-plated bolt and one-piece bolt carrier with oversized and radiused-rear bearing surface. Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock is mounted on a Mil-Spec diameter tube.

The ARX100 was engineered with one purpose in mind: to be today’s best tactical semiauto rifle. It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter.

The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.

This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.

298,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3241298,For Sale:  Adams Arms Complete Upper Gas-Piston w/ BCG+CH,"Beaverton/Tigard, Portland, Oregon",$ 425,"Listed On: Thursday, July 3, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Alright here's the deal, I bought this as a complete rifle on promotion from an online retailer as a ""half-off"" special, paid about $640 after fees+transfer for a $1300+ (MSRP) rifle. It has been fantastic, and I cleaned and oiled her and took it out to the range to test it. Fired only 200 rounds of various .223 and 5.56 flawlessly (everything from .223 PMC Bronze to surplus Lake City) and functions great. The gas piston system is pretty cool and is a cinch to remove 3 simple pieces and clean the entire upper, which is not really needed much because of the nature of how it works.

I love the rifle however I really wanted a .357, and I really can't afford to get into the AR world at the moment.  I need cash for a revolver, I'm putting up for sale the complete upper with everything you need, 100% ready to go with your complete lower. I'll save the lower to avoid the hassle of selling, and for a future project. 

I'm asking a very reasonable $425 for this package, and YES I think that is fair price, so basically I'm saying the complete lower I'm keeping is worth about $215, which in my opinion, is a very generous estimation considering the lousy furniture that was included, which as you noticed I replaced the hand guard with a standard Magpul MOE foliage green. But if you really want it I can include the original oversized hand guard if you want. So at $400, is half off their $799 (MSRP) of the complete carbine upper. I'm giving you the same deal less the lower.

This is a perfect deal for you if you wanted that kind of discount on this system, but perhaps you have some stripped lowers laying around waiting to be built or completed. Use for your own project or have as an extra for platform interchangeability. 

Thanks for looking, please contact with addition questions or to see, I'll be happy to answer your questions. Thanks, have a great Independence Day.

The 5.56 Carbine Base 16"" Upper is a standard M4 style upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

It literally had not left the box and was locked in the safe and I'm not sure how the manual ended up this way, but it is how it is.

After World War II, Italy adopted the US-designed M1 Garand rifle in .30-06 (7.62×63mm) and also manufactured it under license. This semi-automatic rifle proved itself well during World War II, but in the late 1950s it was considered outdated and obsolete and the Italian military also wanted a new rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 7.62×51mm round.

To meet these requirements, Beretta designed the BM59, which was essentially a rechambered M1 to 7.62x51(.308) fitted with a removable 20-round magazine, folding bipod and a combined flash suppressor/rifle grenade launcher."

The Sig Sauer Pro SP2022 is known as ""Sig's Best Kept Secret"". It combines the feel, look, and functionality of some of Sig's more known pistols (see P226) in a lighter, midsize package. This Gun is perfect for concealed carry (WHAT? A full size Sig light enough for concealed carry? Yep.) due to its slimmer profile, less aggressive (yet still tactile) stippling, light weight, and high capacity in a more compact size. It's larger round (.40 S&W) and amazing reliability also makes it perfect for a home security weapon. Im not trading it because it is broken or messed up or anything else negative, Im trading it because I got a Smith & Wesson M&P that fits my larger hands a little bit better.

The TA31RCO-M150CP is very similar to the TA31RCO-A4 with a unique reticle pattern that provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges. The TA31RCO-M150CP provides enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The main difference is the M150 scope has the parallax set for 300 meters the adjusters are upgraded external ones and the scope comes with attached flip-up lens covers with an embedded killflash device in the front lens cap. The TA31RCO-M150CP incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Red Tritium illuminates the TRS Chevron reticle aiming point in total darkness and the fiber-optic self-adjusts the reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. The TA31RCO-M150CP Trijicon ACOG rifle scope allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Bike is a complete 1993 Sportster with an evo motor that I was gonna throw on a hardtail frame and turn into a nice little bobber, but with a recent baby and an upcoming move I just can't keep it. The bike is complete and ran just fine before being torn down for the build, and come's with a lot of new custom parts. Bike has new king tank and softail rear fender with flush tailight tucked under it, new black 12"" mini apes, new steel braided clutch and throttle cables, screamin' eagle drag pipes that have been wrapped in black, S&S super E carb setup, new spark plugs, new screamin' eagle performance wires, new coil pack, new battery, and the bike has forward controls installed as well. Im asking what I have in parts alone.
Bike is bill of sale only as I do not have a title, but as I said it is complete and only needs minor work to make whole again, or you can tear everything off and put it on acustom frame, your choice. If you wanna make it whole and ride it as is I have the packet from the Colorado dmv with everything to retitle the bike, isn't hard just have to jump thru some hoops first and of course I will include a bill of sale to make that process smoother for you. To finish the bike you will need to paint and install the tank and fender as they are in primer right now, do the wiring in the left hand control (right hand control already wired so I could start bike), and then just do the wiring to the rear tailight amd blinkers, that is it.
If ad is up then the bike is still available, I will remove upon sale. No scams or third parties I only deal in cash in person period. These projects sale fast, get a start on your custom before it's gone. will consider partial trade on a dirt bike, an Xbox ONE for the kids, or firearms. dont really care the make of the dirt bike just as long as it is more then a 100cc."

The Caldwell XLA Bipods provide a stable shooting support that conveniently attaches to almost any firearm with a sling swivel stud. The lightweight aluminum design adds minimal weight and deploys quickly, with legs that instantly spring out to the shooting position with the touch of a button.
The legs are notched for easy indexing to a specific height. There is a connection point for sling attachment and multi section legs that collapses forward allowing for convenient carry of the firearm. Soft rubber feet provide enhanced stability, while the padded bipod base protects the firearm's forend.
In the real world of hunting, the chances of the ideal shot opportunity occurring while on a level ground are slim-to-none. A pivoting bipod will allow the shooter to compensate for ground that is unlevel by up to 20 degrees. The lower portion of the bipod pivots independently from the upper stock mount, allowing the firearm to be quickly leveled on uneven ground. The tension knob can be adjusted to control the resistance of the pivoting motion.

For sale is a used Hi-Standard Longhorn, with 500rds of 22LR (500 older CCI Blazer and probably 100rds of Remington golden bullet) and a cowboy-style holster rig.  (belt with bullet loops and holster)

I'm no Hi-Standard expert by any means, but a little quick internet research tells me that the Longhorn's serial number (134xxxx) appears to place it from 1962 according to this site:  http://www.histandard.info/datapublic/serial/rserialno.html

As with all other examples of recent completed auctions on gunbroker.com, this revolver has the cylinder wear on the left side of the frame.  I've included a couple of pictures, including one closer image of the frame wear.  Many of the recently sold on gunbroker appeared to have had black paint or pen applied to the gun to hide this - but as you can see, this one is in it's ""natural"" state... :-)

Not interested in trades - looking for cash for the family.

Gun is located in Mukilteo.  Will require signed bill of sale, DL and CPL.

$325 for revolver, 500+rds, and cowboy style holster rig.

You are about to take a look at 2 M70 Yugo AK47 kits built to feed and fire 8mm mauser ammo! Yep. Kind of like a couple of M76 carbines or something. As you can see, there is a fixed stock and an underfolder. BOTH ARE FOR SALE. They both use MG13 magazines. They have been dubbed (by me) FrankenYugo's and are about as badass as you will ever get for the money. The M70A1(ish) rifle comes with a new sling and 3 mags. The M70A2(ish) comes with 4 mags. Will sell individually or as a package. Guns were built by MY Guns in Talent Oregon and I believe he built these receivers from scratch. Bluing on both rifles done by Two Rivers Arms and both were built with NEW Israeli barrels. I have shot the B2, but both rifles were extensively test fired during builds and both function 100%. If you buy both, I will throw in the MG13 magazine carrier as well. The dust covers were extended using extra's.

By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Made in U.S.A.

Features
Polymer three-piece design with an interchangeable finger shelf that allows for a flat ""A1. style"" surface or an ""A2-style"" finger nub. Mounts to MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny and NATO. STANAG 4694 rails (min. of ~3"" recommended). All mounting hardware included"

SKU: 163690

When the first all-steel small frame (J) revolver was introduced in 1950, it became an instant success. Originally named the Chiefs Special by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, it has become the first choice for those who insist on an all steel, small frame revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance. The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads. Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

The Smith & Wesson 163690 640 Centennial Revolver in .357 Magnum features a 2.125-inch barrel, satin stainless finish, Uncle Mikes combat grip, front serrated ramp sight, rear notched sight, round butt, internal hammer, smooth target trigger, an overall length of 6.5625 inches, an unloaded weight of 23 oz, and a 5 round capacity.

There is one spot on the base where the bluing is scratched thru to the metal but it is very small. $20  Also have some .22 LR ammo I can throw in to sweeten a deal.  (not bulk so please don't call me about it)

Winchester 534REDACTED Carbine Lever-Action .44 Mag Rifle, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. For 2011, this exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3241995,For Sale:  5 Boxes Original WWII 7.35 Carcano Ammo w/Clips - Excellent Shape,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 140,"Listed On: Friday, August 1, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is my last 5 boxes of original WWII Italian Military 7.35 Carcano ammo. I've sold both my rifles and no longer need it..

Each box contains 18 rounds of ammo loaded on (3) six round, blue steel Carcano clips. The ammo and clips were given a light coating of some sort of a dry lubricant at the factory which has preserved them in fantastic condition given their 1939 production date. The boxes are in nice shape as well with no rips or tears.

There's only one, maybe two places in the country where you can buy similar ammo and GunBroker lists the most. However you'll see the lowest price starts at $35 a box and goes up to $50 a box for the same ammo I have posted here. So this is a very good deal if you need some Carcano ammo. Also these Carcano clips themselves are selling for $9 - $10 each these days. So you can shoot the ammo and then recoup most of your cost by selling the clips. Don't believe it - check out  EBay, Sarco, or GunBroker.

$140 for the 5 box lot. You must be at least 18 to purchase. 

I'm willing to ship this ammo anywhere it's legal to do so at the buyers expense."
