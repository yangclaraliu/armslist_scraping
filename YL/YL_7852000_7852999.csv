Production began in 1923 with serial number 350,001, and ended in 1946 with serial number 630,475 for a total of 153,085 pistols being produced. The math is correct as blocks of serial numbers were skipped during production. Production ended in part due to the Astra Model 300 being replaced by the Model 3000. During World War 2, Nazi Germany purchased 85,390 Astra Model 300 pistols. They ordered 63,000 pistols chambered for the 9mm Kurz and 22,390 pistols chambered in 7.65mm.

Bore is clean and rifling strong. If this pistol had been unfired it would easily fetch over $2000 but because it has been used I'm pricing it at a more affordable cost of $1449. Shop around and you will see that Diamondbacks in this condition do not come up for sale at this price, so I am pretty firm on the price!

Has an Apex trigger system, and slide has custom Stealth Cut from Slideworks Eng., that has a cut specific for the Trijicon RMR optic. The barrel is an upgraded threaded Silencerco barrel that I had custom coated in Titanium Nitride. Silencerco does not make TiN barrels and I had it professionally TiN coated and is absolutely amazing! I also have an Magpul magwell attached that has also been cerakoted in OD Green to match the frame. It sill come with a Viridian X5L light/green laser Weapon Light attached. It comes with 2 mags and they have heavy gold floor plates installed. Lastly, it will come with a Trijicon RMR01 type 2 optic, the latest version. Like i said, put about $2200 into this glock when its all said and done, I will sell for $1700 cash as is, and accept trades of $2200. I am not budging on my cash price which is beyond reasonable. Trades or trades plus cash will need to be in the ballpark of $2200. If your trade is worth $1500, and you offer $400 cash to offset, then that is not in the ballpark of $2200.

I've put maybe 300 rounds through it (and that is honestly probably on the higher side) all either FMJ or Hornady Critical defense (figuring out what flavors it liked). All brass or nickel plated cases. I like this gun, this is my second Dan Wesson, but I've found a different handgun to carry. The Eco has no holster wear, I only carried it a handful of times. Fit and finish are excellent, never had any issues with it cycling or feeding. The gun is equipped with two dot Trijicon night sights and G10 grips from the factory. Included with the price will be the factory case, 2 Dan Wesson Compact magazines, bushing tool (it's a bull barrel but still has the tool), as well as two Wilson Combat compact magazines, a Galco Gunleather Combat Master right hand OWB holster, and a single Galco magazine carrier (both holster and mag carrier are black leather). I also have a Galco Gunleather Jackass shoulder holster and mag carrier for compact 1911's that I can throw in for a little extra (straps have been cut to fit me, but they can be purchased at an uncut length online). I'm asking $1400 for everything.Only trades I'm interested in at this time is a Sig Sauer P320 X-Five plus cash on your end. I prefer to stick to the Hampton Roads area if poossible, but will travel for the right deal.

The prism-based design allows for a compact optical system while offering high-level quality. Lenses are fully multicoated with anti-reflective coatings to offer bright views in low-light settings. The red illuminated reticle features five levels of intensity to match your shooting situation. Etched directly on the prism, the reticle ensures shooters have an effective point of aim at all times, regardless if illumination is engaged. The 3X Spitfire utilizes the EBR-556B reticle, which is a hybrid with BDC drop references that subtend with the 5.56 cartridge. The reticle focuses on the rear ocular. The Multi-Height Mount System allows for 30mm and 40mm mounting heights. Flip caps keep lenses protected and free of dirt, dust and debris. Dual rails mounted on the 3X allow the optic to be joined with an offset, auxiliary-reflex sight. Shockproof construction stands up to recoil and impact. Nitrogen gas purging with O-ring seals delivers fogproof and waterproof performance. Hard-anodized matte-black finish.  Available in 1X or 3X. Uses one CR-2032 battery (included)"

As set up, this is a very light-feeling and mobile gun.  It’s lighter than my 12.5” government profile upper, and if you keep the B5 handguard, it’s slim and trim.
Excluding the cantilever mount, handguard, magazine, transfer fees, and shipping, this cost me $597.  It was shot once at Christmas 2016 and has set well-oiled and “looking cool” ever since.  In fact, I don’t know that the BCG and charging handle were even on the rifle when it was shot, as I generally kept a BCM Mod 3 CH and a Toolcraft NiB BCG on the rifle.$550 is fair...  I will consider offers of less, but understand if we drop much lower, I’ll start pulling out the extras.  The addon parts can stay as backups for me, and the barrel is actually very nice.  All that to say, I’d like to sell this, as I want to build a long-range 20” build, but I don’t have to.  
The pictures will show a rear sight, which will not be included.  Also seen in the pictures are a Magpul SL pistol grip and SL stock.  These will be replaced with standard PSA stock units on sale and will not be included.
 
Thanks for checking it out!  Feel free to ask any questions you have.  I would strongly prefer to sell this local."
