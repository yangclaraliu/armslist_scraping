Product Description
The criteria for the gun:
To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.
State of the Art:
Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.

All the factory stuff included including two 15 round mags. Looking to change things up. My first trade choice would be a high quality AK74 that also has extra mags and such. I’d be willing to trade the HK for Glocks in 9mm, preferably Gen 4with night sights. Only model I wouldn’t want is a 19. If you have a a trade that’s more expensive i might be willing to throw both guns towards the trade. I also would be willing to sell the HK for $500 OBO or trade it towards a cheaper AK in 7.62"

Accurate, and softer recoil than other 9mm’s (check out the Internet). Yes, I really love this pistol, and only selling because it has the same grip angle as the Glock,which is different from every other pistol I own. Other than that, not only would I keep it, but I’d buy a Steyr in .40, too, plus the subcompact model! But if you like Glocks, you’ll really love this gun.No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga. Price is firm."

The DefendAR-15 Bump Fire Stock for the AR-15 is CNC machined out of aircraft grade aluminum. No plastic or polymer. The DefendAR-15 stock is the highest quality, most dependable bump fire stock for the AR-15. The DefendAR-15 stock ""bumpfires"" by using human isometric muscle tension biasing forwardly against the forward grip. Bump firing is not full auto, but is as close to full auto as you can get without the hassle of federal registration and the $200.00 registration fee, not to mention the exorbitant tens of thousands of dollars for a full auto AR15. 100% legal and approved by the BATFE. It has a stock lock out that enables you to lock the stock to fire normally or unlock it to bump fire. I am a factory authorized dealer for these stocks all which are brand new in the box with full factory warranty and have never been installed on a rifle. They are legal in all the states according to federal law. It is up to individuals to check their own state law and local laws to ensure it is legal to own in their state or county or municipality (Legal in Florida). I have both the Defendar-15 for AR-15 rifles ($950.00) and the Bumpski for AK rifles ($850.00) as well as springless AA2's (springless 2.0 version Akins Accelerators for Ruger 10/22 rifle) $650.00.

Stocks similar to this have been all over the news the past week. These will likely never be produced again. The Slide Fire company has suspended taking new orders. Unlike most Bump Fire stocks this one functions as a normal telescoping stock with 6 positions of adjustment and looks much better than the others. Also the MOD model works either right or left handed and can literally be switched from one to the other in 2 seconds. With very little practice you can complete full magazine dumps. Gunbroker and other sites are moving these for upwards of $600, with some auctions going much higher. Despite recent events these stocks are a novelty meant to simulate a fully automatic rate of fire. The stock is just that, a stock, not a machine gun part. Buy it and keep it or buy it and list it elsewhere, I don't care. Deal to take place in Pierce County."

It has the carbon fiber duratouch stock and heavy stainless fluted barrel. It is currently wearing a Nikon Buckmasters 3-12x50 scope. This is the original Buckmaster scope not the new second edition cheap one. This scope was 450$ new. I have two sets of Talley mounts I’ll sell with it. The 1” that are on it now and a set of 30mm I have fornit. Up until a month ago this rifle had a Vortex PST scope on it but it’s now sold as well. RCBS dies and Norma brass will go as well as one full box and one partial box of 150gr LRAB bullets. I have a few 130 grain(probably 15) factory silver ballistic tips that it shoots 1/2” at 100 yards and some 140 gr handloads. Some other random reloading stuff such as bullets and primers will come with it. Once I start digging to find all the stuff I’ll give the buyer whatever I have reloading wise for it.  I have shot it at 500 yards on paper and it does great. I shot a 3” group at 500. I shot a deer two years ago with it at 691 yards. I don’t really want to split it up just yet but if someone doesn’t reload I’ll keep that stuff. Only trades I’m interested in are 6.5 creedmoor or 26/28 nosler, preferably a Browning but will consider others. Asking 1300$ for the setup. I have a lot more in it than that! I am willing to listen to offers on guns, cash, or 4x4 trucks and atvs. Txt call or email it doesn’t matter"

A Savage mk2 bull barrel threaded model. This rifle comes with a Nikon prostaff  rimfire optic. It's 4 power with the nikoplex reticle. Unfortunately I do not have the magazine for the rifle. They can be ordered new for around 15-20 dollars online. I have enough vested in the gun that id rather not spend any more on it. So I'll leave the magazine up to the buyer. I'm asking 250 OBO. With the optic the gun as is would cost you around 350 new.Next up is the 10/22 stainless. The rifle has a full stainless barrel/ receiver. I have a brand new two piece weaver mount I'll be selling along with it. Has a very nice wood stock as pictured. Comes with a bx-15 magazine. I haven't used the rifle very much. Put maybe 4 magazines through, totalling 60 rounds or so. Gun is very much like new. I am looking to expand my collection. And at the moment the extra money would be nice lol. Price on this rifle is 240. If you would like to purchase them together I would most likely sell for 450. I am willing to add some cash for the right trade.
