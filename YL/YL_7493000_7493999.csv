Introducing the M&P9 Shield Performance Center Ported Everyday Carry Kit. This exclusive kit from Smith & Wesson includes the M&P9 Shield Performance Center Ported, a Smith & Wesson knife, a Smith & Wesson Tactical Flashlight, and two magazines, all packed neatly inside of a notebook gun case.  Whether deployed as a backup or deep concealment sidearm for law enforcement personnel, or used by consumers for every-day carry, the M&P Shield Ported pistols combine modern-day function with superior design and control.  Engineered on a high-strength polymer frame measuring .95-inches in width, the Performance Center M&P Shield is standard with a 3.1-inch factory-ported barrel. The new barrel along with the pistol’s three precision cut ports across the top of the stainless steel slide aid in reducing muzzle flip and improve the ability to remain on target after firing. The new M&P Shield pistols have been further updated with fiber optic sights and an enhanced trigger.  Internal features of the M&P Shield Performance Center Ported mirror the standard M&P Series. Its stainless steel internal chassis reduces flex while providing a stable shooting platform and its low-bore axis helps maintain ease-of-use and a comfortable feel. A passive trigger safety prevents the pistol from firing if dropped and a sear release lever eliminates the need to press the trigger in order to disassemble the firearm. A loaded chamber indicator is located on top of the barrel.  Firearm Features  Extremely thin and lightweight - can be comfortably carried all day Polymer frame with embedded stainless steel rigid chassis system Striker-fired for short consistent trigger pull, every time Performance Center sear enhanced trigger for a crisp trigger pull M&P’s patented take-down lever and sear deactivation systems allow for disassembly without pulling the trigger HI-VIZ Fiber Optic Sights Ported barrel and slide for reduced muzzle flip Single sided thumb safety Includes 2 magazines; Tactical Flashlight; Smith & Wesson Knife; Notebook Gun Case SKU: 12067 Model: Performance Center Ported M&P9 SHIELD Caliber: 9mm Capacity: 7+1 8+1 Safety: Thumb Safety Barrel Length: 3.1” (7.9 cm) Overall Length: 6.1"" Front Sight: Fiber Optic Green Rear Sight: Fiber Optic Red Action: Striker Fire Grip: Synthetic Weight: 18.2 oz / 516.0g Barrel Material: Stainless Steel Slide Material: Stainless Steel Frame Material: Polymer Slide Finish: Armornite Frame Finish: Matte Black Purpose: Concealed Carry Personal Protection State ComplianceNo Costly Credit Card UP Charges!!

I will include their contact info in purchase. -It's a 26"" heavy barrel and Bell and Carlson tactical stock. -Adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger. -The rings are Burris Xtreme Tactical and the rail is Talley; your scope will not get knocked off.  This thing is solid. -The scope is a Zeiss 4.5-14x50. (refurbished but includes warranty card)-I had a company called Kenton Industries make a customized elevation knob for the scope that is dialed in for quick adjustments on 180 gr 300 wm rounds (the original knob is included as well). I can smack the 500 yd gong over and over with this girl. The rifle's heavy, but combine the weight with the flattened foregrip and you get an extremely stable shot from any platform/shooting house. Needless to say, this thing is way more accurate than the actual shooter. Be aware, the extractor on the bolt will likely need replaced; they tend to go out on large remington magnum calibers.  It's about a $100 dollar job by a smith. Asking 1700 or best offer.

It is non-matching, but the bluing is nearly 100%, the wood grain is gorgeous, and it shoots more accurately than I can. The scope is currently not zeroed because I messed it up and haven't had time to re-zero, but it holds zero well once obtained. The bolt handle was bent by the previous owner and the butt pad was replaced with a rubber one which does a good job of mitigating the kick the Mosins usually have. The rifling is strong and the reproduction scope is of high quality. The previous owner used this rifle in shooting matches and did well, so that speaks to the accuracy of this rifle. Armslist limits the phot uploads to 4mb, so I can't upload all of the photos. Feel free to let me know if you want more. The rifle classifies as C&R if you have a license and want it shipped, or I'm willing to meet in person within a reasonable distance from Gettysburg. Feel free to ask any questions."

This rifle is unlike any other. A lot of work has gone into this beauty. All pits have been sanded down to a smooth finish and left raw to look like NO other M44. There was over 20 hours put into the barrel and receiver of this rifle to remove pitting. It has been oiled to prevent rusting. I could have had it chromed but I couldn't see spending the money at the time. Custom one of a kind bent bolt and threaded handle that allowed for the Center Point 6x16x40 dual illuminated reticle scope. The scope is mounted to the rail that was tapped and drilled to the receiver with a close tolerance. Also custom soldered to the back of the bolt safety is a weathered skull(not another like it!)Bolt action is one of the smoothest I have seen and the bore on this rifle is excellent. The bayonet lug has been cleanly shaved off and looks like it came that way. I have seen guys customize the 91/30 by cutting the barrel down but I decided to go with the shorter M44 that is already shorter from the factory. The stock M44's are selling around $475 now believe it or not. So if you own one they are worth more now since they stopped importing them a few years ago. The stock this M44 sits in is the ProMag Archangel. The stock has a fully adjustable cheek-riser and length of pull, making it a custom fit to any shooter. This stock also allows for the 10 round magazine which is included. Great shooting rifle but I am trying to fund or trade for an AK platform rifle. I am also throwing in a sling that uses a QD mount in the back of the stock and the original wood stock and bayonet as well. I will sell for $650 or trade for an AK that shoots 7.62x39 no other calibers please. If you are looking for a one of a kind M44, this is it. All it needs is a Timney trigger(around $80) and your done. I think $650 is a more than fair price for this rifle. A stock M44 is around $475 alone right now and the stock is available for around $130. The scope was $60 and the rail was $15 not to mention the labor that has gone into it. If this post is up then it is still available. Let me know what you got. Thanks for looking and God bless! Call or text REDACTED.  Just remembered I have 40 rounds of brass cased ammo and another 40 brass cases to go with it too so you can customize loads for accuracy."

It comes with a 10 round and 17 round magazine and I will also include the alien gear holster. The rifling is strong, the handgun functions flawlessly, and I never had a jam or failure to feed.

I was told this was a design that only this model has and was designed to solve a problem with olympic shooters.  It is really a neat rifle.  Thought about keeping it, but I have to choose between it and my true passion which is traveling.  So if you are interested, feel free to either do your homework first, or use your current knowlege of it and shoot me an offer.  Thank You!I am willing to ship this firearm to your local FFL Dealer, providing you can pay with a personal check or Paypal. NO OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENT WILL BE ACCEPTED (Of course locals can still pay cash) Shipping charges are what they are. I do not add any handling fees or anything, so it depends on how you request to have it shipped and insured."
