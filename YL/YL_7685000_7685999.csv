Or I can ship it to an FFL and split the shipping with you.  This is truly a great rifle. Jeff. Bottom line is these original type REPRs from LWRCI made through approx 2014 are the most accurate LWRCI has ever made, and this is well known. They are accurate to 0.3 MOA with Federal Gold Medal Match Ammo and people that have this version of the REPR are not selling them. The newer version has a spiral fluted barrel which can change point of impact once it heats up. This was done to cut weight, which was not necessary on a precision rifle. They should have gone with the straight fluted barrel to preserve accuracy They chose looks of a spiral flute & marketing over practical sense. So if you want the most accurate AR-10 ever made, you get the original black REPR that has no fluting, and it still has the best gas piston in the industry, huge advantages of left side charging handle, all billet construction, 2 stage national match fully adjustable trigger, and more. Mine's a late 2012 model in mint condition and all instructions in the box. Mine's been kept in a safe and is my prized rifle in new condition but I am selling it because I am about to build a custom house and think I might need the money for it.  This one has been stored in a gun safe in a climate controlled home.  It's a 7.62 x 51mm LWRCI REPR, meaning it also takes 308 Winchester rounds. And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun News magazine did an in-depth write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it.

These Berettas were made to handle the higher pressures of the 40SW and reduce the felt recoil due to the heavier slide. The US Border Patrol carried 40SW Beretta Brigadiers for many years and had excellent success with them.
This 96 Brigadier is in excellent condition with very little holster wear and minor wear throughout the pistol. She comes with the original box, manual, an extra magazine, factory Beretta Hogue grips and the factory installed night sights that still have a little bit of life to them. The barrel is a short 4.25"" as with all Brigadiers and the rifling is crisp and shiny. This Beretta is a super nice hard to find 96 Brigadier!

Or I can ship it to an FFL and split the shipping with you.  This is truly a great rifle. Jeff.  This one has been stored in a gun safe in a climate controlled home.  It's a 7.62 x 51mm LWRCI REPR, meaning it also takes 308 Winchester rounds. And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun News magazine did an in-depth write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. I'm selling it for $3395. That is without the bipd. The bipod is not for sale.  CALL OR TEXT ME AT REDACTED, AND MAKE AN OFFER. THANK YOU.  JEFFNOTE:  I WILL SPLIT THE SHIPPING COST TO AN FFL OF YOUR CHOSING IF YOU WANT IT SHIPPED."

Note the discolor on the right side of the frame.  The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15[1] is a derivative of the classic 1899 K-frame (medium frame) Military and Police .38 S&W Special (aka .38 Special) six-shot double-action revolver. The M&P underwent steady evolution throughout the 20th century and S&W spun off several variations as separate models in the post World War II years. One of these was the K-38 Target Masterpiece, which began production in 1947. The Target Masterpiece included a number of new and/or special features, including a six-inch barrel with a narrow rib to provide a level sight plane, a Partridge front sight, a micrometer click rear sight, S&W’s .375” short-throw hammer, a trigger adjustment for overtravel, and improved grips.[2] Noting the accuracy of the Target Masterpiece, a number of police departments and the FBI soon requested the same revolver with a four-inch barrel and a Baughman Quick Draw front sight. The result was the K-38 Combat Masterpiece. The major distinction between the K-38 Target Masterpiece and the K-38 Combat Masterpiece is the barrel length and the front sight.[2] In 1957 the K-38 Combat Masterpiece was renamed the Model 15 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. (The Military & Police and the Target Masterpiece were renamed the Model 10 and Model 14 respectively.) The model number is stamped on the frame behind the cylinder yoke, so it is visible (only) when the cylinder is open. A number of production and engineering changes have been made throughout the years, some of which are noted by a dash number suffixed to the Model number (15-1, -2, -3). Over the years the Model 15 has been produced with several barrel lengths, with 4"" (standard) and 2"" (1964–1988) being the most common. In 1972 S&W released a stainless steel version as the Model 67. In 1997 the hammer and internal lockworks were modified from an on-the-hammer firing pin / internal hammer block to a floating firing pin / MIM flat hammer, and kept the hammer block that, unlike a transfer bar safety design, moves up with the trigger pull. The hammer hits a transfer bar, transferring the strike to the firing pin, while the block in a hammer block system moves down with the trigger pull, unblocking the hammer from the firing pin, allowing the hammer to strike the firing pin. These two safety systems work oppositely, but achieve the same goal of only allowing the gun to fire when the trigger is pulled all the way. The Model 15 was a popular sidearm for law enforcement and was the standard issue sidearm of the U.S. Air Force Police from 1962 until 1992 when it was replaced by the Beretta M9 pistol.[citation needed] Production of the Model 15 was discontinued in 1999 when Smith & Wesson was purchased and reorganized, although a couple limited run ""Heritage Series"" models were released in 2001 and 2002. In 2011 Smith & Wesson re-introduced the Model 15 (15-10) under their Classics Revolvers line, newly machined, with a shrouded redesigned barrel, and a built-in trigger lock (located just above the cylinder release thumbpiece on the left side).[2]"

Since then I've only ran about 1000 rounds through it, leaving it in fairly pristine condition. What makes this AK special is the upgraded furniture ($150), the flash hider/comp ($30), the bolt carrier polishing, and the matte black duracoat that I added to the gun. While most AK's have that rugged black/iron colored coating, this AK has a beautiful matte black coating on it.  While this is indeed a WASR-10, if you want to make it look half this good you're going to need to spend quite a bit more than this for the furniture upgrade alone. The AK comes with two 30-round P-Mags and a Steel Korean mag that I duracoated the same color as the gun. The combination looks great.  (Here is a link to a few more pictures of it: imgur.com/a/Og3j6)If you're interested in taking a look, shoot me a text at REDACTED."

Correct, this is the CZ Scorpion, but in a carbine format with a built-in faux supressor (flash can). I bought it about three months ago and since then I have put about 300 rounds through it. It shoots flawlessly, it's a CZ, what can I expect. I have taken great care of the rifle after ever time I've shot it, I've properly cleaned and lubed it. The rifle comes with TWO 30-round CZ mags as well as TWO 10-round mags. I've also installed a safety delete which, in my opinion, is an essential upgrade if you are a right-handed shooter. It's not super easy to find these online, and when you do, they're pretty expensive. I'm selling one that is in GREAT condition for a great price.

The case feeder has a plate for large rifl e and only requires 4 plates if you want to reload all calibe rs. They're about $30 on amazon.

I am getting rid of it because I have not used it in awhile, and do not have the patience to swap between calibers. Instead my buddy and I split the cost on his press so he could afford.

The wood is really nice and the bluing on the barrels I’d put at 80%+ (I’m not an expert but I’ve bought and sold many guns). There is good case hardening on the receiver. You can tell this thing has been a safe queen for quite some time. I grew up hunting with one of these and it’s still in our family. My Dad’s had his since he was a teenager and it’s never been in the shop. These things go up in value every year. The 20g bring a heck of a premium. I’ve seen them like this for close to $4K. I’m asking a fair price at $1700 so please don’t low ball or offer junk. I’m always interested in trading but I know what I’ve got so if your offer is trash that’s where your email will end up. I drive from Lenoir NC to East Tennessee weekly so can meet almost anywhere (Blowing Rock, Boone, Foscoe, Banner Elk, Mountain City, Roan Mountain, Elizabethton, Abingdon, Johnson City, Kingsport). If if you’ve been looking for one of these, you won’t be disappointed in the condition at this price."

Additionally, the SL8-1 rifle only accepts single stack mags (offered in 5, 10 and 20 round capacities) whereas the G36 accepts double stacked mags available in higher capacities. Other modifications have been made to the SL8 series of rifles including a lightened trigger pull, adjustable cheek piece and butt plate to customize the fit to the user, and a heavier, more accurate barrel. There are also a number of folks that have customized their SL8 rifles to resemble the G36 which of course, you have to option to do so with this SL8-1 rifle and for more information email me at op.we34@mail.com"

991,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7685991,For Sale/Trade:  Hisshou CKRT Knives,"Holdenville, Oklahoma, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Sunday, December 10, 2017",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm not a knife gut but I traded for these recently because they looked so cool.   Unfortuately I just really don't have a use for them so I thought I would throw them up here and see if anyone was interested.This listing has a 13 inch Hisshou knife with kydex sheath, a matching foldinging pocket knife that fits in a maxpedition sheath that is attached to the kydex sheath, and a flashlight that is attached to the kydex sheath on a rail.Not being a knife guy I don't know much about them, but the guy I traded from said he had redone and resharpened the edge on the 13 inch knife.  Both seem very sharp to me and while mybe not able to shave the hair off my arm right now, they both cut through paper like I see people on the internet do.I don't have anything specific I'm looking for.  Maybe a small .380 firearm like a used LCP II.  Just send me your reasonable offers, worst I can do is politely decline.  IF you want to purchase them I will accept reasonable cash offers as well.  More photos can be provided upon request.  Thanks!"
