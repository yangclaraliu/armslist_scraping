We have carefully inspected each of our Smith & Wesson Shields, and none of them are affected by the product warning issued by Smith & Wesson recently, in August of 2013. Here is the latest representative of Smith & Wesson's state of the art M&P series pistols, the MP9 Shield Subcompact. Never one to be upstaged by Kel-Tec or Ruger’s Kel-Tec PF9 clone, the LC9, Smith & Wesson brought its full focus on making a viable thin compact that retains all the quality and features of its reigning MP9 series. Smith & Wesson’s new M&P Shield, writes the factory, is a slim, concealable, lightweight striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18 degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. ... The M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite coated stainless steel slide and barrel. The Shield is, they continue, standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius [for its 3 dot sights] and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately. The 9mm Shield comes with a total of two stainless bodied magazines, as the photos show: an extended 8 shot and a flush fitting 7 rounder. It has a firing pin safety, and a single side lever safety for right handed shooters; with no magazine safety. Slide measures .900 thin behind the ejection port, and the frame measures .955 thin at its back extreme strut area. Best of all, a person gets Smith & Wesson M&P series quality at a price that is very competitive. We’re offering the S&W MP9 Shield in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 369.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Orders & Not Credit Card.

Rifle was first a Spikes AR that was factory built
The buttstock was swapped to a B5 SOPMOD for the nicer cheek weld when using the scope. The handgaurds were removed and swapped to the Troy Alpha rail and I have rail sections for it still. The front and rear sights included would be my MBUS pair, and not the PRO ones I got recently. I have 10 magazines for it, 9 PMAGs and 1 H&K translucent one. The charging handle is a PRI GasBuster for suppressed shooting if your into that, or it simply offers a nicer charging handle with the extended latch. KAC VFG is siting under my rail which helps with an extended hold on the rail. The optic is a PA 1-6 GenII in a PA deluxe extended mount. Has a sling mounted attached to the buffer tube. 

Also have 500 rounds of Wolf Gold and 500 Tula steel cased for sale with it or added into it for the right deal.

Without scope its $1400 and with it its another $370
Without the B5 stock it's $1300 and will come with a standard Mil-Spec stock

We have carefully inspected each of our Smith & Wesson Shields, and none of them are affected by the product warning issued by Smith & Wesson recently, in August of 2013. Here is the latest representative of Smith & Wesson's state of the art M&P series pistols, the MP40 Shield Subcompact. Smith & Wesson brought its full focus on making a viable thin compact that retains all the quality and features of its reigning MP40 series, yet comes in the bigger bore .40 S&W caliber, something Ruger has never attempted, and the only unsuccessful Kel-Tec. Smith & Wesson’s new M&P Shield, writes the factory, is a slim, concealable, lightweight striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18 degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. ... The M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite coated stainless steel slide and barrel. The Shield is, they continue, standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius [for its 3 dot sights] and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately. The .40 Shield comes with a total of two stainless bodied magazines, as the photos show: an extended 7 shot and a flush fitting 6 rounder. It has a firing pin safety, and a single side lever safety for right handed shooters; with no magazine safety. Slide measures .910 thin behind the ejection port, and the frame measures .955 thin at its back extreme strut area. Best of all, a person gets Smith & Wesson M&P series quality at a price that is very competitive. We’re offering the S&W MP40 Shield in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 369.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Orders & Not Credit Card.

The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with an 18” S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel, covered by the DDM4 Rail™ 15.0, gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing overtravel when swinging between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip. It also has a Burris 1-4x24mm Riflescope and Burris FastFire II.

Smith & Wesson 5906 TSW ""9 TACTICAL Smith & Wesson"" in excellent (new) condition. 
The 5900 model pistols are Smith & Wesson's 'Third Generation' series, replacing all previous heavy-caliber models except the Model 52. Features incorporated in these pistols include a fixed barrel bushing, greatly improved trigger pull, 3-dot sights, improved wraparound grips, beveled magazine well and a double-stack magazine.

Fitted with black hardware on the frame and slide with black accessory rail mounted under forward part of the frame. Each TSW has the frame and slide machined as a matched set with an assembly number on each half. The barrel has a loaded chamber indicator, in the barrel hood, visible as a small window or hole in which to view the rim of the cartridge. This was bought brand new in box and fired once.
It's in original factory box with lock, cleaner, (2) 15 and (2) 10 round mags. I put only 15 rounds through it. This is one of the finest and most popular duty and personal protection firearms ever manufactured. If your looking for a 9mm handgun, this one warrants serious consideration. 
The Tactical Series™ has Novak Lo Mount Carry sights for greater accuracy and are outfitted with a standard accessory equipment rail to hold a light or laser. With a checkered front strap and ambidextrous decocking lever for both right and left-handed shooters, they stand ready to perform during any emergency. Please review the photos and email me if you have any questions or would like buy it. Buyer must be at least 21 years of age.
Will only be sold through Markley's in Wasonville California. Cash purchase only.

The XD(M) 4.5” Full Size is the perfect pistol for those who are looking for full-size performance, sight radius and handling.

The XD(M) 4.5″ Full Size is the perfectly proportional combination of a 4.5″ barrel with a full-sized frame. The result is a service size pistol that’s ready for anything. The XD(M) includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs – all the way up to .45ACP. Try one today and see for yourself what a polymer pistol can be.

If you have any questions please ask! My name is Cortney and I or any other employee will be happy to answer any questions you may have!"

All original materials, including holster and mag holder that came with it.
Feed ramp and barrel tuned at factory so it will shoot any ammo, including HP, without incident.
Includes locking back strap which will stop the gun from firing while it's cocked and locked, requiring you to unlock it before it can be fired.  I tried it once and thought it was kind of stupid so left it unlocked all the time.

537,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3181537,For Sale:  *This Weekend only* Kel-Tec PMR-30 In Box With Two 30 Round Mags and Optics Rail,"West, Evansville, Indiana",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, August 8, 2014",Handguns,Kel-Tec                                                                                ,22 WMR                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"THIS WEEKEND ONLY SPECIAL!  If it does not sell this weekend, I'm just going to keep it. This is the almost impossible to find Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol.  It has had exactly 50 rounds fired from it. It is of recent manufacture, has the latest little inserts from Kel-Tec with the manual and is guaranteed for life.  I also have, still in the package, a picatinny rail that mounts on the pistol.  I just like my FN 5.7 better. 

Per Kel-Tec, the slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin. Weight is 13.6 ounces.  Caliber is .22WMR (.22 Magnum). Each magazine holds 30 rounds. The firearm is made in the US, in Cocoa, FL and comes with a lifetime warranty.

You can own this firearm and optic rail tonight for $500.00 CASH.  IF you can find one locally, it will likely cost you more and you have sales tax to pay as well.  If you buy one over the internet off an auction site, you would do well to get one here in a week and you would have to pay for shipping and transfer as well.  So, proper Indiana ID (preferably LTCH as well) and $500 gets you the PMR-30 in box AND the picatinny rail accessory, so you have a picatinny rail on the bottom (from factory) and the added picatinny rail on top for adding sighting accessories."

I will start this off by saying I really do not want to get rid of this so not entertaining any low ball offers. I am putting this out here to see if there is anyone who HAS to have it just as I did almost 25 years ago.

IF you can find one it will be over a grand but cash wise I would not take that for mine as I will never find another.
If you have some weapons that are worth allot more than what you have in them then that might work out well for both of us.
This sign was framed and presented to a terminally ill Gunny Sgt. and upon his death given to another elderly Marine and I saw it for decades sitting forgotten in a warehouse out of sight and out of mind and it drove me crazy. After decades of asking I was able to finally secure it about 5 years ago.
For some reason today after passing a Marine flag proudly being flown in someones yard I realized that although I have this tremendous tribute in a safe place of honor in my building I am still guilty of it not being in someones possession who would salute the names of the battle it remembers and the brave Marines who made the ultimate sacrifices there.

If I was well off financially I would love to donate this rare tribute but we are not so I will be looking for an offer of cash or cash and trade to pass the torch on to another passionate person.

To save us both some time: Please know that I will not respond to just anyone so please be upfront and to the point on your intentions and offer for a response. 

Absolutely NOT interested in ""pickers"" or ""flippers"" out for the fast buck after it took me 20 plus years to secure this highly desirable tribute.

Good intentions for it and a strong offer will get a response."

Description straight from Ruger:
Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.
