These are Fine precision Skull Pins machined to german-engineering specifications solid steel and insanely sharp. They are used in brain surgery to hold the skull still so they have to be able to pierce bone. I've got about 100 for sale and you can't get them easily. Asking $10 a piece, 3 for $25, or 100 for $750. 

Roughly one inch long and half an inch in diameter these things are evil(in a fun way).They are stainless steel and depending on what you shoot with them can be reusable albeit difficult to find unless your aim is true. 

Impress your friends with something that literally no one else will have and have fun and be safe.

Kick Off. Free Shipping, Add 3% for credit card. KickOff 3 Laboratory tests have shown two distinct peaks in recoil. The explosion of the ammunition is the first; the impact of the bolt against the receiver is the second. Kick-Off 3 is a third hydraulic damper that cushions this stress on the mechanical components and further reduces recoil by an additional 10% for a total recoil reduction of 70%. KickOff M The new Kick-Off MEGA reduces recoil 60% more than any other shotgun of it's kind on the market, and provides Xtreme comfort because the stock area that makes contact with the face remains stationary. Kick-Off MEGA and Kick-Off 3 are integral to the design of Beretta's A400 Xtreme and comes standard on all models. The techno-polymer material is softer and lighter than rubber and expands its surface area on the shoulder, giving the Xtreme secure and precise support.

Not one to settle for second best I purchased this gorgeous black ""little"" six shooter that goes above and beyond what any judge has to offer. Unfortunately for me my girlfriend soon fell in love with the Rock River 223/556 fully dressed AR I bought for myself. 

Bottom line, this gun is more than she could have ever expected but fails to really fit her hand comfortably (she has tiny hands). It is a dream to shoot, has been well maintained, seen very little action, and provides you with THREE calibers for a very affordable price. Only put 3 small boxes of .410, 1/2bx .45auto, and 1/2bx of .45LC down the pipe. The Crimson Trace laser really makes this an enjoyable weapon and only increases its effectiveness as a home defense or personal carry weapon. This weapon not only offers an obnoxious amount of stopping power but the appearance alone is enough to diffuse a difficult situation.

This sidearm has a msrp on S&W online of $1119.00. I am willing to let this pocket sized testosterone booster go for $900 obo.

What is that??? That is the most common thing that my customers say when they see their target for the first time.
Ultimate Targets are made with the highest quality AR500 steel on the market. They are built with care and attention to detail and are built to last for years. Used properly, a target from Ultimate Targets will outlast the shooter. Do you have a concept for a target? I can work with you to make it a reality!

DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick.

Silhouette is AR500 and 3/8"" thick and is also rated for all pistol and rifle ammunition @ 3,000fps or slower. 1/2 scale, 2/3 scale available. Target stands right at 5' tall. The legs remove to make transporting easier. 
These targets will withstand tens of thousands of bullet strikes. If you are building a shooting range, I can help you get the most targets for your budget! I can offer discounts on package deals.

The best way to reach me is by text or call 931-312-912two. Like us on Facebook as well. Look for the Ultimate Targets page. 
Every target from ULTIMATE TARGETS is made by American hands! No robots, illegal immigrants or communist mass production junk! Every target I build is made one at a time, with care, to ensure every target is built RIGHT! I guarantee all of my work. I've never had a target returned for any reason. You can buy these with the confidence that you will get a very well built target that will last you a very very long time.

That's 12+1 of 9mm in a ""subcompact"" that I might call a compact. 
Bought it in 2012, two previous owners who both bought as an investment during the gun scare. Neither carried it, and both together put <50 rounds through it. 
I've put probably 300 through it. Only one failed to eject during break in and one fail to fire. It was a slightly light strike, but also cheap ammo (WWB)  last two hundred rounds it goes bang every single time. Very reliable, quite accurate, rather comfortable. If you have large hands you can use a compact (15rd) mag for an extra finger grip. I have average size hands and the SC fits me perfectly. I've carried it a little, so the bluing has a couple small marks. 

Why the trade? I handled a P938 recently and fell in love. No room in the budget for both. Really wish there was.

This did not have the bayonet on it when I bought it a couple years back, but I prefer this setup as it lowers the weapon's overall weight. The rifle is superbly accurate. I am able to ring steel plates at 450 yards with irons without any issues. I really cannot stress enough how accurate of a platform it is. There are a couple of nicks in the stock, but I have a mint replacement wood stock I can include as well. Aside from the few minor scratches in the stock, this rifle has been meticulously cared for. I have several dozen stripper clips (31 total) that come with the SKS, almost all of which are original manufacture, which are much higher quality than the cheap John Masen or AIM brand you will find on the Interwebz. There is also a Chicom chest rig for the stripper clips. I have about 15 clips loaded and will leave the ammo on for you.

Price is $400. Would like to keep deals close to Indianapolis area. No trades at this time.

Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces: A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations. E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions.

After market recoil spring assembly and guide rod and recoil buffer. Comes with 2 15rd Glock mags and glock case and 25 rds or horrandy critical defense. I'm asking $650 for the Glock which I think is a fair price. Trade value $700.  Glock is in great shape! Can send more of different pics upon request. Located in Louisville

And that's for Federal brass case new. Avoid this sale until either he lowers prices to where they should be or he does a buy a bundle get one free.

The whole idea behind buying bulk is to save. If each box if Remington 9mm is $20 which is the case, then why pay the 120 for 5 boxes of 50 rounds.

This is a very clean commercial SKS carbine, with ALL MATCHING serial numbers on all components including the bolt, carrier, receiver, magazine, stock, top cover and fire control group. The wooden stock and upper hand-guard are particularly nice, with no noticeable scratches or dents and strong original finish remaining. Bluing and chrome are in very good + condition as well, no rust or pitting. Very solid, with VERY low round count and a bright, shiny bore with a good crown. The only flaw on this rifle is that its prior (original) owner drilled and taped the top cover for a scope mount with 6 holes (pictured). Otherwise, one of the nicer unmolested SKS carbines I've seen. Barrel is faintly marked with importer info ""CAI ST ALB VT SKS 7.62 CHINA"". Includes original cleaning rod and bayonet, as pictured.

It is 4 MOA.  I have two Aimpoint rubber covers for it (one black, one FDE) or choose to run it without your choice.  Box and manual included.  Also included are front and rear flip up covers and ARD killflash filter (eliminates reflections from the objective lens)  This red dot retails for over $600.  This model is one of the top in the Aimpoint lineup.  It is night vision compatible and able to be submersed in water to 150 feet (I've never had it in water, but nice to know if you drop it in some water, you'll be ok).  I'm selling for $350.  If you would like a mount, I have a Larue Tactical LT129 Cantilever mount with QD lever.  It works well if you run a magnifier, as the cantilever mount gets the red dot far enough forward on the rail to allow the use of a magnifier.  There is a battery compartment on this mount, and I believe I have a spare battery for the Aimpoint red dot sight in it.  This mount retails for $178.  It is about 5 years old, but still works great.  Larue obviously makes quality stuff.  I'll include it for an additional $50 along with the mount adjustment lever."
