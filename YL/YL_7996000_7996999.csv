This pistol has seen approximately 1000 rounds and is in excellent, well loved condition. Ive done a fair bit of dry fire drills, 1 USPSA match and a few solid range trips with it, so it shows signs of being used but surely not abused.The DPP was milled and installed by L&M Precision Gun Works in NC. One of the only machine shops that will mill the P30 series for a DPP. Mark did a wonderful job on the milling, coating and install of cowitnessing front sight. All drop safety mechanism are still operational (firing pin block specifically).The trigger components were worked over by Keith at GrayGuns. I opted to keep the hammer and hammer pivot pin un-stripped and coated but was assured it wouldn't make a lick of difference. I just preferred the all black look. The trigger breaks at an extremely consistent 3lb 6oz and can be slightly increased with different components easily.The following upgrades have been installed. The stock components are included.- Leupold Deltapoint Pro 3.5 or 7.5 MOA optic (you can choose, i have both) w/adjustable rear sight $400 (Plus $325 for milling, coating, suppressor front sight etc)- GrayGuns Competition Reset Reduction and springs package $380 (12+ week lead time)- HKParts V4.1 trigger kit $80- HKParts Nickel Sear Spring $10- HKParts short slide stop lever $40- HKParts low profile magwell $60 (there is a relatively obvious scratch on one side. Can be cleaned up with a little effort.)The pistol will come with its original box, paperwork, grip panels, etc. The following is also included:- 5x 10 round magazines- Red Hill Tactical double layer competition holster in Grey/Black- Various trigger springs, hammer springs, spare extractor, etc- Talon granulate grips for Medium and Large backstrap.Price: $1750 OBO.

I have had the rifle for about 5 years now, but I think it's time it went to a good home since I've honestly gotten out of collecting Mosins and am selling most of them except for a couple. The rifle overall is in typical used condition. The stock has some scrapes and dings, but it is not cracked or anything. All numbers match except the buttplate, which I understand to be common to these rifles. The front sling swivel has been replaced with a larger wire one I can only assume is field made (although that is probably questionable at best. I do not know of a better term so apologies.) The rifle does have a original Finnish sling that I added on after buying it years back, as well as a cleaning rod. The rod is in the white, but I am unsure of the maker. It was one I got at a gun show some time back as the rifle was missing its cleaning rod when I got it initially. The rifle is mostly Izhevsk parts, however the butt plate is a Tula part. The rest looks to be Izhevsk from what I can tell. The bore is really strong albeit dirty from sitting in a safe. I have not shot this rifle in the years that I have owned it. It is import marked on the barrel from CAI of St. Albans, VT. There is also the serial number stamped on the left side of the receiver. The last condition issue I wish to address is that the serial number is partially hilighted. I am at fault for that. I tried to hilight the markings on the receiver with a grease pencil probably three years ago but gave up halfway through. It should clean up though with WD-40 or similar oil and a rag. Overall, I would say it is a nice example of a Finnish rework 91/30.
 
I am asking $400 or best offer for this rifle. I am in the NE Atlanta area (Gwinnett Co.) and can meet FTF for a transaction if need be."

Only reason for selling is that I finally got around to purchasing a 7.5” upper in 300blk that I originally wanted but PSA didn’t offer until recently. The upper comes with bolt and charging handle. The upper will not come with any sights because they are going to be transferred over to my 7.5” upper. The upper will come with the SilencerCo ASR mount/brake since I am just going to direct thread my Hybrid to the 7.5” to cut down on overall length. Also, if you’ve ever owned any PSA upper and wanted to switch out handguards; you’d find that the barrel nut is most often, torqued on so damn hard that you cannot physically get it off. That was the case with this upper/barrel nut. It was brought to a gunsmith who then had to bring it to a machinist shop to get the barrel nut off so that I can install the quad rail it is now using and coming with. I tossed out the original M-Lok Rail, so it will not come with this upper. But, the hard and expensive part was done so now; you can swap rails and handguards without much effort. Also, a divot was created for the gas Block so that you can place it in the same position every time. That is also justification for the price I am setting since this is all work you’d have to do and can get pretty costly. When you make your trade offers, please consider the cost of all the gunsmithing that went into this, and also the fact that it’s not a factory PSA rail. Also, please look up the Silencerco ASR brake and going rate of a PSA complete 8.5” upper in 300blk so that the price lines up for you."

Has a fabulous stereo for being a factory stereo.  Power windows and doors and the heated seats are really nice when it's cold outside. Now for the down side.  It does have a slight oil leak on the front seal. It's nothing that I haven't been able to keep an eye on and addd when needed. The transmission will shift a little hard. I went to check the fluid level and there is no dipstick on this transmission. Apperantly you have to add the fluid in from the bottom. Not sure but I did watch a You-Tube video on it and doesn't look that difficult but it hasn't been that big of a issue. Questions Three One Seven Four Nine One Seven Nine Five Two.

IF WE AGREE I CAN CLOSE THE AUCTION AT ANY TIME! Incredible condition! I believe this gun is UNFIRED!!! I've owned guns for over 55 years and this Luger does not look to me as if it has ever been fired! I am NOT a Luger expert, but this one is exceptional. Look at the pictures closely for signs of wear! I'm not talking about just the blue, look at the parts too! I just don't see any physical wear! All the numbers that I can find are a match! They do not appear to me to be ""forced"" or redone. The serial number ends with an A.  I bought this Luger in 1994. At the time I vaguely recall the seller saying that the Luger had come from Russia. The collapse of the Soviet Union was in 1991. I believe he told me that the gun had been imported into the USA after that event. I've had questions regarding the grips, the marking on the underside of the barrel. I've also had questions about the number 26 on the left side of the gun which looks etched possibly done with an electric pencil (see picture #2). During a Google search I found a picture of grips identical to the grips on the gun. That picture indicated that they were VOPO Luger grips. I have done additional searches which have led me to believe that the gun is an East German VoPo (Volkspolizei = Peoples Police) Luger. I have taken many different pictures. Some have been cropped to show as much detail as possible. Some of the pictures have had the contrast and or the light adjusted to show more detail. If they shade of blue looks inconsistent in different pictures that would be why. The gun is a very even shade of blue! If there are additional areas you would like to see then please let me know. I will do my best to provide them for you. If you do message me, please include at least your first name and your state. I have set a reasonable reserve just a bit below the Buy It Now I will ship as soon as possible after payment has been received. I will ship through my FFL. Regarding C&R FFL's; it depends on the state and my FFL. If you are a C&R FFL and I can not for some reason ship to you due to your state laws we will work something out. Message me with your name and state. The bottom line with C&R FFL's is that I do not wish to break the law! I will not ship to California, Alaska, or Hawaii You will pay the shipping. If you have questions please ask. One last thing, I am new to Gun Broker and only have 1 feedback. I have however been on Ebay since November of 1998 and currently have 796 positive feedbacks. You can check me out on Ebay under the name Knights42. In some cases I might take PayPal, but we should correspond about that prior to your bidding. Let me close by saying that this is an exceptional Luger and I believe you will be very happy if you are the next owner!!!

It's a great gun, and fun to shoot, whether you use the fiber optic sights or the scope. While it may not sound whisper silent when you are firing, it actually directs the sound back and to the sides, keeping the sound from spooking what you are shooting at.  And if you are shooting rats in your neighbor's back yard, it won't alert them or their dogs.  Action (piston assembly) is blued steel and looks like a regular gun barrel quality. Barrel forward of the break is polymer composite, and the stock is all-weather plastic polymer. I have four tins of pellets in various styles- the Master Point and Hunter are the same, conical pellets with a dense pointed end. The Magnum is similar, but with a domed head that I found is actually more effective against small rodents (maybe it increases the impact shock). The Match has a flat face, used for punching clean holes in paper targets. I built a gun rack for it, it can either sit on a shelf or be wall mounted with a special mounting strip I built that fits into a groove in the back. The shelf has three recessed pockets made to fit the three ammo tins. It is made of pine and unfinished, you can paint, stain, or just clear coat it, and put some felt or rubber in the holder grooves. Willing to sell, but I'm more interested in trades."

I have two left, and have opted to sell off one and keep the other. I purchased this example, best as I can recall, in the late 1980's. The serial number of 08652PZ*** dates the gun, according to Browning / Miroku records, as having left the plant in 1981.The gun conservatively rates in very good plus to excellent condition. It retains nearly all of the original blue. The barrel band at the front of the forearm is apparently aluminum and displays with some thinning on the high point. There are a couple of light superficial scratches present on the frame, and another on the mag tube. The wood has average figure and retains nearly all of it's satin finish although there are a few scattered handling marks present; none of which are through the finish.The front sight was damaged when I purchased the weapon. It appeared as though the previous owner (or some Jethro wannabe gunsmith) had removed too much off the blade in an attempt to adjust it for elevation as opposed to simply using the rear sight step elevator. I ordered a new factory replacement from Western Gun Parts Ltd. (they acquired all NOS parts when Browning discontinued the Miroku B92 line), and had it professionally replaced by Kevin Wyatt of Wyatt's Guns and Repairs in Medford.There are no additional holes present in the frame or barrel. A sling swivel stud had been professionally installed in the buttstock, as was a front sling attachment located on the mag tube about 2"" in front of the end of the forearm, prior to my purchase.The gun is very accurate off sandbags and is mechanically sound. I've test fired it only, and have not hunted or carried it in the field. It's been sitting in the safe and it's time to move it along.See attached photos. Feel free to touch base if it's of interest. I'll be happy to shoot and forward additional photos and or answer any questions that you may have.PS: Don't bother texting - I can't receive or reply to them. I repeat - Do Not Text! Many thanks~Note; 1) I will not ship. Face to face sale handled through an FFL in the Rogue Valley only. 2) If you see the ad, I still have the gun. 3) I'm not interested in trades at this time."
