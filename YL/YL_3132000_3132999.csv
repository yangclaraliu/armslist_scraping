1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3132001,For Sale:  Mil-A-Spec-46100 Body Armor W/Condor Plate Carriers,"Tucson, Phoenix, Tempe, Payson Az, Tucson, Arizona",$ 200,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 3, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The available colors of the vests are ""Desert Tan"" ""OD Green"" ""Black"" NOTE: If you buy 3 or more sets I will offer a discount. If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6""
Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

Will transfer only via a licensed FFL (of your choice) to comply with Colorado's notorious and ridiculously stupid new laws.  This is a sale from my private collection but my wife and I are a licensed FFL so if you can come to me, I'll eat the Colorado Instacheck background fee.  We live in south-central Elbert county, about 70 miles southeast of Denver, and this time of year it's a beautiful drive out here.  If it isn't sold by then, I hope to be back to work in Denver next week and can bring it along to show to you.  Or I can ship it to your FFL.  Up to you.  Contact me for details.

Serial Number 21361 was produced BEFORE WW2 and was produced as a factory 20 inch barrel SHORT RIFLE in 1939. Caliber is 30 Govt'06 and there are NO Non-Factory holes or alterations. The rear bridge has NEVER been drilled and tapped. Original sights are present and the front sight is an integral part of the barrel so it is impossible to fake. Early features including the clover leaf tang and early style safety. Excellent bore and mechanics. Nearly all of the original blue remains and this short rifle has seen limited and careful use. Solid stock with strong original checkering and original butt plate. Perhaps a light coat of oil has been applied to the stock long ago. It looks great with excellent wood to metal fit. These factory short rifle model 70's are perhaps one of the most difficult variations to find especially with NO extra holes in the rear bridge as most were scoped up over the years. This is a great model 70 in collector condition sure to appreciate in value.

Its comes with a second, new, cm40 top end I acquired and then was ported by a gunsmith. The Kahr factory couldnt do it any slicker.
Either top end works 100%. Firing the ported top end, I really cant notice any increase in muzzle (or port) flash or fireball.
The ported barrel, when fired, is subtly flatter, less flip. It also does take the ""sting"" away from firing this pocket cannon, compared to the regular barrel, so it is noticeably softer.

This would be a good setup to practice with the ported top end, put the wear on that, and then carry the normal top end.

Comes with 2 mags, a 6 and 7rounder, and box, papers, lock, etc.

We live in south-central Elbert county, about 70 miles southeast of Denver, and this time of year it's a beautiful drive out here.  If it isn't sold by then, I hope to be back to work in Denver next week and can bring it along to show to you.  Or I can ship it to your FFL.  Up to you.  Contact me for details.

This is a Regent Arms R-100 1911 pistol.  I bought it last year because I wanted to experiment with doing some 1911 mods on an entry-level pistol.  Well, I got sick and haven't been able to do anything to this gun.  It might have 20 rounds through it to prove to me that it would run, but otherwise is just exactly as it was as I received it.

If you're looking for an inexpensive 1911, this GI model is for you.

Will transfer only via a licensed FFL (of your choice) to comply with Colorado's notorious and ridiculously stupid new laws.  This is a sale from my private collection but my wife and I are a licensed FFL so if you can come to me, I'll eat the Colorado Instacheck background fee.  We live in south-central Elbert county, about 70 miles southeast of Denver, and this time of year it's a beautiful drive out here.  If it isn't sold by then, I hope to be back to work in Denver next week and can bring it along to show to you.  Or I can ship it to your FFL.  Up to you.  Contact me for details.

We live in south-central Elbert county, about 70 miles southeast of Denver, and this time of year it's a beautiful drive out here.

In like new condition. I would not consider ever selling this handgun if I was still able to use it well. I have developed bad Rheumatoid Arthritis and can barley shoot it and when I do shoot almost any handgun it hurts like the devil so I am selling most of my handguns.
I ordered this gun from the factory in the .38 Super Auto caliber for use in competition which I never got to do. I paid a little over $1200.00 for it. I have the case it came in and all the original paper work. I will sell for $1000.00 that's about $350.00 less than a new one from Kimber. I have left it just as it came even with the rubber grips, at first I didn't like the looks of them but they are great to shoot with. They give you a very good control of the hand gun. With the right ammunition this caliber is as powerful as a .357 but with a lot less felt recoil. This is truly my favorite gun I have owned a number of .38 Supers over the years but this one is absolutely the best one I have ever had. No trades and please no silly lowball offers. I will look at reasonable offers. Thanks for looking."

Bluing & wood are absolutely PERFECT with the only exceptions being the four very small dings in the right-hand side of the stock. Bluing in excellent condition, although there are very minor handling marks & minor fading of bluing at the end of the muzzle. 

Bore condition is EXCELLENT. I purchased this shotgun off of the original owner who purchased it brand new. It lived in a safe almost all of it's life. The rest of the time, it was used to shoot clays. 


This is as good as it gets for a 57 year old shotgun. 


These are great shotguns for first-time buyers. Why buy a new import when you can get a nearly immaculate, fully U.S. made shotgun for the same if not less? If I didn't have to make room, this one would stay in my safe. 

Great home defense option for those who just received their pistol permit.

It is often designated the CZ 27 after the naming scheme used by the Česká zbrojovka factory for post-World War II commercial products. However, it is correctly known as vz. 27, an abbreviation of the Czech ""vzor 27"", or ""Model 27"".

After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 the pistol was folded into the German armed and police forces as the P27. Construction of the pistol continued in Czechoslovakia until the 1950s. Allegedly, the Czech military sold five and a half thousand surplus vz. 27s to the Swiss in 1973 for half a million marks. Between 620,000 and 650,000 were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. In December of 1948, a gift of five ""ČZ 247"" automatic variants of the pistol (based on both the vz. 24 and vz. 27) was sent to Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie. In 1949, the vz. pistol was exported to 28 countries, including Turkey (3,286 pistols), England, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, and Pakistan.

Known military contracts include India, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Poland.

If you know your MK II Pistols, they are becoming harder and harder to find. IMO, they are better than the MK III's because they do not have the LCI or the magazine disconnect. If I had to put a dollar amount on both pistols, Magazines, 22lr ammo, and extra parts, it would be somewhere in the ballpark of $1200.00 or so.

This Remington 1900 shotgun was made around 1906. The barrels and the receiver appear to have been duracoated and the finish looks great. The wood looks awesome and appears to have been refinished professionally. All in all, the shotgun is a great skeet and duck shooter. Everything fits nice and tight and there are no cracks on the wood. For a 100+ year old shotgun it looks to be in great condition and shoots even better. This is a 12 gauge and accepts 3 inch shells. The barrels are 30 inches long.

Clearly stamped safe/fire switch position indicators ensure that you can easily identify the service state of the rifle. 

These lowers are FULLY FUNCTIONAL. The blemishes are minor and do not affect the function of the rifle. Blemishes may include: Plating inconsistencies, Pits, Scratches and Dents. If you are the least bit concerned what the blemish is you should not buy a blemished lower. We have plenty of non-blemished models in stock at the shop. 

This factory new stripped lower receiver allows you to build a custom AR-15 from the ground up. Mil-spec dimensions and coating ensure the highest quality and correct component interface.

If a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun.

Holes, inletting and pin locations have been cut to final dimensions and accept standard AR-15 magazines and components. Clearly stamped safe/fire switch position indicators ensure that you can easily identify the service state of the rifle. 

These lowers are FULLY FUNCTIONAL. The blemishes are minor and do not affect the function of the rifle. Blemishes may include: Plating inconsistencies, Pits, Scratches and Dents. If you are the least bit concerned what the blemish is you should not buy a blemished lower. We have plenty of non-blemished models in stock at the shop. 

This factory new stripped lower receiver allows you to build a custom AR-15 from the ground up. Mil-spec dimensions and coating ensure the highest quality and correct component interface.

Federal law requires that you be 21 years or age or older to purchase a stripped receiver or frame. If a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun. However, they still are ""firearms"" by definition, and subject to the same GCA limitations as any other firearms. See Section 921

Gun shoots flawlessly and is a joy to shoot, the rotating barrel helps reduce muzzle flip and instead of snapping up it pushes back which greatly helps with accurate follow up shots. Has upgraded ""D"" trigger spring giving a noticeably lighter DA trigger pull at around 5 lbs. Also has upgraded slim controls which convert it from a type F (decocker/safety) to a type G (deckcoker only). Will come with all factory parts, Small & Medium back straps(wearing large in pics), 2 mags, box, all manuals, holster (never used)

Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.

The small, pocket-sized Vz.50 was developed during late 1940s for police use and it was chambered for the marginally powerful 7.65x17 Browning ammunition. Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the ""new"" design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame.
