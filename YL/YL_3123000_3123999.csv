This is a lightweight pistol with an unconventional trigger mechanism called ""fast action"". The frame is composed of an aluminum alloy with a matte finish, while the slide is of blued steel.

The ""fast action"" trigger mechanism allows the hammer to be decocked while still keeping the mainspring compressed. A light pull on the trigger causes the hammer to flick back, after which the pistol would behave in conventional single-action (SA) mode.

The pistol can also be fired in conventional single- and double-action (DA) modes. The ""fast action"" mode allows the trigger travel of DA mode and the trigger weight of SA mode. This allows a more accurate first shot due to the lighter weight of the trigger. It is also safer due to the longer trigger travel required to fire the pistol. The factory magazines hold 13 rounds. Smith & Wesson 59-series magazines are compatible with the DP51 but will protrude slightly.

The pistol also has an ambidextrous safety and three-dot sights. It is also equipped with a firing pin block which (as its name implies) blocks the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled. Runs perfectly with very few rounds fired. 

It comes with 1-13 round magazine. I would like to sell for $400 but may trade for something unique. I travel throughout VA as well. Thanks for looking!"

Price includes sales tax!!!

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

This is not your typical plinking AR as it is expensive to feed and belongs out putting deer on the table. I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, (5) 26 round Alexander Arms magazines, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo, I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then we go to a local FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested. If one carbine is not enough for you, I have three Alexander Arms consecutive serial number carbines waiting for that father sons hunting trip. I would be happy to sell all to you for $1000.00 each. I will pay for all the transfer and shipping fees. 
Maybe we could consider a trade for Sig’s or Benelli’s? I am really looking for a Sig M11A1, Sig M400 Carbines, or a Benelli M2. Please let me know what you have I will respond back to you.

This is professional work, not the hack jobs that you see floating around here. The cost for this labor was 200.00, but I am entertaining selling the pistol at a great price point of 500.00, or trade for like-value. 

This is a great way to get your hands on a custom piece without the shipping or lag time. 

As for the pistol, it is brand new, unfired. I purchased it specifically for building it custom, but find it is a bit aggressive for my soft jazz hands. The frame is the only custom component, and I have not sunk any more time or money into anything else. The pistol will include a holster, perhaps ammo if need be, and the factory OEM stuff. 

I am not in a hurry to get out of this. So if you are making me an offer, don't think I will accept a lowball. Sale price is firm at 500.00."

It is literally in perfect condition-it has had 5-#6 3"" turkey rounds shot through it for patterning, was cleaned, and has been in the safe since. It is an awesome shotgun by all means, but I just have too many shotty's and need some room in the safe. This slide/pump action shotgun is lightweight and chambered for 3 and 3 1/2"" magnum shells, coated for weather resistance, has the ComforTech recoil reduction system, fore end shell stop button, and enlarged trigger guard for hunting with gloves. The front sight is a very bright red bead-bar with an intermediate steel bead for perfect alignment when aiming.  

Included will be the gun, the 3 standard Benelli chokes that came with gun which are IC, M, & F, + an aftermarket turkey choke ""shown in pictures"". Gun will come in a protective gun sock with gun lock and standard tools, and if you are a local buyer you can have the other 5 shells from the box that aren't fired. 

The MSRP on these things is $639.99 + tax but the first $450 gets the whole set-up. I will ship to an FFL of your choice anywhere in the U.S. for an additional $25 even though shipping will cost more like $35-40, and I will purchase mailing insurance on it as well. 

Below is a link that shows the spec.s on the gun. My price is as low as it will go, and I am not interested in trading for anything at this time. This would make someone an awesome shotgun and I hate to see it just sitting in my safe. They are hard to find on shelves around here, but when they are-the lowest I have seen is $599.99+tax. This is a good price for a basically brand new gun. Thanks for looking!

The rifle comes in original box, Tikka scope rings and Allen wrench, sling swivels, T-handle torx, gun lock and original owners manual.

This rifle has been fired less than 40 rounds using Federal ammo. I don't use Russian ammo.  I built three AR15s in different configurations, I gave the 16"" to my kid, I'm keeping the 14.5"", and I am selling the 20"".  There is absolutely no issues with this rifle, it shoots and feeds very nicely, I just decided I prefer the short barrel.

Please don't waste our time with silly offers, I have more than $1000 invested.  I will consider guns, especially a double action 9mm, a Marlin 30-30 (pre Remington), a Keltec .32 or similar, and some cash in trade if you are reasonable about it.  I am not interested in trading up.

Unique design redirects concussion forward to provide better flash suppression than standard A2 suppressor on short-barreled AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and other centerfire gas-operated weapons. Virtually eliminates side blast to protect nearby personnel during CQB, building entries, and when shooting from inside vehicles. Lessens felt recoil and reduces muzzle rise to help keep sights on the target for fast follow up shots and superior recoil management on full-auto assault rifles, especially with barrels 13"" or shorter. High-carbon steel with matte black manganese phosphate finish stands up to the heat and pressure of thousands of rounds. Convenient, ¾"" wrench flats allow easy installation with the same wrench used to remove factory flash suppressor. Crush washer included. Each unit individually serial numbered for quality control. Fits AR all barrels with 1/2 28 threads."

I have a nice Kel Tec SU16 B for sale fairly rare gun to find. It is used and shows signs of wear but the wear marks are just typical, no scarring on the metal or stock. It cycles every kind of ammo you can think of. It is chambered in Nato so will eat .223 also.

Little info on the gun, it is a folding carbine, that stores 2 10 round mags in the butt when folded or pinned back. Gun also will use any AR 15 mag. This is a very straight shooting gun and just overall fun.

Price is OBO, also open to all trades.

Full size 1911 with one 8-round magazine ($550), one 7-round Colt factory magazine ($35 - not pictured), WRB XMH holster with thumb break and magazine pouch ($30 - not pictured), zippered locking soft case ($19), rubber Hogue grips with finger grooves ($20), wood Hogue Sig Sauer grips ($50), 8 brand new 16 lb recoil springs ($75), a used .45 caliber cleaning kit ($12), 20 rounds of Federal Premium low recoil Hydra Shok ammo ($28), and an antique leather shoulder holster with built-in spring retention ($?).

I've put exactly 132 rounds through the pistol.  The previous owner bought it and kept it new, but there's a little surface rust in the grip screw heads from replacing the grips.  He also apparently dropped it so there's a ding on the front left side of the slide, and the left corner of the hammer and safety.  Nothing which affects the mechanics of this gun.  This is considered one of the best entry-level 1911's, and shoots excellent.  Perfect if you're trying to decide if you want to go a 1911 route without paying for an expensive name, or looking for a project gun to test your gunsmithing skills on (not that it needs anything).

The previous owner told me the leather shoulder holster is from WWII, but there's no markings.  It's in pretty rough shape.  The holster needs some stitching and the shoulder strap is cracking or split in several places.

Price shown is for cash - trade value will be a little higher.  I know funds are pretty tight for a lot of us right now, so while I prefer cash I'm open to trades, especially partial trades with a bit of cash.  I would rather add ammo, mags, etc instead of cash if you have something I want that's worth significantly more, but I do have a little cash if needed for the perfect trade.

Do NOT ask what my bottom dollar is or if I still have this - I won't respond.  And please don't send me any truly insulting offers.  It's not a must-sell situation and I'm perfectly happy keeping this around, just looking for something I would use more, or a little cash for the kitty.  Otherwise feel free to ask any questions you may have.

Not a gouger just trying to get the bulk of my money out of it -- my loss is your gain.

Remington 700's are some of the best the ""Sendero"" is basically the long-range 'sniper' model sub-moa out of the box, heavy tapered barrel, great looking/feeling oversize stock with double front posts so you can have a bipod and sling, full length aluminum bedding, nice trigger -- illuminated 4-16x50mm mil.dot (1/4 moa per click), sun shade, flip up covers (sweet set up). Really a cool gun!

This gun will shoot better than most people are capable of and the .300WM is a superior cartridge. This is a 1000 meter gun out of the box and the capabilities are endless.  

Might include some ammo, case, sling etc. for a local full price offer. Mainly looking for cash but might do trade partial trade +/- cash if the right deal comes around...

Asking: $1750 OBO for gun and glass and $1250 OBO for rifle only.

Even though the silencer isn't functional it does decrease muzzle rise, adds to greater muzzle velocity of the rifle and is aesthetically pleasing. The scope is a Chinese patent replica of the Leupold Mark 4 it is accurate and has amazing visual quality designed for rifles out to 800 yards it also has fiber-optic eliminated mil dot crosshairs. I was planning on selling the rifle for $1,100.00 and the scope is an extra $250 for a grand total of $1350 or a Remington 700+ $600 cash This past weekend I put 30 rounds through it without a hitch just to make sure the rifle was functioning properly.

The wooden stock and bayonet mount has been replaced with a  Tapco Composite Patent Pending Pistol Grip Folding but-stock model in Charcoal.  The need for the stripper clips has been removed and it accepts all Tapco magazines now.  The receiver has been replaced with one that has 3 rail segments on it.  An adjustable folding Fore-End grip has been attached that also adds 3 more smaller rail segments to the front of the SKS.  I have tapped on a Flash Suppressor/Muzzle Break that dramatically reduces both the recoil, the rising of the barrel when firing rapidly, and also distributes the flash quite a lot.  I have attached a tiny150 lumen flashlight to the rail on the for-end grip.  It turns a darkened room into daylight.  I have also installed a Rangefinder Scope and Red Laser Indicator with Trigger switch.  These can be used in conjunction with each other to extremely rapidly put the weapon on target and start putting rounds down range.  Or you can fold the stock down, use the pistol grip and for-end grip and using the laser rapidly swing the weapon to bear on any target.  Or for more accuracy, fold out the stock, Fold up the for-end grip and use the Rangefinder Scope for much more accurate long range shots than most SKS users are used to from this class of weapon.  It comes with 4 full 40 round magazines, a soft sided carrying case and close to 1,000 rounds.  The barrel has been chromed and the serial numbers are highly visible.  The picture shows a shiny barrel.  This has since been re-blued and is no longer shiny and reflects nothing anymore.  I spent $650 on the Paratrooper alone.  No magazines, no rails even, nothing but a very base weapon and wooden stock.  I then started building this much more lethal beauty. This baby has well over $700 in modifications not to mention coming with close to $300 in ammo!!!  That's close to $1350 spent on her so far.  Very accurate even out to 400+ yards.  Much more accurate than any AK-47 I can tell you that.  Even more accurate at the 400 yards than a brand new Ruger Mini 14.  We are coming from Colorado into Vegas for my new job and will be living near the strip for the first month."

I have a Glock 26 in new condition.  I've put about 200 rounds through it.  Comes with everything as if you were buying new.  Fires perfectly as all Glocks do.  Trying to thin the herd.  Also has the rubber talon grips (easily removed if you don't like).  This improves grip (my opinion) and makes it more comfortable if carried against skin.  With a 15 round mag and a mag sleeve, essentially you have a Glock 19.

It is a full sized polymer framed CZ 75 with a decocker and standard 3 dot iron sights. It is Single/Double action with a mag brake (Magazines drop roughly an inch, but remain in the gun until pulled by hand) 

This gun in used with approximately 500 rounds through it. I bought it as a carry gun, but I've run into issues with it printing and location. It is a full size gun, roughly 8.25"" long and 6"" tall (5.5"" with 16 round mag). Unloaded with a factory magazine in it weighs 28 ounces (1.75 pounds roughly)

The gun runs fine and the factory and flush fit mag work great, the 2 32 round magazines jam occasionally and do no lock the slide back on the last round. 

The magazines are two 18 round CZ factory mags (shown inserted) a flush fit 16 round magazine by Mec-gar, and 2 30-32 round magazines by pro-mag. The holster is an In The Waistband holster by Old Faithful Holsters. It is good thick leather and a very strong piece of molded kydex.

The factory hard-sided case got lost during a move but I have the manual, original cleaning rod, and the larger backstrap/grip. The gun will come in a soft sided zipper-close case.

I am asking $600 or best offer. I would consider a trade for compact carry guns like Glock 19s, M&Ps, or small framed 1911s, etc etc. Trying to stay away from .40 S&W though."

Used primarily as a prop for film and television.  This is the real deal, not some airsoft garbage.  I have run this on my personal M4 on the range and it's an amazing optic.

Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock. 


Technical Information: Aimpoint CompM4 and CompM4S

Hunting: 
A monster buck is fun, but we are mostly looking to put 1-2 deer/turkey in the freezer each year. 10-100+ acres but size isnt as important as ease of access and location.  Truck/ATV access to retrieve downed game is a plus.  We would prefer to stay 45min of Salem.

We are looking for a good place for weekend practice and target shooting.  Small to medium calibers up to about 100 yards.  A good SAFE environment that wont keep the neighbors stirred up. Would prefer to stay within 20-30mins of Salem (24153).

** Finders Fee?:  If you know of a hunt club, farmer with a deer problem, maybe a neighbor with land they arent using, etc... shoot us an email.

The bottom metal appears to be a replacement because its more of a matte finish than gloss. The rifle shoots very well with the Winchester white box varmint 45 gr HP. The scope and rings are not included in sale. The only reason for selling is to shake a little money loose for a Remington 700 classic I have located. Email or text for info or pictures. $650 OBO.
