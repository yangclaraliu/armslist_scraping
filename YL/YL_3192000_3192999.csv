The CZ999 is an updated version of the CZ99 pistol. This was also imported as a railed version by Arsenal and EAA as the EZ9 or EZ99 pistol. (This pistol is not made by CZ, it just has CZ in the name.)

Milled steel slide with aluminum frame and fully chromed barrel. Has ambidextrous slide release, decocker and magazine release.

This gun is basically a cross between a Walther P88 and a Sig P226. It has the ergonomics and trigger similar to the Sig 226 in grip, size and weight. The single lever serves as both the slide lock / release and decocker and is ambidextrous on both sides. The magazine release button is also ambidextrous on both sides.

The trigger on this is very similar to Sig triggers. The double action is long and smooth with a very crisp single action. If I had to compare, I would say that Sigs have a slightly smoother and better double action, but the single action on this really nice and crisp. If you can shoot a Sig accurately, then you can shoot this just as accurate. This firearm is currently in service with the Serbian military and police.

I have about 50 rounds through the tube and it's been mainly a range toy for me. 

Asking $435 for this firearm and 5 steel magazine, plus the case it came in. I would entertain trades for a Gen 3 Glock 19 with 3-4 magazines."

As issued during World War two. The backpacks that were employed by the US armed forces at the beginning of the war were less than adequate. The primary pack was the haversack , which was designed during WWI. it was cumbersome to use and did not hold enough cargo.

A new design was developed for the fighting men in the European mountains. Known as the ""mountain backpack', the design consisted of a large main cargo area with three smaller pockets built to the front and sides. Of khaki canvas construction. The pack is supported by a metal frame. It has a large flap that secured the main cargo area. The inside of the flap has a smaller pocket where paper items, such as maps, could be secured. The flap is also where the black ink stamps are placed with the date of manufacture and the name of the company that produced it.

This backpack design was far superior than the haversack. It also inspired the development of the ALICE pack , which was used during the Vietnam war.

The main body of the US mountain backpack is attached to the metal frame by looping the straps at certain locations. The main means of securing the body comes from a leather section sewn to the top of the pack. The metal frame inserts into this section. A metal snap is then engaged to ensure the pack is held in place.

Ink stamping Hinson MFC. 1943 on inside flap. US stamp on outside flap. Has some small holes but otherwise not bad condition. Came from an estate from a gentleman that also had a lot of German captured items like bayonets and Mauser stocks. So chances are this pack was used in the European theater during WW2.

Go to www.PatriotTAC.com  for more information.
 If you were to invest in something that would determine the outcome of the rest of your life, would you consult with just anyone?  Wouldn't you seek the knowledge of professionals in that particular field?  Your choice for Concealed Carry Legal Issue training is no different.   While many firearms owners have become skilled shooters, the truth is that a high degree of confusion remains as to when the use of deadly force is legally justifiable. With so many myths surrounding the subject and the complexity of the laws as they pertain to concealed carry, there is little wonder why both police officers and otherwise law-abiding citizens find themselves being prosecuted for actions they believed were both prudent and justified. Laws by their very nature are ambiguous, confusing, and often left to the interpretation of those who do not practice law and who may not even understand the law. To ensure you possess a comprehensive understanding of the law you could hire an attorney and pay hundreds of dollars for the consultation. If you are ever in a situation where you have no alternative but to use deadly force, a good criminal defense attorney's retainer fee can start at $30,000. Fortunately, the professional instructors at Patriot Training and Consulting can provide you with this information in an easy to understand format. In comparison, the cost of attending either your initial Concealed Carry Handgun training or Legal Issues Refresher training through PatriotTAC is a small financial investment to help ensure you don’t find yourself on the wrong side of the courtroom. If you don't think you can learn a lot from a concealed carry course, than this IS the course for you! For more information and to register, go to www.PatriotTAC.com"

Not since the classic Colt Ace service models has anyone accomplished the feat that this pistol embodied. The firearms market has been awash for the past few years with inferior Pot Metal 1911 copies, with names ranging from Chiappa to Walther stamped on them. Trouble is, you can’t stick a magnet to any part of those guns’s frames or slides. Here, at last, is a well, made credible conversion. Basic pistol is the tried and true Armscor Rock Island 1911A1 in the workhorse .45 ACP caliber; and it comes with an all steel complete slide assembly chambered in .22 Long Rifle caliber. Manufacturer is Armscor of the Philippines, a solid century old company. Importer is API of Nevada. Construction is entirely matte blue military type finish steel, with the exception of the pair of flat and rounded serrated surface polymer mainspring housing back strap pieces. Both slide assemblies are 5 inch barreled Government style. The .45 Slide is classic 1911 type, and the .22 LR slide assembly is a two piece open top device that supports a solid steel .695 diameter heavy barrel with dovetailed steel front sight and slide mounted low profile black combat rear sight. The .45 slide has dual dovetailed sights as well, white cowled barrel. Both slides have full length steel guide rods, although the .22’s rod has much less diameter than its .45 ACP mate. Trigger is .325 skeleton serrated face with overtravel adjustment, steel construction, and the photo specimen broke at a smooth, second-stage-feeling 4 pounds. Hammer is .300 skeleton Commander type, mated into a beavertail grip safety. Slide release and main safety are classid government type. Weight empty is just over 36 ounces in .22 configuration, and standard 38 ounces in .45 ACP. The .45 ACP Magazine is an Italian made blue steel ACT-Mag 8 rounder, and .22 LR magazine is polymer 10 rounder with steel guided spring. Replacement pricing on an Armscor 1911 paired with one of the pot metal .22 copies will destroy $800, and a person doesn’t really have anything with that pot metal add on. We’re offering the Armscor Rock Island M1911A1 XT 22 / 45 pistol with both slide assemblies and magazines in the photos, or one of its identical mates for only $ 619.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts

This gun isn't for you.

If you're looking for a tried and true gunfighter's weapon, then, well, keep reading. This gun and the accessories that come with it, have seen some shit; real shit, in the real world. 

This is a West German marked Sig P226 9mm. It was made back in the day when Sigs were still Sigs. Are the Sigs that are being made now good? Yes, they're 'good'. I'd have no problem carrying a modern day Sig as a defensive weapon. They're fine. You know what they're not? They're not West German Sigs. Only a West German Sig is a real Sig. Sorry, I know someone will be butthurt about that but it's the truth. Also, those Sig ""M25s"" that Sig tries to tout as their Navy SEAL gun; well, that's a fine gun, but no, the tier 1 guys aren't carrying those. What are they carrying? This gun. They're carrying non-railed West German Sig P226 exactly like this one. 

This pistol served as a SWAT deputy's duty weapon right here in Florida. He was a former Navy SEAL and, after leaving the Navy and getting hired at the sheriff's office he decided he didn't want the Glocks they were issued and so instead he bought the exact same pistol he had been carrying for years in the Sandbox. Why?  He had a ton of USN issued German Sig mags (the ones you're getting here) and some holsters. 

Does it have holster wear? Yes. It has holster wear. If you're looking for showpiece then don't come see this gun. It was a duty weapon so it was well cared for but it was in and out of his holster as he worked the road in a busy part of the county. That's life; it's what happens to real guns in the hands of people who really use them and don't just collect them and talk shit on gun forums. 

This weapon has night sights and comes with the original (and fairly rare and sought after) Sig grips, as well as the more modern grips (the ones on the weapon in the picture). If you don't like the old style grips, you can easily sell them online for $75 all day long. 

Five of the six mags were US Navy issued mags issued to him in Virginia Beach, VA. These are the expensive and hard to find German zipperback mags. One of them is a Sig contracted Mec-Gar mag made in Italy. They are obviously all 15rd mags and I believe a few of them are LEO/MIL marked. The painted Safariland 6004 drop leg holster was also a USN issued piece of gear. It was ""operator modified"" to remove the upper legs strap, shorten the drop and added a retention strap which they placed around the pistol's grip when parachuting. The SERPA holster pictured is also a USN issued holster but was never worn in-theater so it's in perfect condition. Apparently all the guys used to use the Safariland 6004 and now, lately, they've all switched to the SERPA. You get both. The third holster, is his old duty holster for his sheriffs office patrol uniform. It is NOT a Navy SEAL issued holster. 

You'll get two cases with this pistol. The one pictured is the one the pistol came in. It is ""Sig Law Enforcement"" marked so it is somewhat collectable by Sig collectors... or so I am told. This gun originally came with 3 Mec-Gar mags (one of which is included) and the other two are nowhere to be found. The other case is a case for the Sig MK25 that I came into possession of. It is not the original case for this gun but, hey, it's a freebee. 

Anyway, this weapon is the real deal. You don't have to believe any of what I wrote above, but it's true. When we meet up and I explain my background you'll understand. You'd be getting a weapon with a hell of a lot of authentic history. He's a personal friend and when he switched from this full size Sig P226 to the slightly smaller P228 when he left patrol and became a detective he sold me this whole package. It's a great package but, to be honest, I'm just too much a striker fire fan so I have not been using this piece as much as it deserves because I love my Glocks. 

Anyway, if you buy this package you'll be all manly and women will love you and you'll look like a straight up operator and you'll shoot better and Hooters girls will flirt with you and actually mean it and strippers will give you their real names and your credit score will improve and you'll be better at home improvement projects and the pain in the ass kid with the loud stereo down the street will finally listen to you and slow the hell down and lower his music and all kinds of cool shit will happen to you. So buy it. Or trade me something cool for it."

I started with the hottest version of the best rifle there is, the AAC-SD model of the Remington 700 in .308 Win.  This version features a limited-edition 20"" heavy tactical barrel with a 1:10 twist and hammer-forged, threaded barrel.  I then decided to scrap the included Hogue OverMolded Pillar-Bedded bbl and order the best in the business, a Manners Composite Stocks MCS T5A DBM - T5A is the Manners tactical thumbhole stock with KWV Loggerhead adjustable cheekpiece, plus the amazing Badger Ordnance mini-chassis which is a true drop-in chassis with detachable magazines that can accept both Accuracy International (AI/AICS) mags but also the newer ""Accurate Magazine"" brand (Separate brands but similar sounding).  The stock was also customized with sling swivel studs *AND* two flush cups for QD push button sling swivels.  This was a 6+ month custom ordered stock and is better than any McMillan, HS Precision, etc.  All the world champion .50 BMG shooters are using MCS now.  The stock is in custom camo Forest Camo.

In addition, it has the best stuff on it- a Harris S-BRM 6-9"" bipod w/ pivoting , used on the Army SF 5.56mm SPR sniper rifle; a Viking  Tactics VTAC padded 2-point sling; 1.25"" VTAC QD-tactical push-button swivels; a Kinetic Research Group (KRG) polymer add-on bolt-handle knob ; 

The rifle wears a brand new , never used Nikon Monarch 5-20x44mm Side-Focus Bullet-drop-compensation reticle scope.  This amazing scope has the Nikon BDC reticle which is compatible with their ballistics calculation software ""Spot-On"" which allows you to program your scope you're using, the caliber, ammo brand, exact ammo load, and your zero and target distance and it gives you the exact aiming points so you can easily make amazing accuracy shots with incredible ease out to 1000+ yards.  You really have to check it out to see how amazing it is.  It takes the effort that the US military trains USMC/USA Snipers that can compute ridiculous ballistics firing solutions, and puts it into a few clicks on the computer, which then is used with the BDC-dots on the scope to hit where you need to hit.

The rifle has never been fired, nothing has been used.  I painstakingly assembled this custom baby, adding each piece and getting ready to rock and roll but.. I lost interest completely.  I was building it for ""when I moved to Florida"" and now that it took me an extra 1.5 years to get here, I would much rather have a different style of rifle and maybe something else completely.   The rifle is even packed in a tactical digital-camo Cabelas rifle drag-bag style case.   It's nothing short of beautiful.

-$2250- I am losing money here, part for part piece for piece this is an incredible deal.  I just am in a situation that I need to sell something and this is something I can do without - it's amazing to me it hasn't been sold , as I received tons of compliments and interest when I was putting it together.  ALSO -I am in a spot and need to sell so , I would be willing to part with the stock only for $1100 -you would pay more ordering one new AND plus a 6 month waiting period for it to be made.  It's brand new, and perfect, so I would be willing to sell it for the price I paid.  I am open to hearing your ideas on an offer but trades don't help me at this time, Cash and Carry baby. Please contact me ASAP with your interest.

In the immediate-term, I would be willing to consider a trade that accounted for about half with the other half in cash, .. I am getting emails about trades and that doesn't really help me, but I would probably consider a trade that was half-cash and half-value in trade (say a nice 1911 or a SIG 226/229 etc.)

Great rifles, but I never shoot it as much as my other ARs

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.

**Please note that the Vortex scope is for sale separately

Price WITHOUT Optic: $1200

___________________________________________________

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds. The lower is a DPMS lower with mil-spec trigger and some more Magpul furniture including pistol grip with storage, enhanced trigger guard for shooting with gloves, and lightweight 6 position buttstock.

The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

Oh boy who's looking for a beauty to add to their collection?? This is a very nice example of the high polish stainless PYTHON that Colt offer in the late 80's and 90's.

Rear sight is fully adjustable, vented rib and full underlug. Grips are original neoprene with the Colt emblem intact on both sides. A few faint marks in the finish only because it will scratch easily since it is high polished...some probably came that way from the factory...believe me when I say they are faint. To all of you serious collectors I am sure you own the polish cloth that will take these right off and make it look as new. I don't know what else I can say about this gem...she is just gorgeous!! This is one you should not miss out on if you are collecting...blue examples are must more plentiful than the high polished stainless"

This is the best stock made for a M1A or M14 as it fixes the common problems and greatly increasing accuracy while adding rails for accessories. The boost in accuracy comes from free floating the barrel from the Op-Rod guide forward, Sage's custom ""glass bedding job"", and adjustable cheek rest for scoped shooting. The only reliable way to mount optics on an M14 is the EBR scope mount. If you want one rifle to do everything from point blank to 1000 meters this is it. Sage M14 EBR rifles are used in all branches of the military as semi auto sniper rifles. This sale includes the following:

Coyote Tan Sage EBR Stock - 800$
Coyote Tan Sage EBR Scope Mount - 250$
Armscorp M14 National Match - 2300$+ on gunbroker.com
3 Checkmate 20 round magazines - 75$

Rear sight is fully adjustable, vented rib and full underlug. Grips are original neoprene with the Colt emblem intact on both sides. A few faint marks in the finish only because it will scratch easily since it is high polished...some probably came that way from the factory...believe me when I say they are faint. To all of you serious collectors I am sure you own the polish cloth that will take these right off and make it look as new. I don't know what else I can say about this gem...she is just gorgeous!! This is one you should not miss out on if you are collecting...blue examples are must more plentiful than the high polished stainless."

The added texture to your handgun, pistol grips, handguards, magazines, etc... Ensures a good grip in the worst of situations.

The light system is a ELZETTA Charlie C 333 900 lumens weapon light. This is the brightest light I have ever seen on a battle rifle. They are the main supplier to SF units around the world this light is very disorienting even in day light and is totally blinding at night its sitting in a ELZETTA XSM mount with optional side rail. Last is the best part it has a AIMSHOT LS8300 Laser try to find one of these. This is the brightest laser you have ever seen and they are only sold to SOCOM on official military POs. They are no longer sold to even law enforcement agencys. You can verify that with Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta. You can follow the beam even in day light and at night it looks like something from STAR WARS. Comes with zero tool and two different tail caps. Would rather trade than sell.

It has a DA/SA system, decocker, and comes with 3 magazines. It's very easy to switch out the .40 S&W barrel for a .357 SIG (about $150) and you have a fun way to buy more expensive ammo -- or the .22 LR barrel to save money. I really like this gun, I just find it a little heavy for summer concealed carry (it's still on the compact side and was great in spring).

The condition is a little more worn than the pictures look like and it may have been a police gun previously, but operates flawlessly. I've had it for about 4 months, having purchased it from a LGS. It is missing one of the four grip screws, which can be purchased for a few dollars (http://www.midwayusa.com/product/REDACTED/sig-sauer-grip-screw-sig-sauer-p229-357-sig-40-s-and-w).

I also have a Mossberg 715T .22 LR AR-style plinker and some defense ammo I can throw in depending on the deal.

The Range Officer is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to create a pistol that is acceptable in man different styles of shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he likes most. It is built with the same precision as the Trophy Match, and TRP models, but Springfield has removed the extras
that result in a higher price. It is everything you need in a competition model at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.  I know several FFL dealers that will transfer for $20 total.  All laws apply.
