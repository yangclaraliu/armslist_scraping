This shotgun comes in Good, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have a light amount of normal wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw normal, regular usage. There are a small handful of light nicks, scratches, and scrapes on the shotgun's wood stock, as well as in the shotgun's forearm/slide-action. The wood stock/forearm are free of any severe chips, cracks, dents, dings, staining, or discoloration, and the action slides the chamber open with relative ease. There is also some wear/tear on the receiver, in the form of shallow scratches, nicks, as well as minor discoloration and staining. The inside chamber of the receiver does show a bit more rusting, but is still in good shape. This shotgun features a 22-inch long Ribbed Barrel, that ends in post where a bead sight used to be but was knocked off. The barrel is in OK shape, though it does show signs of rusting, pitting, and discoloration. Despite its condition, this is a fantastic shotgun, that would make a wonderful addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

This shotgun comes in OK, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have an average amount of normal wear/tear, which can be attributed both to the age of the firearm, as well as the fact that it was previously owned, and saw an average amount of normal usage. The wood stock and forearm/slide-action have only a small handful of shallow nicks, and light scratches. There are no severe chips, or gouges; staining, or discoloration. There is one small, minor crack starting where the stock meets the receiver, but that is it. This shotgun's receiver is in mostly good shape, with only some minor scraping, as well as some light scratches on the outside, and some minor rusting on the inside. This shotgun features a Hard Rubber Butt-stock, and a safety switch set into the front of the trigger assembly. It also features a 28-inch long barrel, topped with a bead sight near the end. This shotgun is in fantastic condition for its age, and would make a wonderful addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

It will come with the factory mag as shown and I have an additional aftermarket mag of some sort. I'm selling this because I rarely use it and I'd like to pass it on to someone who will enjoy it.

Bought this from AIM Surplus 10 years ago as being in Excellent condition and it has not aged a day since. Definitely looks like it was either unissued or arsenal reconditioned. I wouldn't go as far as to say this has never been fired but I have never fired it and it is very clean. It is not perfect, there are 3 very small dings in the stock near the trigger guard. One of the pics shows the worst of the three. But other than that the stock is in great shape and is a great color. Everything else is in like-new condition. I bought this to have some fun shooting up cheap surplus ammo that was available at the time. But this thing was so nice that it went into my safe and I pull it out once a year to wipe it off, oil it up and then put it back. I'd love to have an SKS to shoot or modify, but not this one. The time has come to pass this on to someone else who will enjoy it. Import mark from Numrich Importing, W. Hurley NY.More pictures available upon request.Email or text REDACTEDUpdate: Will include 300 rds of Wolf steel-cased 122 gr 7.62x39 ammo in 20 rd boxes (approx $75 retail).
