Feed ramp is M4, and the rifle has a flat top upper. 10"" free-floating keymod handguard. Also included is a generic grip-pod, 2 polymer magazines, a set of FieldSport flip-up iron sights and a Vortex Strikefire II red/green dot with 4 MOA dot. The case is a pluck and pull Plano all-weather case. Has 5 latches to keep it secured closed, it's waterproof and is said to float (I'm not sure how much weight can be in the case before it loses buoyancy). This case is TSA approved.  I usually use one-piece cleaning rods, but I have an extra unopened Hoppes cleaning set for 22 caliber firearms. These rifles usually sell for around $650. Case was $70, grip-pod was $25 the mags are $25 for the pair, BUIS were about $30, and the Strikefire II is $180.  That brings the total to about $980 here. Id like to see $700 for the lot, price is negotiable, but I won't dip too low on it. It's a good rifle with a good setup. I've put about 600 rounds though it with zero failures of any sort."

This shotgun comes in OK, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have a moderate amount of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular usage. There are a number of scratches throughout the wood stock, as well as the forearm, and a couple of VERY MINORcracks, near where the stock meets the receiver. This shotgun's receiver also shows some wear/tear, in the form of light rusting, as well as some minor pitting. The inside chamber of the receiver appears to be in great shape, with little to NO rusting, staining, or discoloration. This shotgun features a 28-inch long barrel, as well as a safety switch set into the trigger assembly. Despite the wear/tear that is evident on this shotgun, it is still in working, fireable condition. This shotgun would make a great addition to anybody's collection, and was designed using Browning's original A-5 Patent!

Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly.
