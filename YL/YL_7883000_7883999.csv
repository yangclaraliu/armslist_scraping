Grip and mainspring housing are PVD coated black. Gun runs great and only has about 1,200 rounds through it. This gun weighs in a 49oz unloaded meaning very little recoil. Had trigger work done with the grip change and this now has a 15lb mainspring and SVI trigger bow with short flat insert. Initially had some extraction issues so dropped in a Brazos Customer Pro Tuned Extractor and she's run great ever since. There is some holster wear on the slide mainly in the cerakoted area as the cerakote job done by STI leaves a little to be desired. For serious buyer contact us via Call or Text 301-684-5912"

I won't lie, the M500A has seen better days. It does have some pitting and has clearly been left to the elements previously. The finish was completely removed and all parts were polished by the previous owner. There is no remaining rust that I have seen and if kept clean, should stay that way. The barrels and receiver were finished in matte black which turned out fairly nice. The wood furniture was also stripped and refinished then coated with Flex Seal which is peeling off. The foregrip was cut down about 1/4"" to allow the shotgun to be racked without hitting the side saddle on the receiver and the butt stock is missing the recoil plate. The barrels are all smooth bore. There is one 20” with green fiber optic bead, one 24” with semi-buckhorn rifle sights and one 30” with green fiber optic bead. The 20” has been well used and shows a lot of internal wear. The 24” and 30” are used but still have lots of life left. The side saddle has 6 shell capacity and has a raised picatinny rail section to mount an optic with a tunneled section below for easy use of the iron sights as well. It is pretty rough looking overall in spots but it still functions perfectly with all three barrels. This would be a great option for something you want to keep in the barn or as something you can abuse and not be worried about. It would also be great as a practice piece for learning gunsmithing or Cerakote. Currently asking $250 for the M500A bundle. I am only asking that much because it comes with the extra barrels and side saddle/rail combo. I am flexible on the price for the right deal.If you are interested, please, save us both a lot of time and review the below information. Thanks!Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue.If you decide to purchase a handgun from me, I will take down your ID and CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. If you decide to buy a long gun from me, I will check your ID and write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. The bill of sale will include identifying information for both parties and there will be a copy for me and a copy for you. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at Family Shooters Corral on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking!

Thanks!If the ad is still up, the item is still available. I will remove the ad when it sells like everyone should do on every listing anyway. CPL holders always prefered. All firearms sales (serialized parts) will require a bill of sale AND RI-060 transfer for handguns. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue. It is an ongoing issue across the entire firearms culture for some reason and every one of us should be working to do better.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at COSC on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking!
