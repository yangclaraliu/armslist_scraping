No, that doesn't mean it is abused. If you want a gun that hasn't left the box, there are plenty listed for $500 plus. Yes, I am cheaper than any other Gen 4 G17 on Armslist. I listed it to sell, not to haggle. No, that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with the gun. No, I will not accept $300. No, I do not want to keep 2 magazines for a gun I will no longer own to drop the price. Yes, I will consider any trade, but please don't be offended with a ""No thank you"" as the reply.

Rifle was sent to the Israeli Defense Force following WWII where, like many of these rifles, it was re-barreled into a .308. Rifle is very accurate, bore is clean and bright. Has original German marking and proof under floor plate. It is topped with a vintage Weaver K-60B metal body scope made in the late 60's or very early 70's. Sits in a Monte Carlo stock (I don't have the original furniture). Just put 30 rounds through this over Christmas vacation and it performed flawlessly. Great deer rifle or for whatever else you need. Just don't have time to hunt anymore. Not perfect, but it's WWII MILSURP in good condition. Not numbers matching, but again, very few of these are. MUST have LTCH and ID. Yes, I know it's not a handgun, but that's my way of ensuring we are on the up & up."

This bike currently will not start. The back story: I went to Michigan this past summer with some old friends for a guys riding weekend and brought my old 450. In the first hour of riding the engine blew and I was out of a bike so I went on craigslist and bought the cheapest old beater bike i could find locally just so I had something to ride for the weekend. I paid $1100. It ran like a raped ape the entire weekend and never had any issues. I brought it back to AL with me and it has been in my garage since. It ran when I parked it but now it will not start. Not sure if it is because of the cold weather or if the carb needs to be cleaned, or if the gas in it has ruined but it has plenty of compression and it turns over fine so there is no huge reason why it won't run. Like I said, it did when i parked it. The carb just probably needs to be cleaned or its too cold and needs different jets in the carb. Not really sure and I dont plan on taking any time to figure it out. I just need this thing out of my garage so the first $500 that comes along can have it. The rear tire has since went flat as well. Not sure why but it did have air in it at one time and it may take air again, not sure about that either. The sprockets have wear on them, the chain is stretched out a good bit and it is definitely no show piece but it did run and will run again with very little work im sure.Now for the good. It has new plastics less the front number plate, new grips, new air filter, newer plug, Renthal bars and a Pro Circuit silencer. It will also come with a new set of aluminum radiators that came with it. I just never put them on.Interested buyer only. Must be willing to meet me at the Tractor Supply in Moody. SOLD AS IS, WITH BILL OF SALEFirst come first serve, $500 cash firm or trade for an AR-15 or a Glock 19 gen 4 or 5. Call or text me anytime. 205-nine o three-404five.

This pistol was unfired when I bought it, I've put around 700 rounds through it. I carry it when I'm working so.there is some holster wear on the slide. This pistol has a suprizingly pleasant SA trigger pull, sayftey engages nicley, decocker works great and its a straight shooter. For those who dont know these little pistols are unstoppable work horses following typical Eastern European fashion, throw it in the sand, in the mud do whatever to it and it'll run great. Check out militaryarmschannel on youtube, they did a torture test on one of these and it was pretty impressive. Feeds hollow points, target ammo of all types without a hiccup. Will be sold with two magazines, a Santis leather iwb r/h concealment holster, black plastic grip and bakalite grip (shown on pistol) and about 50 rounds of brass cased HP ammunition. Open to trades."
