The serial number on this pistol is 65xxx SA. It is fitted with a 5 1/2-inch barrel with the Blue/Colored Hardened Case. This pistol has never had the cylinder even rotated & therefore, is in unfired condition & I believe this to be a 100% rated weapon. I have not found one flaw. This Colt has only been handled only to unbox, inspect & take pictures, otherwise, it sits in a gun safe in it's box. The grips are the factory grips it came with as they should match the serial numbered to this pistol if they are numbered. The vivid Blue/Color cased finish has that stunning and colorful look! The color cased finish would rate a 100% overall condition. The original Colt bluing would rate at 100%. Of course like all factory Colt boxes, the original box is serial numbered to match this Colt. The box contains the cable gun lock, instruction book, warning tag and a plastic cylinder protection ring. The outer white box itself is sound with the front section tab that shows wear age & from"

This handgun has been very well maintained by Me and the previous owner who was a law enforcement officer. Ive put 500 rounds through it with absolutley no issue. It's never misfed or jammed and performs perfectly. This gun has been trusted to keep me and my family safe and I have no doubt in my mind that this firearm would fail me. The only reason I'm selling it is I've bought a glock 21 and for the same purpose and have several other handguns that I won't part with due to sentiment or have already sold and am trying to make room and have some extra funds put back because my family is happily expecting another child. The glock will come with three 15 round magazines the factory case and has Trijicon sights. The side that was exposed while holstered has some wear on it but nothing major. I'm only asking 325 for the gun and all components so I can sell it quick but I am firm on price and wont go lower. You won't find one cheaper that functions and if you do.....well buy it. But the price I listed is very reasonable and I know it's worth every bit of it plus some but I believe in fairness and feel that someone agrees you can reach me at REDACTED if this add is up it's still available thank you.Ps I will ask you bring a valid State IDand be of age I will not sell to a minor or anyone that can't legally possess a firearm. Please no trades the only.trade I'd make is another glock 21 3rd Gen because my father in law keeps trying to get mine and his bday is soon.

Mostly Remsport ( supplier to many companys that rebrand it under another name ) , with some EGW , Wilson, Brown parts thrown in to finish it out. No sights are on the pistol ( wasnt sure what I wanted ) , but I do have some I can include. Grips are a custom checkered, brand unknown. I have a S&A 1pc msh/magwell I can included in place of the standard mainspring housing shown in the photos. Can also swap out the trigger for a flat one if the buyer wants.   This is in the natural stainless steel finish with a light polish on the slide.   I was going to cerakote it, but as with most ss firearms, you can leave it as is and if it gets scuffed or worn, hit it with some Scotchbrite.  Most parts were drop in with minimal material removal on the slides ( .0002-.0004 ) and the hammer ( light polish on sides ) .. I have 2.of.these, thats the only reason for trading. Too much redundency in the safe.   I might even consider bundling both of them for something.  $650 (700)  cash , which is alot less than what I have into it, or possible trades. I can include cash to even it out. So, for the same price as a base model 1911 in the stores or a 20yr old glock here on AL, you can havbe this optioned out 1911. Meet at my club and we can do an efa10 there. No shipping .ill donate $50 to each, comm2a and goal once this is sold / traded."

I got the rifle in a trade, and while it’s definitely a cool, unique rifle, I don’t have much use for it. What’s really cool about it is they stopped manufacturing these rifles in 2005, so they’re becoming rarer and rarer each day. Still not too hard to find parts for it yet though. The gun will come with a rail mounted red dot sight, the original carry handle/sight if you prefer that, and a case. Willing to negotiate quantity of mags and ammo included depending on cash/trade offer. Asking 1250$ OBO, not in a huge hurry to trade but will entertain trade offers.thanks, ZakREDACTED"
