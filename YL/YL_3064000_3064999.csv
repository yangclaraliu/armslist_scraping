This is the new 22 version of the pistol. I have been looking at one recent and really do not find much about them as in reviews, how picky on ammo they are. Like the other walther .22 is or the ppk one.
Am wondering if anyone has one that I might try , well never hurts to ask. Or some advice on them. I have had other .22 pistols but this one is new out and seems nice.

The reason i ask is i had a ppq before and this one is similar. I know the trigger is not even clise to a ppq but is usable and not nearly as nice of course.
I could get a buckmark or mark3 also if this one is not that great. I just thought i would ask around here."

I have a lot of random parts that I would like to get rid of (as a lot) in trade for something I can actually use. I honestly don't want to bother with selling these little things one at a time so hopefully you have an item or two that I need or we can go + or - cash from either end. I'm easy. 

Parts: 
Knights Armament RAS rail. This one is very well used and is likely a mil surplus one. Does not have the top screw but mounts perfectly and fits flush. Looks like hell but would be cool on an M4 clone or of you painted it. 

Palmetto State Armory stripped upper. This is one of their stripped blem uppers but for the life of me I cannot find the blem. I bought it but it has the logo and I just don't like logos on uppers. 

Aimpoint QRP mount with spacer. This is used but in decent condition. 

London Bridge Trading weapon catch in FDE or Coyote or whatever color that is. Brand new with LBT logo. 

Sig light/laser combo. Works great but I stripped the threads on the inside of the female end piece that the rail mounting bolt thing screws into. Again, the light works great but I don't want to mess with trying to fix it. 

3 FDE Magpul 5.56 PMag feedlip / dust covers 

Offset mount for Surefire and similar lights. This was a cheapo Amazon one but it works great. Only mounted it but never actually used it. 

3 Glock +2 (or maybe +3?) mag extenders. I was told they were for Glock 9mm mags. Never used them. 

3 random pieces to some Magpul handstop 

Two A2 grips (not Colt; no screws) 

Two older A1 grips (bought at surplus store; no screws). One of them is partially painted OD green. 

Green commercial spec buffer tube. I love the color on this but was too stupid to see that it was commercial spec when I picked it out of a parts bin at a gun show. Looks like it was maybe used but the threads are perfect. 

Set of FAKE AIRSOFT Magpul front and read BUIS in FDE. I don't even believe these are the PTS ones. I think these are Chinese garbage fakes. I have no idea where these came from. If you squint real hard they kind of look real but they are crap. Never used them. 

Maxpedition small dump pouch in FDE. Used a couple of times. Still pretty perfect. 

HK .308 mags. One is a real HK and the other two (the ones in the green magpouch thing) appear to be non HKs"

Photo is representative, but buyers’ pistols will come from the same lot, virtually identical. Dealers, Law Enforcement and collectors may take any number of very similar pistols that we have on hand, at the same per-pistol price and with no additional shipping charges. From a joint effort between the two greatest companies in our industry comes this cutting-edge, state of the art, Smith & Wesson model 99QA chambered in the popular and effective .40 S&W Caliber. Smith & Wesson Factory Number is 320219, a law enforcement sku. This particular piece served with the Springfield Massachusetts Police Department, so it helped provide security for the Smith & Wesson factory itself. The Springfield Home Boys and Girls on the PD liked the SW99QA’s unique sear system that allows a short, Quick-Action trigger pull that gauges in the 10 pound neighborhood. Frame assembly, manufactured by Walther, is high impact polymer with sure-gripping serrations and textured contours. Frame has integral Picatinny / Weaver slots for light accessory use. Sights are readily visible three-dot, low profile Night Sights with windage adjustable rear. We rate their luminosity at 60 percent of original strength from our dark room inspection. Slide is black stainless with XSE type serrations fore and aft. Mechanism is locked breech type with internal firing pin block to guard against accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped. Manufactured by Smith & Wesson, the stainless barrel is 4 inch Service Size; extreme overall length is 7 inches; maximum height is 5 1/2 inches; maximum thickness is 1.15 inches at the disassembly bar, but the grip part of the frame is only 1 inch thick. Note that the mainspring housings / backstrap parts can be easily replaced to allow shooters to adjust the contour of the grip frame. This is an amazingly good feeling, well balanced .40 S&W pistol. It is furnished with two original Law Enforcement issue blue steel bodied 12 shot magazines, sometimes Law Enforcement marked from the ban period, not an issue in most jurisdictions since the Brady Ban sunset in 2004. From its SAD serial number prefix it was manufactured in 2002. Surface wear is minimal; mainly, scouring on the slide release lever, faint whitening to the edges of the sights and slide, and moderate scouring on the sides of the grip frame. We rate it as a strong Very Good, perhaps even Excellent, specimen finishwise, since no more than 10 to 20 percent of its surfaces are affected by any kind of contact evidence by our estimate. High marks to Springfield PD for their careful weapons maintenance. This pistol comes in an original issue factory blue Smith & Wesson box with instruction manual. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. Photos, at any rate, should suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Last wholesale price on the 99QA series was $600 vicinity. Standard 99 Walthers with night sights are similarly priced, and just as scarce. We’re offering the very attractive Springfield Domiciled P99QA .40 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates		for only	$ 359.00	California DOJ Roster Status Good until 9/11/2014. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 12 shot magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement only, add $ 15 to sub One [instead of 2] new 10 round mag [until we run out], or $15 off with no magazines.

Manufacturer's Description:

Built in collaboration with Advanced Armament Corporation, the new AAC Suppressor Ready pistol is one that you will cherish for a lifetime. This one is not just another pretty face in the crowd, but rather an all business gun that comes ready to use with or without an Advanced Armament Suppressor. A steel thread-protector comes standard to protect your barrel when the suppressor is not in use.

Available through Nighthawk Custom, its Preferred Dealers or from Advanced Armament Corporation, this custom handgun is loaded with proprietary features. The first to catch your eye will be the lightening cuts on the top of the slide, mainspring housing and front strap that match the Advanced Armament Ti-Rant suppressor. As you can see from the pictures, it makes for a very attractive firearm.

The slide sports new Heinie Ledge Straight-Eight Suppressor Sights which are only available through Nighthawk Custom. These sights are designed to give you a complete sight picture over the top of the suppressor. The distinct ""ledge"" rear sight allows you to cock the weapon off of a hard surface if needed.

FEATURES:
-Proprietary Cuts on the Front Strap, Mainspring Housing and Slide Top
-Forged Frame and Slide
-Nighthawk Custom Match-Grade Blacked-Out Threaded Barrel with Thread Protector
-Medium Length Lightweight Match-Grade Blacked-Out Trigger
-Ultra-thin Aluma-Grips with Nighthawk Custom logo

, finish. This is a great revolver in very good condition. It has had a pro trigger job so that it is competition smooth on the trigger pull. One of the smoothest shooting .44 magnums you will ever see. I do have the presentation case for it but over the years the screw driver and cleaning tools have been lost. This is a revolver you have to see to appreciate. It is pictured with an aftermarket set of grips that I prefer to the big bulky Smith & Wesson grips but I do have the originals for the revolver to go with it. I will ship to your FFL if needed but you as buyer must pay the shipping costs which I am told for this gun would be approximately $100.00. When someone makes a firm offer and if they need it shipped I will take it and get an exact figure. I am not interested in any trades. I believe based upon recent sales of similar guns that this gun is priced very fairly but don't be afraid to make an offer. Thanks for looking."

The 77 Precinct was established in 1925. How the Winchester ended up in the publics hand I do not know. Perhaps the LAPD had an auction at a time when they were modernizing their equipment.

This Winchester was manufactured in 1916-17. Note on the left side of the butt stock it is stamped 77 – LAPD. Which means, 77 Precinct on 77th street in Los Angeles, CA. This rifle with saddle-ring was carried on foot petrol and on horseback. The lands and groves in the barrel are like new. 

The 77 Precinct was established in 1925. How the Winchester ended up in the publics hand I do not know. Perhaps the LAPD had an auction at a time when they were modernizing their equipment. I purchased the gun at Kerr’s Gun Shop, in El Reno, Oklahoma and I have had it approximately twenty years.

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. This is Smith & Wesson’s model 5906, 9mm caliber Adjustable Sight variant, the highest form that a standard production model 59 descendant reached, with third / rounded trigger guard configuration. Product code was 108170, feature abbreviations were 15 SH AS AM TDA, for 15 shot magazine, Adjustable Sights, Ambidextrous Safety / Decocker, Traditional Double Action. This variant was produced in relatively small numbers from 1992 until 1999. THF Serial Number Prefix dates this pistols to 1992 - 1993 production. This specimen served in corporate security at the Grand Gulf Nuclear Plant in Port Gibson, Mississippi. Construction is stainless steel, with classic satin stainless .260 serrated spur hammer and matching .304 smooth combat trigger. Sights are distinctive S&W Wing protected, mill mated adjustable 2 rear and dovetailed black anodized front. This pistol has been professionally reworked, bead blast refinished, and test fired by Black Ice Coatings in Utah. Residual detractions are negligible as the photos will show. Grips are new factory Smith & Wesson. Magazines are both later production, orange follower 15 round Law Enforcement magazines from the ban period that ended in 2005. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, note that bushing contact evidence on the muzzle area of the barrel is only moderate. We estimate that this 5906 has been fired fewer than 1000 rounds, annual qualification. The distinctive configuration of the 4 inch barrel and the full-length stainless steel guide rod made these among the most accurate 9mms ever produced. Construction is entirely stainless steel, with the exception of black anodized sights and internal springs. Weight empty is 37 1/2 ounces. No other US Manufacturer that we are aware of has produced an adjustable sight pistol of this type. We’re offering the 5906 iin the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only $ 586.00.

$340 + Tax (Cash/CC Price)

These Sig's were purchased through the Bolivian Government, but were unable to be exported. Our distributor purchased them and we are passing the savings onto you! These won't be around long, so don't delay! This is a standard P250, but comes with TWO 17RD magazines instead of ONE.
Great way to save a lot of $$$ and have a fine Sig to add to the collection!

It has never been fired. Unfortunately, I didn't take it out of my car soon enough, and it managed to accumulate a little rust on the top of the barrel. It was removed with steel wool, so it is no longer an issue. There is no rust anywhere else on the gun, internally or externally; I inspected it thoroughly to insure this. The steel wool had the effect of marginally lightening the blueing on the barrel, though it is only noticeable if you're looking for it. Otherwise, this gun is flawless. It comes with the original box and parts.

This one works great. Only thing wrong was 2 ftf's the first 50 rounds. I did my homework and found that the factory uses 14 pound recoil springs. Probably too lighten felt recoil more. I changed it out, only change I made besides grip and mags, to a 16 pound standard recoil spring. It's run the last 300 rounds perfectly. That's the total round count as well plus 3 gold dot carry ammo which worked perfectly. I love the gun. It was an impulse buy though and I need a smaller gun for carry. Gun is dead on accurate. The few fliers were my fault. Target pic posted was at 15 yards."

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. From its tour of duty in Wisconsin with the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department comes this Smith & Wesson model 4046 Steel Frame Stainless Double Action Only pistol. The 4046, of course, came into production at the request of Law Enforcement agencies who demanded a strong well balanced pistol for transitioning officers accustomed to revolvers. From its VYK serial number prefix, it was manufactured in the late 90's. Manufacturer was Smith & Wesson; product code was 102955. Construction is entirely stainless steel, except for the black anodized .304 smooth faced combat trigger and .280 bobbed hammer. Sights are 3 dot Novak type, dovetailed into the slide. The 4046, of course, is full time double action. Its safeties consist in its firing pin safety and magazine safety, those guard against firing if the pistol is dropped, and will not permit firing without a magazine. Trigger pull is a very smooth motion of approximately 12 pounds. Barrel length is 4 inch classic bell nose muzzle that locks into place consistently; and with a  matching stainless full length guide rod. These elements made 3rd Generation S&Ws incredibly accurate. Magazine capacity is 11 + 1, and this pistol comes with two ban-period Law Enforcement marked 11 shot high capacity magazines. Weight empty is a superbly balanced 39 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the trigger guard to grip frame junction. This pistol with 180 grain ammunition will not yield anything like the recoil fatigue that its competitors give. Surface wear is only moderate, and amounts to scouring on the right side of the one-piece grip, small amounts of edge scouring and holster buffing. We rate it as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos should suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. This pistol is excellent mechanically. Night sights are at about 50 to 60 percent of their original strength from our dark room inspection. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, and from the looks of the contoured area on the muzzle end of the barrel and from the exterior of the chamber area, we estimate it has been fired fewer than 1,000 rounds. The last price on 4046 before they were discontinued earlier in the decade was upwards of $700 apiece. We're offering this one, however, or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only	$ 319.00.	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 11 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement only, $15 off but no magazines, includes Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, and New York.

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. FFLs, Collectors, and Departments, however, may take any number of very similar 4043s we have at the same price. Any ammunition showing in the photos is Not included. The .40 S&W chambered metal frame Smith & Wesson pistols descended from the 59 series. Smith & Wesson brought its 4006 online in 1990, and followed with this 4043 variant, S&W sku 108528, in 1991. Here you had a real metal pistol instead of a plastic gun, yet competitive and light. The 4043’s full time double action made it easy for police departments to transition from double action revolvers, and eliminated the possibility of an officer going into a tense situation with a 3 pound single action trigger pull. The 4043 has a smooth consistent trigger pull of 10 pounds in a .6 inch travel distance on every shot. Its .260 bobbed hammer does not stand for single action. Weight empty is only 28 ounces, almost 10 ounces less than the steel frame sibling. From this specimen’s VYJ serial number prefix, it was manufactured in the mid to late 90's. It served in the State of Pennsylvania during its law enforcement career. Barrel is 4 inch stainless, with Smith & Wesson’s distinctive muzzle collar configuration that ensures consistent lock up with the bushing. Its combination with the steel full length guide rod produces the legendary accuracy of this pistol. Frame is white alloy with type 2 serrated face trigger guard, and serrated grip frame front strap. Caliber is .40 S&W, with 11 shot magazine capacity, 12 rounds fully loaded. The 4043 has a firing pin safety and a magazine safety; it will not fire with the magazine removed. Sights are Novak dovetailed front and rear black anodized that we have refurbished to standard 3 white dot configuration. Barrel, slide, and internal parts are stainless steel, with .304 smooth black anodized combat trigger that matches the hammer. Surface detractions on this pistol are moderate, principally holster wear on its edges, and moderate contact wear on its one piece black polymer grip and on its grip frame strut. We rate it as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean, and we estimate this pistol has been fired fewer than 1000 rounds annual qualification. We are furnishing it with a total of two eleven round factory magazines. Any ammunition showing in any of our photos is NOT included. Replacement pricing on the most recently produced 4043s has approached $800 apiece. We’re offering the Pennsylvanian Smith & Wesson 4043 in the photos, however, 	or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only	$ 329.00.	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilians in jurisdictions where 11 shot magazines are restricted, $20 off but no magazines. We will trade three 11 rounders for two 10 rounders all day long.

900,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3064900,For Sale/Trade:  Luger-1936 S/42 made by Mauser,"Inola Oklahoma, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 1,800","Listed On: Wednesday, June 4, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a very scarce early Pre-WWII German Luger manufactured by the Mauser factory. This was the first year that Germany stopped using the secret letter code markings for the year of manufacture on small arms. The chamber area is stamped ""1936"" and the front toggle is marked ""S/42"", the wartime code for the Mauser factory. The right side of the barrel extension has the early double ""Eagle/63"" Waffenamt proofs. It is numbered in the military fashion with the full serial number stamped on the major components and the last two digits on the various small parts. The grips are checkered walnut. 
Excellent overall with 95% of the original blue finish with wear on the edges and high spots overall with blue loss on the side plate, muzzle area front frame rails with a hint of thinning on the lower grips strap. The straw colors are vivid and remain 80% intact. The grips are excellent with nice original distinct checkering on both sides, mixed with some minor handling marks. This Luger has all matching upper serial numbers and all matching lower serial numbers as is normal for a Mauser produced luger made in 1936 and referenced in the information noted in the Gun Digest article below. 

The Luger Pistol
From Gun Digest Book, 11th Edition, 1957.
By: Fred A. Datig | April 20, 2009
The 1936 was the last year that Mauser used the traditional straw bluing on the small parts. Wartime production was starting up and demand required that the trigger, thumb safety, locking lever magazine release were converted to salt bluing in early 1937. Pre WWII manufacture means it was made as good as they ever were.
Beginning in 1936 Krieghoff, like Mauser, dated his products with the year of manufacture in numbers. A few examples may be encountered bearing dates of “1936″ and “1937″ which do not conform to the proper serial number range. These were pieces assembled from already numbered surplus parts at those later dates. These will have the 1936 S/42 upper all matching and all lower all matching. Some of the Mauser-made Lugers will be found bearing not only the commercial Mauser Banner but also carrying a date-stamp over the chamber. Such arms were originally intended for commercial sale, but when the German military forces demanded more Lugers than normal Mauser production could supply, pistols previously set aside for the commercial market were merely stamped with a date and accepted by the Army as regular issue weapons. In 1936 the secret code names were augmented. Mauser was assigned the code number “42″ in addition to the “S/42″ already in use. 

It is not unusual, then, to find Lugers bearing the code name “S/42″ and, for example, the date “1936,” and also to encounter “42″ pieces having the same date. To add to the confusion, pieces were also produced bearing the same date, “1936,” and inscribed with the commercial Mauser Banner.

Photos are representative, but buyers will receive a virtually identical specimen to the one in the photos. After 6 years of success with its 4516 Compact, Smith & Wesson introduced its first alloy frame Compact in 1996, the Value Series Compact .45 ACP, numbered model 457. SKU was 104804. The 457S and the lightweight 4513 TSW followed only in 2003. The few of us who have owned a 4513 or 4516 will notice the relatively squared slide edges on the model 457, and its black polymer dovetailed 3 dot combat sights. Construction is Carbon Steel slide with matte blue finish; and black anodized alloy frame. Barrel is 3 3/4 inch satin stainless with the distinctive muzzle collar that has always produced the 4500 series accuracy. This Pistol is traditional double action; from a resting hammer with safety on fire position, first shot is a long smooth double action pull, and the pistol goes to short pull single action after the first shot because the hammer stands cocked until the shooter disengages by throwing the safety lever, which part also serves as a decocker. This pistol also has a firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if it is dropped; and a magazine safety so that it cannot fire unless the magazine is in battery. Magazine capacity is 7+1, total 8 shot capacity of .45 ACP caliber ammunition. Hammer is .260 smooth surface factory bobbed, and trigger is .305 smooth faced combat type. Weight empty is 29 ounces; slide thickness measures only .975 inch. Overall length is 7 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut; and height is 5 3/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate. Grips are original factory issue black polymer. Surface detractions are moderate, principally edge whitening and light streaking, with contact scouring on the grips. We classify it as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is excellent and well maintained mechanically; Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate it has been fired no more than 1,000 rounds during its tour of duty, no rounds at all for a 4500 series Smith & Wesson. From its VDM serial number prefix, this pistol was manufactured in the late 90's, and it served and protected with the Officers of the Syracuse NY Police Department, issued during Chief James T. Foody’s tenure, and serving until Chief Fowler oversaw the transition to the new M&P .40s from Smith & Wesson early in 2013. Replacement pricing on the latest produced variant of this series, the 4513TSW, approached $900 when it was still in production. We’re offering the model 457 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates	 	for only     $459.00. 	Not transferable to civilian residents of California or the District of Colombia.

The genesis of modular free float rails has arrived. Building off the
TRX Extreme design that revolutionized rail based hand guards; the 
Alpha Rail utilizes a new low-profile locking mechanism, which offers 
unparalleled strength and stability. The Alpha Rail disperses heat and 
runs cooler than other close to the barrel rail systems.

With unlimited mounting options and greater heat dispersion, the Alpha 
Rail once again sets a new industry standard in modular free float design. 
The Troy Alpha Rail is machined from 6061-T6 hardened aircraft aluminum 
and finished in MIL SPEC Type III Hard Coat Anodizing. It works with any 
standard AR15 barrel nut. This kit does NOT include any detachable rails 
or the barrel nut. It does include mounting hardware

As far as I can tell, it is completely original except for the barrel and grips. However, the barrel was manufactured by High Standard which was under contract during the war to make barrels. The grips are Colt but plain plastic grips were standard at the time. These are checkered walnut with the Colt medallion and in great shape. The pistol retains much of its original bluing. After 1941 all M1A1's were parkerized. The serial number on the frame and slide match. The pistol certainly shows its age and use but is totally functional. It undoubtedly saw some action.
