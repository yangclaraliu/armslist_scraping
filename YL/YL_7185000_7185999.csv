It includes gun, Negrini case, 20,28, and .410 subgauge tubes as well as skeet and IC chokes for each tube. There is a set of 12 gauge choke tubes as well including 1 Cyl, 2 skeet, 2 IC, 1 Mod, 1 IM and wrench. Condition is very good. There is a small scuff/scratches on the right side of the stock, and a few scratches on the monoblock from where a piece of shot got in the receiver and I opened and closed several times before realizing it. Neither of these affect the function of the gun. There is also a small spot at the end of the barrel where the bluing did not take perfectly.Shipping insurance."

Ammo and a budget scope.  I would like to get a 308 or 6.5 Creedmoor as the kick is a bit too much for my liking! 
Cosmetically, the gun has some dings on it but does not look bad overall.  The gun was a floor model at Gander Mountain and must have been there for a while as the serial number of the barrel indicates it was manufactured in 2012; I am guessing it was shown for a few years in the store.  The buttplate does not look very new, and there is a bump on the outside of the barrel crown which I have been told is external to the crown so will not affect accuracy.  Glad to answer any questions on the gun and send as many pictures as you want.  I will throw in the Weaver rings as well (not pictured).
