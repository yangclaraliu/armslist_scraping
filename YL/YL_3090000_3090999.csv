Hi

I have an Anderson Manufacturing AR Pistol, it has:

9 inch barrel free floated
quad rail
Sig Sauer Tactical Butt/forearm grip as they call it
Magpul MOE pistol grip
Magpul Desert flip up sights.

For those who are not familiar with Anderson Manufacturing, they are a high end AR manufacturer, they have this new type of coating on their guns that does not require you to oil it. read about it here http://www.andersonrifles.com/

so far i have $1400 in the rifle. it has shot less than 300 rounds through it, it shoots like butter, it has recoil of a baby and it is fucking bad ass. 

since this is considered a pistol, you must be:
at least 21 years of age
a WA Resident
Not a Felon 


it comes with:
4 mags
standard a2 pistol grip
standard a2 heat shield
60 rounds of 55gr 223
safety lock



Trades Only at this point unless you're going to make me an offer i won't turn down.
Located in Bothell, WA and can travel up to 20 miles for the right deal. No more. 
I have my CPL, WA ID and I use to be a grunt :)

What makes this the rare model is due to its popularity. This is the only model that will fire while folded. So it folds for compact storage, great for backpacking. But if any a pinch will also fire like a pistol with the stock folded. Demand is high on this guy.

Another feature is the built in bipod under the forend. Polymer lower makes this an ultra light AR style rifle. Also has an AR birdcage style flash hider.

This is probably the best black powder rifle on the market at any price! This gun is over engineered in every way! Flat shooting and hard hitting! It's accuracy rivals high end target guns!
Black powder is right around the corner!  This gun can easily shoot 300+ yards with incredible accuracy! Probably the most accurate modern muzzle loader on the market! 

This gun was set up for Elk hunting and long hard hitting shots!
These are fantastic single barrel guns. They are made for accuracy and distance. It has a modular trigger group that snaps out for easy cleaning. Trigger breaks like glass at 3-3.5# with no creep or over travel at all. The recoil dampening stock takes away all trigger flinch. This rifle is one of the best engineered guns out there for the money. Go to this review link about hunting with the gun and ballistics for 50 cal and 223. http://www.shootingtimes.com/2011/01/03/longgun_reviews_st_kp1_200712/

http://www.chuckhawks.com/knight_KP1.htm

The standard load on this gun is 150 grain. It will go long and hit hard! You can also buy center fire barrels for this in 223, 270, 308, 45-70 etc..
Mounts are included but scope is NOT. I have the original box and all papers.

June 03 update:  I've taken the pistol completely apart & cleaned her up pretty good.  I would say that the bore is in VG condition & she should be a great shooter (round count is unknown).

Quote from Wiki:  ""The SW99 rendition of the popular Walther P99 is a joint collaboration between Smith & Wesson and Walther. The modified receiver used in the SW99 is supplied by Walther and is manufactured in Germany. Smith & Wesson manufactures the slide and barrel of the SW99 in the United States. Though there are slight variations in aesthetic design, the function of the SW99 is identical to its German-made counterpart.""

Per contract spec all internal parts NP3 PLUS coated and exteriors coated in Desert Tan Poly-T2. NP3 PLUS has a 1000 hour salt spry protection level per ASTM-B-117 and Poly T2 exceeds 1000 hours. We know from personal experience this HK platform is the finest piston driven platform in the world.. system expels all gases out front and literally gets wiped out with a cloth after use. By adding the aerospace contract coatings we do not oil the upper or lowers as the lubricity factors in NP3 Plus are stunning. We do routinely clean the barrels however. HK units have 16.1"" match barrels and are guaranteed sub moa, tactical upgraded charging handles, upgraded bolt systems (NP3 Plus), weep ports for water use, German G4 adjustable stocks with soft rubber recoil buttplate (swing out with storage), genuine HK German mfg rail cover port side with ergo covers starboard.

Includes military 175grain BDC Ballstic Drop Compensator with stadia (crosshairs) out to 1200 meters. Target at 900 meters put the ""9"" on it, 400 meters the ""4"" etc. Most expensive scope on the market in it's class MSRP on the Leupold website breaks 5k. Package includes the Sig Sauer MK25D. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs the fleets special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs. This Desert version features flat dark earth coated alloy frame and stainless steel slide. It also features a UID identification label, anti-corrosion coatings on controls and internal components.

From Springfield Armory Website
The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is available in your favorite calibers – 9mm, .40SW, or .45ACP. It’s time for you to get serious about winning. It’s ready. Are you?

Great handgun for purse or pocket at only 12.3 ounces. Capacity 8+1. Nickel finish with rosewood grips. Condition is definitely a 10 out of 10.

 I've had this for a year and I'm looking for something a little bigger. It has about 100 rounds through it. It is clean and well-maintained. I will include 2 magazines and I'll throw in 200 rounds of 22lr to get you started. It comes with a plastic case and trigger lock. The tip-up design makes it ideal for someone (i.e. ladies) who may have trouble racking a slide. They are $300 new (with only one mag and no ammo) so I'm pretty firm on the price of $250.00.

It features a red illuminated horseshoe reticle with bullet drop compensator and Marine Corp ranging stadia lines.

About the ACOG;

Provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges and out to 800 meters.
The TRIJICON ACOG 4x32 Scope, Army Rifle Combat Optic for the M150, TA51 Mount (TA31RCO-M150CP) was most recently chosen as the rifle combat optic of the U.S. Army. It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope incorporates the innovative Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC). This revolutionary, both-eyes-open aiming method provides you with ""instinctive"" target acquisition and increased hit potential. And, the scope's ranging is built into many of its reticles, so you only need to set zero once for a multitude of ranging distances.

Broad-band, anti-reflective coated lenses provide superior clarity and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The ACOG also offers large Eye Volume, giving you greater leeway - fore and aft, and from side to side - with which to see through the lens. Of course, once the target is acquired, the ACOG is a trusted ally to help you zero in on a perfect shot.

No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because this ACOG scope features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

The ACOG is crafted with a tough, military-grade, aluminum-alloy housing and is waterproof to depths of 100 feet - making it nearly indestructible. Only the prism housing moves, so it's much more rugged than conventional designs."

The link provided is off of Steiner's website.  Any questions, feel free to ask!  I tried to take the best pics I could using my phone.  The pictures do not do this glass justice!  I am an honest and fair individual.   Google Steiner Military 7x50R M-22 Reticle to see the retail price(1000$+) and more info.  REDACTED"

It's a gorgeous over/under 12 gauge Italian made shotgun. It's got a 28"" barrel. I'm not sure what the official specs are, because I got the gun when I was around 18, so I've had it about 12 years now and the paperwork and choke tool have been lost with the ages. Not 100% certain if the specs on the chamber say 3"" or 3.5"". I managed to put a few 3.5"" rounds through it last weekend and it didn't blow up on me, so we have that to work with. 

We've got a minor scratch on the stock, but that's about all I managed to find. It's had less than 100 rounds put through it over the course of its life. I took it out less than a week ago to triple check everything, and she's in perfect working order. She shoots well. Operated by firing pins, with a switch to control which pin goes. 

I'm asking $650 for the gun. I'm trying to cull down what I have, so I'm not looking for any trades, no matter how good they may seem to either of us. If you have any further questions, shoot me an email, but if you want me to get a whole lot more technical than what I've gotten in the ad then I'm afraid we're both up the creek. I also go to sleep early in the day through the week, so if you email me in the evening, I probably won't see it till late that night, but I will get back to you. She's a fine gun and would make an outstanding addition to anyone's collection."
