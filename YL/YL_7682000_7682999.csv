I have all of the original parts and will include them with the gun (slant muzzle break, original furniture, original grip).  I'll also throw in a sling mount for the grip.  Will sell without the rail for $500 with the original parts included.  Pmags do not seat properly because of the dong grip on the front. They function fine but you'll need to change the furniture to use them. I also have 500 rounds of Golden Tiger 7.62x39 and 7 assorted magazines if interested."

This is a BDL model that's chambered in 22-250. It has a 26"" heavy bull barrel, nicely tuned trigger, and jeweled bolt. It is the definition of tack driver, with groups consistently under 1/2 moa. This was a backup rifle, so it has a very low round count (under 90). On top of that, it has some great upgrades, including:HS Precision Fiberglass stock with adjustable butt and cheek riser - this is a $445 stock before the adjustable upgrades! It's finished in a 5 color multicam pattern.Warne Steel Picatinny RailWeaver 6 Screw RingsMeopta Meopro/Euro Instinct 4-12x50 Scope with EXT reticleEverything is cased in a Plano All-Weather locking caseThe price is $1300 for everything. The scope itself retails for over $700, so this is a steal! I can meet in the Akron area, and may travel further for a serious buyer. Any questions just email."

The gun has custom “firewood” grips and comes with 1 magazine. It was manufactured in 1943 and certain parts of the firearm are stained red from the cosmolene that the first owner, a friend of mine, cleaned off. The finish isnt perfect it’s around 75% , it was blued at the star factory and then when the Soviets gave them over to dealers, the one mine came from was reblued before being sold to civilians. All stamps are still intact and look great! This is a great collectors item. Stars that can be bought today are generally from the 70-90s era so WW2 models are not nearly as common so that is why the pricing is different. This particular pistol has a story behind it due to a eagle holding a swatztika on the grip. The original dealer who had a crate of stars knew that some stars were sold to the nazis during the war. So he attempted to sell them as Nazi owned due to the selling price of originals being 3-4 times the price of a normal WW2 Star. The stamp can be seen in person but a camera can’t focus on it. The last picture, the Ñ, is the Spanish proofmark for 1943. Beside is is the verification stamp placed by the proofhouse. Star has an official website and they show all the dates for every proofmark ever stamped on a Star product. All numbers match.This is a great piece for Spanish collectors or just someone who wants a WW2 1911! If you have any questions just ask!"

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.Sale is cash only.  New is $600.  Firm on $500 priceTransfer to occur at local FFL, buyer responsible for transfer fees."

Or I can ship it to an FFL and split the shipping with you.  This is truly a great rifle. Jeff.  This one has been stored in a gun safe in a climate controlled home.  It's a 7.62 x 51mm LWRCI REPR, meaning it also takes 308 Winchester rounds. And REPR stands for Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle. 20 inch barrel, the desireable 10 twist, best gas piston system in the industry, highly desireable left side charging handle so you don't break your cheek-weld (just reach up with left hand to grab it), billet aluminum construction for quality, and factory back up iron sights.  This rifle is known for sub MOA accuracy to 1,000 yards. Shotgun News magazine did an in-depth write up on this rifle and they got 0.3 MOA groups at 100 yds with Federal's Gold Medal Match 168 gr Sierra Matchkings.  Rifle has only had 50-60 rounds fired through it. I love the gun but I am selling it because I am moving out of state soon and want the money to go towards earnest money for a home build.  This particular model of REPR is sought after because the barrel is non-fluted and they are known for extreme accuracy. The non-fluted barrel won't warp, compared to what you risk with the newer model with a spiral fluted barrel. They should have put a straight flute on the barrel if any kind of fluting at all was to be used, but they spiral fluted it and that is not wise to have under a sustained fire or shooting in hot weather. Rifle was $3975 new. I'm selling it for $3395. That is without the bipd. The bipod is not for sale.  CALL OR TEXT ME AT REDACTED, AND MAKE AN OFFER. THANK YOU.  JEFFNOTE:  I WILL SPLIT THE SHIPPING COST TO AN FFL OF YOUR CHOSING IF YOU WANT IT SHIPPED."
