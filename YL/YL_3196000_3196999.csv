The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun. The Chiappa Model 1911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life."

The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.

From Manufacturer:

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design.

The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when our company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.

Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is.
Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 Mag holds 12+1 rounds and will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.

Ive put about 100 rounds through this and it functions smooth as hell as well as extremely accurate. This rifle was constructed for low weight while maintaining high accuracy. However you will need to sight it in again since i took the scope off for temporary use on another rifle. I have $2,200 invested in this build and threw in the sling and case to go with it. Looking to part with it because i just have too many ar's and this is the least used one. I will consider fair offers. This is not your basic cheap ar like you usually see for sale. This has high end parts that you cant get for small dollars. I will consider the upper by itself if you already have a lower to put it on. I will not respond to low ball offers."

This is a non-lethal piece of tactical equipment used to warn and temporarily blind assailants, it could also be used as a long range laser sight. 

I bought this because I have a general interest in Laser pointers and this is essentially the biggest/best one of those you can find. I bought it a while back, showed some friends and its been sitting in a drawer ever since. I am selling it because I honestly haven't gotten much use out of it and am planning on putting the money toward a vacation. 

The Laser comes with its original case, instruction manual and a pressure pad all of which can be seen in the attached pictures.

These are very hard to come by and are EXTREMELY expensive. I encourage anyone interested in this laser to Google search it for more info on its specs and retail value.

If you are interested in purchasing this laser we will need to meet somewhere (Public place in/near RVA, you may choose) and I will need to see some ID just so I know you are a legal US Citizen.

I am asking for $1,500 for the laser and when compared to its retail value you will find its quite a steal. I will entertain any reasonable offer as well as Trade offers."

It has been Ceracoated in Flat Dark Earth and would make a great SHTF rifle. Its been in the safe a while doesnt get shot much anymore. Just seeing if anyone wants to giver her a good home.

It's the very popular compact size that combines the Officers size 7 round frame with the Commander size 4.25"" barrel length making it small enough to conceal easily but large enough for easy control and comfort with a nice sight radius. They are fully stainless steel with match-grade internals.

These Commander sized models are hard to find, the stores sell out as soon as they get one with a list of customers wanting them and the distributors are all out with a back-order. This was ordered for a retirement gift for a military friend retiring after 34 years but took so long to come in that we had to get a different model for him instead to have it in time for his retirement party. It finally came in Tuesday (June 17th) but now we don't have a need for it. I got a good deal on it about $25-$30 less than the ""going price"" for a new one (assuming you can even find one) so I'm asking $775 or best offer, right at the price I paid sans the sales tax and shipping so basically saving someone taxes and you don't have to wait 6-9 weeks like we did.

If you haven't read the reviews for these things you can easily do a search; this is the SR20111 Commander. They have rosewood grips with the Ruger insignia, Novak 3-dot sights, the trigger on these are fantastically crisp with a skeletonized triangle cut, skeletonized match-grade hammer, polished feed ramp, nice sized beaver-tail grip with thumb reliefs and a larger grip bump for combat/self-defense, backstrap checkering, beveled mag well, the scalloped slide release, larger mag release button, the larger safety lever you get all the features already included that many people spend hundreds of dollars to add to 1911's.

It comes with the box, all paperwork/manuals, Ruger decal, a nice ballistic nylon carrying case with the Ruger logo, two polished stainless steel magazines, empty indicator, test-fire shell/round from the factory, a gun lock, and Lifetime warranty.

I like the gun alot, but I am a bit tight on fundage, and want to get something smaller for a CCW. The gun has always been stored in my safe, cleaned with a very light layer of ballistol over everything. I've put about 200rounds through the gun, enough to feel comfortable with it, but it's stayed as a home defense gun. The gun has never jammed, stove-piped, ftf'd, or anything unexpected. As far as reliability, shoot-ability and accuracy, I'm very impressed with the gun. 
    All that being said, since I wont have this in a holster on my belt for open carry, its a bit much for me to dream of comfortably concealing. I'd like to sell or trade this to apply toward a number of different firearms. Can uptrade so don't hesitate to ask."

The M1 carbine is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic carbine that became a standard ﬁrearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian ﬁrearm. A total of over 6.5 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II. Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies : the largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company. The Chiappa Firearms’ M1 series is a fine replica of the M1 carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight, which can be removed to leave guides free for optics mount. The barrel and bolt are made of solid steel, the trigger guard and magazine of polymer."

It also comes with walnut grips that I was told was from the factory but are a smooth wood versus a checkered wood. It is in mint condition and a great piece to any collection. You will be very happy with this Python and as you can see from the pictures, it is one of those Pythons that everyone wants to own and it is as good as it looks in the pictures. A rare find for a Colt collector.

877,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3196877,For Sale:  250 rounds of 7.62x54r in a Maxim ammo can,"Arcadia, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 65,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 2, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale: 250 rounds of belted Bulgarian made (Circle 10) 7.62x54r in a Maxim gun ammo can. Please note that this ammo can be un-belted very easily for use in rifles.

The ammo was manufactured in the Bulgarian Circle 10 factory in 1971. It is lacquer sealed and silver tipped. It has been belted on a Soviet made 250 round non-disintegrating ammo belt.

The belt is 250 links long with feed tabs at both ends with the proof mark 17/53 stamped into them. It has never been used in an MG, and as such shows no wear or rust. 

The ammo can itself is a soviet made can designed to be used in conjunction with the M1910 Maxim machine gun, or the later SG-43 Goryunov. It has the late war style canvas carry handle, and is in pretty good shape despite its age. 

While the ammo has been belted, it can still be easily removed by simply pulling it out with your fingers if you intend to use it in rifles like 91/30s or PSLs. And if you intend to leave it belted, it will feed through a Maxim, SG-43, or PKM machine gun without any problems. The ammo can will also fit just fine in any mounts designed for those 3 weapons (If you're lucky enough to own one!)

Available for local pickup only, cash only. Upon purchase I will need to see your ID to affirm that you are over the age of 18 as well. 

If you have any questions or would like additional pictures of anything, feel free to contact me via email. 

Thank you!"

Finish under the grip is excellent as well. I have 11 mags that would come with the colt, 1 of the 11 is the original. Have the original grips, the blue box and paperwork for it too.

This pistol looks and feels like new, does have the Century import mark on the slide otherwise impeccable.  Check out the barrel pic, no wear at all.
Comes with 2 mags, issue holster and cleaning rod.

Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance."
