Mostly Hot Shot and Wolf. It has worked flawlessly out of my AR.But I'm more in need of 7.62x39 AK47 ammo . So, I was hoping there's someone out there in the opposition situation, who would want to trade round for round. 100, 1000, I'm game. They cost about the same these days, so 1-for-1 makes sense to me.  Trade me your steel AK ammo for my steel AR ammo, straight up.Let me know. Cheers"

Don't need all of themThe Trijicon Miniature Rifle Optic (MRO®) is a reflex-style, sealed sight intended for use on rifles, carbines, and shotguns to provide fast target acquisition. It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness. The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools. Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions. The MRO Patrol includes an ocular lens cover to protect glass from damage and to reduce glare and reflections as well as an objective cover and ARD, as well as a MIL-SPEC rated 1/3 Co-Witness quick release mount with return to zero accuracy.  Package Includes:1 Ocular Cap1 Objective Cap1 ARD1 1/3 Co-Witness Quick Release Mount (AC32071)1 Trijicon Logo Sticker1 Lens Cloth1 Manual1 Warranty Card1 MRO Mount GuideMagnification1xObjective Size (mm)25mmLength (in)4.1Weight (oz)5.1 oz. / 144g with battery installed, without mountIllumination SourceBatteryReticle PatternDotDay Reticle ColorRedNight Reticle ColorRedBindon Aiming ConceptNoEye Relief (in)InfiniteAdjustment @ 100 yards (clicks/in)1 click = 1/2 MOAHousing Material7075-T6 forged aluminumBatteries1 CR2032 Lithium BatteryBattery Life5 years of continuous use at day setting “3” (setting 5 of 8) at 70°F (21°C)Adjustment Range70 MOA Total TravelIllumination Settings8Dimensions (LxWxH)2.6 in. x 1.7 in. x 2.0 in.
