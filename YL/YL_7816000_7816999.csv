I need to SELL this by 1/12 - I am relocating to New Jersey and cannot keep this, I am NOT interested in trades, coins, cryptocurrency or quads - Cash Only. The price has been reduced and is FIRM at $630, I will NOT return it to stock and I will NOT remove items to reduce the cost.**Reloaders: For $1000 I will add 8 pounds of unopened Universal Clays, unopened 5K Small Pistol Primers (Ginex - OEM for S&B/Xtrme) and 6.2ish-K sorted/washed 9mm brassMy urgency does not equate to complacency, do not insult me with a low-ball offer - those offers and trade requests will be ignored.This is an otherwise unmolested Gen 4 Glock 19, the modifications are listed below:- Trijicon HD 3-Dot Green/Green Night Sight (installed 10/2017)- Glock OEM Extended Slide Release- Lone Wolf Ultimate Adjustable Trigger (UAT) **Notes on this below**- Ghost EDGE 3.5 Connector- ZevTech 6# Trigger Spring **Notes on this below**- ZevTech Reduced Weight Safety Plunger Spring **Notes on this below**- All metal contact surfaces have been (mostly) deburred, and polished w/ 1500 grit and hit w/ a microfiber cloth with Flitz- Four (4) 15-round Magazines, All Glock OEM- 450 Rounds of Ammo: 200x 124gr NATO loadings (higher SAAMI Pressure/slightly higher velocity), 75x Federal 115gr +P HiShok, the rest is LOOSE and has about 80 or so 115gr Tula Steel case with the rest being a mix of AE/Fed/Win with some 147gr GS/GD/Hornady CD stuff in there- Most stock parts are included as well as the box, backstraps, etc**Regarding the Trigger** - I have received questions and concerns regarding the viability of this for Defensive/CCW applications; while the sum of the UAT, Ghost Edge and the Zev springs may sound like this is a hair-trigger - it is not. Unlike the Fulcrum, Glockstore Drop-In or the Overwatch triggers, this does not have the weak ""2 pound"" break with all of these parts. I added the heavier Zev trigger spring and the UAT to give this Glock as much of a ""double action"" feel as I could. Ergo - there is no mushiness, yards of travel, creep, wobble or general sloppiness you get when you are using a standard Glock trigger (Even with springs/connectors) - this feels like a refined/broken-in Sig DAK action, and breaks around 4 pounds. I have tested it for dropfire, and if you did not like how it broke the trigger is fully adjustable so you can add a little bit of takeup to ease you mind. I did not adjust it nor modify it as to bypass the trigger safety - the reduced weight plunger spring and Edge Connector only aid in reducing that ""bump"" you feel near the break on a stock Glock trigger, this was not and never was intended to be a USPSA hair-trigger - this breaks smoothly and like glass, or as close at it gets in a striker fired pistol.The Striker Assembly was not touched, it has the stock striker spring and stock striker, there will be no issues with partial ignition, FTFs, FTRTBs, FTEJ or FTEX - as long as you have quality ammo and do not limp wrist, this pistol should give you no issues.If you bothered to read through all of that, again, the price is FIRM at $630 - I am located in the Polaris area and will meet at the BMV off of Lazelle and US-23/High Street or the Cabela's off of Lyra/Gemini and I-71 - I can meet downtown near Nationwide near 3pm, and I will drive up to ONE HOUR.You can reach me readily via email but TEXT is preferred at 6one4 6four8 49five8 - no calls please. I will send additional information and/or pictures upon request if I am able to."

Also on this rifle it is equipped with an Atlas by-10 bipod. This rifle is in very nice shape. With minor handling marks. It’s had maybe 100 rounds through it. Only reason I’m selling it is to fund growing my collection. .   I will consider separating everything.   That being said. Don’t be afraid to make me an offer the worst I can say is no. I am interested in trades. Mainly interested in colts, Sigs in 9mm and pre lock smith and Wesson revolvers. I will look at all trades I’m like most. I just like new toys. I am located in Mt.
