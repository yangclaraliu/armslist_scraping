I have kept it in a temperature and humidity controlled safe since i bought it. I had purchased at one point 3 extra magazines, but i cant find any of them, so im selling this with no magazines.This is the IWI tavor in 9mm. This gun was designed for 223 / 5.56 but comes in 9mm for practice and cheaper fun at the range. You can buy the 223 barrel and other necessary parts to convert it for about $900. Then you have a single rifle that fires both so that you can practice on cheaper ammo and use it for defense / long range shooting with 223 ammo. There is also a sexy silencer for the 9mm version of this rifle that fits into the guard at the front of the rifle and is totaly discreet / futuristic. You can only buy it if you legally can buy a silencer / setup an NFA trust. I do not own the silencer,  but i bought this rifle hoping to get the silencer eventually.  The rifle is new in box. It has never been fired. It has no wear or damage. It comes with the normal accessories other then i have no magazines because I cant find them since i moved.You can either email me through armslist, or text me at two 2 5 two eight 4 six 6 8 five."

I'm selling this for $175 total, and the JP provided version would not provide you with both sets of barrel nuts, handguard retaining nuts and wrenches.The rifle was built last year, and it has mostly been a safe queen. I test fired it in the spring, and it sat in my safe as I was in the middle of a move from Colorado to Kansas. You are getting a like-new used rifle accessory at a fraction of the price. The company specifications are listed below. Manufacturer Description:Large-frame MK III Hand Guard models make use of an eccentric nut design whereby the barrel retainer nut is not centered in the receiver extension. This allows use of the same smaller 2"" tube as our small-frame hand guard models rather than requiring a larger diameter. At the same time, this design does cause the barrel to sit slightly below center in the hand guard tube. This is purely an aesthetic characteristic and does not affect barrel-tube parallelism or durability.Specifications:Length: XL (15.5” OAL) Platform: DPMS LR-308, Knights SR-25, 2010-11 Bushmaster or similar Tube Style: Signature Machined from 6061 T6 aluminum with a 4140 steel barrel nut, this mid-length hand guard includes two JPHGS quick-detach sling studs.Receiver Thread Pattern: 1 7/16"" x 18 TPI Max.

So, I'm offering this excellent, used-condition muzzle brake for someone else to benefit from (and save some money) during their next rifle build.It is my understanding is that this muzzle brake will work on the following models of suppressors:TBAC 223CBTBAC 30CB5TBAC 30CB7TBAC 30CB9TBAC Ultra 5TBAC Ultra 7CBTBAC Ultra 9CBThe new TBAC CB series brake in this listing can also be used with 30BA and 30BAS suppressors with the CB2BA adapter.Multiple vendors offer this detail, but please verify this before purchasing. Returns are not allowed for buyers who purchase the wrong brake for their particular suppressor model.The black Ionbond DLC finish (monocolor dark gray) is in excellent condition with only the slightest of handling marks on it from installation/removal.Manufacturer Description:This is the new ""Compact Brake"" for the Thunderbeast flagship long-range precision rifle suppressors. They've designed a new brake that is smaller and more efficient than the old one.When used alone, the new ""CB"" brake is approx 30-40% more effective at recoil reduction than the old 30BA brake. This new brake is proportioned correctly for .223 and .30 caliber rifles, but it provides a suppressor mounting surface just as solid as the old BA series."
