They are 100% genuine article.
The M145 Telescope is a fixed 3.4 power, 28mm optical sight that has been designed to engage targets accurately out to 1200m range. The optical sight weighs 24 oz. (681 gr) and is extremely rugged for rough field conditions. The sight has an 8.2mm diameter exit pupil, which provides excellent vision in low light levels, i.e. dawn and dusk, and also for rapid target acquisition. The zeroing adjustment increments in both windage and elevation are 2.5 mm at 10 meters range for each detent (click of movement) and 5 inches at 500 meter range. The mount is designed to fit to the Picatinny rail MIL.Std. 1913. The optical sight has an eye relief of approximately 3 inches (70mm). Eye relief is the distance between the eye and the sight’s rear eyepiece lens. The reticle pattern has built-in trajectory compensation from 300m to 1200m range. The reticle is illuminated, by a battery. It has been used in conflicts around the world and is rated for the heaviest of machineguns, such as the M249, 240G, and MINIMI and of course M16 type rifles. This optic compares favorably against anything Leupold, Aimpoint, ACOG, or EO Tech puts out!

It's just fantastic, weighs less than a pound and disapears in to a backpack (rolls up into it's own little bag).Sadly i'm just not using it enough to justify having it around...even if it is cool :) I spent ~$500 on it with the FFL transfer and shipping, I'd like to make up recoup some of that.Here's the description from their site ( https://www.packrifle.com/ ):Pack-Rifle is an incredibly light weight, take-down, utility rifle. The receiver, and most other parts, of the Pack-Rifle are machined from high strength aluminum, while most wear parts and fasteners are constructed of stainless steel. The barrel is a precision button rifled, Cro-Moly liner with a carbon fiber composite outer. Carbon fiber is also used for the butt stock tube of the rifle. This construction makes the Pack-Rifle not only the lightest rifle out there, but very weather resistant as well.But the feather-weight of our Pack-Rifle is only part of the story. In addition to being light, the Pack-Rifle also takes down to a very small size. The same mechanism that allows the loading and extraction of spent shells also enables the rifle to take down into two pieces, in less that 2 seconds without tools! It reassembles just as fast.Other features include, but are not limited to, storage in the handle and butt stock tube of the rifle.Give me a text or a call:Seven One Seven - 606 - 2824"

The PPS43 (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev submachine gun) was born as an answer for the need of a weapon that would be more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, which was in use then by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews, mobile recon groups and paratroopers. In late 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new, more compact SMG. Designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942 and it was adopted under the designation of PPS42. The next year he refined the design and this final model was designated as PPS43. This SMG was manufactured in significant numbers, with nearly 2 million PPS43 weapons manufactured between 1943 and 1946. The PPS43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world and widely copied. The PPS43 was license-produced in Poland starting in 1946. Today... Pioneer Arms has redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meter distance. The front sight is a fixed blade. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded, closed position. This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland by Pioneer Arms. All parts and components are Polish made. The PPS43-C pistol comes with a curved box magazine which holds up to 35 rounds.
