Built on a Compact frame and mated to a 5” barrel with full-size slide. The Compact frame will allow this pistol to be carried more discreetly than a gun with a full-size frame. However, with the 13-round Xtension magazine, this takes on the feel of a full-sized pistol.With all the same features found in the standard XD® line, the longer barrel and slide result in a longer sight radius and faster recoil recovery.

Handgun has EXACTLY 450 rounds through it (I still have the used brass and will happily throw it in if you want it) and is cosmetically flawless. Bought it about six weeks ago, and I'm not as impressed as I want to be with it. Ithought I'd see if anyone else is willing to trade me something desirable; if not I'll hold on to it as it certainly isn't a bad gun in the least. If you do a little searching over the internet, you'll find that the gun reviews extremely well. One of the biggest complaints about it is the price of the exotic ammunition ammunition: well, I've got an answer for that...Here is everything that will come with this lot:One - FN Five-seveN Handgun in factory FDE clean and well lubed ($1250 standard retail)Seven - Factory 20-round magazines with Mag pouch (comes with three, $150ish for the extras)Two Thousand Nine Hundred rounds of American Eagle Ammunition. That's 58 50-round boxes. ($1300  from the discount stores)And of course the original box, papers, etc.If you do the retail math, that's approximately $2700 worth of stuff if you went bought all of that right from mainstream gun stuff websites (Buds, Brownells, Midway, etc). while I don't expect a penny-for penny accounting of that amount, but it puts you in the correct ballpark with its value. I can say that a I like the pistol, but I don't Love it, so therefore I'm possibly interested in trading or selling it. I'm not dead set that the firearm must go, but if youre interested and can hit me with the right item(s) worthy of my interest, I might bite.*Listing edited when I added another 200 rounds of new ammunition that were in the bottom of my range bag."

The M&P45 Shield was introduced shortly before the M&P 2.0s came out so this has those upgrades such as the improved stippling and much more tactile trigger. I never had time to get it to the range so it is completely brand new and I've simply decided that I like my two Kahrs better.Also available are three boxes of Ruger ARX 45acp 118gr polymer ammo that on paper seems to be ideal for small semi-autos. These were $22 a box but I'll sell all three for $50 if purchased with this firearm. I'll need to see a NMDL or CHL and a bill of sale will be necessary, thanks."

This is a 1988 Taurus model 66 4in 6 shot revolver. This isn’t one of the crappy new ones they are producing. This gun, as well as all other taurus model 66 revolvers that were made from 1986-1988, were produced from the same metal and machines as S&W k-frames at the time. Smith had moved to a new factory and sold the old one to taurus, which taurus used to produce these revolvers. Now about this particular gun. It is a heavy power house. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up yesturday (Friday, September 8th 2017) from the best gunsmith in the area. He did a full satin hot bluing as well as replaced anything that showed signs of being worn down. Such as the firing pin for example. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This particular gun is renowned for being the best made revolver taurus has ever made (probably because the s&w machining). If you want to know anything else, feel free to shoot me a message. I am looking to sell, but i am definitely open to trading for another handgun only. This gun also includes a folbus paddle holster. Thank you and have a nice day."

That makes the factory finished pistols very difficult to find. This Colt also has a factory letter that states the nickel finish and that it was shipped to the Johnson Plantation Gun Shop in Ashburn Georgia February 9 1970. This Colt is fitted with stunning original pearl grips. The pistol itself shows very little handling or being fired. The high polish sides have a mirror finish that would rate a 99% overall condition. The top of the slide and frame sides would rate a 98+% overall condition. The magazine is the correct original magazine for this pistol. The barrel shows no plating loss or wear. The high quality reproduction box has the correct end label with the correct nickel finish tag. The instruction sheet is an original Colt printing.

Image quality is enhanced through the use of proprietary anti-reflection lens coatings on all optical surfaces, phase-corrected coatings on the prisms, and large 50mm objectives that gather generous amounts of light to deliver bright images even in low-light conditions such as at dawn, dusk, or under heavily-canopied woods.Designed to stand up to a life lived outdoors, the optical tubes are nitrogen-filled and O-ring sealed to make them water and fogproof, even when moving through extreme temperature variations. The chassis is made from an aluminum alloy to make it lightweight and corrosion-resistant. And to further cut weight, providing users with more area to grip, Leupold employs an open bridge configuration with a dual-hinge. Its oversized, knurled center focusing wheel allows for sharp focusing even while wearing gloves, and for long-duration glassing sessions, or to reduce fatigue and visible hand-shake, the Mojave can be mounted on a tripod or other support system using an optional adapter.Features:- Extra Low-Dispersion Glass Objectives- Phase-Corrected BAK4 Roof Prisms- Fully Multi-Coated Optics- Lead-Free Calcium Fluoride Lenses- Open Bridge Configuration- Nitrogen-Filled, Water & Fogproof- Center Focus/Dioptric Adjustment Wheel- Tripod Mountable With Optional Adapter- Twist-Up Click-Stop Eyecups Includes: - Leupold 12x50 BX-3 Mojave Pro Guide HD Binocular (Kryptek Highlander)- Carrying Case- Neck Strap Specifications: - Prism Type: Roof- Magnification: 12x- Objective Lens Diameter: 50mm- Angle of View: 4.8e (actual)- Field-of-View: 251.0' @ 1000 yd - Minimum Focus Distanse"

Kick-off recoil reduction system plus Microcore recoil pad. 6.6lbs unloaded. New ""S Grip"" checkering. GunPod2 From Beretta: ""The Beretta A400 Lite Synthetic is a hunting shotgun that does it all--and that doesn’t mind playing hard and getting dirty. After a demanding day upland hunting in the tall grass, waterfowling in the marshes or breaking clays at the range, the A400 is just as happy being tossed in the back of the truck for the drive home. It is not simply a black synthetic version of the A400 family, as it incorporates a boatload of special features like cross-tube piston giving you a 4+1 shot capacity, a new checkering pattern for better gripping, advanced recoil reduction, light weight, Optima HP choke system and the revolutionary smartphone-compliant Gunpod 2 to keep track of (and share!) your shooting activities. It is a workhorse--but a workhorse with an impressive pedigree. Fast, Versatile, Light and Low-Recoiling With its Blink gas-operating system, the A400 is the fastest semiauto action on the market, capable of delivering 4 shots in less than one second. Just as importantly, its 3” chamber will reliably feed and fire different-purpose shells (2 ½” or 3”) from heavy-hitting rounds to light target loads. And as an all-purpose shotgun, it combines low weight (6.6 lbs) with low recoil, so that it can be easily carried around on the most strenuous adventures without ever being punishing on the shoulder. This is because it sports two advanced recoil-reducing devices--the Kick-Off system within the buttstock (which absorbs up to 50% of recoil) as well as a super-soft, no-snag Micro Core recoil pad. Easy and Low-Maintenance In the hands, the A400 Lite Synthetic feels like an extension of your body. Beretta has researched and created a new “S Grip” checkering pattern that gives you a wonderfully-positive hold (even with gloves) while being much easier to wipe clean than conventional checkering. An adjustable shim system also enables you to customize the fit for drop and cast, while a highly-visible fiberoptic sight at the end of the gun’s ventilated rib helps you keep your eyes on the target. The A400 action is self-cleaning, so it requires much less maintenance than any other shotgun you’ll ever own; but when you take this gun apart you’ll be amazed by the intuitive simplicity of the tool-free field-stripping process and by what little maintenance the A400 Lite Synthetic requires. GunPod2: Your Digital Hunting Diary The A400 Lite Synthetic comes with a built-in GunPod2 unit, a Bluetooth-compliant electronic unit that transmits all the information you want about your hunt to a smartphone app (included). This cool device lets you create a map of your hunt, drop a pin where you took your best shots, help you remember where the game was and immortalize each shot with a photo, video, or note. You can also instantly share any part of this on Facebook and other social-media venues, so that your buddies who stayed home can see what they missed. In all, the A400 Lite Synthetic is a modern, dynamic, sporty do-it-all that is eager to share your adventures and help you brag about them."" Comes new in box with: 3 chock tubes w/ wrench, LOP extension shim, cast/drop shims, sling swivels, oil, manuals. contact me if you are ready to buy now, and i will ship once paymernt is made."

Kick-off recoil reduction system plus Microcore recoil pad. 6.6lbs unloaded. New ""S Grip"" checkering. GunPod2 From Beretta: ""The Beretta A400 Lite Synthetic is a hunting shotgun that does it all--and that doesn’t mind playing hard and getting dirty. After a demanding day upland hunting in the tall grass, waterfowling in the marshes or breaking clays at the range, the A400 is just as happy being tossed in the back of the truck for the drive home. It is not simply a black synthetic version of the A400 family, as it incorporates a boatload of special features like cross-tube piston giving you a 4+1 shot capacity, a new checkering pattern for better gripping, advanced recoil reduction, light weight, Optima HP choke system and the revolutionary smartphone-compliant Gunpod 2 to keep track of (and share!) your shooting activities. It is a workhorse--but a workhorse with an impressive pedigree. Fast, Versatile, Light and Low-Recoiling With its Blink gas-operating system, the A400 is the fastest semiauto action on the market, capable of delivering 4 shots in less than one second. Just as importantly, its 3” chamber will reliably feed and fire different-purpose shells (2 ½” or 3”) from heavy-hitting rounds to light target loads. And as an all-purpose shotgun, it combines low weight (6.6 lbs) with low recoil, so that it can be easily carried around on the most strenuous adventures without ever being punishing on the shoulder. This is because it sports two advanced recoil-reducing devices--the Kick-Off system within the buttstock (which absorbs up to 50% of recoil) as well as a super-soft, no-snag Micro Core recoil pad. Easy and Low-Maintenance In the hands, the A400 Lite Synthetic feels like an extension of your body. Beretta has researched and created a new “S Grip” checkering pattern that gives you a wonderfully-positive hold (even with gloves) while being much easier to wipe clean than conventional checkering. An adjustable shim system also enables you to customize the fit for drop and cast, while a highly-visible fiberoptic sight at the end of the gun’s ventilated rib helps you keep your eyes on the target. The A400 action is self-cleaning, so it requires much less maintenance than any other shotgun you’ll ever own; but when you take this gun apart you’ll be amazed by the intuitive simplicity of the tool-free field-stripping process and by what little maintenance the A400 Lite Synthetic requires. GunPod2: Your Digital Hunting Diary The A400 Lite Synthetic comes with a built-in GunPod2 unit, a Bluetooth-compliant electronic unit that transmits all the information you want about your hunt to a smartphone app (included). This cool device lets you create a map of your hunt, drop a pin where you took your best shots, help you remember where the game was and immortalize each shot with a photo, video, or note. You can also instantly share any part of this on Facebook and other social-media venues, so that your buddies who stayed home can see what they missed. In all, the A400 Lite Synthetic is a modern, dynamic, sporty do-it-all that is eager to share your adventures and help you brag about them."" Comes new in box with: 3 chock tubes w/ wrench, LOP extension shim, cast/drop shims, sling swivels, oil, manuals. contact me if you are ready to buy now, and i will ship once paymernt is made. feel free to call or texts me on REDACTED contact name Charles Lawrence"

Also known as a Beretta Cheetah. I bought this gun when I first got married and it's served me well since then. This is not a safe queen. The gun has holster wear on the key areas but the gun functions perfectly and I'd judge the grade to be NRA Good thanks to Beretta's wonderful finish. The gun has Trijicon night sights installed. The ""glow"" isn't as strong but it does glow at night. The gun includes two factory 13 round mags, one 10 round Beretta mag, and one 13 round after-market (I believe Metgar). Since this is my only 380, the gun comes with all my ammo. The following comes with the gun. Approx 250 rounds. 1 box of BLAZER brass FMJ1 box of BLAZER aluminum FMJ2 boxes of BROWNING COURT FMJ (bought at Fin Feather Fur)10 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty JHP20 rounds of Buffolo Bore 95g +p FMJ18 rounds of Hornady American Gunner JHP9 rounds of wolf FMJ Military Classic FMJThis was my carry piece for several years so I've got two holsters that come with it. One is a GALCO IWB for a glock 26 that works well. The second is a New York UnderCover from DeSaintis. That holster needs a snap replace but if you're not easily defeated like me it will work very well. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I won't sell to someone outside of Ohio unless they want to pay for an FFL transfer. Willing to accept trades but I'm looking for a 10mm, 1911 (preferably a 10mm 1911) and I'll always look at another AR-15. I'm asking $640 because while this gun is used it has some features and acessories that are very hard to find. If you're going to make an offer, I'm willing to hear it but please put some effort into it and don't just ask for my ""best bottom price"". Willing to drive, but gas is starting to go up so please keep that factor in mind when making an offer. Thanks and have a great day."
