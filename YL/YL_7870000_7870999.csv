Meticulously taken care of.It's had a total of 60 rounds fired through it, FN 5.7x28 40gr blue box and i'm including the 40 unfired rounds with this offer. I have the original box, 3 magazines, the lock, the test-fired round, the manual...hell, i still have the bar code that came on top of the slide of the gun itself. The picture doesn't do it justice but if you were to go to a store, saw this listed as brand new, you would be inclined to believe it to be such. Obviously, you need to provide a valid CCW or a valid buyer's permit and a valid ID and be legally able to purchase and own a handgun. If anyone is interested, i'm willing to provide a few more pictures, if needed. Thanks for reading."

I have one .32ACP(7.65mm) magazine and two .22lr magazines. It comes with original grips, packaging, and manual. It has a clean bore, very good rifling, no corrosion that I can see. The only things that it is missing is a pin to hold the extractor in place when changing the face plate to shoot .22lr, and the specialty screwdriver. It is a DA/SA with a decocking mechanism built in. I Installed a new nylon buffer from Numrich a few years ago to replace the aging and damaged one. Other than that, no issues with the gun. It functions well with high velocity .22lr and regular .32ACP, I don't recommend hollow points as they do not feed well.This is an uncommon piece of H&K history. I would be interested in trades. No glocks or Rugers. Please, feel free to send me an offer. But of course, cash is king. All laws, both MA and Federal, will be followed."

I recently replaced it with a 1-6X scope and really didn’t have a use for the 4X ACOG (especially one in FDE). The optic is mounted on a nice Bobro QD mount from the factory. It was an ACOG and RMR combo but I am keeping the RMR but the optic does include the mount ($73 value) which also has backup iron sights. The optic has probably seen about 150 rounds through it with some marks on the factory Cerakote from being knocked around in my gun safe. The glass is still nice and sharp with the green illuminated cross reticle. The optic is manufactured in Early 2017 so the tritium has still a lot of life left. Unfortunately since it was a packaged deal, for some reason it didn’t with the original box or documentation when I bought it. Asking for $900 and I am not looking for trades. Hoping to sell to someone locally and WILL meet halfway at a safe location, but I will ship it if the buyer pays for shipping (additional $30 for priority mail with adult signature and insurance). I will take discrete PayPal Friends and Family or USPS Money Order.  Pics: https://imgur.com/a/bRV6Q"
