This gun does NOT have a magazine safety which is typical for the FBI and police guns; this means it will fire with the magazine removed. The 10 series Smith's are the best 10mm pistols ever made.I bought it about six years ago and immediately sent it off to Smith to give it a thorough checkup. They replaced springs, cleaned it up, and put new night sights on it (cost me about $350). I've put about 200 rounds through the gun without a single failure of any kind.It includes 14 magazines. Ten of those have new Wolff springs, and the rest are good as well.  Yellow or white followers. Includes a Don Hume leather pancake holster that makes the gun carry very well, and a Don Hume duty style holster ase well, and both are in excellent condition.Includes a Smith & Wesson box, not the original.Absolutely NOT interested in trades of any kind. The cash is going to another project.  Absolutely NOT going to separate.Meet at my FFL in Port Orchard and you pay the fees.The whole package is $2200. If that's too much you can sell off some of the mags, they're going for $80 or more each without new springs.  The package is the gun, 14 magazines, two holsters, grip sleeve, and box.  Cartridges are not included.1006 1026 1066 1086 10mm"

Had this rifle for about 2 and have shot a total of about 120 rounds through it, 55 of which were used for a proper barrel break in. Had a custom Mcmillan A5 stock made for it shortly after i purchased the rifle, which makes this overall a very solid. Took a total of 6 months to get the stock, and I added flush-fit QD sling cups on the side for a very comfortable carry balance. Stock is fiberglass so its a little heavy, but not as bad as a metal chassis you find on a bunch of other .338 Lapua rifles. Also have a Timney trigger in the rifle, set at a rather light and crisp 3.5lbs, acompanied by an oversized bolt handle typically fount on the 110 BA models. Dont really want to sell the rifle, lot of personal touch to this rifle, but have some pretty good plans for the money.To top it off, it sports a 6-24x50mm Vortex Viper HST with MOA adjustments and tactical turrets for quick re-zero. Rings are made by Leupold. Fine with selling just the bare rifle, and I will also give you the original stock for what its worth, I would sell the Rifle itself for $2,200.-Harris is not included. -Will deal only with Wyoming resident with valid ID, I live in Jackson and have a ranch near Kinnear and Riverton. Thanks for Looking, feel free to ask questions."

It is a percussion cap black powder rifle built on the Remington 1858 frame which is considered the finest BP pistol made during that period. It will also accept all of the accessories made for the Remington frame pistols. I have owned several of these rifles in the past and they are extremely accurate and a blast to shoot. Cartridge conversion cylinders are available that will allow this rifle to fire cartridge ammo. The gun sells for $600; I am asking only $450 which is the best price you will find anywhere. Remember this gun is not used it is new in the factory box.
