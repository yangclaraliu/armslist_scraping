New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

For Sale is my Gen 3 Glock 21sf with Night Sights

This is the ""Short Frame"" model, with Night Sights.

Gun is in good condition, round count is unknown. I’m the 3rd owner and got it in a trade. I’ve put about 50 rounds down range, previous owner about 50, owner before that was original owner and unknown on round count. The barrel is polished (done by the previous owner) – see photos. 

Gun shoots very well, and is accurate. Sights show a little wear on top (I presume from a holster) and do still glow well in the dark.

It’s a nice gun, but even the SF version is a bit too big for my hands.

Includes:
• Glock 21sf Gen 3 with Glock Night Sights
• (2) 13-round magazines
• Extended Takedown Lever (installed – original included too)
• Hogue Handall Grip (installed)
• Original Case (missing cleaning kit and lock)

Cash Price is $450, trade $500  Final price drop, price is firm.

Sale will be FTF in Milwaukie, Oak Grove, Gladstone or O.C. Current Oregon CHL and Oregon DL are required. Bill of Sale also will be required.

I’m looking for cash, but do have a trade list available, and very limited cash, potentially some ammo to add at the moment. I would be interested in (in good condition, not necessarily new):

• Inexpensive AR like an M&P 15 Sport (no .22lr) – preferably a flat top style, quad rail is a plus
• Springfield XD or XDM .45 (my hand fits this one very well) 4.5 or 5.25 inch
• Remington 870
• Pump or Auto Shotgun in 20ga
• Pump or Auto Shotgun in .410
• Pistol Caliber Carbine (depends on make/model)
• Ruger SR1911 - preferably the 5"" model - maybe another 1911 in a similar price range

Not really anything else I'm interested in at this time, but if you have something you want to suggest, send me a message, worst I'll give you is a polite 'no'. I can say I'm not interested in any sub-compact type pistols or any revolvers. 4-5"" barrels are of more interest to me.

This handgun was bought less than 2 weeks ago (still have receipts and paperwork) and has never even had a live round chambered let alone shot down the pipe. It includes everything as new, gun, 1 mag, assembly tool, lock, paperwork, etc...

 This is Taurus' take on the classic 1911 design. It is a very sharp gun and very well made. I have owned a few different guns of the same or similar model from Taurus over the years and they all have shot incredibly well. They are well known for being much better made guns than the fairly low price point would suggest. In my opinion they are well on par with 1911s costing twice as much. The trigger alone truly feels as though it has been worked over by a gunsmith and the tolerances on all the parts is just incredible. 

 I love these guns personally and whenever I sell one I always seem to end up with another in the safe shortly after. I bought this with every intention of shooting the heck out of it but other ideas are now preventing that. The only reason for this sale is to fund another build so no trades at this time, cash only. I also have a Glock 22 for sale on here and other sites as well if you are interested let me know on either. Thanks for looking.

The SX-2 Kenai is packaged with a 30x wide angle eyepiece and a 25-60x variable eyepiece, making it an incredibly versatile spotter. It's like getting two scopes in one.

The SX-2 Kenai spotting scope combines form and function in every way. An oversized focus ring is centered over the tripod mount to keep the SX-2 Kenai steady and stable while focusing in the field. Built with the user in mind, you get comfortable holding points, aggressive knurling for a sure grip, and outstanding features built in.

The industrial design and lightweight material make the SX-2 Kenai easy to carry and operate, without sacrificing an ounce of toughness. This Leupold spotting scope is nitrogen-filled to guarantee complete fog and waterproof performance."

Hold the PX4 Storm Compact and you'll immediately realize that this handgun can do it all. Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots

It is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip.

In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense.

Cash/Items/Ammo (+/-) either way depending on trade. This is not a basic AR-15 rifle, aside from the Andersen lower, majority of parts were more expensive than your run of the mill DPMS and other entry level brands. If you haven't heard of Bravo Company USA, please google them and you will see that they are one of the best in the business and offer Noveske/LMT/DD quality at a mid-range pricing.

I am not desperate to get rid of this, just am looking to round out my collection. A good portion of my ""wanted"" items, would involve some sort of compensation coming back my way. I'm easy to work with but will expect fair value for both sides, at current market rates. Not looking for any pump shotguns or bolt action rifles UNLESS they are in addition to one of the items I have listed, to help make up value (if that needs to happen). 

Lastly, I will not be responding to cash offers. I am not looking to sale, I am looking to barter only. Not interested in electronics/cars/stereos/musical insturments/tattoos/time at timeshares etc. Firearm related trades only."

5.56 mm / .223 caliber Flash Hider (Flash Suppressor) and Suppressor Adapter

Specifications
Caliber 5.56 mm (.223 caliber) 
Length 2.33 inches 

Description
FH556-212A
The FH556-212A is a high-performance flash hider for the Colt Commando, C8 SFW, M4, M16, HK416, and 5.56mm (.223 cal.) semi-auto, bolt-action, or assault rifles with Mil-Spec 1/2-28 muzzle threads. It also serves as a precision, rock-solid adapter mount that enables rapid no-tools attachment of SureFire FA556K, FA556-212, FA556MG, or MINI suppressors to the rifles listed above and other rifles with the same muzzle thread/configuration. 

The FH556-212A flash hider delivers superior muzzle flash suppression (see demonstration photos at left). This provides three benefits—minimizing degradation of your night-adapted vision, helping to conceal your position, and reducing muzzle rise. Machined from heat-treated stainless steel, finished in a tough, corrosion-resistant coating, all SureFire flash hiders are extremely resistant to gas and particle erosion and will perform perfectly for thousands of rounds. 

[NSN: 1005-01-554-3051] 

NOTE: SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders also serve as adapter mounts for our Fast-Attach® sound suppressors. If you do not plan to attach a SureFire sound suppressor to your firearm, we recommend choosing a shorter-length muzzle brake or flash hider. SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders that mate with our overlap suppressor models are longer in order to extend rearward over the barrel, a feature that is unnecessary unless mounting an overlap suppressor. 
Features 
•Provides rock-solid suppressor attachment in seconds without tools
•Also serves as a precision adapter mount for SureFire FA556K, FA556-212, FA556MG, MINI, and MICRO suppressors
•Machined from heat-treated stainless steel, finished in a tough, corrosion-resistant coating
•Extreme resistance to heat and gas/particle erosion
•Installation requires no permanent modifications to most weapons"

Details:
After two decades of universal praise for the Ankle Glove™, Galco has added the Ankle Lite™ to the Concealed Carry Lite™ family of holsters. 

Using the same wide neoprene ankle band and Velcro closure as the Ankle Glove with Center Cut Steerhide™ for the holster, the Ankle Lite combines extended wearing comfort with unmatched security. Additional comfort is provided by sheepskin padding between the holster and ankle, while speed of draw is enhanced with a reinforced thumb break retention strap. 

The Ankle Lite may be worn with or without the optional adjustable calf strap (sold separately), and accommodates ankles up to 13"" in circumference. 

Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers, the Ankle Lite is available in right or left hand draw in black or khaki finish.

It's a 1990 Plymouth Acclaim, it was bought new in 1990 by my grandmother, and driven less than 3,000 miles per year. It's the 3.0 V6 and 4spd Auto O/D. We are the second owners, it has less than 60,000 miles on it, but for some odd reason, sometimes the transmission will lose all forward gears, but work in reverse, other times it will drive fine. Car runs damn good, and when it drives it drives good, does need shocks and struts, has new front Rotors, and Pads, new Headlight Bulbs, lights converted over to 9007 from 9004. Driverside front window fell off track and busted, Glassworks in Tulsa quotes $180 to come out and install the window.

Has Cruise, Heat, A/C needs charged, power windows, locks, mirrors, heated mirrors and rear window defrost, real top of the line for 1990, and the Acclaim beat out Toyota and Honda as the midsize car of the year for that year.

Clean title, tag expires January 2015.

The only difference between the PS-90 generations is found in the trigger group.  Unlike the new PS-90s, this one still has the auto sear (forward safety sear) present.  In terms of functionality, there is no difference between the various generations.  I purchased the Gen 3 because I was told that it was more desirable than the newer Gen 4 that did not have the auto sear present.
The PS-90 is a bullpup style rifle that comes in 5.7x28mm.  I'm selling the rifle along with a few others due to a growing family, but I would certainly be keeping it if I could.  I've owned it for nearly 6-months and have fired it at the range three times.  As I typically fire two full mags, the number of rounds fired through it is likely 300-400 and it has been well maintained.

This isn't the cheap DPMS ""sportical"" rifle that everyone sees at your local walmart. The upper receiver on those particular rifles do not have a dust cover or a forward assist, This rifle DOES have the dust cover and forward assist, I bought it new that way from Larry's. I got it on sale for $647.99 after tax, I also purchased a new EOtech holographic weapon sight to mount on top, a XPS-2 to be specific. The EOtech itself was $539.99 after tax. So it's practically a $1200 rifle & I can honestly say I've only fired the weapon 8 times. It's WAYYY to loud and powerful to be shooting on the regular. I bought it mainly for home defense or when the SHTF.... I love to hunt and am looking for a nice hunting weapon with a value somewhere in the ballpark of my AR. I'm looking to sale or trade. & I am in no hurry to part with this weapon. I'm just testing the waters because I'm still in love with this AR. (2 FREE magazines & Magpul pistol grip, trigger guard, and vertical post grip w/ deployable bipod included.) I bought these extras with all intentions of installing them but just never got around to it. All extra magpul parts are Flat dark earth in color, which will go great with the black upper & lower.

I'm asking $975 cash for everything and I will not go a penny lower. This is a GREAT deal. You will never find another AR15 this clean for this price."
