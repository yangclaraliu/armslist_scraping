This is a beautiful shotgun and I sadly haven't even shot it yet. It pains me to sell this beauty, but bills need paid and the wife said something had to go. I paid $1,395 plus shipping. I know I'm not going to get that, so I'll take $1,000.00 obo.The really nice thing about the shell carrier is the SN isn't covered, like with mose side shell carriers.The action on this gun is smooth, the over sized safety is a great feature, and the follower spring is strong.Ben at Boresight Solutions brought them in on trade, selected the best ones, then sent them to Vang Comp for an armorer level inspection and overhaul where necessary. Vang Comp then delivered the works: -Full VCS barrel port/backbore mod;-Vang Comp Ghost ring/picatinny rear sight and front night sight;-Oversize speed safety;-Deluxe DSAC w/extra Velcro shell carrier;-Vang Comp +2 magazine extension kit;-New factory hardwood furniture;-Graphite black Cerakote.He did not have the anodized aluminum trigger guards refinished, as in his experience the aluminum is often pitted and rough under the anodizing and looks worse Cerakoted than if left alone.According to Ben, ""these guns seemed lightly used based on their internal condition when I picked them out; they were NOT the usual trash can police trade-ins you see that have been abused and damaged."" Just to be clear, these are real Police Magnums, not one of the many cheaper versions (Tactical, Marine Magnum, etc) based on the 870 Express platform."

Its brand new and still in the wrapping plastic with factory oil on it and was just taken out to check it over and to take the picture for a friend that I'm now using for the post, so that means its just as it came from the factory with no rounds through it except for the factory test rounds and no handling marks at all since it was barely touched by me and it wasn't on display at the shop either. It comes in the factory plastic case with the manual, yellow safety ring, cable lock and three full moon clips. I will also toss in at least twenty five rounds of 357mag ammo to start you off with. Gorgeous gun and I would be more than happy to keep it for the collection but I just want to see whats out there for trades because I have other Ruger revolvers and I'm not attached to this one yet where its so new and was a replacement for something else.

The Dillon solution is a remarkably simple device that bolts to your bench and allows you to swage the primer pockets with speed and ease. The case is supported from the inside, so you won't be tearing the rims off the brass. A tool steel, hardened swage rod (easy to change from large to small primers) simply rolls the crimp away. No reaming is necessary. Our unique compound cam leverage system assures not only ease of operation, but perfect alignment with each and every round. Sound simple? It is and it works. What's more, it's inexpensive. The Super Swage 600 comes with large and small swage rods, .22 and .30 caliber backup rods, and a 45ACP adapter.""Includes priority shipping to you.  Thanks for looking!MikeREDACTED"

I couldn't abandon my partner after she stood with me through everything and always backed me up. Unfortunately my long term girlfriend who I share a child with, decided to recently relocate after knowing she would for months without telling me, and stick me with all of the bills. Thus money is very tight right now. So it's time for Ethyl to find a new partner, someone that can treat her better and give her what she needs again. Please only serious inquiries and tell me how you will treat Ethyl right."

Made by LegalManufacturing, LLCSlide is much more durable and made better quality for shooting more accurately and better weapon manipulation. The slide and barrel have a nickel boron finish and has weight reducing side and front slide cuts. Has forward serrations. Its a very nice look and design and makes a difference in shooting and performance. And with the added lone wolf trigger makes the trigger pull much nicer and lighter. (Trigger put on by previous owner)Below is from legalmanufacturing's website about the slide etc.""NIB BATTLEWORN® is a patent‐pending nickel boron plating process that offers wear resistance while simultaneously reducing friction to aluminum, steel, and titanium firearm surfaces. NIB BATTLEWORN®is a dark shade of gray with an aesthetically distressed, modern “battle” finish. Legal Manufacturing LLC’s proprietary plating process creates a smooth and uniform surface and increases the hardness of the plated part to over 70 Rockwell hardness. NIB BATTLEWORN® does not add significant dimension to the metal surface ensuring it can be applied on nearly all firearm components with no adverse impact on operation.""Has original case, 2 15rd mags plus a magpul 15rd and 17rd mag still in packaging. Has extra back straps and loader. the numbers on slide, barrel and frame all match. Has lone wolf trigger as well.These are much harder to find in the gen 4, even the gen 3s new will run about $600.i will let mine go for $700. I am not desperate to sell and will gladly keep it for less. If you can find one else where for cheaper with the Tin coated barrel and lone wolf trigger then i suggest you get that one and dont waste my time telling me about it. I will check what you are offering me if it is a lower value handgun and based on extras included will determine how much boot i will need.dont offer trade value with boot hoping that $700 value will suffice, the $700 price is strictly an all cash price!My price is firm! Trade value of $750 for nice HKs, or gen 4 glock 34 with upgrades or boot or a glock 23 or 35 with a 9mm conversion barrel.will also trade for really nice 1911s such as springfield, ruger, kimber, maybe remington. Would also like a Cz 97b with boot. All steel baby desert eagle in 9mm or .45 with boot my way.walther ppq with boot my way.hk vp9 with boot my way.beretta m92fs with boot.gen 5 glock 19 with boot.XDM 9mm or 45 4.5"" or bigger with boot MY way.smith and wesson m&p 2.0 9mm or .45 with boot my way or the earlier gens with even more boot my way.Cz 75Bd or Cz 75b tactical plus bootcz sp-01 with bootcz p10 with boot. Only long gun ill consider is a nice AK or a gen 3 glock 19 or 23 with a kel tec sub p2000 that uses glock mags in the same caliber or with the micro roni. Your trade needs to be something really nice for me to consider it, so dont offer me an xd and expect me to trade straight across or a $500-550 brand new priced gun and expect to not add boot. I AM ONLY INTERESTED IN STRAIGHT TRADES OR TRADES WITH BOOT MY WAY, I WILL NOT ADD BOOT TO ANYTHING HIGHER VALUE SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK. OTHERWISE JUST CASH WORKS TOO.may consider multi gun trades but no junk.would like a nice handgun and a home defense 12Ga shotgun combo deal. not wanting any .22lrs, archery, or black powder.

This grip is manufactured from a soft durable rubber and features a lightweight, synthetic skeleton making the rigid interior of the grip. The synthetic insert is chemically bonded to the exterior rubber grip insuring that the grip won’t de-laminate or come apart. Hogue uses a cobblestone (stippled) surface on this grip instead of traditional checkering for a modern feel and excellent grip control in any condition. The finger grooves on the front of the grip are an affordable alternative to front strap checkering and are preferred by many competition shooters for rapid, accurate shooting. The material is solvent and oil resistant which means it will not deteriorate or dissolve due to cleaning your firearm. Specifications: – Fits: Sig Sauer P238 with Finger Grooves– Color: Black"

The officer owned a huge collection of various type guns, so none of them saw much use. This particular revolver was fired on a few special outings, but never carried, and was eventually stored in a protective gun rug until it was sold.The serial number indicates this gun to be of late 1976-early 1977 vintage. It is a S&W factory nickel plated steel .38 Special with a 2"" pinned barrel, shrouded hammer, and five shot capacity. The gun is striking to admire, but it is also a wonderful shooter. I took it out to the gun range and put 25 rounds through it (have to shoot all of the vintage guns!) I was so impressed with both the single and double action trigger pull and accuracy. I can see why these Model 49's with the shrouded hammer were such popular carry conceal weapons by law enforcement officers.As was the case with many officer owned revolvers back then, this gun had its original grips taken off at initial purchase at an officer-frequented gun shop, discarded as many thousands were, and replaced with different grips. Those custom grips eventually found their way to a different revolver owned by the officer and another set of wood grips were put on this gun. I thought those grips were functional but not attractive, so I replaced them with some S&W grips I purchased so it now has the grips you see in the attached pictures that are nice but not numbered to the gun.This gun is in very nice condition. As with any nickel plated gun that has been shot or stored, there are a few handling marks on the gun but none that take away from its brilliant shine and eye appeal. The bore and chambers are bright, shiny, and clean. It is much too pretty for me to carry conceal, so I will carry a couple of S&W revolvers that have ""more character"" and won't mind a few more carry marks. In fact, I bought a blued and much less pristine condition Model 49 to use as part of my S&W revolver conceal carry rotation. This Model 49 will come enclosed in its very own Bore Stores fitted and treated gun rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."""

Any how I am looking to possible just trade this Rifle for a couple of AK47'S, possibly but on the other hand I just got laid off and can really use the cash as well. So I guess I am more so wanting to sell it than trade it. If I leave the scope on that I just bought at Academy I will sell for $1200, or trade value $1600........These Msrp for $1524.............Please email me your contact # and I will reach out to you at my earliest convenience........I will also throw in 300 rounds of 308 ammo that you can use for target practice or to zero the scope further out its up to you on that.  Please again email me and leave a good contact # to be reached at please.Kind RegardsCJ................................"
