ok first off dont crucify me... this is a pistol. my buddy helped build this to convert later to a sbr. i never posted pics so dont blame me for the 5.45 ban lol. i still have not set up a trust so im gonna let this one go. orig trunnion is in place with a rivet throgh the pin hole where the stock attaches to so a stock can not be placed on without modification. original stock is included in this auction. mag, drop case, and sling not included. 

this is one of the now sold out rguns. barrel is a bluejack. not sure what version but the gas hole is not in the middle of the grove and it hits the land. built on an nds receiver. all parts are orig finish and the bbl and receiver were painted to match."

I took this in on a trade towards a car. The owner said with purchase price,parts and gunsmith work it has OVER $1500 in it and that is what I allowed him. I had initially doubted that until the first time I fired this fantastic weapon. The trigger pull is very nice and it is VERY accurate and then I started to become aware of all the options it has.
An absolute honor to shoot and built by someone who really knew what they were doing.

Personally I am not an expert on these Commanders but I know a quality built and professionally modified pistol and this is at the top of my all time list.

This is a Springfield Armory Commander in .45 ACP some of the options may be standard for a Commander edition but listing everything I am aware of anyway so please pardon anything you know to be standard on the Commander edition.

Novak,ramped combat night sights
Heavy Duty slide return spring (reduces recoil felt and wear to frame)
Adjustable Guide rod
Adjustable Trigger
Open style Hammer
Beaver tailed safety and checkered memory bump
Checkered strap and front trigger guard
Upgraded barrel 
Looks to also have a polished feed ramp and throated barrel (not a single misfire)

ONLY reason I am considering selling this is because of an I.O.U. that was called in but not accepting any crazy offers . 

First $1500 cash (cash only no checks etc) or to it as I do have other options.

Thanks for your time."

399,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3072399,For Sale/Trade:  McGowen .280 Remington Ackley Improved Barrel for Savage,"West Eugene, Eugene, Oregon",$ 280,"Listed On: Monday, September 22, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here are the specs:

.280 Ackley Improved chamber - widely considered Ackley's finest wildcat, this cartridge sits nicely between the under-performing .280 Remington and the hyper-active 7mm Magnum. The cartridge has seen a big resurgence in long-range shooting since being SAAMI spec'd. It is an ideal long-range cartridge (think 1,200-1,500 yards).
28"" length - will push a 7mm bullet at speeds very close to 7mm Mag with substantially less recoil and requiring about 20 grains less powder charge.
Small (or standard) shank - fits most Savage receivers with the exception of the short magnums - if you have a .25-06, .270, .280, or .30-06 this is a drop-in part. Magnum rifles will require a new bolt-face.
1:8"" twist - fast twist allows for shooting the heaviest and longest bullets of the 7mm family with great stability.
11 degree target crown - the gold standard of target/long-range shooting.
Bull barrel profile - a heavy barrel profile that is not as susceptible to POI change due to barrel heat and is also more rigid than traditional tapers for extremely consistent accuracy. The additional barrel weight dramatically reduces recoil for quicker follow up shots.

McGowen is widely considered a very fine barrel maker offering product at an affordable price. This barrel is stainless steel, hand-lapped, and completely custom. Although the barrel has not been fired, I would expect no less than 1 MOA accuracy, and probably much better if you do your part. I've shot lesser barrels down to sub-1/3 MOA. If you've never shot out of a custom barrel, you will find the results vs. a factory Savage barrel quite startling in terms of improved accuracy.

If you are local I am willing to help you head-space your new barrel. Please note that there is a slight nick and a few small scratches on the barrel that were incurred during shipment. The blemishes will not affect accuracy, and assuming you will be Cera-Koting the rifle are a non-issue. See photos."

I'm interested in trading for quality pistols, revolvers, or nice o/u shotguns. I have no problem trading for multiple guns, or guns plus cash, just let me know what you have and we can work something out. 

I will sell pieces separately. $700 for the lower, $1500 for the upper (with scope and bipod), or $1200 for the upper with no scope or bipod. I'll also sell the scope with mount separately for $175, and the bipod with mount for $140.


Cash price is $2000 firm, and trade value must meet $2200. If your trade items aren't worth at least $2200, you'll have to make up the difference with cash or ammo. If you're having trouble understanding why it costs so much, I can send you an email with links to every piece on this gun.I can email more pictures if necessary, armslist doesn't make it easy to upload high quality pics.

529,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3072529,For Sale/Trade:  .38 special premium home defense rounds,"Glendale Heights, Chicago, Illinois",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, May 23, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"$50 for both or trade for ammo: 9mm, .40 S&W or .45acp.  One box of the premium Magsafe Defender and one box Magtech First Defense.  

Magtech First Defense:

These rounds are designed with a 100% solid copper bullet, unlike traditional hollow points that contain a lead core covered by a copper jacket. Copper jackets could tear away when fired, causing a loss of weight and a corresponding loss of power. However, Magtech First Defense solid copper bullets have no jacket to split or tear away, ensuring every round you fire meets its target with maximum impact and effectiveness. Trust the bullet that delivers deep penetration and devastating expansion... the kind that stops a threat in its tracks.

MagSafe Defender:

DESIGNED FOR PERFECT PENETRATION DEPTH
MagSafe's revolutionary design uses large lead shotgun pellets rather than solid lead for a bullet's core. The earliest versions (1986-1987) used small pellets, like the #6 shot a competitor uses for their ""Silver"" line of frangible ammo.

Early in the design process, hundreds of videotaped test shots were made into ordnance gelatin. Then, viewed in slow motion, you could see how a core's pellet size and pattern created the greatest wound damage for any given caliber.

It was quickly learned that using much larger #2 or #3 shot gave perfect penetration depth in gelatin or flesh-form 10 to 13 inches (two to three times as much penetration as our competitors). A large man's chest is only 12 inches thick from front to back, and any more penetration than that was wasted energy which would endanger innocent people.

That was the first goal reached - ammunition which won't overpenetrate a torso and hurt or kill innocent bystanders.

REDUCED RICOCHET HAZARD
One side benefit of using huge shot pellets is the reduction of ricochets, because larger objects are affected more by rotational forces. Tests showed that MagSafe Ammo won't even glance off slimy, wet boards at the most shallow of angles. They also don't ricochet off windshields, car doors or interior house walls. And, most importantly, they won't glance off bone.

ANOTHER GOAL WAS REACHED. ""CONTROLLED-CORE TECHNOLOGY""
For almost a year, experimentation with shot placement within the bullet's jacket continued, looking for a fan-shaped pellet wound channel. It was felt that the wider the pattern the better the chance of hitting vital organs, even with a poolry-placed shot.

By arranging pellets in specific patterns, literally stacking them in place one at a time, by hand, bullets could be designed to work nearly any way wanted - maybe deeper penetration, or wider wound channel, some even to break apart in sheetrock walls.

To stabilize the pellet patterns until the instant of impact, dozens of types of epoxy resins were tested. A custom blend with perfect properties was found - it is easily broken apart at impact, yet tough enough to launch at twice the velocity of normal bullets.

No other ammo uses high-tech resins or pellets put onto specific patterns by hand."

Buttstock Strap on the right hand side has the following

1941

Butt stock is dated 1941 and marked Australia. However as you can see it appears that it has been “trimmed down” a bit on the front. A nice job but…
Receiver serial numbered beginning with a C which also an indication of the 1941 date.
However the bolt does not match the receiver in numbering and it is of a later date.
This is a nice one to look at and to shoot
Ones that have matching numbers and have been restored to original are going for upwards of $600.
Since this does have some “abnormalities” it’s going to be a great buy for somebody.

This 1201FP is in excellent condition. It has one rub mark on the mag tube cap, but is otherwise pristine. It is not some old police trade in, but a commercial model that came with the ghost sight/tritium front option and an 18"" cylinder choke barrel. The tritium is pretty much faded at this point. If you are unfamiliar with the 1201FP, it uses an inertia style action very similar to the Benelli M1 Super 90. VERY fast shooter. They were commercial cousins back in the day. This one includes the original factory stock, a new Choate pistol grip style (with much more comfortable recoil pad), box and instructions. Original owner claimed six rounds through it. I'll claim five more. Just don't get out with a tactical shotgun and it's gathering dust. Asking $800 for everything. Compare that to a new Remington or Mossberg semi-auto combat shotgun. Way more gun, for little to no more money. Will add pics later or email upon request. Transfer at your cost if purchased. Mutual if traded. Have a place down the street that charges $20."

It's comes with a couple of holsters,   the Bianchi 100 as shown,  a spare mag holder, and a black nylon Outside the belt  retention model.   I'm particularly fond of this one - and am thinking if somebody doesn't offer up cash right away, I might just keep it.   Being all stainless it's perfect for  long term storage out in the back yard.  I don think there's a bit of plastic or rubber anywhere on this,  and being stainless - it's pretty heavy,   which is good - given the short barrel it would be a bit hard to tame otherwise.     But -   as it it, it's a sweetheart, and easy to carry, draw ( no sights or protrusions)  and the recoil is very manageable due to the weight.     Trivia - For those of you old enough to remember Miami Vice in detail,  this is Crockets left ankle piece if I remember correctly.  Either way   it's a great concealable piece for EDC,  and it has a cool history given where this was made.  You must be legal to buy and own this in Wa state.   I'll need to see ID, CPL, etc."
