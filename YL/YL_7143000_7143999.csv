With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame and a polished and engraved stainless steel slide. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.This is a cash only sale with transfer at FLL in the SouthEastern PA area.  Not interested in a trade at this time."

The Thule 997 Goalpost hitch t-bar is designed for use on pick-up trucks and SUVs with class 3 or greater 2"" hitch receivers. This adjustable watersport carrier mounts into your vehicle's 2 inch receiver to allow you to carry long loads such as kayaks, canoes, paddleboards and sailboards. The mast of the Goalpost has multiple mounting holes to allow you to adjust the height of the load bar, levelling it with a vehicle's roof rack. The Goalpost comes with two plastic load stops that can be used to butt up against your gear to prevent side-to-side movement.  The 997 Goalpost has multiple stabilizing features to help balance the rack. It comes with two pull-tight straps that hook into the Goalpost's mast and then hook on to your vehicle's bumper or tow loops to help stabilize the rack vertically. The bolted hitch pin that comes with the 997 Goalpost uses a flat washer and lock washer to eliminate receiver wobble. This bolt can be replaced with a Thule STL2 Snug-Tite locking hitch bolt to lock the Goalpost into your hitch (sold separately). Features•Hitch mounted, height adjustable load bar•Includes one 58"" Thule steel load bar with durable plastic coating with bar end caps•Durable powder-coated steel construction•Anti-sway design for stable, more secure transport•Telescoping mast adjusts to truck cab heights•2 load stops to help stabilize and hold load•Works with 2 inch receivers only•Add a Thule STL2 Snug-Tite locking hitch bolt to lock the Goalpost into your hitch (INCLUDED)"

To trade I am interested in other quality 9mm pistols. Please, don't bother with your Taurus or Hi-Point. And I am not interested in any other caliber, so if you offer me a .40, don't expect a response. My main trade interests are CZ Shadow Target or Sig P320 X-five (with you adding cash). Other pistols that interest me are quality 9mm in colors other than black (mainly FDE or ODG, but will consider others), such as Walther PPQ OD Green, Glocks in mixed colors, CZ P-07 or P-09 in grey or FDE, HK VP9 in FDE or grey, Sig P320 in FDE or ODG, or others. I may also consider black frame/stainless slide pistols like the FNX-9 or SP2022. Will consider multiple quality 9mm to trade, but if you've got only one of these pistols, be prepared to add cash. PTP/PTC required. Thanks for looking."

I don't use the display case because I use the blued firearm a lot and carry it.  The ppk is in great shape with no scapes, no marks, no damage, and has never been dropped or banged up.  It has 250 rounds through it, and it is always cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  For $850, I will include the carry case, two mags, paperwork, nylon iwb holster, and a box of .380 ammo.

I purchased the Glock about 3 months back for $450. I put $60 into it ($35 holster and $25 grip). Therefore you are getting $500 worth of gun for $450. I bought it as a police trade-in and it's looks to have been unfired or very lightly fired and well cared for. Has minor holster wear due to it being a police trade in.In the 3 months I have owned it I was only able to get to the range twice time. I put ~300 rounds through it and it functioned flawlessly with the factory magazines. I have managed fairly decent groupings despite my lack of experience with pistols. I purchased a cheap 28 round magazine for fun from Korea for $18 and it had fail to feeds 2 times though 56 rounds (2 magazines) during high speed mag dumps.As per the listing, I will sell the Glock 22, 1 factory magazine, talon grip, and holder for $450.After the posting I purchased an additional factory magazine and a Korean 28 round magazine. I can throw both in for an additional $20 (They cost me $38).I also have a CAA micro roni stabilizer with an added micro red dot (cheap $25 dot but holds zero with the low recoil) specifically made for the Glock 22. Due to recent clarification by the ATF, it can be shouldered, essentially turning your Glock into a carbine (not officially). I purchased the stabilizer for $350. It is incredible and I achieved ~2 inch groupings and 25 yards with it. I initially purchased it as a fun range toy but it seems to be very practical for home defense. I can throw it in for another $300. https://www.yrsinc.com/en/micro-roni-stab-caa-tactical-micro-stabilizer-roni-for-glock-17-18-19-22-23-25-31-32 .
