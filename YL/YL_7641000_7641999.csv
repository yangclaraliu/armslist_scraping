Refusing to be constrained by tradition and previous design limitations, the Rhino has improvements that move the revolver forward into the 21st century. Unconventional in appearance and superior by performance, the Rhino fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top. This dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud make the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. Accessory rails on the bottom of the barrel shroud on the 4”, 5” and 6” barrel models easily allow mounting lights or lasers. The 6” barrel models come with both rails on top and bottom to easily mount optics as well as lights or lasers.The snag resistant “hammer” is actually a cocking device because of the Rhino’s innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolver’s width to a minimum. Available in 2”, 4”, 5” and 6” barrel models in black or stainless finishes, all Rhino revolvers feature an easy to see fiber optic front sight."

Mind you, there are variations on these themes, such as semi-beavertails and Prince Philip grips, but most guns fall into the two aforementioned general categories. Thankfully, Beretta offers its Model 471 Silver Hawk side-by-side in both variants.
The 470 was released in Europe in 1996 to commemorate the firm's 470th anniversary and made it to the States in 1997. It has since been updated with new features and finish options under the Model 471 designation. We elected to evaluate the pistol grip-equipped 471 in 12 gauge.
The Silver Hawk is a boxlock, in which all the fire-control parts are attached to the action. The receiver is of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel with an attractive satin-nickel proprietary finish. The receiver's sides have half, false sideplates machined as a part of their contours. Both sides-as well as the underside-feature tasteful, hand-chased scroll engraving. The bolsters, too, have deep scroll engraving, and the nickel trigger guard exhibits modest scroll ornamentation as well.
Lock-up is by the proven Purdey double-underlug method-with a slight twist. Beretta angled the lugs slightly to keep the gun tight even as surfaces wear. The lugs are manufactured by electric discharge machining (EDM), and the barrels are fused to the monobloc with a laser-making this classically styled side-by-side utterly modern in its manufacture. The surfaces of the breechface and receiver under the barrels are jeweled.
The barrels are cold hammer forged, and the 3-inch chambers are chrome-lined. Beretta's interchangeable Optimachokes came with our sample, and the 2 3/4-inch-long tubes feature an elongated cone for the choke constriction. The exterior bluing of the barrels is smooth and even.
The stock is of European walnut with a semi-gloss finish, and our sample exhibited nice figure on both sides. The stock's wrist and fore-end are hand-checkered in a 20-line-per-inch, bordered point pattern with only a few flattened points and no overruns. Wood-to-metal fit was excellent around the trigger guard, but left intentionally proud at the receiver and fore-end.
The butt is topped by a blue Beretta Gel-Tek recoil pad, which has a silicon center to better distribute recoil. The outside surface is smooth, and a slight radius at its top makes the pad unlikely to hang up on the shooter's clothing as the gun is mounted. Two lugs projecting from the rear of the buttstock engage recesses in the pad's interior. When the wire retainer at its bottom is pulled down, the pad slips off easily – allowing replacement with a pad of a different size or color.
An Anson push rod serves as a retainer for the fore-end. Depressing the grooved button at its front moves the retaining iron out of engagement with the fore-end hanger. A small, white metal diamond-shaped insert is visible on the fore-end's underside within the checkering and serves as a retaining nut for the fore-end iron. Interestingly, a small selector mounted in the fore-end iron's left allows the shooter to choose between selective automatic ejection or extractors only.
As befits a gun with a pistol grip stock, the Silver Hawk has a single, selective trigger, which has an inertial block that sets the second barrel to fire. The steel trigger blade is left in the white, and it broke at 4 lbs., 12 ozs. for the right barrel, and 5 lbs., 12 ozs. for the left. Barrel selection is made via a button mounted on the tang safety. Pushing it to the left reveals a single red dot, and the right barrel fires first. Pushing it to the right selects the left barrel, and two red dots are revealed. Operating the selector moves the inertial block into engagement with the selected sear, even if the gun is already cocked.
Pressing the automatic safety forward disengages it. Moving the top tang lever to the right withdraws the two locking bolts to the rear, allowing the gun to be opened.
The Silver Hawk was function-fired at Shady Grove Hunt Preserve and Sporting Clays in Remington, Va., with 2 3/4-inch Federal and Winchester loads and patterned at 40 yards. The 471 proved surprisingly lively for a gun with this style of stock and fore-end. Its 28-inch barrels aided a smooth swing and follow through. Once it was moving with the bird, the 471 was steady and smooth.
While straight stocks and splinter fore-ends are preferred by many upland hunters, others, including dove hunters and waterfowlers, like the reassuring weight and feel of a beavertail fore-end and pistol-grip stock. Those looking for an American-style stock in a modern, quality side-by-side with enough ornamentation to impress their friends in the field or blind (without being ostentatious) need look no further than the 471 Silver Hawk."

Comes in the original factory hardcase and I have accumulated a total of 10 (yes ten) new 30 round magazines that go with the gun. Also included but not in the picture is the owner's manual. I am only selling because I have another suppressor that I plan to purchase so I am not looking to trade for anything at all, just want to sell. The ten magazines alone cost me a couple hundred bucks. Also worth mentioning these guns have a lifetime warranty from Keltec that transfers with the pistol to the new owner. Located in Trumann which is about 10 minutes from Jonesboro. I stay very busy and prefer the gun to be picked up in Trumann but I am in Jonesboro every other day or so and could possibly meet there. These guns and mags aren't easy to find so please no lowball offers. The price is $400 for the gun and the ten mags. Will not sell to anyone that appears to be criminalistic or shady in any way. I rarely check email so the only way to get ahold of me is by phone. My number is REDACTED and name is Jason. I also have a Henry Golden Boy listed in .22 Mag."

SOCOM Series Sound Suppressor (Silencer) Specifications Caliber 5.56 mm (.223 caliber) Length 5.3 inches Weight 14.6 ounces Diameter 1.5 inches Description SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER OPEN BOX, NEVER USED The SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER Fast-Attach® suppressor is identical to our SOCOM556-MINI suppressor, but has serrated teeth on the front plate for added bite if the situation demands it. The MINI and MINI MONSTER are both shorter, lighter versions of SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, which was selected for the M4 and Mk18 carbines by US Special Operations Command after placing first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted, and which also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding. With an overall length of just 5.3 inches, the SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER is extremely compact and lightweight. It features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire’s patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. A new indexing system means it mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles. The SOCOM556-MINI MONSTER is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color. All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page. SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use. All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders. Features • Patented Fast-Attach® design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds • Identical to the SureFire SOCOM556-MINI, but with serrated teeth on the front plate • Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials • Provides effective attenuation of sound and dust signatures • Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach-detach cycles • Compact and lightweight for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics • Advanced core design to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback • Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash • Integrated blast shield increases durability • Constructed of advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and stainless steel • Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote™ finish in Black or Dark Earth color

Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. In addition, the gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, limiting the amount of gas escaping and maximizing the amount of propellent gases inside the barrel. Effectively, the maximization of gases in the barrel increases the velocity as much as possible within the respective barrel length. The longer the barrel, the higher the velocity and accuracy. This Python’s bore looks like it left the factory yesterday and as such, its accuracy should be phenomenal. The bluing is 99-100 percent. The action is as crisp as you would expect a Python to be and timing is perfect."

With its 14"" barrel and compact 26.4"" overall length, the Remington 870 TAC-14 is extremely maneuverable and delivers plenty of 12 gauge stopping power. Built on the proven, all-steel 870 receiver, the little TAC-14 is handy in tight places, especially where there isn’t enough room to effectively use a full-sized shotgun. It’s even compact enough to make a dandy truck gun.The 870 TAC-14 sports a ""bird’s head"" Shockwave Raptor pistol grip that helps take the bounce out of recoil, ensuring you have excellent control of the gun, shot after shot. Rounding out the TAC-14 is a Magpul® MOE® forend with M-LOK accessory-mounting points, plus extended front and rear handstops that further enhance your control of the TAC-14.  NO NFA registration or tax stamp required! Chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shotshells and slugs Fixed choke Durable reinforced polymer stock Bead front sight  The Remington 870 TAC-14 is not classified as a ""shotgun"", “short barrel shotgun,” or “any other weapon” under the NFA, so it is not subject to federal Class 3/NFA firearms restrictions and is simply classified as a “pump-action firearm.” This is because its overall length is greater than 26"", and it is not capable of being shouldered, meaning the TAC-14 can be purchased without an ATF NFA registration or tax stamp. State and local restrictions may still apply."

KAC finally achieved perfection with this generation. Run 175gr Federal Gold Medal Match (GM762M2) and you can be confident in outstanding accuracy and 100% reliability with and without a suppressor. Round count is only about 400, all in casual target shooting, so this rifle is still a baby.
This kit includes a number of premium upgrades and accessories. I had Ayan George (boltcarrier.com), who is the premier third-party KAC armorer, remove the original KAC flash hider (included) and install a Surefire SOCOM muzzle brake (SFMB-762-SR25). The brake is very effective but even better when used with a Surefire SOCOM762-RC2 suppressor (suppressor NOT included!).
I bought numerous magazines and only kept the ones that would easily drop free from the mag well. Included are four KAC steel mags and two Magpul mags, all 20-round capacity.
Also included is a full KAC rifle buffer system: KAC rifle receiver extension (buffer tube), KAC rifle buffer and KAC rifle action spring. Currently installed on the gun is a Magpul PRS Gen3 adjustable stock. The complete original KAC carbine buffer kit is also included, along with a Magpul CTR and Limbsaver recoil pad. Thus you have the best of both worlds for precision and carbine uses.
Other included accessories are the Magpul MIAD grip, Badger 34mm 20 MOA 1.3"" high Unimount, Triad Tactical Sniper Skid Plate (the grippy forearm wrap that assists with shooting off barricades or other hard surfaces), Surefire Warden blast diffuser (which helps when you're not using a suppressor), Vickers padded SAW sling, and a JP Enterprises bore guide. I have a left-side safety currently installed, but the original KAC ambi safety is included. The original manual and outstanding factory test target are also included. No BUIS are included. Original LMT SOPMOD stock is not included."
