Also available is an over the chest 'bandaid' that holds plenty of shells I am willing to sell. I can throw in some shells and slugs for another $30, plenty to start out with or top off your supply. Italian made, this is a lightweight and smooth shotgun- very high quality and in like new quality- I have never even fired the gun. The tactical design is more saught out and is perfect for home defense with a smaller overall weapon size and weight. As short barrel as legally allowed. 
 
I am asking $390 for the shotgun, $30 for the bandoleer fully stocked with 12Guage slugs ($20 empty). I have rougly 20 slugs and shells i can throw in for another $10 to get you started. 
For trades I am looking for a compact .40, .45, .357, or even a .38 if they are of similar value, if your offer is worth less we can balance it with cash.

Features: PLEASE note that Shadow Orange is a very rare pistol with limited availability. When it came out the first time a few years ago, it was sold out immediately. Now we are lucky to see only a few pieces that hit the USA market at this time again (you can see a few other sellers selling this model for more). These pistols that are currently showing on the market are a very limited run that was originally slotted for Australia. However, due to the general shortage of CZ firearms in the USA - CZ USA was able to source a few of these Shadow Orange pistols - making this a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for U.S CZ collectors to get the last of Sp-01 Shadow Orange pistols. Since Shadow 2 is now in production - when these Original Shadow Orange models are gone - they are gone forever as there will not be made anymore. Any questions?

The legendary Glock 19 . . . Improved. The GLOCK 19 is ideal for a more versatile role because of its reduced dimensions when compared to the standard sized option. Chambered in 9x19, the G19 has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon.The most popular GLOCK pistol of all time is now available with the numerous improvements that define the Gen 5 pistol line. The versatility of the G19 is further enhanced in its fifth generation while also preserving the dependability it is known for.The GLOCK 19 Gen5 showcases the latest technology and engineering that drives GLOCK's constant pursuit of perfection. The G19 Gen5 features over 20 design modifications from its Gen4 predecessor, including the GLOCK Marksman Barrel, an nDLC finish, ambidextrous slide stop levers, a grip with no finger grooves, and a flared mag-well, all wrapped in a package perfect for concealed carry or use as a back-up weapon. These changes deliver improved accuracy, durability, performance, control, and flexibility in both low-stress and high-stress situations.Improved Durability - NDLC FinishThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the proprietary GLOCK nDLC finish. This enhanced finish reduces corrosion and scratching and improves performance in adverse conditions.Improved Accuracy - Glock Marksman Barrel (GMB)The GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the GLOCK Marksman Barrel. The barrel’s new rifling and crown deliver improved accuracy for both the beginner and the seasoned gun owner.Universal Fit - No Finger GroovesThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols have no finger grooves on the grip. Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip, delivering consistent comfort and improved control to a wider range of consumers, regardless of hand size.Quicker Reloading - Flared Magazine WellThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature a flared mag-well. The larger opening found in the mag-well of GLOCK Gen5 pistols makes quicker and easier magazine changes possible, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of a second matter.Ambi Operation - Ambidextrous Slide StopThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature ambidextrous slide stop levers. Now it is easier than ever for both left-handed and right-handed gun owners to quickly, comfortably, and safely manipulate the slide."

This pistol is in perfect condition (less than 1,000 rounds through it), has been extremely well-maintained, and features a number of custom modifications that make it a dream for the true 1911 enthusiast. I have been holding onto this pistol in the hopes that I would find the time to get to the range and enjoy it, but my schedule just won't allow it these days, so I'd like to see it go to someone who will enjoy and appreciate it.The Springfield TRP (Tactical Response Pistol) is one of the best 1911s on the market. It features a forged carbon steel national match frame and slide with a black Armory Kote finish, a stainless steel match grade barrel, a 4.5-5 lb trigger pull, low-profile 3-dot Tritium night sights, black/grey G10 grips, and 2 stainless steel 7-round .45ACP magazines with slam pads. While the factory TRP is an excellent firearm, this particular pistol has been modified to reduce recoil, increase accuracy, improve handling, and reduce wear that results from normal use. All custom machine work was performed by an experienced and reputable 1911 gunsmith (Jimmy Mitchell of Mitchell Custom Guns in Breckenridge, TX). Each part was checked, machined, and tested for this specific pistol, ensuring perfect fit and performance. Here is a list of improvements and high-quality aftermarket parts that have been added to this pistol:- EGW 1-piece tungsten full-length guide rod- Custom stainless steel short flat trigger- SVI reverse recoil spring plug (spring tunnel/dust cover of slide has been machined to fit this plug)- 16 lb. Wolff recoil spring- EGW flat-bottom firing pin stop- Smith & Alexander mag guide mainspring housing (20 LPI checkering)- 19 lb. Ed Brown mainspring- Wilson Combat Factory Plus mainspring internals (cap, retainer, and pin)- Ed Brown steel firing pin- Wolff Extra Power firing pin spring- ""1/4 notch"" removed from hammer- Wilson Combat Bullet Proof Tactical thumb safety (single-sided safety)- Wilson Combat Factory Plus hammer and sear pins- Wilson Combat Bullet Proof semi-extended slide release- Wilson Combat Bullet Proof Tactical mag release- VZ Elite Tactical Carry (ETC) G10 grips in black cherry finish I am selling this pistol with the original case, 2 magazines, gun lock, plastic holster, plastic magazine holder, and cleaning brush. You will also receive the original parts (in case you'd like to revert some of the modifications back to their factory state, to better suit the pistol to your liking). The pistol will come with 2 sets of VZ ETC G10 grips (one for use with a single-sided safety, and another for use with a double-sided safety), as well as the original black/grey G10 grips. I'm also including a really comfortable N82 Tactical IWB holster for this pistol, as well as a leather magazine holder.  If you're interested, I have a few boxes of Federal HST hollowpoint ammunition that I would be willing to sell along with the pistol for a fair price. My asking price for this pistol is $1,250 OBO.  If you are local, cash is preferred for payment.  If not, I am willing to accept PayPal.  I am not capable of accepting credit card payments because I am a private individual and not a business, and I'm not comfortable accepting any sort of personal/cashier's check.  If you are not local, I am willing to ship this firearm to your FFL via UPS Next Day Air or FedEx Priority Overnight."
