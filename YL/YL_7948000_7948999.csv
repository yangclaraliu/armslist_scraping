I've had no malfunctions with it just can't hit the broad side of a barn. It might have a use as a paperweight or snake shot gun. Would be great for a tackle box or tool box gun. The right side was repaired at one time with a newer component. Again the gun works fine, its just uglier than anything else out there."

M1 Carbine Quality Hardware 1.5 Million. This one sits in an Inland stock set that was re-arseneled at Springfield Armory between WWII and the Korean War and has the SA/SHM stamp with SA Orndance Wheel inspection stamp on the stock just below the adjustable rear sight. I took this rifle over to my gunsmith and had him remove the tight barrel band and we discovered that it's an early release with the rare removable recolil spring tube, so the price has increased. Stock shows signs of repair and I have included pics of that.  I don't recall all the parts inside, so if you want pictures, I'll do a basic field strip, but I won't disassemble the trigger group and/or bolt. I have shot this rifle with USGI LC ammo and it functions fine. Muzzle wear is a little over one with a shiny bore. Throat erosion is a little over one as well. Comes with a USGI Mag, Butt Stock mag holder, repro sling and oiler. I I'll throw in 100 rounds of carbine ammo as well. $950 NO TRADES. CASH ONLY.   I'll drive within one hour of Orlando to get this sold.Photo Album with 34 pictures: https://imgur.com/a/R1uwy"

Item Description: An Action Competition Pistol Laden With Popular Custom Features
The Canik TP9SFX 9mm competition pistol is firing-line ready, right out of the box. It’s an excellent starting point for shooters just getting into pistol competition, and it has plenty of features experienced competitors want, too. Aside from its whopping 20-round magazine capacity, the Canik TP9SFX is all about adaptability and customization. It comes with a set of factory installed Warren Tactical fiber optic sights, plus a slide cut for mounting a red dot sight.
 
Canik supplies four different red dot mounting plates, so you have your pick of just about any popular low-profile red dot pistol sight for your TP9SFX. The Warren rear sight is mounted on the red dot slot cover plate - when you install a red dot, the rear sight is automatically removed, eliminating unwanted interference between the two. But that’s not the end of the TP9SFX’s customizing options! Other high-end features include:
 
    Single action trigger with 3.5-4 lb. pull
    Interchangeable backstrap inserts for a custom fit to your hand
    Ambidextrous cocking lever
    Adjustable-length, reversible magazine release button
    Precision button-rifled, match-grade 5.2"" barrel
    Striker status indicator for instant operator feedback
    Picatinny rail under the barrel for light or laser sight
    Non-reflective Tungsten Gray Cerakote finish over a phosphate base
 
The Canik TP9SFX pistol comes with two 20-round magazines plus, for the benefit of the beginning competition shooters, a polymer holster with optional paddle or belt attachment, cleaning rod, and brush"
