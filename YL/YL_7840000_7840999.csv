I can build the slide to fully functional but u will have to wait for me to get the parts shipped. I don't have any right now. Why buy a Polymer80 instead of OEM GLOCK frame? 1 word: Ergonomics! Once u feel this frame in ur hand u will instantly know.With the improved ergonomics of the handle plus the double undercut of the trigger guard, u feel like u have a better purchase on this than any of the OEM GLOCK frames. 2. NO FFL REQUIRED! No taxes or transfer fees and nobody knows ur business. 3. The satisfaction of building ur own firearm. U will know ur gun inside and out after building it.This can be built in a few hours with minimal tools (hand files, sand paper, drill, (dremel optional)). The directions say to use a drill press but after a lot of research I've found this isn't necessary and isn't the best way to do it anyways. Polymer80 compact (G19) frame (grey or black) $150RMR cut slide $325Raptor cut slide $375Built right, this will end up being just as reliable as an OEM. I can send u videos of testimonials to the reliability of these pistols.There are a ton more as well.

The gun has a single/double action trigger, a decocker (for when you have one in the chamber), a 9lb trigger pull/4lb trigger pull (when hammer is cocked), and a European/HEEL mag release to name a few features. This gun is fully functional, and is one of the best and smoothest firing guns I have ever shot. I really do not want to sell it, but looking to move towards other things.I have 2 magazines for the gun, a paddle holster, and case to go with it. I clean this gun ATLEAST every other week to make sure it is lubed. My price is based in all of the other ones I've seen listed and sold for, also have had an appraisal of the gun at a local gun shop. We can try to make a deal, just let me know your offer.Looking to either sell the gun, or trade for an AR15 chambered in 5.56. I might trade it for another 9mm, but not preferable.
