It comes with 1 mag, takedown screw, ironsight guard, and handguard retainer. The top handguard is missing and the 1 screw that goes through the front sight base. The bore is very clean( and I can send pics upon request) but the iron sight guard has some light rust on it. I don’t have the time to buy and replace the rifle handguard and screw even though it’s an easy fix that is under $40 I just don’t have the time. This rifle is in good shape, it has very small surface rust on the left side of the receiver but it was taken off with mineral oil and extremely fine steel wool so she’s good as new. There is no pitting but the bluing is what you would expect of a rifle from ‘43 and who knows what it’s been through. This rifle was obviously not sitting on a rack in an Arsenal during the war so you can take it or leave it but this rifle shows HEAVY signs of use. The reason I can say that is this was a gift from an older friend of mine who was the first owner and he bought it from a dealer. He field stripped it for storage and misplaced the top handguard and the 2 screws. This rifle can be fixed for under $40 I just don’t have the time to fix her. If I don’t sell her I will eventually replace the parts and repost it for a higher price. I will not sell the magazine separately, these rifles are going for around $400 and those who know how much the magazines cost will know what a good deal this is. Thanks for looking and I can send additional pictures upon request. Price is firm"

367,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7781367,For Sale:  ALG DEFENSE ADVANCED COMBAT TRIGGER - NICKEL PLATED,"Washougal, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 70,"Listed On: Friday, May 11, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BUY NOW: https://www.limitlessamerica.com/products/alg-defense-advanced-combat-trigger-nickel-plated Description: The ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.    Note: HardLubing is ALG's term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT's single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components.   • The ALG Defense ACT trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components. • Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. • Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. • Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness. • Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. • A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. • Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated. • Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.0lbs. 2. Advantages for the Armorer • The ALG Defense ACT trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged. • Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets. • As a trigger meeting the essential U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense ACT can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements."

The gun has almost no wear and has been cleaned thoroughly and regularly.  This Packaged deal would make the perfect gift for new and experienced shooters alike. This was originally purchased as my wife’s first gun, but she is now ready to graduate to something with a little more kick.
 This is one of the softest shooting pocket guns on the market and with some practice can accurately reach out to about 50 yards. This gun is an absolute joy to shoot and an excellent choice for the recoil sensitive or those of us who want something that can be carried in practically any outfit.  
 If you’re a fan of the 1911 styling and want a brand you can depend your life on, the Sig P238 is the way to go.
 Included in this deal is:
 - 1 Sig p238 Extreme model, that comes with factory sig night sights and front slide cocking serrations
- a total of 5 magazines, one 6 round flush and four 7 round extended
- original carrying case and Sig cleaning mat
- 2 sets of grips, the original extreme grips and a pair of sig rose wood grips
- a shell for a tlr-6 light laser combo (this requires the Tlr-6 insert to function, not included)
- 4 regular holsters and 2 holsters that will fit the sig with the tlr-6 installed
- 50 rounds of hard ball 95grn FMJ
 To purchases all this new would cost you $800 or more, and with the quality of the Sig it can easily run 10,000 rounds down the pipe before any factory maintenance is needed.
 Total asking price for this deal is $480, I guarantee you will not find anything of this quality with this many accessories for this price.All local laws apply, bill of sale will be provided, no trades, thank you.-----------------

The RB5000 KynSHOT Marksman Recoil Buffer AR15 Carbine is a proven system that has seen heavy use with civilian competition shooters, law enforcement personnel and the United States Armed Forces.  This buffer is designed to fit any AR-15 with a collapsible stock.  This buffer was designed for 5.56 mm / .223 cal. rifles. Works with a variety of other AR-15 cartridges such as the 6.8 SPC and large bore AR calibers. High strength 17-4 Stainless Steel construction throughout the unit, making it virtually impervious to corrosion.  Military grade materials and processes used in manufacture.  Guaranteed 10 years or 1 Million Rounds. For subsonic ammunition (e.g. 300 AAC Blackout) – especially when running unsuppressed – we recommend the model RB5000L, which is tuned for lower energy applications. For higher power, harder running AR-15 applications (e.g. the .50 BEOWOLF) we recommend stepping up to the KynSHOT model RB5005.  The RB5005 will fit inside the buffer tube and spring of most AR-15s while removing more energy in operation."

This rifle is a tack-driver and with 168gr Sierra Match King HPBT (Federal-308M) it can shoot sub-MOA all day. If you elect to go with the chassis and stock below, it's capable of sub-1/2MOA with a good optic onboard. The barrel is a 20"" bull barrel that's fluted and threaded from the factory, so it's ready for a suppressor. I'm offering the rifle by itself for $650. - If you want it with the DPMS Jerry Miculek brake, it'll be an additional $30. The brake mitigates muzzle rise nearly 100% and dampens recoil by about 50%.

I can switch out the NEW XBP BCG for a standard mil-spec, M16 (semi-auto/full-auto) BCG (black), for $775/OBO w/ trade; however, the XBP BCG in FDE looks better and offers superior performance (and typically sell for around $200).
Trades: Price has been lowered for a quick cash deal. I am open to trades and am not looking for anything specific.
Specs:- Rock River Arms (Brass Aluminum Forging Enterprises) Upper Receiver; 7.5"" .223 Wylde / 5.56 NATO barrel with pistol length gas tube; 1:7 Twist; 4140 Chrome Moly steel; MIL-SPEC specifications exceeding the ISO-9002 Quality Standard and includes a manufacturer's lifetime warranty against defects; A2 barrel nut.- NEW Sharps XPB BCG (FDE)- UTG pro, free floating handguard
- Osprey Optics 4x32 MGD Scope; Mildot reticle with green/red/blue illumination; fiber optic front iron site paired with adjustable rear sight.
- Aero Precision Lower, with Premium parts kit (Strike)
- Shockwave Blade Stabilizer
- Ambidextrous charging handle
- Ambidextrous safety
- Strike Industries magazine catch
- Extended magazine release (Odin)
- Extended pivot/takedown pins (Strike)
- BAD Lever (Magpul)
- Rugged Polymer Ergonomic Pistol Grip W/ Storage- Heavy buffer
Notes: The pistol has ~300 rounds through it; however, the BCG is brand new. The Osprey sight/scope has performed beautifully. Zeroed at 50 meters, and has held the zero without issue. I purchased this optic from a local distributor and was completely skeptical because of the price point. The glass is extremely clear, the illumination is magnificent, and it has performed as well as any other optic I've owned. I've replaced the stock fiber optic rod with a thicker rod for better visibility/illumination. These rods go for a couple dollars on Amazon, so you can easily switch out the color or revert to the thinner rod size (if desired).Disclaimer: Purchaser must abide by all state and federal laws pertaining to this transaction.
