The serial number puts the manufacture at 1974.  The barrel in the carpet was pretty rusted, in and out, so I cut the worst off of it - gunsmith said about 2"" - and had a brake added. The original 24"" barrel is now about the same, but with a brake.  The slight pitting on the barrel and receiver came out, then I Duracoated everything in HK Black.  The bore looks very nice after a good scrubbing, and probably wasn't fired more than a box of shells in it's life.  I refinished the wood stock as well while adding a Decelerator recoil pad, but didn't spend alot of time on it.  The Leupold 4x needed coating as well, but it's still a fine old optic.  I did not and will not re-zero the scope.  That will be entirely up to the proud new owner.  This dangerous game caliber isn't something you want to take out every weeekend and shoot.  The rifle maybe weighs 8 pounds soaking wet, so the recoil is pretty harsh, but it may be a little tamer with the recoil pad and brake.  Not interested in trades, and I'll cover the FFL at Magnum Shooting Center in Colorado Springs.  Any other location will be on the buyer."

This car is all original (except the stereo), and all intact! No rust, no leaks, no missing pieces, tires still hold air, and fluids are still in engine. It has been sitting in a garage/barn since 2005. I got it with then intent to rebuild a few weeks ago, but life hit me and I will be unable to do so. It is a 5-Speed 3.0 DOHC, has 186,000, but previous owner believes it needs a new engine. It has red leather seats.. inside and outside is very dirty from sitting so long, but the dirt comes right off and there are no cracks in the leather or glass..its a project car so it doesn't run currently and the brakes are locked up so the tires aren't rolling. It would have to be picked up on a trailer or towed from the location it is now. It'd probably start with a new battery put in it, but it isn't recommended from the original owner due to his belief of a thrown rod. Overall, this car is definitely going to need some work to be worthy of being mechanical sound, but all in all it's a sweet car in excellent conditon and it needs to go home to someone who can get it going and do something with it. This car was only made for 5 years.. please someone take it and bring her back!! Will take offers and open to trades!"

LMR barrel dated 7/53.  Most other parts are Springfield.  The stock is a post war birch with only a proof P on the grip.  I dont have guages but the muzzle shows very tight with 3/16- 1/4"" showing on a bullet test. I probably only put a couple hundred rounds through it. Will come with CMP manual, certificate,  and I'll include a few Enbloc clips if you need them.  Overall a really nice shooter IHC. I am thinning out my collection as I dont shoot much anymore.  Please email me for more pictures, I have quite a few.  Thanks"

The rifle is built on a 1995 Remington 700 action , and comes with Zeiss Diavari-Z scope which is 3x12x56. I do not know the round count, the rifle and the barrel appear to have not been fired much at all. The rifle has a Harris bipod, and comes with original paperwork and the test fired target from H-S Precision. The rifle will come in a padded Boyt rifle case. I can be reached with questions at (336)314-5120, and I will ship the rifle with a copy of my drivers license to your FFL. I called H-S Precision for information on this rifle and it would cost you $3900 to build it today without the Zeiss scope. The only form of payment accepted will be a USPS money order."
