Rifle features include: Mark Bansner's own custom stainless steel action fitted with a Lilja match grade barrel that has been chambered using the ""dialed-in"" techniques developed for bench-rest rifles.

Jewell trigger is tuned to a crisp 2 1/2 pounds. All metal is coated with our polymer "" Titanium"" K-Cote metal finish that protects even under the most extreme conditions. The stock is our ""Sheep Hunter"" model by High Tech specialties that has been carefully pillar-bedded, shaped and cut to a 13 5/8"" LOP. Bansner's lightweight ADL trigger-guard and forend bushing has been added to give a clean, trim appearance. Paint color is our textured forest green with fleck. Cost on this gun was $6350.
