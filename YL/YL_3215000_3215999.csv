I want to sell it or trade it because I am looking for an assault rifle! Preferably a AR but I'm open for more options. So yes I am willing to trade! I am listing this for 900 dollars because I paid 1100 for it. If you have any questions please feel free to ask."

I can add some ammo for a little extra or the right trade (Winchester White Box and/or personal defense rounds)

I've put exactly 132 rounds through the pistol. There's a little surface rust in the grip screw head slots from swapping grips. and the gun was dropped so there's a ding on the front left side of the slide, and the left corner of the hammer and safety (doesn't affect function). The guy I bought the leather shoulder holster from told me it's from WWII, but there's no markings. It's in pretty rough shape. The holster needs some stitching and the shoulder strap is cracking or split in several places, but it holds the gun securely.
Package is over $800 new (not counting shoulder holster) before taxes, shipping, background fees, etc.
Yours for $550 cash, or a bit more in trade value.

I have around $700 invested in this package, and the MSRP on this is around $500 for the gun alone.  Please don't ask what my bottom dollar is or if this is for sale, or I won't respond.  $475 is the cash-only price, trade (or trade + cash) value will be higher.

I've taken it out to the range twice, exactly 100 rounds through it.  Virtually no recoil which is why I bought it as a training rifle - it's just too heavy for my nephew to handle and my daughter has many years before she's ready for the range.  I prefer cash, a straight trade, or trade + cash on your end.  Not looking to add any cash."

"" USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Contoured, extended slide release
Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator

Paid less than $400 for it at the time, actually bought two of them but it's twin has since been sold to a gentleman in Corvallis.  

If you're wondering why the price is so high please do your research before emailing me with a bunch of questions or making an offer.  Granted it's a beautiful revolver, but this is more of an enthusiasts/collector's revolver than one you buy for your wife or plan on using as a CCW.  Do what you like, just my opinion.  Price is firm and the only trade I would consider is a high-end 1911, Sig or Kimber are the lowest production pistols I'll consider.  

All custom fit and finish on this 60-9 was done directly by Smith & Wesson's Performance Center, have all the requisite paperwork on file.  Needless to say, this revolver will also run .38 Special and .38 Special +P for the faint at heart.   Please either email or text with questions, have plenty more pictures as well.

This is as powerful and as pretty as a Glock can get, and I still think it's incredibly ugly, but I at least gave it a shot.  Anyway, after all this work, figured I see if anyone out there has a different opinion and would like to take it off my hands, and more importantly, out of my safe.

Please either text or email with questions, and yes, I do realize you could go do all this work yourself for around the same price (minus the porting, of course) and please feel more than free to do so, but I don't need to be told that or berated in any other way because you think I'm another ""Armslist Price-Gouger"".

The original stock was sporterized and it had a rail added and the bayonet removed. I prefer original so I tried to get it back to what it once was. I purchased a new stock for it and also a bayonet with all the equipment required to attach it. The bayonet is included but not mounted. Serial numbers aren't matching but the bore is clean and the rifle shoots great absolutely no problems. Rifle comes with typical tools, cleaning kit, original stock, sling, 15-20 surplus rds, and 3-4 stripper clips. I'm looking for $200 cash or trade for another gun. I'm not looking for anything specific so offer up! Will meet at turners, oak tree, possibly somewhere in Burbank or simi.

Stock has been sanded and coated with boiled linseed oil.

EDIT: I'm adding an additional mosin! Buy them both for $250! I will not sell the Russian mosin separately they must be purchased together. The second mosin is a 1942 Russian that was cut down by the original owner to replicate a 59. The stock was refinished and although the front sight looks funky, it is sturdy and I had no problems hitting steel targets out at 600 yards. Gun cycles smoothly with no issues!"

I am dowtown Orlando during days and Oviedo, nights and eves.
I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger Mini Thirty rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

480,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3215480,For Sale:  ACOG 4X32 Green fiber optic with RMR .223 / 5.56 tested,"Lawton, Lawton, Oklahoma",$ 250,"Listed On: Thursday, June 26, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This listing is for an ACOG style scope with reflex sight. It measures 6 inches long and is solidly built with aircraft grade aluminum and multi-coated optics.

The scope features

4x32 magnification with a crosshairs reticle. The crosshairs have a bullet drop compensator out to 600 meters. Best of all, the reticle is fiber optic and the center

glows Green when light hits the tube on top of the scope. The stronger the light, the brighter the crosshairs against the target. This is true fiber optic, no batteries

required. Windage and elevation are adjusted using the screws under the two waterproof caps. Four clicks will move the bullet one-inch on a target 100 meters

away. If you are unfamiliar with ACOG type scopes, please be aware that they have a short eye relief coupled with a finely marked reticle so the scopes will need

to be mounted nearer to the eye. Comes complete with a Picatinny mount, which quickly attaches to your rail using two thumb screws. The reflex sight is a fine

red dot reticle and has fully adjustable windage and elevation. The reflex sight is powered by an easy to find CR 2032 battery. In addition, the ACOG has built in

back up iron sights on the left side of the scope. The scope and reflex are both shock resistant and waterproof, although extended submersion is not advised.  

.223 / 5.56mm approved. The test scopes were zeroed within 9 rounds with a 25 meter zero target. An additional 50 rounds were shot and held acceptable zeroes. 

For over a year now, We've sold hundreds of ACOGs / similar optics and have shot thousands of rounds using these scopes. Our local customers use these scopes weekly without fail and praise us for the affordable alternative ACOG scope that works!!! Now offering a 1 Year warranty on our scopes for any manufacturer defects.

The scopes will come new in package in factory boxes with allen wrenches.

Photos are representative, but buyer will receive a pistol in very similar condition and from the same lot. At press time on this ad, we had a few 1963 and 1964 production P1s that are C&R Eligible. All these are good to go on the California Roster until Feb 2015. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement may take any number of very similar Walthers at the same per-pistol price and with no extra shipping charges. From duty on the front lines of the Cold War with the Federal German Border Police, Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS, here is a very attractive Cold War piece manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, in the 1960s and 1970s. This pistol is certainly a symbolic piece of the Berlin Wall, and the island of Democracy that West Germany stood for. Each specimen bears correct West German proof marks, and their only U.S. marking is the federally mandated import stamp, PW Arms, so marked on the right forward side of the slide. Slide and frame have matching numbers. This is a lightweight, alloy-frame model P-1 in 9mm Luger, production of which began in 1963. It is very similar to, and a direct descendant of, the fabled steel frame P38 of World War II. Construction is durable anodized alloy frame with matte military finish on its barrel , slide, and all its steel parts. Type is traditional double and single action semi-auto with full safety / decocking lever. The P-1 has a firing pin safety as well, but no magazine safety. Magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm Luger, Parabellum, 9x19 ammunition, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 4 7/8 inches. Sights are dovetailed notch rear and blade front. Weight empty is 28.2 ounces. Surface detractions are minimal, only faint amounts of whitening on its sharp edges and light holster contact streaking. We rate these pistols as Very Good, close to Excellent, 85 to 90 percent vicinity by our estimate. If refinished, the lettering is so sharp it doesn’t matter. Photos, at any rate, should suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, and the West German Police always took good care of their firearms anyway. These are excellent quality pistols, but not designed for +P loads. Its historical importance includes the fact that the P38 was the direct ancestor to our own well known 3900 and 5900 Smith & Wessons, and the Beretta 92 / M9. Own one of these Cold Warrior Walther P-1 pistol, the one in the photos or one of its substantially identical mates, for only $ 339.00. California DOJ Roster Status good until Feb 2015. Not transferable to any civilian residents of Massachusetts.

This listing is for one pistol; FFLs, Law Enforcement, and collectors, however, may take any number of extras, subject to our stock on hand, at the same per-pistol price and with no additional shipping charges. The PT-911 shows Taurus innovation and German influence at the same time. Taurus took its Beretta Compact type frame and installed a shorter, sturdier slide with looks akin to the German Sig Pistols. Here is Taurus’s PT-911 in blue steel and black anodized finish, with a straighter, thinner grip frame on the order of Beretta’s Vertec frames for shooters more comfortable with a pared-down grip frame compared to the relatively fat feeling 92 variants. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Type is compact traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a matte finished alloy frame; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft. Height is 4 15/16 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate; and 6 15/16 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut. Minimum frame thickness is .740, with a maximum slide thickness of 1.07 inches. Frame is equipped with an integral Picatinny or Weaver type rail for optical, laser and light accessories. Magazine capacity is 15 rounds, 15+1 total capacity. Barrel length is 4 inches according to the box label, but 3 3/4 inches by our own measurement. This pistol comes furnished with two blue steel finger rest floorplate Taurus factory magazines; and any Taurus 92/99 magazine will fit into this pistol with some protrusion. Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry. Current replacement pricing on the PT 911 is upwards of $500 per unit in our area, if a person can even find one. We’re offering the PT-911 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 349.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement, we will sub One Factory Taurus PT-911 Ten Rounder for the two 15s, or $25 off with no magazines, buyer’s call. Affected jurisdictions include Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, and New York. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority Mail, insured with Delivery Confirmation.
