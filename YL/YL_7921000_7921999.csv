I've only fired 50 rounds down the pipe with this pistol. I've recently purchased it, so it's a 2017 model year SR22. Comes complete with factory packaging, manuals, 2 different sized interchangable grips, 2 magazines, flat magazine base plates. Great pistol for plinking, training a new shooter, or just having fun. Also, it's VERY well made! The slide is machined billet aluminum, NOT cast. The barrel is a solid chunk of milled stainless steel, with a great feed ramp. Adjustable sights (front drift, rear drift and elevation), functioning decock and safety lever. Weighs 17 ounces so has a decent heft in hand, but not heavy, and feels great in the hand! I wear an XL sized glove, and it fits great with the large grip in place.ADDED BONUS: Comes from the Davidson's distributor and includes the Davidson's warranty card! Why does this matter? Because Davidson's offers a lifetime warranty for all firearms they sell. Simply submit the registration card, and if you ever have any malfunctions witht the gun, take it to a Davidson FFL and they'll ship you a new firearm from the Davidson inventory, not the manufacturer. Not such a big deal with a Ruger, as they have great customer service, but nonetheless, nice to have this added peace of minded.Lastly, if your email simply asks if the item is still for sale, I'm going to assume you're a spam-bot and not likely reply so try to make yourself sound like a real person by signing your name etc. Thanks for looking, hope to hear from you soon..."

The SMR MK8 is one of the first rails available to utilize the Magpul M-LOK technology. These rails are designed to give the user full modularity while maintaining a strong and rigid platform. Maximum venting at the lower 45Â° quadrants create maximum heat dissipation and also dramatically reduces the railâ€™s overall weight. Utilizing Magpulâ€™s M-LOK technology at the 3, 6, and 9 oâ€™clock positions, as well as the upper 45Â° quadrants. The SMR MK8 is both versatile and modular, allowing the user to tailor their platform to his or her unique needs.Â  The SMR MK8 also features Geisseleâ€™s proprietary 2.25â€³ long barrel nut. This increases the surface contact where the rail interfaces with the receiver and creates a platform that can be trusted to be straight and true the entire length of the free float rail. This increases accuracy and zero repeatability during disassembly and reassembly when performing maintenance.Â  Bundled with a low-profileÂ Geissele Super Gas Block, a $59 value, the SMR MK8 is not only feature packed, but it is also value packed."

Comes with everything in pic. All of our slides have an RMR cut standard, and come with a “Battle Plate” that fills the void when the RMR is not installed. This plate is designed in a way that enables one hand manipulation of the firearm that increases safety. We don’t do top serrations due to training issues with the masses. On our Battle Plate, the serrations and screw lugs are on the 45 angle cuts. Placing these serrations and lugs here, forces the shooter to angle the pistol away from the body when using one hand to rack the pistol.  Internal Work  We start by swapping out the recoil system with an ISMI stainless steel guide rod and flat wire recoil spring. We replace only one spring in the trigger system which is the plunger safety spring. The other springs are stock and will grant consistent primer strikes and positive reset. We use a factory OEM minus connector and tune the factory trigger bar. With all this work the pull weight will be 4-4.25 pounds depending on the pistol. We also manufacture our own trigger shoe which is flat with a curved toe. This fixes the issue of trigger/trigger guard finger and glove bite. Frame work  We remove the finger grooves, cut in gas pedals, and bevel out the inside area of the trigger guard on a mill. We call the gas pedals the “Accelerator Cuts” and they offer enhanced traction on the pistol. With the accelerator cuts, muzzle rise is dramatically decreased and follow up shots are faster. We do a non-traditional double undercut and dock the front of the trigger guard for aesthetic purposes. We finish the frame off with full stippling"

I'm only selling it because there's an item I need to buy and it needs to be paid for right away so that's why I'm dropping the price so take advantage of it while it's this low of a priceSurvival Armor SPECOPS version in color Tan. Ballistic protection is level IIIa. Its a very well made ballistic helmet and with all the new parts (such as Exfil liner and 4pt x nape chin strap) and accessories(Revision rails and VAS type aluminum shroud) it's one of the best I have ever put together and I have built many of these helmets. I don't think it's ever been used because  It doesnt appear to be used at all or if it was it was very lightly used. The original helmet liner appears to never have been used at all as it has absolutely zero signs of ever being worn and the helmet itself  doesn't look like it's ever been used . Size Med but with the new liner I installed it can fit up to XL. Has new Revision side rails in FDE that sell for $90. I also installed a new set of side rail bungee cables. New exfil type liner and new 4pt chin strap with x nape pad. VAS type aluminum shroud in FDE also new. I can meet face-to-face in the South Philly or South Jersey area or will ship anywhere in the US only with payment through PayPal and shipment through USPS Priority Mail.This helmet sells for $450-$500 without the accesories and another $240 or more in new accessories. So it is a truly very good deal. Shipping is $10 USPS PRIORITY with tracking sent right away
