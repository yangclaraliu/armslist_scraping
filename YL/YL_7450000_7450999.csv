Great fit/function. It's got the SAW style pistol grip, and it comes with two buffer tubes, one for use with optics, and one for use with irons. It still fits in the backpack that comes with the 10/22 takedown. However, it is definitely more snug. I have a small red dot sight on my takedown and it barely fit. Ultimately I took the stock off my rifle, because I keep a lot of stuff in the backpack, and with this Tapco chassis system I couldn't pick it as full as I would like to.It's a.really great upgrade from the OEM stock, and with the collapsible stock and along mounts, rails, etc,  it definitely gives you more options.Shoot me an email if you're interested.

The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro's forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum.The 12-gauge and the 20-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads, making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover and a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto.This Benelli Montefeltro comes with the Benelli Box and Benelli Hard case. It does come with Chokes, Full, Modified, and Improved Cylinder. It also has the choke wrench. This gun was very well taken care of. It is used but the gun has no markings or scratches. (Pictures!) You will be able to see in the pictures. This gun is chambered in 20 Ga, and has a 26"" Barrel. In my opinion, the gun as a whole, I would grade it at 95+, on because it has been shot.SPECIFICATIONS: Mfg Item Num: 10865Category: FIREARMS - SHOTGUNSGauge: 20 GaugeBarrel Length: 26 in Capacity: 4+1Chamber: 3 in Overall Length: Weight: 7.1Sight: Fiber Optic front, Mid Bead Sight Used!

Also throwing in a clean OEM case with lock, speed loader, brush, and manual.$570 for the whole thing which I think it's a good deal considering used TLR-1HLs go for about $80 and the Dawson sights are about $100 used. $180 street price on upgrades puts the base gun at $390. I can part out the TLR-1 for $60 less. Must sign bill of sale or present CCW. No I won't ship to an FFL."
