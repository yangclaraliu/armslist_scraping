I have an HECKLER & KOCH \ H&K \ HK USP 40 v1 (DA/SA) Pistol Chambered in .40 S&W up for sale or trade.This Full Sized HK USP 40 comes in HK Hard Case\Box with Owners Manual.The HK UPS 40 Variant 1 is a Double Action \ Single Action Pistol.The Pistol will come with (2)x 13 round Law Enforcement/Military configuration Magazines/Clips. This HK variant includes a safety lever that also function as a hammer decocker and the typical HK ambidexterous mag release.This gun is used but looks to be in good to very good overall condition.All numbers matching (Barrel, Slide, & Frame).No major signs of wear or abuse.There are signs of firing and handling marks so expect this to be an ultra accurate shooter and not an untouched safe queen.
Given condition grading is subjective, please feel free to contact me for addition photos to ensure condition is acceptable to the buyer. 
While this HK is from my personal collection I have just been issued my FFL so the Buyer must be willing and able to fill out a form 4473 FFL transfer form and pass the ATF background check.  Would prefer a buyer with a concealed weapon permit (to avoid the 3 day waiting period) but not a must. FYI - There will be NO charge for the background check and NO FFL transfer fee.

Serial #3544. The outside has been re-done and a good job of that. The Stevens name and other info was left pretty much in tact. The rest of the shotgun has been either blued/powder painted or sanded and varnish applied. The action on this shotgun is still very tight. The bore? It's either very dirty or has rust pits. I think the latter. Tried to take pics of the bore but I need some tutoring on how to do that right. People always ask me if it's shootable. Would you really want to?? I reload so I suppose I could reload something real mild but I'm not going to say it's shootable. Even though I'm a mechanical engineer/gunsmith for the last 45 years I still have to say you should have it looked at by a competent gunsmith. But in spite of the re-build done on it I think it's a cool wall hanger or conversation piece. Wow, 1864 and in this kind of shape. See pics, please, for the best description. Thanks for looking.
