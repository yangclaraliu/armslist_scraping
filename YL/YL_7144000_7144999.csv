We know it is a West German model because of the proof marks on the frame and tha fact it is stamped ""Made in W. Germany"" on the slide. On the ""slide chin"" there are three stamped marks. The top one is for the Kiel Proof House that tested the firearm. The middle mark shows that it was tested with ""Nitro"" rounds, and the bottom mark, ""JJ"" tells us it was proofed in 1988. The serial number of this firearm also dates to 1988. The serial number is stamped on the frame, slide, and barrel. Includes two magazines - one 7 round factory mag and one 8 round Promag, cable lock, and Sig hard case. This Sig is not a new gun. I would rate it a 7 out of 10. If your looking for a W. German Sig P220 that you can use and carry without worrying about getting a scratch on it, you cant beat this one for the price. Price is $500.00 Cash. Not looking for offers or trades.Buyer must be a Florida Resident at least 21 years of age and legally able to own/possess a firearm.

If you are wanting to trade please work out details before coming, and if you are coming to buy let me know you are on your way so I will have it ready for you to look at. We are in the process of setting up a large yardsale with tools and man items with a lot of our personal vehicles and trailers. There will be something for everyone, but while we are setting up, we don't care to pull a few firearms out. We are thinning out our collection some. I also have a way to accept credit cards at a 3.5% charge (what it charges me)Don't contact me unless you are legal to own a gun."

This rifle is tight fitting and very smooth cycling.  This rifle is rust free, no pitting, with a very nice blued finish.  There is some blueing wear on the loading gate and hammer from use.  There is slight wear on the blueing at the barrel band and muzzle from the leather scabbard.  Included in sale is a heavy leather scabbard from Eubanks Leather in Boise ID, which comes with straps for rigging to a saddle (cartridge case in photos is not included).  The scabbard is used but in good working shape, leather has been conditioned. Price for rifle and scabbard is $800, firm. I will ship from my gun shop to yours at your expense.  I will consider a trade for a ruger 77/357 plus cash.  It's a very fun rifle in good shape, thanks for looking.  Please contact me for more pictures."

This is a closed bolt semi auto pistol. It is in fair condition and is missing the extractor and needs a retaining pin that holds the firing pin in. This model can be converted from 45 acp to 9mm. Comes with two magazines. I purchased it as a project but have other projects that have taken priority.
