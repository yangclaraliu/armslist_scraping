Well not really because I do see it pretty often, just never thought I would be the guy doing it. Anyway long story short my home was broken into and they ran off with my guns, my iPad, my fiances iPad, my 6 year olds tablet, and a big water jug 3/4 of the way filled up with silver coins that we had been saving for 2-2.5 years. I don't have homeowners insurance so I'm pretty well screwed. Being the the first of the month with all my bills being due and the cost of replacing my back door and door frame which is a French door so it's gonna be pretty dam expensive, so I'm pretty well strapped on money for a few weeks. I do have an LG 43LH5700 flat screen Smart TV (43""). I paid almost $400 for the tv and barely used it maybe half a dozen times. It was to big for my room and hurt my eyes being so close to the bed so I had to get something smaller. It has set in my spare room unused. I also have a really nice wall mount still in the box for it. It adjust side to side and tilts with a quick release. I gave almost $90 for the stand. If anyone has a lower end handgun they are looking to part with and could use a nice TV and wall mount and would be willing to do some trading you would definitely be helping a guy out big time. I feel completely naked walking around without one of my sidearms. Surprisingly I still have my tvs left. I guess the thiefs arms were to full with my other belongings. Like I said I hate doing this and it is kind of embarrassing but just looking for something cheap to carry until I get all this stuff takin care of and can purchase something new. Thanks much in advance."

The bore has some shiny and good rifling but some really decent pits as well. You must have the gun checked by a gunsmith before firing. The action seems reasonably tight and functions good. I loaded three round in the magazine and they feed fine The metal looks cleaned long ago over some pitting. Don't ask if it can be buffed and cleaned up. No The markings are visible and not hard to read. The butt stock is the best part of the rifle and solid with out any cracks but of course was cleaned up long ago. The forearm wood is solid as well and clean long ago as well. I replaced the rear sight with a Marbles with the same condition as the rifle and looks very respectable indeed.
