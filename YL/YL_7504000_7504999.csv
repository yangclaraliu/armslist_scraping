Magpul AFG and (2) 20 roung FN magazines included.
The gun has approximately 1500 rounds through it.  The factory gas port has been replaced with a HD stainless port matched to the linear comp so as to produce correct, reliable function w/out being over gassed.  As anybody that has a SCAR 17 can attest, the factory (PWS) muzzle brake is a beast and very unpleasant for anybody close to you.  The HERA comp really tames this gun down.  I was worried about recoil increasing with the linear comp.  I was pleasantly surprised when it did not increase.  It actually made the gun more pleasant to shoot.  The recoil impulse feels like it was extended over a slightly longer time than before.  It is much easier to stay on target and overall an awesome weapon.  Just trying to free up funds for night vision.No shipping, transfer at a FFL. If you are serious buyer, I will gladly let you inspect the weapon."

I'm usually not a fan of stipling on Glocks, but this one is done right, looks good, and provides better grip. Gun looks and functions flawlessly. Both mags have pinky extension, one is stipled as well. Sites are bright. Not much more to say. Sell to MO resident, legal to own only. Thanks for looking."

The finest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards. America's best shooters keep choosing Kimber. Legendary LAPD™ SWAT tested five major 1911 brands and chose Kimber. United States Marines assigned to Special Operations Command chose Kimber. The U.S.A. Shooting Rapid Fire Pistol Team trains for Olympic competition with a Kimber. Most recently, LAPD™ SIS transitioned to Kimber. They all chose Kimber for the same reason: quality, dependability and accuracy. So should you.

Any knowledgeable input would be appreciated here, as ar57 Center has HORRIBLE customer service and has been no help at all. From what I have read, for what it’s worth, I need about an 8.2oz buffer and a little space left inside for the weights to slide(supposedly that helps with bolt bounce in this upper?), and an m16 cut bcg(I don’t know if I NEED the FA bcg but I have seen YouTube videos with this upper and a FOSTECH echo2)."
