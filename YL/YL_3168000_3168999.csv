About the gun, unfortunately the gun does have what appears to be a little rock rash on the top of the barrel from about the 1st third of the fore grip to the back of the barrel. Other than that there are minimal scratches on the wood and it works fine. Been reading a lot about these guns and they seem to be of very high quality, I'd keep it but I don't need it."

This one was made in the late 70's, putting it at 30+ years old. It sat in a gun safe for a long time.

The cool thing about Dan Wessons is that the barrels are easily removed and installed with a special tool. The barrels are threaded on both ends. One end screws into the frame and you use a .006 feeler gauge to set the gap between the barrel and the cylinder. Then you slide the accompanying shroud over the barrel and tighten it down with the barrel nut. This applies tension on both ends of the barrel reducing harmonic vibrations and improving accuracy. Dan Wesson made barrels from 2 ½ to 15 inches!"

My father-in-law left it in a soft side case and the case got wet and took some pretty bad water damage. He then got it back in working order taking it to a gunsmith so the gun works very well. He intended to fix it up but recently passed on leaving this. The barrels on the inside are in very good shape but there is some real pitting on the outside. The wood stock needs completely redone but is in usable shape. There is a duck scene on one side and quail on the other. The reciever is completely tooled and still in fairly good looking order. So all in all a very usable but somewhat ugly 20 guage where spending some time on the wood and this wouldnt look all that bad. It is a great gun to take out and not worry about as is. Anyway give me a realistic offer or a trade and maybe we can work out something.

Oh boy who's looking for a beauty to add to their collection?? This is a very nice example of the high polish stainless PYTHON that Colt offer in the late 80's and 90's. I believe this sweetheart to be manufactured around 1992. She has seen few rounds...there is barely a cylinder rotation mark to be seen, the bore is perfect as is the cylinder and the timing. Rear sight is fully adjustable, vented rib and full underlug. Grips are original neoprene with the Colt emblem intact on both sides. A few faint marks in the finish only because it will scratch easily since it is high polished...some probably came that way from the factory...believe me when I say they are faint. To all of you serious collectors I am sure you own the polish cloth that will take these right off and make it look as new. I don't know what else I can say about this gem...she is just gorgeous!! This is one you should not miss out on if you are collecting...blue examples are must more plentiful than the high polished stainless. Comes with the blue inner box...no outer cardboard or paperwork, Pa residents to pay sales tax."

Oh boy who's looking for a beauty to add to their collection?? This is a very nice example of the high polish stainless PYTHON that Colt offer in the late 80's and 90's. I believe this sweetheart to be manufactured around 1992. She has seen few rounds...there is barely a cylinder rotation mark to be seen, the bore is perfect as is the cylinder and the timing. Rear sight is fully adjustable, vented rib and full underlug. Grips are original neoprene with the Colt emblem intact on both sides. A few faint marks in the finish only because it will scratch easily since it is high polished...some probably came that way from the factory...believe me when I say they are faint. To all of you serious collectors I am sure you own the polish cloth that will take these right off and make it look as new. I don't know what else I can say about this gem...she is just gorgeous!! This is one you should not miss out on if you are collecting...blue examples are must more plentiful than the high polished stainless. Comes with the blue inner box...no outer cardboard or paperwork, Pa residents to pay sales tax."

The military's need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG 6x48. Powered by Trijicon's patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the TA648RMR ACOG reticle features a red chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 5.56mm M855 out to 800 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the ACOG 6x48 incorporates Trijicon's Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG line, the ACOG 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 500 feet. This model of the 6x48 ACOG features an 8.0 MOA RMR. The TA648RMR also includes: - 1 8.0 MOA RMR Sight (RM02) - 1 Picatinny Rail Adapter (TA75) - 1 LENSPEN (LENSPEN) - 1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15) - 1 Manual - 1 Warranty Card Specifications: - Magnification: 6.0 - Objective Size: 48.0 - Bullet Drop Compensator: Yes - Length (in): 9.00 - Weight (oz): 39.3 w/out RMR - Illumination source: Fiber Optics & Tritium - Reticle Pattern: Chevron - Day Reticle Color: Red - Night Reticle Color: Red - Calibration: 0.223 - Bindon Aiming Concept: Y - Eye Relief (in): 2.70 - Exit Pupil (mm): 8.00 - Field of View (°): 3.30 - Field of View @ 100yrds (ft): 17.00 - Adjustment @ 100 yds (clicks/in): 4.0 - Mount: TA75 - Mount On/Comes With: TA75 - Housing Material: Forged Aluminum

Due to some new nerve damage in my hand I've had to move to 9mm so I'm getting rid of my big caliber stuff.  Everything functions perfectly.

First is my Springfield XD-45.  It comes with all the usual XD stuff (hard case, lock, holster, dual mag pouch, speed loader, paperwork, etc) as well as three 10-round magazines (it came with two originally).  It's seen two boxes of ammo at the range (100 rounds total).  I'm packing all three magazines (30 rounds - not pictured) full of Federal Premium® Personal Defense® HST Handgun Ammunition (jacketed hollowpoint) ammo.
$599.99 for the gun, $36.99 for the extra magazine, $43.50 for ammo at Cabela's, all before taxes, fees, paperwork, etc.  
Yours for $530.
I can include a brand new Sig Sauer rail-mounted compact pistol laser for an extra $75 ($149 MSRP, and I'm asking even less than Amazon before shipping!), or I'll sell this separately if you're interested in just the laser.

Second is a Shooters Arms Manufacturing (SAM) M1911 Military.  Full size 1911 with one 8-round magazine, one 7-round Colt factory magazine (not pictured), WRB XMH holster with thumb break and magazine pouch (not pictured), zippered locking soft case, rubber Hogue grips with finger grooves, wood Hogue Sig Sauer grips, 8 brand new 16 lb recoil springs, a .45 caliber cleaning kit, 20 rounds of Federal Premium low recoil Hydra Shok ammo, and an antique leather shoulder holster with built-in spring retention.  
I've put exactly 132 rounds through the pistol.  There's a little surface rust in the grip screw head slots from swapping grips. and the gun was dropped so there's a ding on the front left side of the slide, and the left corner of the hammer and safety (doesn't affect function).  The guy I bought the leather shoulder holster from told me it's from WWII, but there's no markings.  It's in pretty rough shape.  The holster needs some stitching and the shoulder strap is cracking or split in several places, but it holds the gun securely.
Gun with magazine was $550 at Gander Mountain, Colt magazine $35, holster $30, zippered pistol rug $19, both sets of Hogue grips $70, recoil springs $75, cleaning kit $12, ammo $28, shoulder holster $? before taxes, shipping, background fees, etc.
Yours for $550.

Buy both for $1025 ($1100 with laser) to save even more money, or make a profit reselling, or whatever.  I do have a few extra boxes of .45 ammo left if you want to buy some around market value, but will only sell them with one or both of these pistols for sale.

DO NOT ask if these are still available, or what my bottom price is - I won't respond.  Otherwise, feel free to e-mail with any legitimate questions.  You must be over 21 and legally able to own firearms (having a CCW is a bonus, but not required).  I'm in Brookfield and if you're local I expect you to come to me.  If you're from up north I'm willing to meet up at Cabela's.  If you're from the west, I'll drive out to Johnson Creek.  Otherwise expect to pay for my gas and time, or have a much higher trade value if you want me to travel further."
