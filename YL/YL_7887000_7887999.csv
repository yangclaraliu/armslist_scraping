However reproduction ones are available online for $10.Metal is rough and the barrel has seen better days but it will fire. A complete matching example of this carbine can set you back over $2000.

650,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7887650,For Sale:  US Palm AK-47 30 Rd. 7.62x39 Magazines,"Phx., Phoenix, Arizona",$ 20,"Listed On: Saturday, January 27, 2018",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a few US Palm AK-47 magazines for sale. The mags are lightly used, with some very minor cosmetic blemishes. These mags have steel-reinforced locking lugs and are impervious to the sort of wear you see on regular polymer magazine locking lugs. I have used these in various AKs, and they lock up like they are welded into the rifle. The mags are $20 each. Here's a little info on these mags:The US PALM AK30 Polymer Magazine fits all AK-47 rifles that use detachable double-stack magazines. The AK30 is constructed of proprietary aerospace polymers developed by TangoDown. The US PALM AK30 is a cut above other AK-47 magazines with its purpose-built design and multiple unique features. The AK30's unique design began by eliminating the removable floor plate, creating a stronger design. This revolutionary design, paired with advanced polymers gives the AK30 the strength it needs to survive impacts that would destroy other magazines. After the magazine is molded, the body and end-cap are bonded together at the molecular level, so no disassembly is possible or required. The AK30 has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy magazine cleaning and hassle-free maintenance. Just dunk the magazine in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. Dry contamination easily flows free through the vented follower design. The AK30 also features a chromium-silicon spring that is heat treated, stress relieved and US Mil Spec corrosion resistant coated. Life expectancy for this spring is 100,000+ cycles. The US PALM AK30 magazine represents a leap forward in AK-47 magazine technology: advanced polymer construction eliminates the need for metal feeds lips. <b>The locking surfaces are reinforced by a stainless steel cage that has been molded into the entire top of the magazine to further ensure reliability for years of trouble free service.</b> See link below for a review on these mags.<a href=""http://www.recoilweb.com/oped-magpul-ak-moe-pmag-vs-us-palm-ak30-mag-52881.html"">http://www.recoilweb.com/oped-magpul-ak-moe-pmag-vs-us-palm-ak30-mag-52881.html</a>"

Finished in a proprietary Legion gray coating and featuring custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the P220 Legion is improved in nearly every way. The stainless-steel slide sports SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights as well as front cocking serrations that provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm or conducting press checks. The P220 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip and a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. The P220 Legion also features low-profile decocking and slide-catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P220 Legion ships with three 8-round magazines. Challenge Coin and Legion Case Included. This gun has been to the range exactly one time and has had less than 100 rounds put through it (Sig 10mm Ammo). Also has the Exeter, NH mark on the frame (as opposed to the Newington mark found on later guns). Incredibly smooth trigger and powerful, yet manageable (for most) pistol. After 4 surgeries to my right hand, it simply got to be too much too quickly (but it was FUN). I didn't even finish off the ammo I took to the range."

The VZ-2008 is built from original Czech military Vz.58 parts, on a new US milled receiver. It features both a bayonet lug and removable muzzle brake. This one is  in excellent condition. It comes with original bakelite furniture, steel side folding stock,  Also included is 3 original 30 rd magazine and Drago range bag.In 1958 after years of development, the prototype SA.58 was put through extensive testing. It had a milled receiver, with many lightening cuts and streamlined for mass production. It fired using a striker system, which allowed it to be more compact and reliable. Its bolt locked into the receiver using a falling wedge or block, not unlike that used in the German P.38 pistol. It operated with a short-stroke gas piston, which was very similar to the one used in the FN FAL. It fed from curved magazines made of a lightweight but durable aluminium alloy, which held 30 rounds. Eventually after a few more small tweeks and changes, it was adopted as the Samopal Vzor 58. This made Czechoslovakia the only Warsaw Pact nation not to adopt some variation of the AK47 or AKM.  $750.00 or best offer."
