The Sa vz. 61 was designed for reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The Sa vz. 61 was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire. The design of the Sa vz. 61 was unique in its time. It uses the following common operational features found on a submachine gun: an unlocked bolt, magazine inserted into the bottom of the receiver (outside of the pistol grip) and a folding stock. These common features are combined with the following characteristics not usually found in submachine guns: extraordinary small size, fires from a closed bolt, and uses a rate reducer to slow full automatic fire. The Sa vz. 61 offered by CzechPoint is the semi-automatic version of the original military issued firearm - it is as close as one can get to owning the legendary vz. 61 submachine gun. Except for removal of the full-auto parts and rate reducer, and three modified parts with new safety, this firearm is like those used by Military and Paramilitary units in nearly 20 countries around the world.  As shown in the photo, the Sa vz. 61 finish is comprised of a blued lower receiver with a black paint upper receiver (paint cured at 300 degrees fahrenheit)."

Has run flawlessly so far but I don't shoot it enough to justify keeping around so I'm letting it go. I swapped out the original Magpul CTR stock for a gen 1 Magpul UBR. It's much sturdier and balances the gun better.The muzzle device was also upgraded from an A2 birdcage to a Silencerco ASR brake.I will include the picatinny rail sections and extra rail covers that came with the rifle.Pictured as is this rifle and upgrades cost over $2750 retail before FFL fees.

There was a limited run of the Marlin 39Ds from 71 to 73 only, and in 1972 they had a grip cap and butt pad with a white spacer. Under 16,000 like this one were made. It's just like the 39A but with a pistol grip stock.  I wish I could say this one is in great shape but it isn't. Mechanically it's solid as a rock and functions flawlessly but the blueing has suffered from improper storage over the years. The stock looks like there's some beautiful wood hiding under some aged finishing that would be best removed and redone.  Being a limited model/configuration of the well love 39 family I think this would make an awesome restoration project, but I don't have a need for any more projects!
