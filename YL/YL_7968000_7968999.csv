Really each is missing an internal part or two but otherwise is unbroken and functioning. Great for a beginning gunsmith, a late winter project, or a cheap way to get two guns that can be with a lot more with a little investment. First is a Bernardelli Baby 25acp (6.35mm) semi automatic pistol. It’s in good shape and the slide operates smoothly. Includes the original magazine and grips which are clean and free of cracks.I believe all it is missing is a firing pin and disconnector. Complete they sell for $200-$275 in this condition. $75 would own this gun.Second is a Hopkins and Allen shotgun.It has an interesting take down mechanism built into the side of the receiver. It is in good shape with original stocks and original buttplate still present (these are usually gone).I believe all this one is missing is the firing pin. The trigger and firing pin were taken out for “safe” storage many years ago by an overly conscientious gun owner. The firing pin has since been lost. $50 would own this gun."

Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more. Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly."

The reason for this special magazine is the .44 Magnum's rimmed case.The basic specifications of the Ruger Deerfield carbine, taken from the 2006 Strum, Ruger catalog, read as follows: Caliber: .44 Remington Magnum; Finish: Blued; Stock: hardwood; Sight: gold bead front, adjustable aperture rear; Barrel length: 18.5""; Overall length: 37""; Weight: 6.25 lbs.; There is a little scope protector cover provided with the rifle. It is leather and fits around the scope at the position of the turrets. It is intended to protect the scope from ejecting brass. Shooting the firearm at the range for the first time I discovered two things. One, this rifle had a surprisingly decent trigger for a semi-auto hunting rifle. Two, it was a surprisingly accurate .44 magnum rifle at 100 yards. In the field, the rifle carries and handles very well. It shoulders quickly and points true for offhand shooting."

As far as revolvers go I don't think I'll ever have enough though I probably have to many already. Excellent to like new condition only and preferably stock. A current production USPc 45 and S&W PC snubbies are my first picks but I'm open to others. Let me know what model you have in including the variant for HKs and the sub model for the revolver like finish or length etc, the condition (again only looking for exc. to LN) and all that comes with it (specifically). Replies that say ""Got a USP"" and nothing else for example will be ignored. Now for the trade I have a SIG P225A1 (9mm, all black one with SIGLITE sites and G10 grips) that's basically still new in the original case with the manual, warranty card, sticker, lock, shipping/storage plastic and two eight round mags. Love SIGs and have more than enough of them too but I haven't touched this one yet. I would trade it for either a HK or revolver in a even trade or with cash and or/extras depending on what you have. Mine will be on EFA10 since its not approved but you can use a FFL if you need to and can for yours. If your local I can free myself up anytime most days since I work from home but if not we can figure something else out. All laws will be followed. Thanks."

506,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7968506,For Sale:  Conceal Carry/ Defensive/Tactical Pistol Instruction,"S/W Suburbs, Chicago, Illinois",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, April 16, 2018",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"TriggerFarm® Firearms Training and Range provides Top Notch Firearms Instruction for the IL Concealed Carry and Defensive Pistol/Tactical instruction to further your Handgun Skills. Our instructors are Top Notch, they all come from Police/Law Enforcement/Military backgrounds, they have real world experience and a Professional Demenor for instruction. They do not portray the Drill Instructor Attitude. We pride ourselves in training beginners and shooters with limited experience drawing from a holster and shooting and or shooting while moving or from cover and concealment. More than likely a sense of humor will entail the seriousness of combat shooting, we know its a serious matter and we know how to push you to your limits of shooting under stress all in a very safe and enjoyable manner. We offer one Concealed Carry Class each Month, next one is May 5th and 6th 2018. The cost is $200.00 no hidden fees and no extra charge to use the Range cause we own and operate it. Check out our Website for additonal Dates for the Concealed Carry Classes and for updates on the renewal process staring this Fall.  Google TriggerFarm Firearms and it should appear. We also offer two Defensive Pistol Classes. A Basic and an Advanced.  In order to take the Advanced Class you must attend two of the Basic classes first, trust me you won't mind,  it will be fun and informative. Our classes mirror the standards set by Police and Military Professionals.  The cost for the Basic Defensive Pistol is only $50.00. For the Basic Class May 26th 2018 you will need to bring the following,  around 300 rounds of ammo, yes we actually shoot during the class,  a good functioning outside the waistband strong side holster, something that has decent retention and allows for a smooth draw and reholster. A reputable handgun that functions, this always gets a little tricky, it doesn't necessarly have to be the concealed carry pistol you tote around. The basic muscle memory and steps of drawing from a holster can be incorporated into different types of firearm and holster postions. Lets face it most of us change up holster positions and firearms at some point maybe depending on weather or types of clothes being wore, but the draw sequence and proceedure should be the same. For the purposes of the class Mid to Full size firearms work better, they hold more rounds therefore your not constantly reloading magazines but you decide what you wanna use if its something smaller, lower capacity just bring more magazines I would suggest 5 minimal for those firearms holding 10 or less and 3 for those that hold 10 or more. Magazine pouches are nice and allow for quick access and proper alingment for quick reloads, but they are not neccessary, pockets will work.  The class framework is as follows, Start out with a safety brief and review of the shooting fundementals. Introduction of the proper drawing technique, introduction to shooting and moving, shooting from cover and concealment and finishing up with shooting the challenge course that imcorporates all the skills of the class. The classes are held one Saturday a month they are for 3 hours, we usually run two sessions 9am to noon and 1pm to 4pm. Each session is slotted for only 10 students. I usually book the morning first then start the afternoon. If you have a large group and want to book a entire session please call, it might be possible to arrange for seperate day or time.  815-955-6094 or email Triggerfarm@gmail.comFor the Advanced Class: May 29th, 2018  The cost is $100.00 This class is 4 hours and starts at Noon on Sundays, (This class is limited to 6 stundents per session) Prerequisites for the class is two prior Basic Defensive Pistol classes from TriggerFarm. For this class you will shoot 300 rounds, the same holster and magazine requirements as the Basic Classs. Topics of instruction will include the basic shooting fundamentals with added malfunction drills. Close quarter shooting (push off drills) shooting from a seated position, Shooting and reloading with weak side hand, drawing , shooting from a vehicle, simulated road rage and car jacking senariors. Shooting the challenge course."

Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be.
The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.
The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm or 8+1 rounds of .40 SW, the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever.
If you’re looking for a 1911 to carry with you every day, look no further than the Springfield Armory® EMP®."

Mag.). From Savage: ""The Savage Model 116 FHSAK is a bolt-action rifle chambered in .30-06 Springfield, .270 Win., .300 Win. Mag., 7mm Rem. Mag., and .338 Win. Mag. The Model 116 FHSAK is one of nine rifles in Savage’s Weather Warrior Series. The FHSAK features include a hinged floorplate magazine, muzzle brake, swivel studs, and Savage’s AccuTrigger system. The AccuTrigger system features a dual-stage trigger design in which the first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism. Once this occurs, the second trigger can be depressed in order to activate the firing pin. The trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The FHSAK also features Savage’s patented AccuStock system. The AccuStock includes an integral (internal) aluminum spine that runs the length of the forearm, resulting in a more rigid stock that allows the barrel to float freely. In addition, the AccuStock is bedded so as to apply both horizontal and vertical (3-dimensional) pressure to the action. This achieves in a tighter fit between stock and action, resulting in increased overall gun accuracy. The Model 116 FHSAK is drilled and tapped for scope mounts. ""This rifle is in excellent condition. It was bought in the late 1990's for a Caribou hunting trip. It was bore sighted and shot 10 rounds. The owner took 2 Caribou with 1 round each. So it was fired exactly 12 times. Not cleaned and put away until now. I cleaned the barrel up a little. The scope is a Pentax LightSeeker 3-9x40. Its a very nice clear scope that actually does gather light very nicely. The scope retails for $439.00 alone. The mounts are by Burris and are very good quality also. The sling is a non-slip type and very comfortable. This whole package would retail around $1,200.00 today. $650.00 plus ACTUAL shipping or Sales tax 6% if sold in VT.
