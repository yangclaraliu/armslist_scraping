So I need to sell it so I can get a Glock 43PX4 Storm Double/Single-Action SemiautoThe NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement.PX-Storm-Full-introAbsolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Ultra-SafeUltra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesLoaded-with-FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Easy-to-Maintain Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down. It is also available in stainless steel, compact and sub-compact versions--making this line even more versatile for a variety of uses.Specification and Features: .40 S&W 4"" barrel length 14 rounds 3 Dot Fixed sights Polymer frame Polymer grip 7.59"" overall length 5.51"" tall 1.42"" wide 1.18"" grip width 5.75"" sight radius Matte black 27.3 ozContact: Kaleb (417) 300- seven 3 zero 6"

Per Sig websight this is the Flagship of the 320 x series. I was interested when I heard about this new model and bought it new beginning of December (17). It is in perfect condition. no scratches, marks or anything out of the ordinary. All original with no modifications. Everything that came with the gun is in the box (papers, sample oil four (4) 21 round magazines, grip weight,magwell, matched black barrel, Dawson adj backsight, fiberoptic front). The back sight is removable and gun already predrilled by Sig to accept a Romeo reflex. (other reflex sights require an aditional mounting plate)The gun is fine but I'm more comfortable with my current competition gun. It will just sit in the safe.Gun has 2 range sessions that were 150 rnds each. and one other (100rnds )..cleaned after every round. There is nothing wrong with it. It functions flawlessly. I bought it for 849.99 plus tax. I'm asking 800.00. Face to face only. Text or call anytime three 3 zero. five five 9 7 4 zero zero. As always all laws apply. Before anyone has to ask YES the p320 X5 is drop safe and does not require the Sig voluntary upgrade. I listed possible trade as an option but really prefer to sell.

I've owned, carried (every day), and shot many of these pistols and I've loved every one. This pistol inparticular has never been shot a single time. I repeat I have NEVER shot a single round through this gun. Now, you may be wondering why this pistol has been kept up and away in a gun safe and now I'm selling it. To be honest and short with you, I own like 15 pistols, and never have time to shoot any more so I'm cleaning house and I thought this would be a good pistol to sell first seeing as how it's in perfect, factory condition and has never been shot. If you're not aware the Springfield Essentials Package comes with the gun itself, a black hard lockable Springfield case with foam, a gun lock, the manual, 2 magazines (a 7 round and an extended 8 round), a bore brush, and 2 interchangeable backstraps for the grip. Just to make it known this is the GRAY FRAMED PISTOL with the black melonite slide. As a special holiday offer I also received a deal in which I got 4 extra magazines (two 7 round and two 8 round), an OWB right handed Springfield holster, and a Springfield magazine holder that attaches to your belt. All together this is like a $650 deal so the price I have set is a STEAL. I know this gun won't be around long so it'd make a GREAT Christmas gift for someone or a great gun for yourself.

Built on a Mauser action(some say the best in the world), this gun fires 8mm Mauser ammo that could take out a deer, or moose(and squirrel), or even a dragon!(Dragon hunting not tested, results may vary). The rifle is so big you can make a mossin jealous. And comes with a bayonet you can wear on your belt! (May even win “that’s not a knife” competitions in some areas outside Texas) Accuracy is amazing. Place rifle on fence or bench, and the end of the rifle should just about reach out and touch your target, making you an amazing shot! And the shock wave of your 8mm round howling down range will bowl over all the other targets on its way towards total destruction!(ammo included with purchase/trade) She isn’t beautiful. But she is well oiled, the rifling is amazing and she’s looking for a new home. ($255 re-homing fee)."

So I need to sell it so I can get a Glock 43PX4 Storm Double/Single-Action SemiautoThe NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement.PX-Storm-Full-introAbsolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Ultra-Safe Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextrous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with Features Loaded-with-FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Easy-to-Maintain Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down. It is also available in stainless steel, compact and sub-compact versions--making this line even more versatile for a variety of uses.Specification and Features: .40 S&W 4"" barrel length 14 rounds 3 Dot Fixed sights Polymer frame Polymer grip 7.59"" overall length 5.51"" tall 1.42"" wide 1.18"" grip width 5.75"" sight radius Matte black 27.3 ozContact: Kaleb (417) 300- seven 3 zero 6"

I can usually ride this bike for 2 weeks without filling it up. Insurance is also cheap!It has 5,xxx miles and counting as I'm still riding it weekly as this bike is to fun to just let it sit, it also has CLEAN title.It has been Fully inspected by my mechanic and has had a recent oil change that's good until 7,000 miles.Tags are good until May 2018.Has light scratches on both sides but has never been dropped. The bike also releases a smell of burning rubber for a few seconds when you turn it on but it's perfectly normal. It's a common thing on the 2013 ideal but it goes away the more you ride it. I researched and checked with the dealership mechanic and my mechanic. So you have nothing to worry about I'm just sharing this so you won't freak out about it.I’m also the second owner. The original owner didn’t drive it much but did manage to cause the scratches on the sides in his garage. Bike is perfect.Fully stock."

It is a Sig Sauer P229 Equinox .40 S&W. She is in absolute excellent condition with a very low round count. It comes in its original hardcase with everything that was with it the day it was bought new. It has a set of night sights on it but they are starting to dim down a little. They aren’t the brightest but they still glow and get the job done. It has a $300 set of Crimson Trace Laser Grips that are absolutely sweet. The laser will reach completely across my very large bean field to a tree line and lights up on the trees. I was honestly shocked to see how strong it was. It original came with 2 mags but there has been 3 extra mags purchased so a total of 5 mags. 4 12 round mags and 1 10 round mag. I also have 500-1000 rounds of untouched factory new Federal 135 grain Jacketed Hollow Points I can throw in depending on the trade/cash offer. I would like to add that I DO NOT have the original grips for the gun. The best way to reach me is by text at REDACTED. My trade interest are fairly open as long as it is firearm related. Have any questions or would like to see any pictures or would like to make an offer just shoot me a text. Thanks.
