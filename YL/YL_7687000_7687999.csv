This custom trigger job will result in a noticeably smoother, lighter and shorter trigger pull. The biggest advantages are there will be virtually zero over-travel and very short reset, so you can double tap like no other.I will be replacing one custom part and polishing the internals. Everything else will be stock so safety and reliability will not be compromised at all.This is a custom job specific to your particular glock so it may or may not fire if you change slides or other parts. If you want it to be more flexible, I can do that but it will result in slightly longer over-travel.Turn around time is 3 days but I try to aim for 2 days. Keep in mind this takes me a few hours to complete.Text me if you’re interested. I can show you an example. REDACTED Thanks!"

I HAVE TONS!!! ARMSLIST WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO UPLOAD MORE THAN THREEI ACCEPT PAYMENT VIA USPS MONEY ORDER, CASH (IF FACE TO FACE), AND VENMO!Have for sale a pretty rare rifle. This is an ORIGINAL Mosin sniper rifle. Serial numbers on barrel shank, buttplate, bolt, and magazine plate match (the magazine plate was restamped to match). Technically this is not a PE sniper, it is a Top Mount (versus the later side mount) PEM sniper. What makes this even more rare, is that not only is it ""CП"" marked indicating it was in fact built to be a sniping rifle, but it is double-dated AND ""MO"" marked. Very, Very, uncommon. Bore is very good with strong lands and grooves. The bolt was polished at some point. The trigger on this is damn near what you'd expect on a modern-day AR15 or Remington 700. It is VERY crisp and has almost no slack, which is what is typical of original Russian 91/30 snipers. Also, it has the correct higher front sight post (versus the shorter one found on basic issue infantry rifles. The shorter sights which were also typically set to the left, were used to compensate for the fact that standard issue rifles were sighted in with the bayonet fixed. Snipers were not put throught this process because they didnt need it, due to their inherent accuracy). I will also include a Cold-War Era set of whitewash goggles (basically sunglasses for snipers, helped them see in the snow), and leather lens caps."

This particular pistol comes with 2 steel mags,wood grips, factory plastic grips, cleaning tools, factory CZ snap caps, luminescent night sights which this model has removable sights for easy replacement (not fixed sights like surplus models), factory target and paperwork along with a CZ hard case. It is chambered in Browning 9mm which is .380 acp. Has amidextrious safety so it's good for left handed shooters! Double single action, blowback action with fixed barrel for great accuracy and reliability. These are similar in style to the PPK but much better. A great upgrade over the previous model 82. Glossy blued finish with nice wood grips, no wear, appears unfired. This is an easy shooting, easy to conceal, all steel pistol with double stack mags. The collector or person looking for a nice conceal carry or home defense weapon would greatly appreciate this beauty, pics don't do it justice.

FOURTEEN mags! NEARLY NEW!!!Faced with a mortgage and some convicting discussions with pastors and family, I'm giving up the things I love for the people I love. And hot dang, I love the folks at Honor Defense and their fabulous pistols.The Honor Guard is best thought of as a ""personal size"" pistol. Unlike most single-stack nines, it is full-featured and extremely shootable, ready to go the distance with you. Unlike most duty guns that pass as carry pieces, you'll actually enjoy slipping it inside the waistband. It doesn't do anything perfectly, but this is a rare bird that does just about everything well.The Longslide is my favorite setup. The beefy full length slide soaks up recoil better than many full-size nines, making it an ideal traning gun for young folks with small hands and gun-shy family members. The short slide stows like a shield without hard edges and shoots like a more ergonomic Walther PPS.The grip texture is hands-down the best I've ever felt, both very aggressive and comfortably even. The trigger is ideal for a defensive gun. The safety is easy to disengage and actually blocks the sear instead of the trigger, imagine that. The removable fire control unit makes detail cleaning laughably easy.The gun and I have treated each other very well. All components are in excellent, gift-worthy condition, including the four seven-round and ten eight-round magazines.I hate to sell this gun, but I love my family more. I'd be delighted if I can add value to your life in the process.$20 FFL TRANSFER REQIRED: This is non-negotiable. I'd like to meet at Arnzen Arms of Eden Prairie, a well-lit store full of delightful, outgoing, heavily-armed professionals. And a dog!

These cartridges can then be loaded into the gun, or into the provided speed loader, and then into the gun from the speed loader. I found it tedious to have to reload these every single time after emptying the gun, so I purchaced eight more speed loaders, and cartridges for each. The cost of all this was well over $300.00 when new. I did have to make repairs to some of the internals due to cheap production methods, howerver, the gun is in good working order, and my repairs are supirior to the original parts. One is visible in the picture with the cylinder open. The original cylinder stop was made of a soft plastic and was worn out very quickly. The one I made is stainless steel, and will last as long as the gun does. The other repair was made to the double action trigger sear. The original was made of a very soft metal, and became gouged. I resurfaced this with stainless, and stoned it. Like I said better than the original.Only respond if you are interested."

I will throw in 200 rounds for free!This is a bullpup rifle meaning the chamber and magazine are rear of the trigger assembly allowing you to have a very short rifle with a long barrel on it (say the length of a short barrel submachine gun) but you can still hit targets at 200 yards because of the barrel and 5.56 round. Amazing weapon great for both indoor close combat and long range. Jack of all trades type weapon. Does NOT include sight.
The Steyr AUG was first designed in the 1960s as a bullpup assault rifle for the Austrian military. Since then, it has served as the main combat rifle for Austria, Australia, New Zealand, and more, as well as serving in elite military and police units in dozens of countries. Iconic and unique, it has been featured in dozens if not hundreds of films, television shows, and video games, perhaps most famously Die Hard starring Bruce Willis.This example features the desirable and hard-to-find long/low 10 inch military rail, as well as a short forward side rail mounted on the right side.
Includes two 30 round magazines, one 42 round magazine, (only 2 magazines are shown but i have 3), ANY AR-15 magazine will fit as well! That is the difference between this newer AUG a3 and the older non a3 models. and the original box.

      6-shot single action revolver in .22 LR   7.5-inch barrel.   Has the original serial number matching box.  The box is a bit dog-eared, and worn,  some of the seams are split,  and it was taped up sometime in the past.   The guy I got this gun from said it was his dad’s from the 1950s. 
   The gun is blued with plastic faux stag grips.  The blue is about 96-98% perfect.  No scratches, abrasions or dings.  There are some holster type thinning in the bluing at the front barrel edges and other high spots.  There is a slight cylinder ring.  I do not thing the gun has been fired a lot.    The grips are 100%.
 The bore is very good and bright, lines and groves are great. The barrel cylinder gap is tight. Cylinder locks up tight on all 6 chambers.
    I rate the condition at a minimum of 95+%  I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $450.00.   I think this is a good price for this gun, and I am pretty firm on the price.  So please no low-balls. 
I really want to sell this gun I am open to trades, and I am interested in Webley revolvers, only unmodified or not shaved for the .45APC rounds.  Or Martini henry rifles, in functioning condition and fireable.  Not really interested in too many other guns for trade.  If you want to trade it will be slightly to my benefit. 
 
Cash only and a FTF meeting only.
 
Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS).  In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.  Please feel free to ask questions and I can supply more pictures if needed. 
 
I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my ARMSLIST encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.
 E-mail preferred, or text at 21-6-403-2-164.
Thanks for looking!"

      6-shot single action revolver in .22 LR   5.5-inch barrel.   Has the original serial number matching box and box sleeve.  The box is a bit worn, and was taped up sometime in the past.   The guy I got this gun from said it was his dad’s from the 1950s. 
 The box contains the original bill of sale from 1955.  Test firing target.  Reg card, and parts list/diagram. 
   The gun is cyanide case colored, with black and white plastic faux stag grips.  The finish is about 98-99%.   No scratches, abrasions or dings.  There are some very slight spots of frosting on the gun.  There is NO cylinder ring.  I do not thing the gun has been fired a lot.    The grips are 100%.
 The bore is very good and bright, lines and groves are great. The barrel cylinder gap is tight. Cylinder locks up tight on all 6 chambers.
    I rate the condition of this 62 year old gun at a minimum of 96+%  I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $495.00.   I think this is a good price for this gun, and I am pretty firm on the price.  So please no low-balls. 
I really want to sell this gun I am open to trades, and I am interested in Webley revolvers, only unmodified or not shaved for the .45APC rounds.  Or Martini henry rifles, in functioning condition and fireable.  Not really interested in too many other guns for trade.  If you want to trade it will be slightly to my benefit. 
 Cash only and a FTF meeting only.
 Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS).  In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.  Please feel free to ask questions and I can supply more pictures if needed. 
 I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my ARMSLIST encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.
 E-mail preferred, or text at 21-6-403-2-164.
