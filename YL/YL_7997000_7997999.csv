Many more pictures available if interested. Incredible condition! I believe this gun is UNFIRED!!! I've owned guns for over 55 years and this Luger does not look to me as if it has ever been fired! I am NOT a Luger expert, but this one is exceptional. Look at the pictures closely for signs of wear! I'm not talking about just the blue, look at the parts too! I just don't see any physical wear! All the numbers that I can find are a match! They do not appear to me to be ""forced"" or redone. The serial number ends with an A.  I bought this Luger in 1994. At the time I vaguely recall the seller saying that the Luger had come from Russia. The collapse of the Soviet Union was in 1991. I believe he told me that the gun had been imported into the USA after that event. I've had questions regarding the grips, the marking on the underside of the barrel. I've also had questions about the number 26 on the left side of the gun which looks etched possibly done with an electric pencil (see picture #2). During a Google search I found a picture of grips identical to the grips on the gun. That picture indicated that they were VOPO Luger grips. I have done additional searches which have led me to believe that the gun is an East German VoPo (Volkspolizei = Peoples Police) Luger. I have taken many different pictures. Some have been cropped to show as much detail as possible. Some of the pictures have had the contrast and or the light adjusted to show more detail. If they shade of blue looks inconsistent in different pictures that would be why. The gun is a very even shade of blue! If there are additional areas you would like to see then please let me know. I will do my best to provide them for you. If you do message me, please include at least your first name and your state. I have set a reasonable reserve just a bit below the Buy It Now I will ship as soon as possible after payment has been received. I will ship through my FFL. Regarding C&R FFL's; it depends on the state and my FFL. If you are a C&R FFL and I can not for some reason ship to you due to your state laws we will work something out. Message me with your name and state. The bottom line with C&R FFL's is that I do not wish to break the law! I will not ship to California, Alaska, or Hawaii You will pay the shipping. If you have questions please ask. One last thing, I am new to Gun Broker and only have 1 feedback. I have however been on Ebay since November of 1998 and currently have 796 positive feedbacks. You can check me out on Ebay under the name Knights42. In some cases I might take PayPal, but we should correspond about that prior to your bidding. Let me close by saying that this is an exceptional Luger and I believe you will be very happy if you are the next owner!!! Thank you for looking."

It's a one of a kind upper that packs some serious punch in a small package and would be a great wat to finish off your AR-15 pistol project, which is what I had it made for originally. This sweet setup has a key mod pencil rail, is chambered in 300 Blackout, and an awesome Barnes Precision muzzle brake.compensator to keep recoil to a minimum. It also has a Faxon Firearms 1/8 twist chrome-lined 10.5"" barrel (13"" overal with the muzzle brake), and a custom-machined bolt carrier group with a removeable side-discharge handle for easy disassembly and cleaning. I seriously have less than 10 rounds through this thing because I never finished a pistol lower and didn't want to be caught with a 13"" barrel on a standard AR platform. So it's basically brand new and in flawless condition. This thing really is sweet to see in person, and with the side-charge handle, it's freaking badass. I won't even lie.I have over $900 into it, but I'm asking $650 or best offer. Either email me through here or you can text me at (704) seven zero nine-thirty-six eighty-one"

This was hand selected from the Civilian Markmanship Program in 2014. This rifle was never a drill rifle and I will provide the CMP certificate with the rifle. I have not shot it but I see no reason that it shouldn't be a very accurate rifle with the excellent barrrel it has. The muzzle measures less than 1 on its original 4 groove 2-43 barrel. The rifling is sharp and the bore is bright and clean. The headspace has been confirmed to be correct as well. There is no major damage to the stock but it does have a few dings or marks which you would expect from a 74 year old battle rifle. There are also FJA crossed cannon cartouches on the rifle which are excellent. I can provide more information or pictures on request but only for serious buyers. I am not interested in trades at the moment and please no scammers or stories of woe. If the ad is up it is still available.

Tungsten grey cerakote. Has a little knick on side that scrapped off some of the cerakote near the ejection port but I adjust price accordingly. Trijicon Adjustable LED RMR 6.0 moa. Shot only once with it. It works great and reduces recoil a lot but I just didn't really like shooting with the RMR. It looks really cool and shoots great if you take your time but I just like shooting with iron sights better since I'm faster and more accurate with it. I'm sure I just need more practice to get used to it but I don't have enough time to shoot anymore so I figured I would let somebody else enjoy the fun of shooting this setup. Don't have to do a background check or pay transfer fee because it's just the slide.

Rifle comes with 1 high-cap PMag and Magpul MBUS.It is mechanically sound, with all parts working as they should. Nothing appears broken, damaged, or missing. The bore is great; shiny and with sharp rifling. The internals are clean and show little to no real wear. The outside is nice, with no rust or pitting, and only a few light marks from storage, transport, and handling.This rifle has the Enhanced buttstock. It both folds to the side, and can be adjusted to 1 of 6 positions. Also it has a 2 position cheek riser for optics. On the otherhand, it has the factory standard handguard. This is of a Magpul design; simple and effective with a steel heatshield inside. I am assuming the original owner swapped this for the tri-rail unit as it is more comfortable and practical most of the time.
