I can sand it down and use rustoleum on it or you can buy as is. The rest of the safe is in good condition. 
$550.00 - I am selling my overflow safe, I no longer need it and am going to be moving in a few months – want to go ahead and sell it now rather than pay extra to have it moved.
It is a Cannon Safari 48 Gun Safe. 40” wide, 24” deep and 58.5” Tall. Weighs around 625-650 pounds. Cannon does not make the Safari Series any longer, the closest I have found is the Shield Series which does not have the accessories/pistol/rifle holder built into the door. The door has a place for pistols, a rifle, 2 accessories pockets and a pocket for paperwork. The shelves on the right side can be removed for more long rifle storage.
You will need to bring a truck/trailer, blankets, straps, appliance dolly and a few people to help you load the safe. I will get it to the front door of my downstairs apartment which is near Wethimer and Wilcrest (West Houston). There is about a 4” drop from my apartment to the front patio and about a 6” curb drop, other than that fairly easy to move.

The scope has fine illuminated crosshairs. The scope is 24x zoom, and it will come with a 5in Sunshade. The scope is fog-proof, water-proof, and shock-proof. The rifle is a tac driver! Extreamly accurate. It's a 300yrd plus rifle easily. I can't list everything, it's just too much. It has a 20in Wilson Combat Barrel, Anderson Manufacturing complete FDE Cerakoted Lower Receiver, 3.5lb CMG Match Grade Trigger with Anti-Walk Pins, Bravo Company AR10 Bolt Carrier Group, Troy 16in M-LOK Handguard, M4 Feed Ramps, Magpull Buttstock, Magpul M-LOK MVG MOE FDE Verticle Grip, Rock River Arms Flash Hider, Bravo Company Buffer Tube Kit, UTG Pro Heavy Duty Bi-Pod, and Vortex Precision Rifle Scope Rings. The rifle will come with two metal mags! It's cheap to shoot, it only costs $10 for 40 rounds. I'm only asking $1400 cash for the rifle. No trades please. I paid over $2300 for it, so I'm taking a big loss. Cash only, no trades please. Call or text me at: (937)-684-6068, thanks and have a great day!"

426,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7216426,For Sale/Trade:  Sig Sauer p229 E2 w/extras,"Northeast Rochester, Rochester, MN, Minnesota","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, October 15, 2017",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Very nice Sig p229 E2 with extras. 4 magazines, 2 holsters, threaded barreli have over $1100 into this rig so be kind with your low ball offers.....or better yet, do the research and see what these are actually selling for today.This has the 'factory' improved trigger, E2 grips, and night sights.......it is fun to shoot.This is an excellent review for this pistol so be sure to read it.SIG Sauer’s P229 E2 is a full-size duty handgun but can also be effectively carried concealed. The pistol is short-recoil operated and has a double action/single action (DA/SA) firing system. It carries a stainless steel slide on an alloy frame.The slide wears SIG’s Nitron black coating along with SIGLITE fixed night sights dovetailed into the slide, and these sights are part of the gun package, not optional at additional cost. You adjust the sights for elevation by drifting the sight out of its dovetail cut and then selecting one of four differing height sights available from SIG. Each sight choice will move point-of-impact approximately 1″ at 25 yards. To adjust for windage, drift the rear sight right or left as needed in its dovetail cut. (In my experience, I needed a SIG sight tool to move the very firmly installed sights.)Extraction has been improved with a large and sturdy external extractor positioned at the right rear of the ample ejection port. Forward of this port, the slide is stepped inward at mid-line. A passive firing pin safety is within the slide, and 10 diagonal rear-placed grasping grooves enable positive slide manipulation.The slide sits atop a machined, 7075-T6 aluminum frame which is black hard-coated over anodizing. A picatinny spec rail on the dust cover allows users to install lights and lasers. The frontstrap features fine horizontal grooving.SIG Sauer P229 E2 rear sight photoA SIGLITE (tritium) rear sight is dovetailed into the slide as well.To decock a raised hammer, shooters employ a decocking lever located on the frame’s left side, conveniently placed for activation by the shooting hand thumb. The decocking lever is at the top of the frame above the top forward corner of both the wraparound grip and the slide-catch lever pad.The latter, the slide-catch lever, has long been a point of contention for those who shoot with a high, thumbs-forward grip. Doing so often results in either thumb holding the lever up or down at the wrong time, allowing the slide to lock back or not lock back inappropriately. To cure or at least mitigate this “problem,” SIG offers an optional lever part (#34226289, MSRP: $19.90) that’s shortened from its rear, diagonally cut and lengthened forward. (I was cautioned this part can’t be retrofitted to other such models because it interferes with the existing decocking lever.) The P229 E2 lever was changed to allow using this part and to ease installing the new wraparound grip.By the way, the lever must always be used to lower a raised hammer because this action allows the hammer to drop into and be held by the hammer safety intercept notch. There are no external safeties.The magazine catch remains reversible and is placed at the left rear of the large trigger guard, with a finger hook on the lower portion of its front face, which is grooved for better purchase. The takedown lever is above the trigger guard.The GripThe “E2” portion of this pistol’s name stands “Enhanced Ergonomics,” and the new grip is dimensionally smaller than the two-panel grip of the P228. The circumferential measurements of the grip (supplied by SIG) are as follows:Beneath the trigger guard, .15″;midway down from the trigger guard to the bottom of the frame, .2″; andSIG P229 P228 comparison photoGrip comparison: The P229 E2 on the left, and the P228 on the right.at the base of the frame, .12″.Using a tape measure, my P228, measuring from beneath the trigger guard around the most inward portion of the back strap, is 5.5″. The P229 E2 measures 5.25″ (which happens to be the same as a Wilson Combat 1911 frame).The grip measurements do not tell the whole story, however. The nicely-textured grip is contoured, and this effect worked well for me, as I think it also decreases trigger reach.The grip’s base features a lanyard loop. The grip slips on from the rear and doesn’t use screws. Inside on either side of the grip is a raised ridge that bears against the vertical rear sides of the frame openings and holds the grip firmly.Grip screw holes remain in the frame, however, and I was able to attach either my P228 grip panels or a Crimson Trace laser grip without difficulty. The new grip, though, will not retrofit on existing frames of the same size because, as noted above, the decock lever has been altered, as has the mainspring and its housing (as can be seen in the accompanying photo). I’m not a SIG armorer, so I didn’t poke around any further.Discontinued? Not really.The SIG Sauer P229 E2 has been discontinued, but it’s not really gone. According to SIG VP Bud Fini, SIG simply eliminated the E2 designation because the company now includes the new grip on all P229 models.To remove the grip, SIG provides a grip removal tool. To use, insert it into the magazine well from below. After aligning the long crosspiece with the inside of the grip through the frame hole openings, gently turn the tool so the grip spreads apart equally. Then pull the grip off to the rear. The grip slips back on, but take care not to allow it to dislodge any springs. I’m told the tool will ship with every gun. If your gun doesn’t have one, call SIG or gamble you won’t break the grips while prying them apart.The TriggerAlthough SIG’s DA/SA trigger system has been retained, the SIG Sauer Short Trigger is present, too. The Short Trigger is created by thinning the trigger shaft from its front, which moves the trigger face rearward approximately .4″ compared to the standard trigger. In addition, the P229 E2 features the SRT or Short Reset Trigger, which, according to SIG, features a 60% shorter trigger reset distance (the distance the single-action trigger must be released until hammer and sear re-set).SIG Sauer P229 trigger comparisonThe trigger shaft of the P229 E2 (bottom) is visibly more narrow.SIG also says a different sear and safety lever is used here, as in all SIG Sauer Elite Series pistols. Translated, the trigger is closer to the rear in either double- or single-action mode and, when released to reset for another shot, the forward movement needed to re-engage the hammer and sear is roughly 60% less than that needed with the standard trigger system. The net result: Both a real and perceived shorter trigger pull.The MagazineAn increased-capacity, all-steel magazine feeds this pistol. It gains two rounds for a total of 15 in 9mm compared to the P228 and P229 at 13 rounds. The new magazine will not fit the other pistols because the P229 E2 magazine is thicker, as shown by the following measurements taken at the magazine catch opening and the top of the base pad: The P229 E2 measures .914″ and .974″, respectively, while the P228 magazine comes in at .907″ and .911″.Cartridge witness holes on the rear face are numbered 3–15. The polymer base plate, which also serves as a slight finger rest, is removable for cleaning. (Note: Existing 13-round magazines will fit and function in the P229 E2.)I am not shooting as much and it is just sitting in the safe.It is in like new condition, no scratches, dings, or blemishes.I am 2nd owner and original owner never used it much either......I would guess less than a 1000 rounds has been fired between the two of us.You must provide a current permit to purchase (PTP) or permit to carry (PTC) along with valid MN drivers license.

The XAR Invicta rifle is an evolutionary leap in rifle design. It has redefined the AR15 platform, and has been meticulously engineered and manufactured using the patent-pending XAR folding rifle technology. The 4-bolt lockup system, originally pioneered by F&D Defense in 2009, eliminates the constraints of a barrel nut, and has allowed F&D Defense to build a rifle that folds in half at the barrel. It can be folded for compact transport and storage, deployed quickly, and put to use with a consistent and reliable return to zero."

It is a double stacked 1911 with a concealable 4.25"" Commander length barrel. The pistol is in great condition, no scuffs or scratches on the slide nor the frame. Bought it a few months ago, and have put a couple hundred rounds through it since owning it. It shoots fantastic, never had a jam or misfire. I have my eye on something else I would prefer owning so I thought I'd try seeing if I can sell this and put it towards a new range toy, but I'm in absolutely no hurry to sell. Comes with two 13 round magazines, the original box and manuals that came from the Para factory and a few mags worth of range and some defense rounds mixed that I would no longer need. I'm asking for $600, I'm not really interested in trades. Only if seriously interested please call or text Raul at REDACTED Must be a legal AZ resident 21 years or older and able to legally possess a firearm and wiling to sign a bill of sale. Please have your valid state ID so I can at least somewhat verify you're eligible to purchase. Thank you."
