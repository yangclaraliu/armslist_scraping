A400 Xcel: the Fastest, Lowest-Recoil Clay Buster
The A400 Xcel is a 12-gauge competition shotgun that is faster-cycling, softer-shooting and better balanced than anything else on the market. Built on the revolutionary A400 action, it delivers follow-up shots 36% faster than any other brand, while its advanced recoil-reducing systems make it absolutely pleasant to shoot, even on demanding all-day competitions. Its sleek lines and superior ergonomics are designed with one goal in mind: letting the A400 naturally follow your eye to the target. This is why it has quickly become a favorite among serious competitive shooters the world over."

Here is the info from Remington's LE site:

The nation's leading defender. For a half century the Remington Model 870P has been the pump shotgun of choice for government agencies. With over 10 million produced to date, it remains the standard by which all pump actions are measured. Its dual, non-binding action bars deliver ultra-smooth, reliable cycling. The ultimate pump shotgun, the Model 870P stands the test of time, extreme conditions and duty.
•Non-binding twin action bars provide smoothest/surest pump operation
•Receiver milled from solid block of steel
•3"" chamber accepts all 2 ¾"" and 3"" 12-gauge shells
•Steel-lined/grooved fore-end for a stronger grip
•Breech block locks into barrel extension for strength and consistent head space
•Balanced sear and inertia firing pin prevents discharge unless action is closed and trigger is pulled
•Flexitab feeding system prevents a misfeed from jamming the shotgun
•Cross-bolt safety
•Sling swivel studs

For those of you that are not familiar, this is an extremely rare find, of one of the, if not the, best AK47 to be imported in the last 20 years. These are comparable to the Mitchell Arm's Yugo AK's from the early 90's. Those guns are now extremely collectible and much more valuable that this relative bargain that this gun is. 

These rifles were built out of de-milled machine guns. Century Arms International had found a cache of the guns and then sent them to Zastava to have them rebuild on semi-automatic receivers. These were a limited production run and made out of actual military rifles that had been sitting around for decades! Some of the parts show their age, such as the wood, due to being military storage for so long. The production has been ended for quite some time now and these are no longer available for sale. 

Even rarer is that this particular gun has a Serbian crest engraved into the buttstock. Only a small amount had received this very interesting additional. No one seems to know many many got it, but it seems to only have been a small amount, produced early on in the production run. These are considered more desirable to collectors.

This is a spare one that I had bought and it is still NEW in the box. I only took it out to take pictures. The gun is complete with accessories and has never been used. The gun is nice and straight and is one of the nicest I have seen. It was hand picked by me. I was planning on holding onto this one, but decided I have to slim my collection down. My loss is your gain! Do not miss your chance to own a piece of history!"

It is in excellent condition.  
I am new to USPSA shooting and I love the sight tracker barrel system. I used this gun in one local USPSA match. But then a master open class shooter let me fire his open gun....and long story short I am going with a different class of gun. That's due to my vision. 

I put just over 200 rounds through the gun, then sent to off to Tommy precision gun works for trigger and sight work. I have the trigger system tuned to break at a crisp 1 lb  07 ounce. I also had the sights fine tuned. All trigger components that were changed out were replaced with EGW parts. That was about $400.00 worth of tuning. 

The Apeiro uses the Schuemann ""Island"" barrel. This barrel has the front sight milled into the barrel. So as the slide recoils rear wards, the sight doesn't travel back with the slide since it's attached to the barrel. It's an AMAZING design. 

I am inlcuding a total of 5 magazines. 4 magazines have been tuned with the Grams follower and spring set, and have the Dawson base pads installed on them. For a total of over $520.00 for the magazines and their tuning. 

Please contact me with any questions.

Since it is in perfect condition and has already been broken in and has been well maintained I'm not knocking the price down on the gun - which still makes this an awesome deal when you consider you won't be paying taxes or shipping on anything. This is a buy it all or buy nothing deal, I'm not interested in selling the ammo separately. 

Mossberg 590A1 - 450$'s

The following changes have been made to it:

It has a magpul stock (I still have all of the spacers for adjusting LOP)
I added a +2 magazine extension (ordered from S&J hardware) - 100$'s

The shotgun is being sold along side of the following:

1 Plano all weather tactical case - 30$'s
50 rounds of - Winchester Super X - 10$'s
100 rounds of Winchester Super Target - 30$'s
200 rounds of SG1200 ammo - 80$'s (love this stuff!)
2 A-zoom Snapcaps - Free

Total - 700$'s

So, here is the low down on why you should buy this shotgun over any another pump. This shotgun has it all when it comes to home defense.

#1 - you cannot go shorter than 18"" on a shotgun without a tax stamp - most manufacturers go with 18.5 to play it safe
#2 - with the magazine extension I purchased you get the best capacity possible with the magazine being flush with the barrel
#3 - the 590A1 is durable and reliable as they come and it's already been broken in to boot.
#4 - if you're looking for a comparison for other pumps, check out this guy - I'm actually the author http://www.reddit.com/r/shotguns/wiki/faq

I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.

""The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.""

Selling like-new Baby Desert Eagle. I've fired less than 1,000 rounds through this very quality firearm and have loved my time with it. However, I'm interested in purchasing a new handgun that's quite lighter and more comfortable for concealed, continuous, all-day carry. That being said, this is a great firearm for the range and home defense, as well open carry if weight and grip-length are a non-issue.

This deal comes with a Crossbreed IWB hybrid holster, which is the finest holster I've ever used for this sidearm. It's a little worn from wear, but the Kydex is molded to fit the Baby Eagle perfectly, with the options of modifying the retention by heating the Kydex, if you so choose. The holster is of an approximate $70 value and must be put on backorder for approximately 2-3 weeks before being custom cut and shipped. 

I'm asking for $400, which includes the Full Steel Baby Desert Eagle 9mm with Hogue combat grip, the original grips that came with the firearm, the firearm package (standard case, holds two mags, cleaning accessories, etc...), Crossbreed IWB holster, and four magazines with a capacity of 15 rounds each.

FUN FACT: This is also the same handgun used by fictional character Spike Spiegel in the classic anime, Cowboy Bebop."

I'm looking for German Kar98k. Nothing too much to say about this rifle as it is one of the most popular guns that any WW2 firearm collector would know!

I'm basically looking for an original German K98. I would prefer that it'd have a cupped buttplate, sight hood, and in ok condition. I would also consider Mitchell's Mauser.

Because I'm in a tight budget, the highest price I'd pay for such a gun would be $450, but in certain circumstances it could change. 

If you have a K98 rifle, please get in touch with me. I'm open to all offers. 

Thank you for reading this ad and have a good day.
