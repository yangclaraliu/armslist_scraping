The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity. LCR-LG – Same as the model above but with the added advantage of Crimson Trace® Lasergrips® for fast target acquisition and follow-up shots

The gun will shoot with an occasional light primer strike.  Some light JB weld on the firing pin will fix that.

 Leupold Vari-X IIc 2x-7x (this is an older one, made in USA. You can see the serial number in the picture looking though the mag well)
 Has both sling mounts

Rifle and scope are in what I would consider near excellent condition. All checkering is sharp. All bluing is intact. No rust or scratches. Lens of scope is 100 percent unscathed. Just near the front sling swivel on the forearm, you will see a blemish in the finish of the wood and I have circled it in red. This is the only flaw that I see in the finish. It is not in the wood, just whatever the finish is.

The rifle is going to come with about 20 or so rounds of federal premium 140 grain vital-shok, 14 rounds of Winchester 140gr Power-point and 72 pieces of once fired brass.

You will need to come to Powell to pick up. You will need to show me your drivers license to prove that you are at least 18. We will also be signing bills of sale. I will get one and so will you. It's nothing intrusive. If you don't want to do this, then we will not deal.

Please email me with any questions. NO TEXTING. I just blew threw my texting allotment for the month and getting dinged like crazy now, haha.

Due to a bunch of flaky people on armslist, if your first email to me is a lower offer, I will ignore it. Let me repeat that, if the first email you bang out to me is to offer less than what I am asking and that is it, I will ignore it. I have gone round and round the past few weeks with some hand guns and about 10 people have offered less money and then declined to buy. If you want to buy the gun and for some reason back out, just tell me. I don't care what your bullcrap story is, just say you are not going to buy it as soon as you realize it. Yeah, I sound like a prick, but I'm not. I'm just tired of answering endless emails. Let's be adults about this."

Shoots very well. I ear holed a hog at 65 yards with this rifle back in the fall. Gun is heavier than a standard Mini due to the fact the upgraded ATI stock is a pound or so heavier than the wooden stock and the Accu-strut device is a solid steel barrel stabilizer. The heavier weight allows for less recoil and quicker follow up shots. Rife does not come with the rifle scope in the picture. The scope mount will stay with the gun though. 

Upgrades:

ATI stock bought through Cabelas. Has adjustable stock, pistol grip, picatinny rails, and best of all stock also folds away. Comes with original instructions and extra options that I did not put on the rifle, such as extra rails and screws, ect. 

Accu-struct stabilizer reduces barrel flex during bullet exit, allowing for increased accuracy by up to 30%. Comes with original box and instructions.
It is a older rifle when I got it. So I sent the rifle into Ruger. They replaced all internals including springs, and all I had to pay was S & H which was awesome. 

Accessories: 

UTG light and laser combo. Very Bright, I was able to see out to 100 yards through my traditional scope. Does not come with red or green lenses. Comes with original box and instructions.

The Leatherman MUT is the first multi-tool that functions as both a tactical and practical tool for military, LE, or civilian shooters. The MUT features multiple areas on the tool threaded for cleaning rods and brushes and all the screwdriver bits are sized for standard military and civilian sighting adjustment work. Also built into the design of the tool is the flexibility to replace the most commonly used parts on the spot, using a simple Torx #8, keeping down-time to a minimum. With all this, a MOLLE sheath and scope adjustment wrench included, the Leatherman MUT may very well be the most efficient and useful piece in your kit.

With the trigger job, Almost all the trigger creep is gone and the trigger is much lighter and crisp. Comparable to a 1911.
Internals appear to be well-made and of high quality. The only ""cheap"" thing about the pistol (if you want to call it that) would be the finish. Not the best I've seen.

I compared this pistol to a brand new Browning and preferred mine. I thought it was much smoother operating (slide, hammer, etc)

Hey everyone, 
	I have a pretty rare and pretty neat pistol for sale. This is a Grendel P30 pistol. This is  22mag semi auto with the 30 round magazine. This was the predecessor for the PMR30 before Grendel went under and subsequently became Kel-Tec. I took this to the range today and it shot fantastic (a little low for my eyes, but that could be managed). It didn’t seem to like Maxi-Mag ammo but absolutely loved the Armscor JHP stuff. I didn’t have one single issue with the Armscor, and the Maxi-mag just like to FTE a little. This is a blast to shoot and actually blows a bit of a fireball out when you shoot it. This has a mid 4 digit serial number and doesn’t show any “heavy” wear on it. About the only thing wrong is that the safety on the right side of the gun has been “filed” down. It was common on these to rub your hand on that side so it looks like the previous owner did that. Either way the safety still functions fine. 
	These are pretty rare to find nowadays and are rather collectible but still are fantastic everyday shooters. Would be awesome for a girl as a carry as you could load it up and have plenty of firepower without much recoil. I also have TONS of armscor mag ammo available at additional cost or to balance out the trade."

I have up for sale or trade one of Colt's legendary ""snake"" guns . This is a beautiful blue Colt Cobra .38 Special with a two inch barrel and six round cylinder . Arguably the best snub nose revolver ever made . This Cobra was produced in 1977 . It is the improved Second Model Colt made from 1972 to 1981 recognizable by its fully shrouded ejector rod and its long ramp front sight . It has an unloaded weight of 16 ounces making it an ideal concealed carry weapon . I would rate this pistol as at least 98% condition . It appears to be fired very little because of the absence of a turn line on the cylinder . It has the original Colt walnut combat type grips that enclose the front and bottom of the grip frame . These post 1972 Cobras were the only version that Colt ever rated for use with +P ammunition . I will include a Mixson Leathercraft black leather OWB holster with this gun . I will trade for a quality AK47 , AR , CZ75 , CZ85 , Kimber or Browning Hi Power . $750 or best reasonable offer ."

It brings the rugged reliability of the AK platform and marries it to a common, effective, and cheap U.S. round, the 5.56 NATO.

Why the 5.56? Because in an SHTF scenario within US borders, it will be plentiful and effective.
Why in an AK platform? Because I've never seen an AR that can fire 10,000+ rounds without being cleaned or experiencing a FTF.

Built on a new factory Saiga 5.56 sporter, this AK has been fully converted. Saigas are the only Russian new production AKs in the civilian market. Changes included:
- Tapco T2 trigger/guard conversion with trigger moved back to original AK design location
- Polymer pistol grip added
- Polymer AK stock added
- New recoil buffer
- Bullet guide installed to accept Galil magazines
- Tromix enlarged textured charging handle
- Chaos aluminum powder coated quad rail
- Polymer vertical foregrip
- Barrel cut to 14.5"" and target crowned
- Blind pinned type 74 brake to bring barrel length to just over 16""

The front sight base has been removed, as has the rear sight leaf. It works well with long eye relief and red dot scopes, especially with low profile rings. Iron sights could be easily added by installing a rear sight leaf and a gas block front sight. The muzzle brake is ""permanently attached"" per ATF rules, but could be removed if need be by a competent gun smith while preserving the 15x1M HK threads on the end of the barrel for ""permanent"" installation of a different brake.

Comes with one (1) polymer 30 round Galil mag.

Could use a refinish. Bore is in excellent condition. Cycles perfectly. Rough around the edges, but as solid as they come.

It's the .357 Magnum, Single Action 6-Shooter. For its age this revolver is in good cosmetic condition. Mechanically it works flawlessly. Super Smooth Action, Great Rifling, Bluing is in mostly very good shape with the exception of the area around the grip. Not surprising after decades of being handled. This Revolver is rare and getting rarer, a true collectable. As you can see it has the original wood grips and is completely free of modifications. A neat thing about the .357 is that you can also shoot .38 special if you're looking for cheaper ammo with less kick. I can deliver within reason and if the price is right.

I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

It doesn't look bad and honestly the fingerprints and oil from the skin show up much worse on the Gen 4's but those wipe off. I had the trigger guard mod done professional by Hawk Tech Arms so you can get a higher grip. No it doesn't weaken the trigger guard, you'd break the frame before you could put enough force into breaking the trigger guard. Comes with everything I got with it brand new, 3 mags, 4 back straps, cleaning rod, lock, factory fired casings, and the store tag. I paid $617.90 plus having the trigger guard modded. It'll also come with a 20rnd box of 165gr FTX Hornady. $525 Text Cody at REDACTED I do NOT answer unknown numbers so email or text so I know the number then if you want to call I'll answer. Must show ID to buy and sign BOS. I'd also trade for a Gen 4 Glock 17 or 19, if it's an FDE one we can talk about adding some money on the trade on my end depending on condition. Thanks"

Other minor things of note, has the 5th amendment dust cover and a ""don't tread on me"" laser engraved into the trigger guard.

Everything was installed with care and the gun itself has been well maintained. In extra parts alone your looking at around 700-800 dollars. Add in cost of the rifle, you're looking at 1300+ dollars. My asking price is 1000 for the lot, optic included but I'm willing to barter on prices. Trade wise I'm not too interested in pistols/shotguns unless you've got a VEPR 12. Rifle wise I'm looking at other battle rifles, CETME, FAL, PTR91, VEPR's in .308 or 54r, etc. But cash is preferred. Gotta fix up the bike because go figure as soon as the nice weather gets here, it breaks down.

This package includes 50 rounds of long rifle ammunition.

You really don't need a holster for this pistol, it is the perfect size for pocket or purse and it is user friendly, I do have a pocket holster, you can have it as well as the padded holster.

It has a 2.38"" tip-up barrel, it had an overall length of 4.5"". Since the gun is fired from a cocked hammer, the tip-up barrel made absolute sense from a safety perspective.

Rather than use an extractor, the gun could pop spent casings strait up with the barrel tip lever, it can also be checked for a live cartage in the barrel for safety before and after use.

I have had this pistol for 3 years and had only used it 4 times at the range, ran seven magazines though it without any issues, very accurate for its size.

The trigger pull is enhanced with a JP enterprises JP Reduced Weight spring kit. Combined with the nickel teflon trigger, disconnector and hammer, this makes for a smooth, crisp trigger break. The barrel is a Daniel Defense 14.5 inch light contour 1 in 7  inch rate-of-twist chrome-lined barrel with a Cavalry arms Cav comp pinned and welded to BATFE specs giving the barrel an overall length of 16 inches. The barrel is torqued to spec using a Core 15 Stressproof barrel nut. The gas system includes a Spike's Tactical Melonited Carbine-length gas tube mated with a Brownell's low-profile gas block. The Bolt Carrier Group is a WMD NIB-X nickel boron plated as is the charging handle. The fore end is a Samson Evolution keymod free-float tube 12.5 inches in length. In order to obtain maximum recoil mitigation, we finish the rifle off with a Mako G-shock recoil-reducing collapsible stock on a Brownell's commercial receiver extension tube. All together, the CAR-lite is approximately five pounds. Simply put, this is a light-weight and handy little rifle you have to shoulder to appreciate. Note that this is our demo. If you chose to purchase this model, we will build it from scratch. The approximate wait time is three weeks from start to delivery."

******If this ad is still on Armslist, the pistol is still available for sale or trade.****** 

You really don't need a holster for this pistol, it is the perfect size for pocket or purse and it is user friendly for a man or a woman's hand. 
Excellent pistol for a women.
I do have a pocket holster you can have it as well as the padded holster.

It has a 2.38"" tip-up barrel, it had an overall length of 4.5"". Since the gun is fired two ways, double action with a cartage in the barrel just pull the trigger with the hammer down or from a cocked hammer, just pull the trigger, the tip-up barrel made absolute sense from a safety perspective. 

Rather than use the slide extractor which would discard the empty casing in the barrel, the gun could discard last spent casings strait up with the barrel tip lever, it can also be checked for a live cartage in the barrel for safety before use.

I have had this pistol for 3 years and had only used it a four times at the range, ran seven to twelve magazines though it without any issues, very accurate and fun for its size, it is also economical.

Call REDACTED or reply by email for more information. This little gun is easy to breakdown at home or in the field if needed for cleaning.

We are located on 64th ave, in north Denver, we live in the county, so test firing it is legal on my property. Interested buyers only, no free shooting without a bill of sale."
