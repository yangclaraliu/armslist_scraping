Now Gen. 4 owners have the same ability to ""tune"" the Gock recoil system to specific loads just as Gen. 3 owners have!  Our guide rods allow the use of standard ISMI springs or stock Gen. 3 springs, allowing you to tune the pistol for whatever ammunition you choose for improved performance and reliability. 
Jager  Gen. 4 Guide Rods have been designed from the ground up, not simply an ""adapter"" which causes inconsistent cycling and lockup due to incorrect fit to frame. With our Gen. 4 specific guide rods, the rear end of the rod sits properly in the frame with no movement or play.  One of the main benefits of adding a steel guide rod is to improve consistency of cycling, not decrease consistency.

This handgun is made for .45 Auto ammunition.  I purchased this new, and have been the only owner.  By my recollection, I have fired more than 100, and less than 300 rounds through this handgun.  I believe that those were all brass cased rounds, no steel cased.  There was never any corrosive ammunition in or around this handgun.  There is no ammunition for sale with this listing.  Please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.  Transfer will go through an FFL.  That is non-negotiable.  The FFL will be South Carolina Gun Company (SC Gun Co) at 242 W. Wade Hampton Blvd, Greer, South Carolina.   In the event I ship this to an FFL for a buyer a distance away, Whatever the buyer's cost is to recieve it from their FFL will be on the buyer.    ------------------------------ FULL DISCLOSURE:  (3 points to follow)  I have gone swimming with this handgun.  It was only in a freshwater river.  Never in salt water, nor even brackish water.  The way that I would clean the handgun after a swim would be to blast it mostly dry with an airhose, and then spray some Rem Oil onto the inside and outside.  Per my recollection, once I did not bother doing this in a timely fashion with this handgun, and the only sign of rust/corrosion that I saw on it is and was that little pin that runs through the trigger itself (visible from the outside of the firearm and visible in my pictures).  I always found the trigger pull on this Glock pistol to be rather heavy.  I don't have a trigger pull scale, so I can't quantify it.  I was comparing against other Glock pistols, some of them with many many more rounds put through them than were put through this pistol.  The back end of the slide overhangs the receiver by what looks like about 1/32nd of an inch.  I have seen the rear of Glock slides fit up with the receiver a little off fore or aft, and I've seen them fit up nice and flush.  I've read about this online and it doesn't seem to be a concern of fit or function.  I personally didn't notice the fit on this Glock until after I purchased it, and so I just want to mention now so a buyer can know ahead of time and make an informed decision.  End of FULL DISCLOSURE portion. ---------------------------------------- Transfer will go through FFL.  That FFL will be South Carolina Gun Company (SC Gun Co) at 242 W. Wade Hampton Blvd, Greer, South Carolina. 
In the event I'm shipping this, whatever the buyer's cost is to receive it from their FFL will be on the buyer.  Transfer going through FFL is non-negotiable.  Offers to skip the FFL will be treated as a waste of my time.  Tested and proven.  I took several more pictures than the 3 I can post with my free Armslist account.  If you want more, I can email them.  If I am to ship this firearm, I will accept USPS money order, and I will turn that into real cash money in my hand before I ship anything anywhere.  Sorry for the extra time and hassle, I'm selling a legit product and I want to ensure I have legit payment to avoid getting burned here. 
If we meet in person at the FFL, I'll accept cash, and cash only.  Buyer of a handgun needs to be 21 years of age and able to pass the inquiry of ATF Form 4473.
In the event that buyer wants me to ship this firearm to their FFL, buyer assumes burden of responsibility of knowing that this firearm is legal for them to possess (whatever the particulars of their state's laws and statues are on the subject).  Buyer also ensures that he or she is legally able to possess this firearm (is mentally competent, has not been convicted of even a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and all the other qualifying points on ATF Form 4473).   In the event that buyer and seller agree to a sale, I (the seller) receive payment, package up the firearm, take it to the FFL, transfer the firearm to the FFL so that the FFL can proceed to ship firearm to the buyer's FFL, and then it turns out the buyer cannot take possession of the firearm for whatever reason - we (buyer and seller) agree that I (seller) will refund only half of the money.  I know this is ugly talk, but it's just and it's simple: I'm a regular guy with a life to live and job to pursue, trying to liquidate a couple items, buyer needs to know if they can pass the checklist to take possession of said firearm (i.e., I respect your time, hard-earned money, and hassle; I expect you to respect mine).
I will not sell firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL).
Again, do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."

This is a Factory built upper and not a parts build.---------------------------------------------------Aptly named, the Bushmaster Predator AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly incorporates many of the characteristics and attributes desired by hunters for the pursuit of game at both close and extended distances. The 20"" Extra Heavy Fluted Barrel ensures maximum bullet velocity and uses 1 in 8"" Twist Button Rifling to help stabilize heavier projectiles of up to 77 grains in weight, giving the shooter more reach and greater retained energy on target at longer distances. The Predator's Hybrid Match Chamber has tighter tolerances than a 5.56 NATO chamber for enhanced accuracy potential, while still retaining the ability to safely use both commercial and military surplus ammunition. The Predator features a rifle length Free Floating Tube Handguard with cooling slots for a comfortable off-hand grip that also removes accuracy-robbing influences from interfering with the barrel's harmonics upon firing. Accuracy is further emphasized by the barrel's 11 degree target crown at the muzzle. The upper comes complete and ready for instant use with bolt carrier group, charging handle, low profile gas block, forward assist, shell deflector and ejection port cover all included$550 with scope mount$500 upper only"

Looks like moderate to heavy wear, lands and grooves still visible. Some pitting. Looks better at 117 years old than I do at 52 though. Has not been re-bored to my knowledge (Neither have I, ladies, hubba hubba).Information above was added on 1/4/2018 4:09:48 PMLooks like a screw is missing in the top tang. Picture shows this but I wanted you to be sure to notice. Should be easy enough to replace. Also, there are a couple of small dings in the magazine tube. Pictures show these also.Information above was added on 12/28/2017 10:47:50 PMBEAUTIFUL! My regular buyers will recognize that this is another masterpiece by engraver Jeff Flannery. You can see his name on the barrel. As my regulars know, I'm selling off the guns of a friend of mine who died. He liked to take old rifles and pistols and send them to Jeff Flannery to be redone with engraving and gold inlay AND hi-grade furniture all the way around. These guns are gorgeous. This is an 1892 in 25-20 manufactured in 1902. The heft is great and the action is rock-solid. The engraving work speaks for itself. I do not have the certificate that Jeff provides with his work, but you can get a replacement for 20 or 30 bucks from Jeff. Look him up online. He confirmed to me that this is his work. I thought I was done with the engraved Winchesters as several of you regretted not upping your bids on the other ones. This one may be the best of all. I found it hiding waaaaaaay in the back of the safe. Among the ghosts of Arizona past! Don't screw up this time! Bid early and often. I debated putting a reasonable reserve on this one, but screw it! It's almost tax refund time!!! Get a loan if you have to because this is definitely the last one like this that I'll be listing. I prefer an e-check for payment or wire transfer. You get my bank info, you know where your money is going and I can ship in a couple of days this way and not have to worry about your check getting lost. I will not ship this rifle without a hard case. The last Winchester I sent was damaged in transit. I'll get a cheap hard case and you pay $25.00 for it. You pay actual shipping. I recommend insurance but that's up to you. $0.90 per $100.00. If you choose to send me a check via mail, shipping may take a while. Possibly up to two weeks or longer. Best of luck, this rifle is freakin' gorgeous! Front sight is bent a little bit.Contact for more info.678-718-8067"

524,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7802524,For Sale:  WWII Japan Type 14 Toriimatsu Battle Okinawa,"30179, Athens, Georgia",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, January 8, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Please read the Item Characteristics for important listing details.This is a fine condition WWII Japanese Type 14 Pistol manufactured by the Nagoya Army Arsenal, Toriimatsu Factory, Second Series, in March 1944, along with an original issue Japanese leather clam-shell holster. This pistol was picked up on Okinawa on June 5, 1945, probably by soldiers from the U.S. 184th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division.Famous Japanese weapon designer, General Kijiro Nambu, led the initial development for a replacement for the 1902 Papa Pistol at the Army's Tokyo Arsenal in the early 1920s. The modified 1902 Papa Pistol's short recoil, locked-breech action, striker fired operation was maintained in the new pistol as was the earlier 8mm pistol cartridge. But there were other significant design changes that clearly distinguish the new design from the older Model 1902 Papa. For example, the grip safety was eliminated in the new design and replaced by a manual, thumb operated safety on the left side of the frame. The new safety lever also locked the barrel assembly and frame and it prevented the vertical movement of the sear. The function of the manual safety lever was sound but its location was too far forward for the firer to operate it with the firing hand. The Frame was stamped with the kanji ""HI"" for ""fire,"" and ""AN"" for ""safe,"" on opposite ends of the safety lever pivot point. A curved arrow was added later to indicate the designed direction of travel of the safety lever because the lever could be rotated 360 degrees, which damaged the left grip panel.The frame on the new pistol was also simplified with considerable milling that essentially left the top of the frame open except for the rear sight bridge at the rear of the frame. The new design also replaced the Papa's single, offset mainspring and separate spring guide with two recoil springs that rode in recesses on either side of the bolt. The bolt spring recess design simplified manufacture of the new weapon as the older Papa mainspring design required considerable milling to the frame and an entire part, with associated milling steps - the spring guide - was eliminated completely.The operation of the disconnector in the new pistol was changed considerably from the Papa design with a new trigger lug replacing the Papa's spring-loaded plunger on the end of the sear bar. This new lug design prevented the trigger from engaging the sear until the weapon was in battery and the trigger fully released from previous firing. The trigger guard and trigger assembly was also redesigned to be compatible with the newly design frame and new sear. The striker and bolt on the new pistol was also completely redesigned. The rear, tail portion of the striker was now offset and protruded from the bottom of the bolt instead of the left side as found on the Papa pistol. The bolt itself was also simplified considerably with a uniform, round cross-section that could be easily machined from 18mm round steel bar stock, without the wear plate on the bottom of the bolt as existed on the Papa bolt.Finally, the new design made modifications to the magazine release and magazine body. The magazine was changed to incorporate horizontal grooves instead of checkering on the base to afford a better gripping surface when removing the magazine. The magazine latch was also redesigned as a one-piece design to replace the Papa's more complicated two-piece design. The magazine latch was also shortened so that the outer, left face did not extend as far out from the left grip panel to prevent accidental magazine release during unholstering, handling, etc. There were other design modifications incorporated into the new pistol, including a simpler, stronger extractor, to both increase reliability and enhance mass production.Eventually, a suitable replacement pistol was designed, tested and officially adopted by the Army in 1925. The new pistol design was designated the ""Juyon Nen Shiki,"" or ""14 Year Type,"" for the fourteenth year of Emperor Taisho's reign, which is now commonly referred to as the Type 14. The Imperial Japanese Navy followed two years later on August 6, 1927, when it adopted the Type 14 Pistol for naval use, designating it the ""Type 14 8 mm Automatic Pistol."" The new Type 14 Pistol was the only Japanese firearm that was stamped throughout most of its production with the kanji indicating the Showa date, which is the year of the Emperor's reign followed by the number of the month of production expressed as 1-12.Despite the success of the new design and positive reports from the field, there were several problems identified with the initial issue pistols and the Japanese military issued a general recall for all Type 14 pistols in 1932. Most Type 14 Pistols that had been issued earlier were returned to various arsenals for modification. The modifications included a redesigned striker and guide and the addition of a magazine safety mechanism. The original striker was replaced with a slightly shorter striker and the original guide was replaced with a correspondingly longer guide. These changes required new clearance slots in both the bolt and the locking block. The magazine safety was a pivoting block pinned to the top of the frame just forward of the magazine well. The magazine safety was designed to prevent the trigger from being depressed (or pulled to the rear) when the magazine is removed. Interestingly, the Type 14, both before and after the 1932 modifications, never had a bolt hold open device integral to the pistol itself. The rear of the magazine followers would hold the bolt open upon discharge of the last round but the bolt would close when the empty magazine was removed.The Type 14 Pistol is 9.09 inches in length, 6.02 inches in height and weighs 2 pound, 0 ounces. The barrel is 5.61 inches long with six lands and grooves in a right-hand twist. The Magazine holds eight 8mm rounds. The Type 14 was manufactured at five separate facilities during its production life, which ran from 1926 until 1945. The Nagoya Army Arsenal, Chigusa Factory, who manufactured the first Type 14 Pistols, produced the pistol from November 1926 until November 1932 and manufactured approximately 7,825 Type 14s. The Tokyo Army Arsenal, Koishigawa-ku in Tokyo produced the pistol from May 1928 until March 1935 and manufactured approximately 31,900 Type 14s. The Kokura Army Arsenal, 2nd Factory, Kokura-shi, Fukuoka-ken, produced the pistol from April 1935 until June 1936 and manufactured approximately 3,600 Type 14s. The Nambu Rifle Manufacturing Company, Chuo Kogyo Co., Ltd, Kokubunji Factory, Kokubunji, Tokyo produced the pistol from December 1933 until August 1944 and manufactured 112,475 Type 14s. The Nagoya Army Arsenal, Toriimatsu Factory, Kasugai-shi, Aichi-ken produced the pistol from November 1941 until August 1945 and manufactured approximately 126,500 Type 14s including all of the ""last ditch"" Type 14 pistols.As can be seen from the production statistics above, Type 14 production was phased into and out of several plants over the course of the production life of the pistol. In early 1941, as Japanese leaders realized that the war in east Asia would have to be expanded in order for Japan to achieve their strategic goals, war production was increased in all areas, to include pistol production. To supplement the existing Nagoya Nambu Kokubunji factory's Type 14 production, the Nagoya Army Arsenal's Toriimatsu small arms factory, where this pistol was manufactured, was selected to begin Type 14 production. After planning and re-tooling was completed, production on the Type 14 began at Toriimatsu in October 1941.Toriimatsu began their Type 14 production in the First Series at serial number 50001. During production at Toriimatsu, the factory instituted various changes over the years. For example, initial production Type 14s were rust blued but the process was expensive and time consuming. Toriimatsu chose to finish all of their production pistols using the quicker and cheaper hot salt blue process. Also, shortly after production began, Toriimatsu replaced the long 73 mm long striker with an entirely new, short striker and long striker spring guide design. Later in Torrimatsu production, the factory changed the cocking knob, grip panels and rear sight. According to Harry L. Derby III and James D. Brown's definitive work on the Japanese martial pistols, ""Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893-1945,"" Schiffer Military History, publ., 2003, from which much of this historical information was obtained, ""Surprisingly, a significant number of the approximately 126,500 Toriimatsu Type 14s were held in stores and never issued."" I believe that this particular Type 14 Pistol is one of those that was never issued because of its pristine condition.In August 1944, the Nambu Kokubunji factory ended Type 14 production, leaving the Toriimatsu factory where this pistol was produced as the sole Type 14 manufacturer. With less than a year left in the war, Type 14 production at the Toriimatsu plant gradually decreased each month. By the beginning of 1945, both production and quality decreased significantly. By March 1944, when this pistol was manufactured, only 6,604 Type 14s were manufactured. Type 14 Production increased slightly in early 1944 around the time this particular pistol was manufactured but then decreased again that fall. By December 1944, monthly production had decreased to only 1,566 Type 14 pistols. The next month, January 1945, saw only 670 pistols manufactured. The last full month of production at Toriimatsu, July 1945, saw the factory transition from a more typical production to production of the ""Last Ditch"" pistols, which were assembled with unserialized and mismatched parts and were often left unfinished. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 saw the factory close and the last Type 14 pistol ever assembled.This particular pistol is serial number 21460, which is all matching, and was manufactured at Toriimatsu in March 1944. As noted, that month, the Toriimatsu factory produced only 6,604 Type 14 Pistols from serial number 19967 to 26571. The Frame on this Type 14 is in fine condition and retains 95% of its original salt blued finish that is beginning to slightly thin and with wear noted on the sharp edges. There is minimal wear on the front and rear interior magazine well walls. All of the stampings are crisp, including the Nagoya Army Arsenal and 2nd Series symbols, the serial number and the Showa date on the right, rear portion of the Frame, which is “19.3,” or March 1944.The front and rear grip straps also show 95% of their original finish. The Lanyard Loop on the rear of the Frame is in fine condition with most of its original finish remaining. The Magazine Retainer Spring and large rivet both retain 95% of the original blued finish. The Magazine Safety Block retains 95% of its original blued finish. The Safety Block Plunger also retains 100% of its original blued finish. The Locking Block Spring remains in the white and is in fine condition. The Safety Lever retains 95% of its original finish. The end of the pin portion of the Safety Lever has a blued finish. According to Derby and Brown in their book, Toriimatsu began to experiment with changes to the salt blue compound as well as the bath temperatures around the time this pistol was manufactured and continued to experiment until the end of production in August 1945. The experimentation with the bluing process resulted in a widely varying blued finish on Type 14s. Some of the pistols exhibited a very thin blued finish while others had a very dark, durable finish. Certain small parts, such as strikers, screws, extractors and safety levers, have a more pronounced variation in finish with some having a deep blue finish and some having a bright, reddish tone. The reddish, or plum color, is caused by inconsistent bluing bath temperatures. The kanji on the frame for ""Safe"" and ""Ready/Fire,"" are still crisp and the only mark of any note on the Frame is the Safety Lever arc.The Barrel and Barrel Extension is serial number matching with “460” stamped on the bottom and is in fine condition, retaining 95% of the original salt blue. The only wear noted is along the rear side of the Barrel Extension where it rides in the Frame and towards the muzzle. The Barrel retains 95% of the original blued finish. The Front Sight retains 98% of the original blued finish and it is correctly staked to the Rear Sight Base dovetail on both the left and right side of the sight post. The bullet feed ramp shows no wear at all and retains all of its blued finish. The bore is in mint condition with a mirror bore and strong, crisp rifling. The breech face retains 95% of its original blued finish and shows minimal operational wear. The interior walls of the Barrel Extension exhibit minimal wear and retain 95% of the original blue.The Bolt remains in the white and retains strong case color hardening finish on the top, center portion. Toriimatsu ceased polishing and even bluing of many internal parts beginning with the 2nd Series. Later 2nd Series bolts produced a few months later in early 1944 were not blued but were left in the white. The Extractor remains in the white. The Bolt face is very clean. The rear of the Bolt has the matching serial number “260” near the threaded end and all of the threads are still crisp and sharp. There is an interim inspection stamp on the bolt just to the rear of the Extractor. The Striker is non-matching with “033” on the tail and it retains 95% of its regular blued finish on the rear 3/4ths with the front ""pin"" portion of the Striker remaining in the white. There is an interim inspection stamp on the opposite side of the tail from the serial number. The Striker Spring remains pristine and in the white with 52 coils. The Striker Spring Guide retains 95% of its original blued finish and is serial number matching with serial number “460” stamped on the barrel. Both Recoil Springs are in pristine condition and remain in the white with 42 coils each.The Locking Block is in fine condition with the matching serial number “460” on the bottom and it remains in the white. There is an interim inspection mark on the side of the Block.The Magazine Latch is serial number matching with “460” stamped in the Trigger Guard recess and it retains 95% of its original blued finish. The checkered and smooth faces retain considerable original blue finish. The Magazine Latch Spring is very fine and remains in the white with 16 coils.One of the most apparent modifications made by the Toriimatsu factory during early 2nd Series production was the change to the cocking knob design. As a manufacturing expedient, the original 27.5 mm diameter grooved knob was replaced by a solid, 25mm diameter round style with fine knurling. This revised knob was introduced at Toriimatsu in January 1944. This Cocking Knob is the correct, revised Toriimatsu solid style with the fine knurling. The Knob retains 95% of its original blued finish and is serial number matching with “460” stamped on the back. The checkering (knurling) on the grooves is unmarred.The Trigger Guard is the correct, later large guard type for use with winter gloves and it is serial number matching with “460” stamped on the top ledge and it is in very fine plus condition, retaining 95% of the original blued finish, even on the bottom of the Trigger Guard, which is where you typically see wear. There are various interim inspection stamps on the Guard. The Trigger and Trigger Sear are both in fine condition and retain 100% of their original blued finish. The Trigger is serial number matching with “460” stamped on the upper right side.Both Grip Screws retain the majority of their now thinning blued finish and the threads are still sharp and are not marred. Both Grip Panels are the original, serial number matching Philippine Mahogany panels. Both panels have the correct 24 parallel grooves and the milling areas on the front and back are very crisp. The rear of both panels has crisp “1460” stamped into the wood. Both Panels still exhibit a light color and there is minimal wear and dings on the front surfaces but there are no cracks or chips noted. Both Panels are secure to the Frame and do not move or wiggle when assembled.The original Magazine is the correct and matching Type VIII magazine manufactured by Nagoya Toriimatsu that was used for both the First and Second Series. The body is hot salt blued and retains 95% of the original blued finish. The front strap is notched for the Magazine Retainer Spring. The lower spine of the Magazine has the matching serial number “460” along with interim inspection stamps and a punch mark over the serial number. The cast alloy Base has the correct 9 crisp grasping grooves on either side. The Follower retains 100% of the original blued finish and the Follower Spring remains in the white. The Magazine Loading Button retains 90% of its original blued finish. The Magazine functions perfectly and secures tightly into the frame.This Type 14 comes with an original and fairly scarce Japanese Type III leather clamshell holster in very good condition. The brass rings on the back are the square type and the attaching straps are still tightly stitched to the rear body of the Holster. The central belt loop is also still tightly stitched to the back of the Holster. The cover of the clamshell is in fine condition and the leather hinge is still intact. The closure strap is the correct solid leather tab with the two-piece oval brass keyhole plates. The spare ammunition compartment and closure flap are in excellent condition and the closure flap retaining loop is still solidly attached with the original stitching. The spare striker compartment is present and is adjacent to the spare ammunition pouch and it is also solidly retained with all of the original stitching present.Of historical importance is the marking on the inside of the clamshell. It is marked, in pencil, ""YONABARU / OKINAWA-RYUKYUS / JUNE 5, 1945."" Yonabaru is a town in Shimajiri District, Okinawa Prefecture, in the southern end of Okinawa Island, on the east coast, overlooking Nakagusuku Bay. Yonabaru was home to a Japanese Air Force Base on Okinawa and the airfield was captured at the end of May 1945. Yonabaru was captured by the 184th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, and remained in the 184th Regiment's sector until the peninsula was captured at the end of the battle.This is a fine condition Toriimatsu manufactured Type 14 Pistol that is all matching, to include the magazine, except for the striker, which was a fairly common replacement when the tip would break. This pistol includes a fine and scarce leather clamshell holster. This would be a superb addition to any WWII or Japanese small arms collection, particularly given its fine condition.Contact for more info.678-718-8067"

It was produced with Colt machinery under Colt employee supervision, and is identical to a pre-war Colt Government model from the late 1920's - an American civilian model will run you over 3 times as much in equal condition! All parts are machined out of forged steel, you won't find ANY cast parts unlike modern production 1911s!Bluing is original, all parts are original except for the magazine (which is a blued GI-style MecGar), and the grip panels are World War 2 issued grip panels (early Keyes grips without the reinforcing rings). The gun is very smooth and the tolerances are fine, the trigger is crisp and the bore is absolutely mint. Bluing has wear on the front strap and front of the slide, but it is honest wear from service in the Argentine forces - this gun was carried a lot, and shot very seldom. The serial numbers all match, the extra number on the slide and frame is an arsenal number from service in the Argentine Coast Guard - it was produced in early 1959 judging by the serial number. The gun has German proof marks, which means it was exported as surplus to Germany before coming to America. Comes with a plastic carrying case shown in the photos. I've shot 3 magazines through it over the past 2 years I've owned it, and it shoots wonderfully. The sights are right on, it shoots accurately and to point of aim. The gun has been completely disassembled and oiled, and cleaned after every use.
Most of these guns were extremely ragged and refinished in the government arsenals with a rough parkerizing. Finding these guns with the original bluing is very rare, and most of them are shot out. This is a rare bird to find in the States! I paid $1000 USD and am taking a loss due to financial issues. I ONLY accept cash in a face to face transaction in the state of Virginia. I require a bill of sale and state identification. Understand I am NOT interested in trades, they would have to be VERY tempting and gracious for me to be interested, so keep that in mind! Number is 703 five nine three four zero three six!Please text or email ONLY!
