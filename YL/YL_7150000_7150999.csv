In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin black aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).

I took pics and maybe one of you other collectors might know and you'll give me a heads up. All of the above info means this rifle is one of these Belgium Grade II rifles. That's all accurate info and this rifle has other aftermarket bells and whistles. A cantilever mounted Nikon 4x scope with a Leupold scope mount. A new Browning case. This rifle has been fired by me maybe 50-100 times to sight in AND THAT'S IT! I haven't even cleaned it since last fired and that was circa 1995+/-.

It has had a lot of work done on it minus the gunsmithing here is the run down. Night sights are super bright in the dark and still great during the day to pick up targets. Like I said it has bull barrel and solid guide rod. It has been cerakoted in two tone brown including barrel. It turned out really good and looks very nice. I'm including three holsters,4 extra mags for total of 5 all loaded with defense ammunition, five boxes of extra ammo so another 250rds. I have been into guns sense I was 11 and at 44 I know like everyone else you don't get what you put into them guns very seldom go down but extras are exactly that extras. But for the purpose of selling or trade I think it's fair to at least let people know what there getting. The gun was 642.89 exact, cerokote was around 250,night sites were 125, ammo about 25 a box so 125, defense ammo another 100, extra mags x 4 19.89 so 80, and holsters about 150. So I have about 1500.00 in it and again you will never get it back but I'm not going to give it away so 625 firm that's under half of what I have in it. I would like to trade for another handgun in 9mm. As for brand or manufacture I open to the regular makers sig,hk,smith,beretta,Springfield,etc no high point or Taurus please. I will trade straight out or if what you have is not as much as what I have then we could work out in cash if you are happy with that completely up to you. Sorry for any misspelling done on my iPhone and I hate auto correct.... please send photo with your email so I know what I'm looking at and anything extra that you may have to go with gun. Thanks for looking.... One last thing I'm sure people will ask why I put that much in a rock island and not just buy kimber or Wilson well I have shot all three and own the other two as well and I will tell you this Little Rock island will hit target spot on just like the Wilson or the kimber and I wanted something small I could carry that I would not be heartbroken if it was taken by police after a shooting. So to be honest it is a work horse that does not break the bank and I really loved shooting it I was very impressed with the gun and the maker and would recommend it to any of my friends. The issue is the .45 I'm getting older and after working with my hands my hole life shooting the .45 has just gotten to be not as fun so a 9mm will suit me just fine and still get the job done. So there you have it email if your interested thanks again. 843-283-520six"

P. Sauer & Sohn in the late 1950's.  The stock was hand-picked and installed by Sauer in the early 1960's.  It comes with iron sights - I was told by the Weatherby historian that only some Crown Customs were imported to the US with iron sights.  I have the original receipt when purchased in Germany.  Installed by Sauer were European Claw Mounts and a Nichols 1.5-6 riflescope.  Test targets were provided.  I had a second set of claw mounts ($600) manufactured by New England Custom Guns so that my Zeiss Conquest 3.5-10x44mm could be used - the Nichols provides backup and comes in a leather case. Both scopes have been tested and fire to the same POI when removed and reinstalled.  The .300 Weatherby Magnum is capable of taking all game on the North American continent and has been used extensively in Africa.  This rifle is in extraordinary condition for its age with no rust or pits, excellent, deep bluing and only very minor wood dents.  I additionally have quite a few boxes of factory Weatherby ammunition with Nosler partition bullets available.  This rifle alone can match or better any custom-made $3000 rifle on the market today.  With the two scopes and claw mounts, this package is a steal at $3200.  Many more pics available upon request. I will ship to an FFL holder.  REDACTED"

From Fjestad's blue book: FN Grade II's have grey receiver, deluxe wood with finer checkering, gold plated trigger, and engraving depicting two squirrels and two prairie dogs. Unsigned, signed, or initialed by engraver. This rifle appears to be signed underneath the dog but I can't completely make it out. It looks like ""Legiexxs"". I took pics and maybe one of you other collectors might know and you'll give me a heads up. All of the above info means this rifle is one of these Belgium Grade II rifles. That's all accurate info and this rifle has other aftermarket bells and whistles. A cantilever mounted Nikon 4x scope with a Leupold scope mount. A new Browning case. This rifle has been fired by me maybe 50-100 times to sight in AND THAT'S IT! I haven't even cleaned it since last fired and that was circa 1995+/-. Serial#7T 70572 means DOM 1967, shipping is extra $40."
