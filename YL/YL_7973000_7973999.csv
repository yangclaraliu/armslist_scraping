This gun is basically sold out everywhere, and those that have it are chagring a hell of a premium for it. I can say with 100% honesty it is one of the best shooting 9mm ""pistols"" I have ever fired and I have Sig/HK/Etc. I am selling it solely because it doesnt quite fit the role I was hoping it would quite as well as I need.. This is a very subjective issue and will likely effect very few people, but I am 6'8"" and as such have very long arms (like 37"" sleeves). I bought it with the intention of getting a Form 1 and then using it as my HD/Defensive pistol since the stock is spring loaded and is very easily deployable, plus it is threaded and suppresses very nicely. However while out with an SOT friend who had a USW Stock for me to try out, it is a bit too short for me to shoulder and a such I am going to go a different route and (possibly regretfully sell this unicorn).It has the integrated Aimpoint Nano (and it has been sighted in at 25 yards), also has a built in B&T branded inforce light on the rail. This gun comes with the B&T cleaning kit (in padded case), 3 adjustable backstraps, Single Point Sling, Padded Hard Case from B&T, along with 2 17rd Mags (gun only comes with 1 new, I bought a 2nd one).I am open to trades, they just need to be of similar value as the B&T. I paid just a hair under $2,400 shipped (including the extra mag). I am interested in nice 9mm pistols (preferably optic ready), suppressor ready .45 (not really looking for a 1911 unless you're including $1,500 or more cash), and .223 ""Pistols"", along with nice 5.56 rifles, Does not have to be AR platform (Don't need/want your optics as I have a Trijicon I intend to use), also interested in a highend semi-auto .308. Some Specific Guns I want are listed, but am open to suggestion that are similar to what I want. I put my price as the Cash price, if you are wanting to trade, trade value must be atleast $2,400 (Hell, if you have a more expensive gun, I may add $$)"

I think the gas block might be aligned wrong but as I just had a child I don't have the money or time to trouble shoot it. If you are interested the rifle will include the hard case pictured, two hex mags, a gun lock and 150 rounds NATO and 20 rounds 223. I am willing to trade for cash and some items.  It really has to be something I want to a straight trade. I am firm on 550. Thank you for your time don't try and waste mine"

I had a bad deal with an individual. I'm not here to put his name on blast because I can see why he would be upset. I agreed to trade my AR Pistol for a DD Upper. He lives outside of Jackson, and we met halfway. It was a very sketchy abandonded truck stop, had I seen the location before, I never would have went there. I drove there in my gfs car with her in it because my car's 5th gear is out. It was a very sketchy, ""The Hills have Eyes/ Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" looking place and I felt uncomfortable the whole time. I traded him a firearm that I bought new, and assumed worked. He called me the next day and left a very angry voicemal (because I was at work and didn't answer right away) and told me it would not chamber. I IMMEDIATELY called him back to address the issue. He told me he took it apart, cleaned it, messed with it, took a ""copper brush"" to it and it would not chamber. I had no idea it would not chamber. I never tried to fire or chamber it. I don't shoot every gun I own. But alas, I told him I am a man of my word and had no issue giving him his item back, even swap. My only request was he come to my work, which is a LICENSED FFL, and have my LICENSED Gunsmith look at it to make sure it wasn't altered or parts switched out. I even offered to pay for his gas. He responded very immaturely (as presented in the photos).I've traded with probably half of you guys on here, I work some of the gun shows, and most of you know where I work. You guys know me. I've yet to have a bad transaction until now. I work for an FFL with a Gunsmith. I have ZERO reason to trade off non working firearms. I'd just have my gunsmith fix it, or send it off to the manufacturer. I was just uncomfortable meeting a man who left me a very angry message, in an abandonded delapidated truck stop, in my gfs car with her 5'3"" 110lbs blonde ass sitting in the seat while I meet an irrationally pissed up guy about a gun trade. I don't want to end up on an episode of the first 48. Plus, I had no idea what he might have done with it. I don't know wtf a ""copper brush"" is that he took to my pistol, he states he took it apart and messed with it. I don't know what he did to it. His firearm knowledge seemed very lacking as well, as he believed 7.5"" AR uppers had to be pinned and welded, so I can't seem to say I trust he may not have messed my firearm up, then caused a scene trying to get his back.I'm not meeting a guy to get a gun back he might of broken or altered and I'm liable to take the gun back due to the shady situation and location.Bottom line, I called him back, emailed, gave an option, and even offered to cover his gas and he still refuses. I'm still 100% willing to switch back, so Gerald, let me know. Thanks all!I'll also be attaching screenshots of his responses so you guys can decide for yourselves. If you'll notice, I didn't put the guys info, number, or email on it, because I'm not about putting someone on blast. I would be upset if I were in his shoes too, I understand. But I did do more than enough to try to make it right, just short of meeting him at the shooting local of House of 1,000 Corpes.EDIT 2/28/18:He reposted haha! Thanks for all the emails laughing at this dude and support. I had a guy I was trading with the last time ""sketchy guy"" posted this nonsense send me a text and tell me he was ""uneasy"" with trading with me after reading the post. I told him I totally understood, but offered to tell my side of the story as well. I sent him the screenshots and he told me he was fine with dealing with me after seeing the other guys response. Traded my Weatherby Vanguard for an FNS-9. Good trade. Awesome dude, he came in the shop and we talked for a bit. 
The dude is twice my age and acting like he's half of it. I have his name, number, address, wifes number and all sorts of other info that I could blast out if I was a lesser man, but I'm not. Point is, I've got no problem trading with any of you, and if any of you wonderful folks on Armslist wish to deal at an FFL, doesn't even have to be the one I work at, I'd be more than willing to do so! I take my reputation seriously! I've gotten about 7 or 8 responses from this post, and all but one have been positive. I appreciate the support guys. This post has made me a few new friends on here, so I guess not all is bad!Thanks and take care folks!"

The upper reciever is worth 389.00 and rail sights that are from Cabela's and the rear is 69.00 front 48.00. so almost 500.00 worth of items just for the upper reciever minus the bolt then the lower reciever with 276.00 plus butstock 89.00 over 300.00 for lower. This confirmed by an FFL dealer as a built gun built with I've 800.00 in parts and assembled by a US Marine with I've 13 years in an infantry job. Asking 475.00 obo built for the wife she wants something else built but doesn't know what yet so I can't trade. Selling for 475 because that will get her started with a weapon she wants. Same rifle listed at 575.00 I just bummed she was willing to go down $100 after I told her I could start about anything she wanted with $500.
