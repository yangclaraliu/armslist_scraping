I will only deal with current CHL holders.Transactions will be face to face locally. We can also go through my FFL or your favorite FFL, if you prefer.Suspicious inquiries are subject to being reported to the BATFE.For sale: Very nice lightly USED Bersa Thunder Semiautomatic Pistol in .380 ACP. Contrasting tones, all metal.
This is a nice example of this Italian-founded Argentinian company’s offerings, whose claim to fame are World-class competition-winning 9 mm match pistols.
Saddled with a rather goofy name [‘Bersa’ is actually an amalgam of the first names of the founding partners: mechanical engineers Benso Bonadimani, Ercole Montini and Savino Caselli.], and commonly misunderstood to be a Walther PPK copy; nevertheless, these Thunder pistols are inherently accurate and is softer shooting than a PPK.
Grip has been enhanced with a nice grey toned textured pad to enhance control and retention.Frame is alloy to make it durable yet light and be a nice, comfortable concealed carry piece.
Gun shoots very nice, has been ultra-reliable, and would make a hard to beat carry or purse gun.Comes with three 7-round magazines, soft pouch with logo, and rapid loader.
$280 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will consider ammo plus cash.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees!
__________ 
Buyer will need to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License or TX CHL, and sign a simple Bill of Sale indicating only that you showed me your current DL and or CHL. -> Nothing besides your name and the gun will be on it. I’d be more than happy to send you a sample so you can see what mine looks like.
Gun was transferred through an FFL, meaning I cleared the NICS, making both me and the gun clean.
Bill of Sale will prove you legally own it and protects you henceforth.

As it is based on a pre-1899 design and does not fire cartridge ammunition, it can ship directly to you, no FFL needed. This particular revolver is made by Uberti in Italy, with proof marks showing that it was manufactured in 1963. It was imported by Navy Arms Company which was based in New Jersey. It has all of it’s original parts with matching serial number 17. The gun is in great condition for it’s age, the action is smooth, timing and lock up is perfect. The only indication of it’s age is general and wear and tear on the finish, but this is purely cosmetic. The blueing is nearly 100% intact, just dull in some places. I bought it used for $200, so considering it’s excellent condition I hope to offer a more affordable alternative to buying a brand new one. Contact me if you are interested or have any questions. I am happy to ship it directly to your house if you buy it."

The new production walnut stock has a small modification to it, so I am also providing a complete RamLine black stock.  Included is 25 M1 8-rnd clips & 4 M1 reduced round clips.  The back story is this:  I bought a ""BM-59"" Garand at a gun show in Denver 15 years ago.  At some point I noticed the receiver had a non-repairable crack, so I bought the replacement receiver from the CMP.  When I took it to a gunsmith for fitting, I learned that the receiver needed significant modification to return back to a BM-59 with a detachable box magazine.  So I made a decision to build a new, quality rifle.  Call me if you have any questions: REDACTED.The rifle is currently on consignment with Liberty Firearms Institute in Loveland CO."

918,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7801918,For Sale:  Custom Benelli Nova Turkey & Home Defense,"Norfolk, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 600,"Listed On: Monday, January 8, 2018",Shotguns,Benelli                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This 12 gauge Benelli Nova has been a really fun project. It started out as a basic 18"" Home Defense model Nova and evolved into an amazing hybrid. It has the following items performed or added:- 18.5"" Carlson's barrel with screw-in choke- Extra tall LPA front sight professionally installed by the Revolver Armorer- Forcing cone extended by Rob Roberts Gun Works- Carlson's 0.650"" extended turkey choke- Trigger lightened and polished by Rob Roberts Gun Works- Nordic low-drag follower- Wolff OEM-length magazine tube spring (1 year old)- Nordic +2 magazine tube extension with spring (for Home Defense use outside of turkey season)- Picatinny rail- Limbsaver Airtech recoil pad- Stippled handgrip and forestock- Mossy Oak Graphics wrap in Obsession camouflage patternI painstakingly experimented with 6 chokes and 8 different loads to accomplish this gun's pattern, which yields 188 pellets in a 12"" circle at 40 yards, using 3.5"" Winchester Long Beard XR #6 shot shells. Despite the overhyped claims of manufacturers and anonymous internet turkey slayers that you'll never meet, achieving such a pattern is not instantaneous or cheap. It's even more challenging with an 18.5"" barrel. And no, you don't lose velocity with an 18.5"" barrel. That is a misnomer created by people with little experience and incorrectly assuming shot shell ballistics mimic bullet ballisitics. I've shot the same exact brand and size shot shells using the same exact receiver and 2 different barrels (this 18.5"" barrel and a 26"" barrel) through my chronograph. If there was a difference in velocity, it was hidden in the averaging spread of 3 shells in each barrel. Shotguns use fast powders that have combusted and finished expanding gases in the first 16"" of travel.At 20 yards, this gun puts 90% of the pellets in a 5"" pattern, with a ragged 2"" gaping hole in the center (no halo)At 30 yards, it puts 90% of the pellets in a 10"" pattern, with almost 50% of them in the center 6""At 40 yards, it evenly spreads 90% of the pellets in a 16"" circleI have target pics of this gun in each of these distances if you're interested. To be honest, however, I personally wouldn't shoot #6 size shot beyond 30 yards with any gun. The only birds I've ever witnessed having to be tracked were extended ranges using #6 shot It's my personal opinion that the smaller mass of the pellets just can't maintain enough velocity to ensure instantly effective penatration out that far.When it's not turkey season, I install the open choke tube and +2 mag tube extension for Home Defense use. The adjustable LPA rear ghost sight's POA has been adjusted for 2.75"" 00 Buck.This is NOT a $399, off-the-shelf Benelli Nova. There are plenty of those at the gun shops. If you're looking for a low-cost Nova, you can get them for $350 to $300 on sale or used. If you are looking for low-budget shotgun, this is not the gun for you. I've invested almost $1500 into ensuring this gun is accurate, patterns great, and feels precise while ensuring reliability and confidence. The only blemishes that I can point out are a couple of gouges in the graphic wrap where it got hung up on thick brush.If you are interested, I can meet yout at a local indoor shooting range that has 22 yard lanes and you can witness me fire it and present the pattern on paper. Sorry, but you cannot fire it unless you sign a bill of sale, put $600 in my hand and bring your own ammo. You're already getting twice the gun Bass Pro offers for half the price, not to mention proof of performance. Free gun rental is not in the offer.  I'm almost giving this gun away at a price point that is a no-brainer for someone who knows what they want and know what this is. The price of $600 is EXTREMELY FIRM. If you feel the need to negotiate, we can start at $750 and I'll let you talk me down to $600. For purchase, you'll need a Virginia state driver's license or a military ID with your our of state driver's license."
