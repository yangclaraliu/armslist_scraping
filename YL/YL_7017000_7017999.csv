The IC-A5 is the latest model in the IC – Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and the longer 12” SPR style rail system on the same rifle. We listened- the IC-A5 is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of our longer modular rail system. The upper rail section on the IC-A5 is an aesthetically pleasing special cutback version which allows us to use the low profile gas block and at the same time keep the full 12” modular rails available on the sides and bottom of the hand guards. This IC-A5 brings together features of both the IC Enhanced and the IC-SPR in one package. Like all IC models the IC-A5 is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5. LWRCI™ Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard. Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. Our IC-A5 uses LWRCI™ manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter. The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity. The LWRCI™ IC-A5 comes complete with, LWRCI Skirmish™ Back Up Iron Sights, Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCI™ Adjustable Compact Stock, Magpul® MOE+ Grip and LWRCI™ High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider. IC-A5- the Individual Carbine – impressively improved- showing that, at times, evolution can be accelerated."

I will not be able to add cash to a deal but I have several other items I can add if you're interested as well.The rifle is a 5.56 chambered Diamondback AR which I bought brand new last year (still with the original box/paperwork). Currently the rifle has a free float mid-length quad rail handguard, low-profile gas block, oversized charging handle latch, M16 profile bolt carrier with an MPI bolt, Magpul grip, Minimalist stock, MFT foregrip, and includes the original 30-round magazine plus two 40-round P-Mags. I will include the original box and paperwork if you want it.For the rifle alone (as listed above) I am asking $500 OBO. I can include 200 rounds of .223 brass ammunition for a bit more.It currently has a (brand new) Vortex Strikefire II with a cantilever mount that can include for another $125 OBO. I will include the box and paperwork for this as well. It went straight from the box to the AR to the safe. Never sighted it in because I've not shot the rifle.The other items I have include:-YHM TJ Competition mid-length handguard +$60
-Bushnell Holosight (original EOTech holographic sight) compact model with half inch riser and new N cell batteries +$300Also tools (multi-tool wrench, upper vise block, and torque wrench) and some factory grips & stock. $=VariousAll prices are OBO and negotiable. Let me know what you are interested in and we can work something out. I'm reasonable, so just shoot me an offer or ask questions but please no low-ball offers or asking me to ship. I only do face to face transactions to mitigate risk. Everything on the rifle is brand new, never left the house or been shot, and is in perfect condition. The only ""used"" items are the YHM handguard and Holosight.I would be willing to let the whole lot go for $880 which is a steal if you consider what you're getting. I also have a Kimber Ultra Ten II listed which could be combined with anything posted here for a trade deal. My top choice for a trade is an FN Five-seveN but I will hear any offers. By contacting me, you agree that you are legally able to own this firearm and that you are willing to meet in a public setting and sign a bill of sale."

As the numbers on the gun show it eventually ended up in German hands and then into a U.S. soldiers hands in Belgium. I'm not totally sure about the crossed out numbers (an army unit number(German) maybe)? The grips are correct original wood and the finish around 90%.  I believe this was a pistol from a captured soldier and one that was stuck in a soldiers boot then brought them back to the US. These CZ24s were used by the Germans but (maybe 1200) were manf. and marked for the German army. The holster I don't think was made for this pistol but correct for that time period.  The gun needs a spring or somthing of that nature as it was removed to be sold as a collectable.

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:Manual thumb safetyGrip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firingFiring pin blockEach UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard."
