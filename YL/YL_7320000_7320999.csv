I'm looking for it more as a secondary range pistol to teach my wife and son.  I am posting I want to buy section to weed out the scammers. I am fairly knowledgeable about firearms.  And I know a lot about Sig Sauers. So don't come to me (like the last guy did) trying to sell a standard P226 for $850, That has some serious wear to it.  And then try to tell me that the original price was $1500 bc of all the mods you had done to it, In an attempt to convince me it's a bargain (this has happened more than once). A P226 sells for $900 in the store.  So one that is seven years old and has the finish beat to hell  should be nowhere near $850.  So if you're not serious and reasonable please don't contact me. thank you"

Comparable over/under shotguns sell for at least twice as much and often much more.  This is a steal at the current price when considering the fact it is nearly new and in great condition.  These sell for $1100, $1200 or more plus tax, which you avoid saving another $100+.I am the original owner and have owned this gun for nearly 2-years.  I recently aquired two additional over/unders and no longer need this shotgun.  It is a great gun with many features found only on shotguns costing at least 2-3 times as much.  I really like the adjustable comb on this gun.  The refinished stock looks very nice and I’ll update pictures in the near future once I have had a chance to take some decent pictures.  This shotgun has been well cared for and cleaned after each outing. In terms of usage, I would guess that I have taken this shotgun out befween 5-10 times and it has had somewhere between 250-400 shells put through it.Not interested in trades at this time."

I've owned it for several years now and just don't shoot it as often as I expected to. It's in really good shape and comes with a mounted and zeroed Bushnell Sportview 4x scope, hammer extension, and about 80 rounds of new PPU 45gr. soft-point ammo. The rifle originally had a very rough, gritty trigger that broke around 12 pounds! It's been reworked to break clean and smooth at around four pounds. The rifle also came with a very thick rubber recoil pad, like you'd find on a shotgun or heavy rifle, and this made the stock entirely too long. I removed that and replaced it with the thinner copper buttplate you can see in the photo. $350 or best offer and all trades considered, both up and down.

In all my years of travel and dealing with the Colt Snake Guns this is only the 2nd set of complete Legacies I have seen together with the same number from within the set these being #747. These all 3 remains unfired and in excellent condition. The Titanium Pearl Rattlesnake is the rarest of the trio with only approximately 250 pieces being produced with that finish. The Anaconda also wears the Titanium Pearl finish with gold accents. The King Cobra wears the all gold finish with black accents inside the lettering and roll stamps. All 3 weapons wear the correct original grips that show the American Historical Foundation medallions which were specific to this line-up. Included with this are the factory original boxes for the Rattlesnake and King Cobra with the Anaconda having the original plastic case but no outer slip cover. A custom glass display case is also included that holds all 3 firearms with a beautiful red background. There is a wooden plaque attached to show each of the models as well as the #747 with each. A very rare opportunity to obtain not one but all 3 of the Legacies in one fell swoop.

Some small marks on the wood.Made between 1955 and 1973, discontinued because of the high manufacturing costs. This is a unique rifle is a lever action with a rotating, locking lug as in a bolt action, and instead of just the lever cycling the action between rounds, so that you have to reacquire the trigger, this action keeps your finger on the trigger and cycles the whole action. Very unique.....very fast.....very accurate. I don't hunt anymore so this is just a dust catcher for me. A great investment for a young hunter wishing to add a very unique and collectable gun to his collection."

Made from vacuum heat-treated and sub-zero quenched Japanese 8A stainless steel and hollow ground to a thin, razor sharp edge, they will cleave through just about any obstacle or target in their path. Made practical and tactical they offer non-reflective bead blasted blades, non slip high friction G-10 handles, abbreviated steel liners and our incomparable Tri-Ad Lock. Designed by Andrew Demko, the Tri-Ad is unsurpassed in resisting positive pressure from the edge (cutting, slashing and chopping), negative pressure from the point (piercing, digging and chiseling), and impact pressure (whacks on the back of the spine of the blade) by diverting these forces first to its unique stop pin and then throughout the entire handle frame. Get 90% of the strength with no sacrifice in cutting power and save big bucks. At first thought, carrying a pocket sword as big and heavy as the Espada may seem impractical. However, after much experimentation, this is not the case. Even the biggest model can be carried discreetly and unobtrusively in the front pocket of most pants and when clipped to the waistband and covered by a bloused shirt or sweater they totally disappear.

These are not exaclty rare but there are not a ton of them out there and in good shape (they are almost 80 years old!).  The kit itself is complete and ready to be built into a post-sample or a semi-auto. The parts are in very good shape and have no pitting at all. This kit is NON-MATCHING, as almost all the kits are these days. The barrel is in pristine shape with crisp rifling, the bolt is in great shape with ZERO pitting or damage, the lower is in great shape (no pitting) and the bakelite is in awesome condition, but the stock is a little wobbly (very common with these guns). Basically all the ""wear and tear"" parts are in very good condition. I also have several magizines that are all Nazi German marked and period. I am asking $3,000 for the kit. I am open to trades for high end-hand guns (Desert Eagle, HK P7, Coonan .357, high end 1911's). I am NOT looking to ship or deal with anyone who is not local (hence me posting here as opposed to Gunbroker, Subguns or Sturmgewehr.com, etc.)If you are a serous buyer, please send me pictires of your trade item and what you are looking to get for them. I am being more than reasonable in terms of price (one kit just sold on GB for $2,700 with no barrel assembly or mags) so please be reasonable with your trade value. IF your gun sells for $1,000 brand new I am not going to value your ""used gun"" at $1,000. Thanks, Chris"
