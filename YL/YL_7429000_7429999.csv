Chambered in .303 British, this is a special Enfield No4 Mk1 considering the Long Branch is arguably the best made Enfield and second to the Savage as most rare. It is also all numbers matching except the magazine. It has not been through FTR or been re-Arsenaled. This one has the rare cocking piece, the most desirable mini flip up sight, perfect condition walnut stock with a polished brass butt plate. Shiny barrel with strong grooves guages as a 2 on my Garand gauge. Very tight barrel. The walnut hand guards has all proper markings. Includes sling, bayonet and scabbard. Overall a really nice Long Branch that’s ten times better than what Classic Firearms was selling a month ago for $725 before shipping and dealer fees.I will meet local, ship to your FFL or ship direct to your house (legally) if you are in North Carolina at your cost.If this ad is up it is still for sale.call or text only REDACTEDbest offer"

I bought it for my Saiga .308, but since it has a different style trigger than all the other calibers (of course, ugh!) it won’t work for me. Also selling a few magazines for a 7.62x39 Saiga. These particular magazines started out as regular AK mags, but were modified to work in a Saiga without installing a bullet guide. Metal was welded in over the front locking tab, to recreate a built-in bullet guide, which prevents the rounds from slamming into the side of the chamber—which is what would happen if you used standard AK mags in an out-of-the-box Saiga. The AK/Saiga mags still lock in a regular AK, but unsure if they would still function or not—though it appears they would, I cannot guarantee it. I do however guarantee the mags to function flawlessly in unconverted Saiga’s. As you probably have heard a dozen times, it is very likely (especially with bipartisan support) that these stocks will be banned shortly. These have been banned from sales, or are out of stock everywhere online.....get them while you still can!!asking $550 for the stock and magazines, and will certainly consider trades of equal or better value."
