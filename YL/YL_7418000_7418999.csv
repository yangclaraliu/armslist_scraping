I'm game for most firearms that are worth a damn, so if you've got something that you think is a good trade, I'd like to know about it.
 Bike has been sitting for about a year.  It was running fine, with the only issues that I know of being that it's missing the right side cover, the starter was tempermental (it has a kick starter that works perfectly, so I never bothered with the electric start) and the tach cable leaks a drip of oil every now and then onto the headers.  At this point, I'd say it'll need the carbs cleaned, an oil change, and probably a new battery and rear tire.  The mileage is not high, considering the year.  My plan was to make it into a cafe racer, but I just never had the time to dedicate to the project, and I pretty much just stopped riding for no particular reason other than I'm always busy.  Not really interested in AR15s or anything Kel-Tec, Taurus, Charter, or the like...  thanks for looking!"
