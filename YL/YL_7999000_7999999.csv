With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide.The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe.The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13.Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users.Features:• Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life• Fluted chamber aids in extraction• All steel construction• Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator• Fixed barrel ensures accuracy• Trigger guard heatshield• Ambidextrous magazine release• Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function• Blued finishHK Package Includes:- HK P7M13 9mm Pistol- Date Code: 1H (1987)- Hk Factory Manual- HK Factory Carbon Scraper- 6 HK P7M13 9mm 13 Round magazines-hard carry case-Holster"

I swapped the upper receiver only (just the stripped receiver itself) to a brand new Vltor MUR-1A (Forward Assist) primarily because I had a new one laying around and figured it might add to the accuracy of the rifle.... The VLTOR is more rigid and about twice as expensive .... The rifle has roughly 100-200rds on it and shoots excellent! If I did my part its sub MOA consistently with match ammo (69g FGMM seemed to be its favorite)Specs:Custom forged lower receiver for unique lookMelonite QPQ 16 1/8-inch barrel with 5R rifling223 Wylde target chamber for use with 223 Rem. or 5.56x45mmBLACKHAWK! trigger with Nickel Boron treatmentMid-length gas systemFree-float M-LOK® handguardBLACKHAWK!

So I’m going to sell two of them because I’m getting older and really don’t plan to hunt buffalo, elephants, or wildabeast (not that I ever did). I’m going to sell which ever two sell first and keep the last one. I’m not partial to any though as they all have pros and cons. If interested, shoot me a note and I will pull them out of the safe and take a few pics. This is is what I remember is in there:Browning A Bolt Stainless Stalker in .270 Win with the BOSS. It has the black composite stock and think it has a Leupold stainless scope, and I’m pretty sure it’s a Vari X III 3.5X10.  It has a short barrel (26” maybe)?Browning Stainless Stalker in 7MM Mag. This also has a Leupold scope but I think it is black matte, and also the black composite stock. Again can’t remember exactly but I think it’s a 50MM Vari XIII 3.5X10 EFR. This has a longer barrel (maybe 30”)?Winchester Model 70 in 300 Win Mag with a beautiful wood stock. This thing looks like it’s never been in the field. It has a Vortex Diamondback 16X42 if I remember right. I’ve never taken this in the field but it was used when I purchased it. But it’s a honey!  Longer barrel on this also but I don’t think it has a scratch!Again all three of these are left handed and while I haven’t priced them in the Blue Book yet, I doubt any of them will bring less than $1K so don’t think you are going to steal them. They aren’t eating anything sitting in my safe, I just need to start liquidating down to the 5-10 guns that I need/want to keep. If the ad is still up they are still for sale. I’m going to upload some pics of the Winchester because I have them handy. I think it only shows the rings though, not the scope. Can take pics of others though, just let me know if interested.I have other left handed guns, let me know if interested in other rifles/shotguns."

Winchester) You also get a gorgeous set of Tigerwood grips along with the original Hogue rubber grips. The cost of the ammunition alone is more than $200, the grips, another $75. We paid $1400 plus tax for the firearm alone. MSRP is $1619. Smith and Wesson's Performance Center handguns are renowned for their workmanship and come with a lifetime guarantee. When you add it all up $1200 is a very good price for this firearm. You won't find it anywhere on the internet at a lower price. The price is firm and we will complete the transaction at a local gun shop at my expense. That is for your security and my own. This is very serious firearm and it's value will only increase over time. It's highly unlikely that there any trades I might find attractive but you never know."
