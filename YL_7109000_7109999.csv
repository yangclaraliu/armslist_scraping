I purchased the Glock 19 MOS a few weeks back and then did a ton of upgrades to compete with it. There is well over $1100 total in this Glock. This is for a serious buyer and not some first or second timer looking for a cheap deal.Here is a breakdown-Glock 19 MOS Gen 4 OD green -Ghost trigger connect 3.5 pound-Extended Slide Release-Silencer Co Threaded barrel-Vortex venom RMR 3 MOA-Taran Tactical +5 extended mag plate- 3 total magazines = 2, 15 rounders and 1 extened taran-You will also get all factory Glock parts too including the factory barrel and trigger parts. This is the MOS version and comes with original RMR cut plate from Glock along with 4 more plates for various RMR fits. If you went and purchased all exact equipment in a retail gun store you would pay over $1100 plus tax almost $1200. Buying from me you are paying $200 less and no tax also no chasing parts down. The work is already done. This is a package deal and will not part out ...NO!! exceptions. Must show me a valid Arizona Dl or CCW and sign a bill of sale. Price is $1000.00 no tax NO trades, pleaseOffering a $50 discount to a CCW holder. No that doesn't mean I'll offer it to everyone I offer the discount to take stress off me knowing its going to a CCW holder. I am no hurry to sell this and price is pretty firm. If you know firearms you know this is already an incredible deal at $1000.00 no tax for a pretty much complete competition package."

This is a reissue of the original SD9 before the VE model came out, it has the black Armornite coating on the slide and barrel. S&W even polished the feed ramp. I've installed the Apex Tactial spring kit to lighten the trigger pull and just installed an M&P steel rear sight to get rid of the crappy plastic sight, all steel 3 dot sights now! Have factory box, all paperwork, warranty hasn't even been filled out! 2 16 round stainless mags, they still have the factory grease mark S&W puts on the follower.Bought it the end of June to use for my ccw when I get my license in a few weeks but went with a slimmer single action 9mm instead. Paid $370 for it when I ordered it at my gun shop, no low ballers, and I don't care what your gun guy gets it for OTD.Price is firm, feel free to offer a trade, I'm really interested in the following:Low end 1911s like ATI, Citadel, Rock Island, Charles Daly, etc.EAA/Tanfoglio, Canik/Tri-Star CZ CloneTaurus PT92/99 or PT917, even a PT1911Canik TP9.30-30 lever actionsFEG Hi Power Clone is at the top of the list too.No bows, black powder, .22s, or shot guns though!Located in SapulpaText ONLY REDACTED"

If you reply asking if I still have it I will not reply back. I WILL NOT DELIVER!
$650.00 - I am selling my overflow safe, I no longer need it and am going to be moving in a few months – want to go ahead and sell it now rather than pay extra to have it moved.
It is a Cannon Safari 48 Gun Safe. 40” wide, 24” deep and 58.5” Tall. Weighs around 625-650 pounds. Cannon does not make the Safari Series any longer, the closest I have found is the Shield Series which does not have the accessories/pistol/rifle holder built into the door. The door has a place for pistols, a rifle, 2 accessories pockets and a pocket for paperwork. The shelves on the right side can be removed for more long rifle storage.
You will need to bring a truck/trailer, blankets, straps, appliance dolly and a few people to help you load the safe. I will get it to the front door of my downstairs apartment which is near Wethimer and Wilcrest (West Houston). There is about a 4” drop from my apartment to the front patio and about a 6” curb drop, other than that fairly easy to move.

This shoots really well and have never had any issues regardless of the ammo used. The piston on these is self regulating and does a great job doing so.
