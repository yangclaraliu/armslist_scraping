The factory magazine from the Glock 21, with a capacity of 13 rounds, will function in the Glock 30.  In fact all the larger .45ACP Glock doublestack mags that work in a Glock 21 will also fit this pistol. 
This was my brother's everyday carry gun for awhile, I don't know when he bought it and I'm not sure what generation it is, since it's got an accessory rail but no finger grooves; it was probably purchased in the early 2000s and I'm assuming it's got about a thousand rounds through it.  After I inherited it I did a detail strip and clean, 25 cent trigger job (did not polish the feed ramp), and replaced all the springs since I didn't know exactly how old it is or how many rounds it's had run through.  Shoots great, I passed my concealed carry range test with it, suprisingly accurate for the barrel length.  Recoil is noticeable.  Great condition, great bore, minor holster wear.
Currently has a hogue handall universal rubber grip; comes with 1 9rnd mag (flush with bottom of grip - less printing for concealed carry), 3 10rnd mags, factory box with manual and brush, and a Badger LH kydex IWB holster and single mag carrier; also has working night sights.
$400 cash.  Buyer must comply with all applicable laws.  NO TRADES - CASH ONLY - IN TOWN/LOCAL/FACE TO FACE SALES ONLY - NO SHIPPING.

For those who are unfamiliar, this is essentially the same gun as a Beretta 92, except with a cut-down 4"" barrel that's basically flush with the end of the slide; the ""CS"" stands for ""Compact Stainless.""  I also have a real Beretta M9 that I'm selling, and while the Beretta might be slightly more accurate (it's actually equal to the most accurate pistol I've ever shot) the Taurus is smoother with a slicker action and trigger.

More info from Taurus:  http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=131&category=Pistol
""In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.""
For more info check out some of the awesome reviews online like this one:  http://www.christiangunowner.com/tauruspt917.html
Comes with factory box, two factory mags, one 17rnd and one 19rnd, user manual, and brush.  Don't miss your chance to own one of these fine pistols; they are evidently discontinued by Taurus for unknown reasons, all the information I can find online just shows that those who have been lucky enough to own one of these have consistently found out how awesome they are.  Some people are using them for concealed carry since they're a little smaller and lighter than a fullsize Beretta 92 (or the Taurus PT 92 which is the Taurus fullsize version.)

It is an Ishapore 2A1 and comes with a canvas sling, a reproduction P1937 Web Canvas Carry Case with additional sling, a period correct cleaning kit, and a NATO bandolier full of 7.62 NATO stripper clips, which work great with this rifle. For those unfamiliar, the Ishapore is essentially a British Short Magazine Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rechambered for the 7.62x51 NATO cartridge (.308 Winchester), and produced in India by the Rifle Factory Ishapore.
The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force (other than specialized sniper rifles); this is the newest bolt action military rifle you can get. They kept making these well into the 70s and its been said that the factory may have been continuing slowly assembling more of them from spare parts even up till the early 80s. This particular rifle is dated 1967 and is in great shape with its original 10rd magazine. It has a very nice clean bore with the strongest rifling I have ever seen in an ex-military rifle.
 
The original black painted military finish, which was in poor shape, was blasted off and all metal (except some of the bolt) was professionally Cerakoted by Kentucky Gun Coatings in a semi-gloss black that matches what the original finish looked like; the rifle is now impervious to rust and needs no oil or other protection from moisture.  The uncoated portions of the bolt have been lightly polished as much as possible without removing any material, so some of the deeper machining marks remain (these guns came with a pretty rough finish from the factory.)  The original black painted wood finish was chemically stripped and the stock has been refinished with a modern ebony stain to match the original color, and a poly topcoat for added protection and durability.  The stock was sanded very lightly and no material was removed, preserving a few dents and dings and the original character of the rifle including what I'm assuming is a factory cartouche on the buttstock.
The end result is a rifle in original configuration and appearance yet with the modern finishes of utmost durability and resistance to degradation.  It is a dream to shoot, the trigger has been lightly polished (again, removing no material, so machining marks remain) and is a smooth, yet heavy, military style two-stage.  I've also replaced the original (Cerakoted) rear sight with a Mojo Micro-click aperture sight, which makes it much easier to shoot at distance; the original sight comes with the rifle and is easily re-installed.  I will additionally include some of the original springs that have been replaced and a firing pin removal tool.
$450 OBO.  Buyer must comply with all applicable laws.  NO TRADES - CASH ONLY - IN TOWN/LOCAL/FACE TO FACE SALES ONLY - NO SHIPPING.
I can meet at your choice of local gun store or parking lot of local law enforcement agency for inspection of firearm. 
If you're still interested, here's a little more reading on the Ishapore 2A/2A1 from wikipedia:
The Rifle 7.62mm 2A/2A1 (also known as the Ishapore 2A/2A1) is a 7.62mm NATO (7.62x51) calibre bolt-action rifle adopted as a reserve arm by the Indian military in 1963. The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board in India, soon after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.
The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force other than specialized sniper rifles. Due to fluctuating supplies of affordable .303 British ammunition, the Ishapore rifles are becoming increasingly popular with civilian shooters and collectors in Australia, United Kingdom and the United States.
Externally the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifle was based upon (and is almost identical to) the .303 British calibre SMLE Mk III* rifle, with the exception of the distinctive â€œsquareâ€ (10 or 12 round) magazine. The rifle was designed to allow the British Pattern 1907 (P'07) sword bayonet to be attached. There were other differences to the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifles that include the use of improved steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62mm NATO round), and a redesigned extractor to cope with the rimless round. Production of these rifles started in early 1960s and is believed to have been discontinued in 1975. The original (2A) design incorporated the Lee-Enfield rear sight which had metric graduations out to 2000 meters. The re-designated ""Rifle 7.62mm 2A1"" incorporated a more realistic 800 meter rear sight. The stock is recycled from the No. 1 Mk. III armory stock, with the addition of a cross screw forward of the magazine well. Some stocks were salvaged from existing surplus and show artificer repairs where rotted or damaged wood has been replaced, this is especially evident with the recoil draws that often fail over time due to the rifle being rack stored butt down / muzzle up that allows oils and grease to migrate downwards into this critical area.
The Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as "".308 conversions"". In fact, the 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles: they were designed and built right from the outset to fire 7.62mm NATO ammunition."

It was the standard issue rifle of the Swiss armed forces from 1933 until 1958 though examples remained in service into the 1970s. It has a 6-round removable magazine, and is chambered for the 7.5×55mm Swiss Gewehrpatrone 1911 or GP 11, a cartridge with ballistic qualities similar to the 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester cartridge. Each rifle included a 6-round detachable box magazine with matching stamped serial number. A charger was used to load the magazine from the top of the receiver.
Having been imported and sold in the United States for many years now, this rifle has become increasingly popular, and the supply of Schmidt Rubin K31 rifles is dwindling fast. The price is rising to reflect that fact, and year by year, the average price of a K31 in good condition has gone up. It remains one of the more desirable military surplus rifles of the period.
SPECIFICATIONS:Barrel Length – 25.65 inches: 4-groove, RH, concentric rifling, 1 in 10.63Overall Length – 43.6 inchesWeight – 8.85lbs emptyAction – Straight Pull Bolt ActionCaliber – 7.5×55 Swiss (GP11)Capacity – 6 round detachable box magazineSights – Tangent-leaf sight graduated to 1500mTotal Production – 528,230
This particular example is all original. Mechanically very good. Typical wear on stock – I’ve read the Swiss troops used the butt of the gun to scrape snow off their boots at parade rest, explaining the heavy wear (""beaver chew"") these rifles typical exhibit in that area, which this one has.  The original oiled finish on the wood (I believe this is a beech stock) long since degraded and this rifle has been chemically stripped and coated with a polyurethane clearcoat to preserve the wood itself while still preserving the original appearance – no wood was sanded or altered or removed.  Correspondingly, the metal has been Cerakoted professionally, by Kentucky Gun Coatings, for a durable, rustproof finish, retaining all original markings.  Bright, shiny bore with well-defined rifling. Matching serial numbers on magazine, receiver, bolt, and barrel.  Original troop identification tag under the buttstock.  Comes with two reproduction plastic charger clips that works great, and two scope mounts: a clamp-on receiver mount that I prefer but prevents use of the charging clip, and an Insta-mount that replaces the rear sight for use with a scout (long eye relief) scope. 
$450 OBO.  Buyer must comply with all applicable laws.  NO TRADES - CASH ONLY - IN TOWN/LOCAL/FACE TO FACE SALES ONLY - NO SHIPPING.

The base is 1/4"" thick steel with mounting holes to bolt it to your bench. It has a totally sealed 220v 2hp motor with a KB Electronics KBAC-27D speed controller running it. This controller is the same one everyone uses for belt grinders as it is sealed so no metal dust can get inside. I also installed the optional on and off switch for it. It has Aluminum wheels with a 4"" drive wheel and the top post is spring loaded, so just push down on the 8 ball and load your belt on, takes a few seconds. It has a Pyroceram glass platen which is top of the line and is perfect for very flat grinding. There is an adjustable tool rest that mounts in the bottom opening, this grinder will use any attachments you can find on Ebay or anywhere else as well. Powdercoated Green and Black so its more durable than painting. Runs on 220V and uses standard 2"" x 72"" belts you can get anywhere. Ill throw in a couple of belts so you can take it home and start grinding right away as you wont need anything else.  $1500 picked up in Zebulon in the evenings. I would be interested in trading but no .40, 10mm, AR's or shotguns."

– Seekins billet upper and lower
– Noveske hand guard
– JP Rifle barrel
– Gieselle trigger
– Radian Raptor ambi charging handle
– ATI stock
– GG&G Bipod
– Precision Armament muzzle break
– X2 Scorpion Recoil pistol grip
– All the other parts to finish out an AR.
The stock and pistol grip have a type of Bill of Rights pattern applied called ‘We the People’  The barrel/muzzle break when cold has the typical matte black look but when it gets heated up, it turns into the American flag.  I’ll post a photo showing a before and after but I do have a video of the color change happening that I can send if requested.  It’s the only one I have ever done and it pretty bad *** when you see it.
I have only shot about 175 rounds through the gun and all were hand loads I worked up.  No production rounds at all.  Have taken a course on long distant shots and have hit targets consistently and reliably out to 1,000 yards.  Only selling this rifle because I need to get a little more cash for a house we are currently under contract on.
I have an SKB i-series hard case with foam cutout for the rifle that will be included in the sale.  Fits rifle perfectly with collapsed stock, no parts need to be removed.
Once again, THE SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PRICE!  The scope alone cost me $2,500.  Will consider selling it but price would jump up accordingly.
Call or text with any questions."

Chambered in 308, this is an absolutely unbelievable battle rifle. I bought this last fall here locally and I've absolutely love this rifle. So much so that I've bought multiple others.  This rifle has seen only about 75 to 85 rounds and it's been stored in a climate control and humidity control safe. It comes with the original box all manuals and two FDE SCAR proprietary mags. Both mags have been completely unused and I are in pristine condition. The only modification that I currently have on this rifle is a G&G QD Mount that I have added to the rear of the receiver. The only cosmetic blemish on this rifle is on the barrel where I had to use a barrel clamp in a vise to remove the muzzle break. It's a very slight blemish and can be Duracoated rather easily.  I am not really that interested in trades but  but send me what you've got.  It will have to heavily be in my favor, and if your inquiry is a joke I probably won't respond.  I don't need to sell this but I'm floating this out there to see the interest. I paid $3500 + tax for this rifle back in October and I am calling the trade value on the rifle $3500 because of the modification and extra $65 magazine If you have any questions on this or would like to see more pictures just message me through this post. Thanks for looking.  I would be willing to trade for a black NIB or very lightly used with very low round count black SCAR 17.Just a note.  This rifle shoots easily shoots sub MOA with good ammo, and I had some 168 grain Hornady ammo shooting 5/8"" groups at 100 yards.  Last November I harvested a large 8 point buck from 120 yards and hit him right in the heart and he dropped where I shot him.  This would make an amazing hunting or life and liberty rifle.This rifle is for local sale only, it will be a face to face meeting at a local Springfield location.  I'm sorry but I won't  ship this rifle, even if you are a police officer from Massachusetts.  There is just too much scamming on Armslist.  Thanks for your understanding."

It is not for shooting, so it doesn't have to actually function, but being able to shoot would be a bonus. The gun is needed for a project on providing custom components for the Mini-14/30 that are 3D Printed or CAD-CAM Milled, and other possible modifications. The only real requirement is that the bolt still cycles by hand, the gas-system is not corroded into a solid mass, the barrel still has recognizable rifling in it (Lands/Grooves still visible - and barrel fairly straight... We can make a non-functioning mock-up barrel pretty easily if needed, just to stand in for measurement purposes). And lastly that the receiver is not cracked, or otherwise broken/flawed structurally (it can have dings, scratches, and maybe a bit of surface rust). 
 
But broken springs, cracked stock(s), non-working ejector, or extractor (or non-existent ejector or extractor), broken firing pins (or non-existent), missing hand-guard, rusted barrel, broken operating rod, broken/missing trigger assembly, .... Or non-functional gas system.... Those are OK, as long as the parts are recognizable (and mostly/kinda there).
 
Not really looking to buy Out-of-State, but might consider buying from Out-of-State for the right offer.
 
And the price listed is just a ""Wild Guess,"" and would be willing to offer more for a functioning beater, or less for a gun that was in really, really bad shape, but still met the basic requirements (would need to see photos, and possibly in-person inspection, if in any of Texas' major cities to the East of Frederickburg (or in that general ""Hill Country"" area)."

The shotgun is is good-very good condition. I would estimate 95%-98% bluing. No rust. This shotgun has been cared for very well. This model features a 28"" barrel with full ribbing. The sight is a bead sight. I believe the furniture is walnut. Shotgun also uses the winchoke system and currently has a modified choke installed. Action is smooth as butter and it's an overall solid shotgun. Since it's been in my possession, it has had less than 300 rounds put through it. I used it for sporting clays and it would reliably break each clay without fail. A bit of history on the shotgun: Before it came into my hands, this shotgun was a hunting shotgun used by an older fellow. It rarely left the safe and was well maintained when it was in his possession. Pictured with the shotgun are some extras. Extras pictured are a boresnake and spare barrel nut ring. Also included (but not pictured) is the magazine limiter plug. This is a very fine shotgun and you won't find many in this nice of shape on the market. Please contact me with any questions that you might have. I am also open to reasonable offers as well."
