They nothing to special but i like the older wood grain hunting rifle style rifles. 

first in order of rarity is the m1a non socom rifle. these are pretty plentiful but haven't found a good Springfield close by private. 

second is a norinco hunter AK in 7.62x39 of course. These a little scarce it seems, but i rather do like the look of these compared to a regular AK. 

third is the valmet .308 m88 rifle. This is the rarest of the few ive been looking for. the simple design an ak'ish looks with high cal .308 rounds makes this something id love to own. Its almost like the big bro to the norinco hunter.

Barrel length: 575 mm
Weight: 3.7 kg empty
Magazine capacity: 5 rounds

French army was among the first to adopt the smokeless rifle ammunition in the form of 8mm Lebel cartridge in 1886. By the early 1920s this rimmed cartridge became obsolete, so French began to develop a more modern, rimless cartridge, more suitable for proposed lightweight machine guns. By the 1924 French army had the new 7.5mm cartridge, but this proved to be unsuccessful, and by the 1929 the updated version of the 7.5mm ammunition has been adopted as 7.5mm Cartouche Mle.1929C (7.5x54mm). By the same time, French also developed a lightweight machinegun, the MAC 1929. Initially, French tried to convert earlier 8mm Berthier rifles for new ammunition, but it was apparent that the new rifle is desirable for French infantry. In 1936 French military officially adopted the MAS Mle.1936 (MAS-36) bolt-action rifle, developed by the Manufacture D'Armes de Saint-Etienne. Later on, French forces adopted the modified paratrooper's version, known as MAS-36 CR 39. This version differed from basic rifle by the aluminum buttstock, which can be folded down and under the forend. This rifle served with French armed forces until the semi-automatic MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 replaced it in service during 1950s and 1960s. The MAS-36 rifle was in production up until the mid-1950s. The MAS-36 action also served as a platform for FR F-1 and FR F-2 sniper rifles, which are still in service with French Armed forces. Since 1951, some of MAS-36 rifles were converted or made into MAS-36/51 pattern, by adding the permanently attached grenade launchers and rifle grenade sights. Grenade launcher was attached to the muzzle of the gun, and was used to launch rifle grenades using special blank ammunition. Folding grenade sight was attached to the left side of the front sight base.

MAS-36 is a manually operated, magazine fed, rotating bolt action rifle. The rotating bolt has two opposing lugs, located at the rear of the bolt body. The bolt locks into receiver walls, the bolt handle is located at the rear of the bolt, and is bent forward for more comfortable operation. The square-shaped receiver is machined from steel, and contained integral magazine. Magazine is loaded using charging clips or single rounds, with clip guides machined into the receiver bridge. The wooden stock is made from two parts (buttstock and forend), both connected to the uncovered receiver. The spike-shaped bayonet is stored in the tube below the barrel in reversed position, when not in use. Diopter rear sight is located at the rear of the receiver, and marked from 100 to 1 200 meters in 100 meters increments.

French army was among the first to adopt the smokeless rifle ammunition in the form of 8mm Lebel cartridge in 1886. By the early 1920s this rimmed cartridge became obsolete, so French began to develop a more modern, rimless cartridge, more suitable for proposed lightweight machine guns. By the 1924 French army had the new 7.5mm cartridge, but this proved to be unsuccessful, and by the 1929 the updated version of the 7.5mm ammunition has been adopted as 7.5mm Cartouche Mle.1929C (7.5x54mm). By the same time, French also developed a lightweight machinegun, the MAC 1929. Initially, French tried to convert earlier 8mm Berthier rifles for new ammunition, but it was apparent that the new rifle is desirable for French infantry. In 1936 French military officially adopted the MAS Mle.1936 (MAS-36) bolt-action rifle, developed by the Manufacture D'Armes de Saint-Etienne. Later on, French forces adopted the modified paratrooper's version, known as MAS-36 CR 39. This version differed from basic rifle by the aluminum buttstock, which can be folded down and under the forend. This rifle served with French armed forces until the semi-automatic MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 replaced it in service during 1950s and 1960s. The MAS-36 rifle was in production up until the mid-1950s. The MAS-36 action also served as a platform for FR F-1 and FR F-2 sniper rifles, which are still in service with French Armed forces. Since 1951, some of MAS-36 rifles were converted or made into MAS-36/51 pattern, by adding the permanently attached grenade launchers and rifle grenade sights. Grenade launcher was attached to the muzzle of the gun, and was used to launch rifle grenades using special blank ammunition. Folding grenade sight was attached to the left side of the front sight base.

MAS-36 is a manually operated, magazine fed, rotating bolt action rifle. The rotating bolt has two opposing lugs, located at the rear of the bolt body. The bolt locks into receiver walls, the bolt handle is located at the rear of the bolt, and is bent forward for more comfortable operation. The square-shaped receiver is machined from steel, and contained integral magazine. Magazine is loaded using charging clips or single rounds, with clip guides machined into the receiver bridge. The wooden stock is made from two parts (buttstock and forend), both connected to the uncovered receiver. The spike-shaped bayonet is stored in the tube below the barrel in reversed position, when not in use. Diopter rear sight is located at the rear of the receiver, and marked from 100 to 1 200 meters in 100 meters increments. Probably the most noticeable feature of the MAS-36 is the lack of any manual safety - rifle was supposed to be carried with empty magazine, and loaded only before the actual combat.

Concentrate on improving grip, sight alignment, trigger pull, and other skills without burning up expensive, centerfire ammo. Installs in seconds and requires no gunsmithing or permanent alterations to your rifle. Uses your gun's factory upper receiver, barrel, fire control system, buffer, and spring. Simply replace the bolt and carrier with the conversion unit, load up the included magazine with high-velocity round-nose .22 LR ammo, and you're ready to shoot. Precision machined from high-grade steel to the highest standards of workmanship for proper function in any mil-spec .223/5.56mm rifle or carbine. Every unit is test fired by the manufacturer before leaving the factory to ensure correct fit and function. Kit comes with conversion unit and one smoke-colored 26-round or 10-round magazine; conversion unit also available separately, without magazine. Magazines are molded from impact-resistant polycarbonate and are available in translucent clear or smoke, or solid black. Self-lubricating anti-tilt follower and constant-force spring help ensure reliable feeding. Follower functions to hold bolt open after last round is fired. 26-round magazines are the same size as USGI 30-round AR-15 magazines; 10- and 15-round magazines are the size of standard 20-round AR-15 magazines.


SPECS: Kits include conversion unit, plus one (1) smoke colored 26-rd mag

This is an extra I have and love it.  It takes seconds to switch and use the 22 to practice ACOG sight pictures and trigger pull without using 5.56.  This thing is built tough and never had an issue.  It shoots anything I feed it and the mag does hold 30.

The small frame, double action revolver is universally excepted as one of the most useful and most effective self defensive pistols in firearms history.

Five words best describe the Windicator: Simple, reliable, durable, accurate, and affordable. Weihrauch has been producing the trusty ""Windicator"" pistol for over 25 years, and it has not changed at all. It is an excellent choice for concealed carry, home defense, or duty backup. Windicators are available in .357 Magnum on a steel frame with a 2"" barrel. Standard features include: Internal firing pin block, Coil mainspring, Grooved target trigger, Serrated cylinder latch, Low profile non snag sights, and Rubber target grips.

Full Power in a Small Frame

I've used Armslist for sales and purchases many times, and visit it with great regularity. 
I am just making a friendly point to anyone posting: This is a site for private sales and transactions, sort of the craigslist of guns. If you are a seller, and you have an FFL, that is great, and you're serving the gun community well. But you shouldn't post a sale here, and demand that the buyer have the weapon transfered to him through an FFL, and fill out the 4473 and take a criminal background check. 

There are plenty of places for gunshops to advertise. This is not one of them. This is a place where law-abiding citizens can excercise their rights to LEGALLY buy, sell, and trade their firearms without fear of the Fed getting involved and making into an ordeal it was never meant to be. 
Private sales are king here. Paperwork is not.

Excercise your rights, or they'll be lost forever.

I would rate the finish at about 90% with mostly cosmetic holster wear on the edges of the anodized alloy frame. However these guns were carried a lot but fired very little and the bore and internals are excellent. These third generation S&W's are known for their quality and reliability. This gun has new springs and grips and both mags have new springs, followers, and butt plates. Price shown is for face to face private sale to eligible South Carolina resident.

After some research I have come to find that this weapon does have the Smith-Carona barrel.  The gun is in fantastic shape for a 68 year old rifle and fires like a dream.  I love the way it fires and would use it as my primary hunting rifle if not for the fact that it has NOT been drilled and tapped for a scope.  I contacted several dealers today and all of them told me that with an original GI stock ($100 at a gun show) this gun is worth $800 to $900, though I don't care about this weapon's historical value enough to make the effort.

This was a SHOT show exclusive from 2006 or 2007 I forget which it was uncatalogued. Anyways it is matte stainless with a greyish green and black laminate stock straight grip style. Shot very little. A few light scratches that are not very noticeable. The nature of the matte finish is any scratches show up as shiny spots if the light hits them just right. You have to look for the scratches. The wood is as perfect as it was from Browning. Includes but not installed a set of uncle mikes swivel studs specific to the Blr. The rear sight was replaced with a Williams green fire sight to go with the factory front sight which is red fiber optic. Original rear sight is included. Have original box as well. 

Gun was very accurate with all loads I tried. Only selling because I replaced it with a takedown version of the same gun. 

Might be something to put away as it is an oddball. Or hunt with it. Much better than the shiny walnut blued version if you want to hunt with it.

He called us up with what he wanted out of the holster and the style we made it happen.  Instead of upwards of 60.00 for a holster he did not really like he got what he wanted for less than 38.00.

Sporter stock barrel dated October, 1942.
After some research I have come to find that this weapon does have the Smith-Carona barrel.  The gun is in fantastic shape for a 68 year old rifle and fires like a dream.  I love the way it fires and would use it as my primary hunting rifle if not for the fact that it has NOT been drilled and tapped for a scope.  I contacted several dealers today and all of them told me that with an original GI stock ($100 at a gun show) this gun is worth $800 to $900, though I don't care about this weapon's historical value enough to make the effort.
$500

I'll do cash, trade for a handgun, or AR parts.

I am selling this with lots of extras...6 Magpul P-mags (3 are OD green, 2 are all black, and 1 is black with the clear window). Also 2 Colt 30 round mags and to Colt 20 round mags. All are loaded. Thats 280 rounds of 5.56
Also 2 piece quad rail, infared laser, tactical led flash light, 2 foreward grip handles, one is collapsable. Rail covers, and soft case. Also a USGI load carry vest, with 3mag shingles that actually hold 6 mags. I have 2 of these on the vest. Then a double mag pouch, dump pouch, and grenade pouch. Nice setup. Like I said this rifle is basically new and only has 200 rounds through it. Nice shooting rifle. I paid $1,700 plus tax about $1,900 and change for just the rifle. Who knows how much I spent on all the accessories. The rifle is bone stock right now...I took of all the accessories. But in to of the pics you can see what it looks like with the stuff on it. And the pic of the vest does not show the dump pouch or double mag pouch or grendade pouch. But is on the vest now.

Asking $1,200 for all. I will not take any less and will not seperate any of the package. It's a steal at this price. I will however look at trading all of it for a ""NICE"" Remington SPS Tactical in .308 with a nice scope and bipod. 

Thanks for looking."

Smith and Wesson's first venture into the semi-auto pistol field consisted of a design based  on the Belgian-made Clement pistols.  Initial production was for a S&W proprietary cartridge the .35 S&W auto.
.35 S&W auto has a 7-shot magazine, 3 and 1/2 inch barrel blue finish with walnut grips.
This neat little pistol has 2 safeties a round roll disc where the web of  the hand fits and a push button middle finger operated under the trigger guard.  These are uncommon pistols which were not a success for S&W the next try at a semi-auto pistol would be 20 years later which was the first generation 9mm DAs
  This pistol is a type 3 marked 35 auto CTG which was produced about 1913 with the two safeties mentioned but no magazine safety.  The pistol is excellent plus with 2 perfect walnut grips with the S&W trademark on each side, mechanically excellent and finish blueing better than 90%.  If you have never seen one of these they are well worth looking up on google or the Neal and Jinks Historical Book of S&W.
  Again for those collectors trying to accumulate all 8 variations of the .35 Semi-Automatic Pistol (model of 1913)  this is a type 3."

I bought this for my wife to use as her primary carry weapon. She used it for qualifying for her AZ Concealed carry permit, and fired maybe a total of 20 rounds through it on that day. Since then it has been sitting in a padded case in my safe, because she decided she wanted to carry a compact .45 instead. I see no reason to keep this sitting in the safe taking up space where I could put a new 1911, so I am putting it up for sale or trade.

I am looking to get $200 cash. I would consider possible trades for electronics such as Widescreen LCD or Plasma televisions 21"" or larger (preferably larger), or Widescreen LCD computer monitors 24"" or larger. I would also consider trades for an 8gb or larger Ipod or Zune, go-carts, golf carts, or computers (laptops and desktop/towers) of equal or greater value. Other interesting trades MIGHT be considered, just tell me what you have, and I'll let you know if I'm interested. Items must be in working, usable condition. No Junk please.
