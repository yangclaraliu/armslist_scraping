Trigger is crisp and clean with the upper sporting a Seekins Precision red billet aluminum AR10 charging handle. With a Blitzkreig Tactical LR308 BCG dual serration which can be used with most uppers on the market as it has the serrations for a 3 o'clock style forward assist and a pronounced shoulder for the DPMS style forward assist.
DUAL EJECTOR: ""Two is one, one is none"", a motto to live by. This BCG has a second ejector in the bolt. Building this redundancy allows the BCG to eject and extract efficiently and consistently. This is truly a remarkable and uncommon feature offered in bolt carrier groups.
Carrier: Case hardened 8620 steel, with dual forward assist serrations.
 Finish: Black Nitride - QPQ Treated
 Gas Key: 4130 steel, attached with grade 8 hardware and properly staked
 Cam Pin: Hardened 4340 Steel
 Firing Pin: Made from 8740 steel, center-less ground and hard chrome coated
 Bolt: Case hardened 9310 steel, all bolt parts are case hardened and shot peened with two ejectors and two crane O-rings and dual extractor springs installed.
 Black Nitride/QPQ: This is an extreme case hardening process which turns the steel black and hardens the surface of the steel and extends the life of the product. QPQ stands for Quench Polish Quench. This process is now commonly used in the industry. The Black Nitride is coated by H&M who own the trademark, ""Black Nitride"". Only the best here.
The Barrel is a Green Mountain Barrel which was machined by KAK industries. It is 416 stainless with a 1/10 twist. Chambered in 308 winwhich also will accept 7.62 nato. It is medium contour with a DPMS LR308 extension matte blasted grey finish.
12"" freefloating keymod Omega rail either. 
The stock is Troy industries PDW style stock. Lightweight and compact making this rifle a battleax for our time. It shortens overall length by 2"" compared to an M4 stock. The impact-resistant, polymer cheek-piece with QD swivel mount provides stability and comfort; the aluminum thumb-latch and guide rails offer superior strength and five positions of adjustment.

Three of the tires have a little less than half of the tread left, one is virtually brand new, maybe 3,000 miles on it - I was in an accident last fall, one tire was damaged, so insurance bought me a new one, shortly after I switched to my winter tires.I love these tires, the performance is awesome about 8 months out of the year. The grip, handling, and braking are noticeably better than the Continental all seasons I replaced them with. I just got sick of having to switch my tires every spring and fall, so I switched to all seasons.For someone who doesn't mind switching wheels/tires twice a year these should serve you pretty well.These sell for just under $100 brand new, I'm asking $125 for the set. I'd prefer to sell them as a set, however, I'd consider selling the one new one for $50, and the 3 others for $75 I guess.Tirerack:http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Firestone&tireModel=Firehawk+Wide+Oval+Indy+500&partnum=245WR7FHWI5XL&vehicleSearch=false&fromCompare1=ye1"

Double / Single Action with Blue Alloy Frame and Walnut w/Commemorative Medallion. 
 It was back in 1975 when the pistol was officially presented as the Model 92. The first military adoption is made by the Italian CONSUBIN (the Italian Navy ""SEAL"" teams) and from the Brazilian Army (1975/76). From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. What sets it apart from the 92FS is: A. Distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number(M9-0001 through 2010) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols. C. ""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the M9. 2 - 15 round magazines, wood grips with 25th Anniversary medallion type “F” safety system. Limited production of 2010 units.

It is the hard to find Brigadier version of the 92FS.  It features the matte black finish, heavier profile slide, dovetail front and rear 3 dot sights, DA/SA trigger and ambgi safety/decock lever.  It wears the CTC Crimson Trace Laser Grips, CTC Model LG 302 grips ($189.00 Value) and includes 2 factory 15 round mag.  I can leave the grips on for an additional $100 or install factory grips for the current asking price.
Like the standard 92FS, the 92FS Brigadier is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. Add to this the extra weight of the Brigadier slide, and you get enhanced durability even above these specifications. To minimize recoil, the slide features a heavy profile--which also enhances durability--and the grips are Hogue soft rubber wraparound panels that greatly absorb the momentum of the pistol upon firing. Other important features of the 92FS Brigadier include the dovetailed front and rear sights that can be easily replaced by the user, as well as a maximum magazine capacity of 15 rounds (9mm Parabellum) for top-notch firepower. Add to this the legendary benefits of the Beretta 92FS (M9), and you get a variant equally suited for home defense, competition, duty or concealed carry and more.
