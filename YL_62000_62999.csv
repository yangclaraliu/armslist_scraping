It has been used, and it is not a safe queen. I touched up where the paint has came off the receiver. It does not look brand new, but its good. Barrel & magazine tube has minor pitting/finish wear. The bore condition is superb. Stock in pretty good condition as well.

The first is a rare Remington 700 BDL chambered in 30-06. It is in like new condition, and has iron sights with hooded front, figured synthetic stock, scope mounts and a Golden Antler scope. The action on this is so smooth, and is very accurate. This is much better quality than the current run of 700s, and will come with a nice zip up case.

Second I have a custom built Savage BVSS in .243. Since purchasing my BAT/S this one just sits in the safe. It is to nice of a rifle to not be used. Everything is like new. The barrel is fully floated and the crown is perfect. The SS trigger is amazing, and breaks clean and light. This would be a great long range or varmint rifle. Here is everything that is included with the sale and its original price:

Savage Model 12 BVSS - .243 - $850
Shilen Stainless Match Barrel - $380
Sharpshooter Trigger System - $300
Leupold STD Scope Base - $30
Leupold STD Scope Rings - $40

Simmons 44mag Scope - 6.5-20x44, includes sunshade and covers - $150

$450 for the Remington, and $800 for the Savage. I am open to trades, just let me know what you have. I am in Canton, 44710. Willing to drive a bit for the right deal. Would like a nicer AR platform rifle, 1911, Sig or ???"

Model IM34. This kit is For Frigidaire,Tappan, Gibson, 
Kelvinator and Kenmore (253.series)
with static condenser (coils up the back) 
This is what I will call ""new, old stock"". It is new in the box, with everything you need to install it. It does however fit older refigerators. So if you are in the appliance repair business, or just have an old fridge that needs a new ice maker, then this is for you. I will save you the trouble of googling it for what a new one costs. The cheapest I found them on-line for is $75.99 plus shipping. So you will save money if you buy or trade for this one.  Everything is there, it has NO missing parts or pieces.
Will do a FTF in the Indy area. Cash price is $50.00.
Will also trade for a nice fixed blade survival knife ( no frost or other cheapies) must be of some quality.
Nice flash lights (surefire or insight). Ammo: 12 gauge, .357sig, 45acp, 7.62x39, .30-06 (M2 ball only and non-corrosive) .308/7.62x51. Other cal.'s too, just ask, I did not want to list them all.

The other neat thing though is that other than the upper receiver and charging handle assembly, it's a regular AR15, and all parts interchange. The only difference is that the bolt carrier has a small notch milled in it for the charging handle to engage.

Yes the Registered lightning link is transferable towards civilians since it was manufactured and registered with the ATF before the 1986 cut off date. Is on a form 4 and will be less painful to transfer to another WI resident. Pretty much if you can walk in a gun store and legally buy a handgun, you are eligible to own this. Machine guns cannot be manufactured after may 19 1986 that's why they come with a heavy price tag but is a good investment. Buyer required to file a form 4 and I will pay the 200 dollar tax stamp to ATF. No Class 3 dealer is needed if buyer is a WI resident. The Link is registered not the rifle, which can be picked up or delivered upon payment.  And yes the rifle can have any barrel length when link is installed but must be removed when link is removed if it does not meet the 16 inch legal length. All NFA rules apply,  No trades at this time unless you have a transferable full auto MAC 11 or 10 plus cash. Any questions or just curious message me through ARMSLIST.

The serial number on the frame and slide match, as well as the stickers and numbers on the Sig Sauer Blue Box. The gun was imported by CAI.

If interested please email me at tcdand22 at gmail dot com....it is much faster to get in touch with me that way.

The only trades I would be interested would be a Yugo SKS plus some ammo and some cash, or ak AK47 package, or Saiga 12."

I am selling a 3rd Generation Glock 23 RTF2 (rough textured frame) .40 caliber. Its new in box with all the papers and whatnot. Best thing about this deal is that it comes with a 9mm conversion barrel! So its like having a Glock 23 and a Glock 19 all at the same time but less money. I bought 100 rounds of ball .40 cal ammo and ended up spending like $30 and I was like “theres gotta be an alternative” so I tried the Lone Wolf conversion barrel with the G19 mag and all I spent that day to go to the range was $18 for 100 rounds of ball 9mm ammo. Heres all the package comes with
1. Glock 23 RTF2 .40 cal LNIB
2. Lone Wolf 9mm conversion barrel
3. Three factory Glock 23 magazines (13 rounds each)
4. One factory Glock 19 magazine (15 rounds)

719,http://www.armslist.com/posts/62719,For Sale:  Custom made knives,"North Side, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 200,"Listed On: Thursday, October 21, 2010",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have several custom hunting knives for sale.  These all have ergonomic antler handles, laminated Scandanavian steel blades and hand made heavy leather sheaths.

The antler makes a great non-slip handle with a curve that fits the hand very naturally.  These are very good for actual work on a downed animal where slipping with a sharp hunting knive can have disasterous results.  The addition of an oversized brass guard adds the additional protection against slipping into a blade, and helps to balance the knife to the junction of the blade and handle.  The guards are hand ground from bar stock, not made of the cheap castings you can find at any supply house.

The blades themselves are a Rockwell 58 inner steel protected with a softer (about a Rockwell 49) outer steel cladding.  The inner steel will literally take a razor edge and will hold it.  I have made these knives for friends and they have reported exceptional blade life, with one person having skinned two elk and a deer before allowing me to touch up the edge.  Anyone who has field experience knows how atypical that is.  The outer cladding is softer to protect the more brittle interior steel from the risk of chipping.  It's the perfect combination in a working knife.  Most of these blades are not stainless as I prefer the quality of the edge they can take.  Some, however, are stainless which still holds a good edge and is more resistant to corrosive environments (such as not wiping the blood off the blade when putting it away).  Non stainless blades are waxed to protect them from moisture.

The sheaths are 9oz cowhide with synthetic sinew stiching.  This gives them a nice rustic versus machine made look.  Each sheath is custom cut for the knife it is to be used with.  

I normally produce a knife with a blade that is between 3 1/2"" to 4 1/2"" as I have found this length to be the most useful for field work on an animal.  The Bowie I have pictured is about an 7"" blade and the flint knife is 5""

I have sold these for $250 each, and they can go for more than that at the shows.  I have several I put together going into this year's Christmas season that are available at about $200.  The flint knife is $100 and the Bowie is only $160.  That is because these are not working knives and so the work needed to make them is less demanding.  The pictures below are representative.  

If interested, let me know.  I can emboss the sheaths with a name or a figure such as a mountain sheep to make it a little more custom for gift giving if you would like.  They're just stamps from Tandy so it's no big deal."

If you have any old, unwanted guns around, unsafe or otherwise, I would like to turn them into non-firing models for use in classes. We can use any firearm, modern or old, any style, about any condition, as long as it's reasonably complete. If you have any old barrels that have been exploded out, that would make a great demonstration tool as well. 

To be clear, this is not something the state or Wildlife and Parks is officially doing at this point. I am looking for tools I can use in my classes, and which I can lend to other instructors for their classes. Currently, we have to use toy guns, which is better than nothing, or our own hunting firearms, which have to be extremely carefully monitored, especially with larger groups. The safer and more effective way is to bring in the real thing, disabled and painted up to show so. This allows us to actually demonstrate safely loading and unloading dummy ammo, as well as ways to verify that a real gun is unloaded, with each student getting a chance for hands-on with a variety of firearm types. Another value of the real thing is in its weight. We can show how carrying a real gun can make arms tired, and the effect of that on safely carrying in the field. 

So, if you have anything you'd like to offer, it would be greatly appreciated.

Interior is good but not perfect, no rips in the interior, Door pannels show some age, Dash cracked but has a dash matt and the interior trim is cracked in some spots. Kenwood CD player but the speakers are not real impresive.
Old Camaro Ralley wheels with BFGs, 80 percent tread
Only has a couple of VERY SMALL dents. There are a few small rust spots were it is starting to show through the paint. Stock rear end with stock gears and with the foot through the floor you shift out of second at about 110 mph.. Recomend some 4:10s but will still lite the tires off the line.
The car has 41000 original miles on the car and approximatley 6000 on the motor and tranny.  I have drove it for the last couple of weeks and the car is sound.  I put the stereo in correctly but due to no companys making instilation kits for this year i had to use a universal.  Looks 10 times better then the stereo sitting in a big hole.  I put the new spedo cable in this weekend but the speedo gear in the tranny must be messed up.  Spinning the cable with a drill and the speedo works fine but hooked to the tranny just doesnt work.  You can find one for nothing out of a junk tranny but im not going to mess with it.  It also comes with a GPS that tells you your speed so its all good.  I also put the new weather stripping on the lower doors this weekend. The car runs like a champ..No Studders, No Dead spots and has plenty of power under the hood.   Motor runs 190 temp holding 50PSI oil at idle and has plenty of go!!  I  am needing to sell this car because i need the money to fix my wifes burban.  The price is 3400 obo so shoot me an reasonalbe offer and we can make a deal.  Im still open to partial trades but needing close to 1000+ cash with the trades. Here is what im looking for in partial trades... Nice set of 265/75/16 mud tires that are 90 percent or better, Master AC/Heat switch Panel for a 98-99 suburban, Perfect windshield for same suburban which should be 88-98 chevy trucks or suburban, Nice two seater go cart for the kids, Still looking for a nice Kimber Crimson Trace with 3 or 4"" barrel, Other hand guns to or assault rifles.  The only full trades im looking for would be a half or 3/4 ton truck pref chevy of the same or close value that my father would be interested in buying or could do partial on this too.I need this car gone quick  Cash is king i just need it gone.  Feel free to text or email offers to me even if its not on the list. Text or call at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED if your interested.
