SilencerCo went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length. 45 OSPREY CALIBER:9MM - .45 ACP .300 BLK Subsonic WEIGHT:11.1 OZ DIMENSIONS: 1.3”W × 1.75”H LENGTH:8.0625” SOUND LEVEL:(Dry/Wet): 132.5 dB/123 dB (tested with an HK USP Tactical with Remington UMC 230 Grain Ammunition) FINISH:Hard Coat Anodizing Black Oxide MATERIALS:Core/Caps: 7075 T6 Aluminum Tube: 6061 T6 Aluminum Piston/Mounting System: 17-4 Stainless Steel, Heat Treated, Mount:Threads FEATURES:Interchangeable pistons Unobstructed sight picture Patented cam lock Mounting system Lifetime warranty MSRP:$849.95 (with piston)"

Who doesn't? When I heard back in June they were going to do a G17L run I knew I would need one. So I went into my local gun shop one day a couple months ago and they had 2 G17L's. They were consecutive serial numbers. So I for some reason bought both. I've come to find I don't need two. I carry and shoot one. The other one has never been shot, loaded or holstered. It's mint and new in the most literal sense. After tax they came to $706 each. So for this one I'm asking $600 firm for cash, around $700 trade value. Even buying online, after shipping you won't get a 17L cheaper than this.  

Looking for something in 45 acp. Springfield XD/XDM, glock 41, that type of thing. Cash only if money is exchanged. No junk offered please.

Just a side note, I'm pretty knowledgable about firearms as it is, I can tell new from used, I will research anything offered, so don't think you're going to pull one over on me and rip me off. Armslist is a different market place and I'm very cautious here."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

SilencerCo went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length. 9 OSPREY CALIBER:9MM Luger .300 BLK Subsonic WEIGHT:9.8 OZ DIMENSIONS:1.30”W × 1.75”H LENGTH:7.0625” SOUND LEVEL:Dry: 125 dB (tested with a Sig 226 with American Eagle AE9FP 147 Grain Ammunition) FINISH:Hard Coat Anodizing Black Oxide MATERIALS:Core/Caps: 7075 T6 Aluminum Tube: 6061 T6 Aluminum Piston/Mounting System: 17-4 Stainless Steel, Heat Treated, Mount:Threads FEATURES:Interchangeable pistons Unobstructed sight picture Patented cam lock Mounting system Lifetime warranty MSRP:$849.95 (with piston)"

I have fired around 200 rounds through it flawlessly and I kept it clean and lubed before and after each use. It does weigh about 8-9 pounds, however it has minimal felt reciol and muzzle flip/ sway due to the weight and muzzle break, allowing great grouping at high rates of fire. Included in this package is what you see in the picture(rifle, pmags, accessories, optics) and 71 rounds of poly coated steel cased 55 grain fmj rounds and 60 brass cased 62 grain green tipped XTAC rounds.

The charging handle does show obvious wear and there is a nick on the bottom rail of the quad rail due to equipping a cheap grip, but not very noticeable. Other than that, the rifle looks brand new.

I bought this on here on Armslist a month ago for $170 (without the 22 magnum cylinder and with zero ammo) to teach my 8 year-old how to shoot.  Turns out it's a little too heavy, and her hands are a little too short to use it comfortably.  That being said, I will take the loss and sell it tonight for $125.  As I said, it does not come with the 22 magnum cylinder.

I test-fired it at 20 feet, and it was as accurate and reliable as I expected; I fired 18 accurate as hell (and I'm an average shooter) rounds through it at Happy Hollow, so you get 82 rounds of Federal .22lr along with it.  This is a great reliable gun, but I am buying something lighter and smaller for her to learn on; a small financial loss I can live with. 

I will delete the ad when it has found a new home.  Check out the reviews on Cimarron 22 revolvers, no lowballing please, this is a fair price for a reliable, accurate and fun firearm."

Daewoo DR-200 Rifle in .223



Accessories:
One 120rd Chinese Drum Magazine 

This Daewoo DR-200 rifle came in from one of our local customers as a trade-in and is in excellent condition. Previous owner reported firing it many years ago, but has kept it in a safe until now. Other than a few light marks from safe storage, we can see no other defects on the rifle. 

Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle was developed by the, South Korean, Agency for Defense Development and manufactured by S&T Motiv (formerly Daewoo Precision Industries). It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle was developed by the, South Korean, Agency for Defense Development and manufactured by S&T Motiv (formerly Daewoo Precision Industries). It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

I just purchased this and one of the kitchen appliance broke so need to turn this into cash. The rifle has never been fired. Located in NW burbs, FOID will be required and 24 hr rule applies. Local pickup only. 

The CX4 is a semiauto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.

The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.

This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.

The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization. Please visit our accessories page for a full list of CX4 accessories."

I have been unsuccessful in cashing this money order because its in your name ,  my bank wont do it and  Western Union wants to charge me $15.00 dollars to refund my money , I don’t feel that I should have to be put out because of the misunderstanding concerning  the purchase of your items , now I propose like I wanted before that I will send this money order back to you , and you can cash it, and  send me a blank money order use the same funds to purchase a postal money order.   I understand this may inconvenience you a bit, but I would really appreciate your cooperation in this matter  I don’t want to lose  my money.

The butt plate is original and has some scratches and nicks at the top and bottom, but no chips and no cracks. The bore is excellent, no rust or gouges. The action is also excellent, and the gun functions perfectly – it shoots ½” groups at 50 feet with Minimags. The bluing overall is in great shape, with a few small specks of rust in two or three places, but nothing egregious and hardly noticeable. The gun also comes with the following: red and black Raybar sights, original Ithaca 7-round magazine, Marlin 10-round magazine that will fit this gun, and an original hangtag/manual.

It also comes with the original black grips, O.D green grips and the ones pictured.
I have various holsters for the Kimber, including a raven concealment systems holster IWB/OWB. Since some these items are specific to this model Kimber they are being included. These items do not increase my asking price. In other words asking me to sell the kimber without them will not save you any money. I feel the asking price is very reasonable as it is literally brand new never fired. My asking price is ""pretty much"" my bottom line.
 This Kimber is in the exact same condition as if you bought it at Gander mountain. But you will get a BUNCH of EXTRAS you wouldn't get at Gander and still pay $200 more not including taxes and fees!  If you have been looking to buy a kimber this is a hell of a deal, I dont believe you will find as mint of a weapon for the amount I'm asking.
If you have any questions please let me know.

Shooting Illustrated's Rifle of the Year 
Shooters know that longer sight radius’ allows the shooter to draw a better sight picture, improving accuracy. The Tac2 is built on that foundation. Features Magpul ACS stock, Moe Grip, and back-up sight, and debuting DPMS’ new M111 modular handguard system, this carbine is equally suited for a multigun competition or a tactical defense carbine. Utilizes a full rifle length gas system for minimal felt recoil.
