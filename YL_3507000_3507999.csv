This is the precursor to the EMP series this firearm comes loaded with extended beaver tail, two tone frame with wood checkered handgrips, ambidextrous overlarge safety, and night sights with plenty of life still left in them. 

This is also rare as you will not find many of these on the market in .40 S&W

This firearm is used with minor wear but no scratches or dings in the finish.  Also no idiot mark from disassemble or reassembly while cleaning.  I spent 9 years in the military so I am beyond OCD with my firearms.

I bought this with the intent to carry as my every day carry however I decided to go with something else.  I have only run 1 box on white box Winchester through this fire arm. Other than that she has been a safe queen.

Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, medium, and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

Varmint HE ammunition delivers excellent terminal performance producing quick, humane kills.

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The flat base creates in-flight stability for long-range shooting. Hornady's swaging process creates precise formation of the core around the tip of the bullet, creating a build-up of energy which contributes to its phenomenal performance.

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Though not my first choice, would also consider a straight trade for a Sig p238.
Would also consider a quality J-frame size revolver or Ruger LC9/LC9S +cash.
I will consider other trades but these are the ones I'm primarily interested in.
Otherwise will sell for 400 firm.

The XD® 5” Full Size is designed to put the most into your hand when you need it. Built on a full size frame with a 5” barrel, this is the XD® that delivers the most in performance, capacity and controllability. Whether you’re looking for a pistol for the nightstand or the shooting range, the XD® 5"" Full Size will do the job.

The XD® 5” Full Size has all the same features found in the standard XD® line in a tactically-sized package. This XD® is as easy to shoot as you would expect it to be. The 5” barrel brings you a longer sight radius and decreased shot-to-shot recovery time. The advantages don’t stop with easy shooting, though – the XD® 5” Full Size includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®.

Its a good gun but at the end of the day, I'm a Glock guy. Its been well maintained and currently has a Surefire X300 Ultra attached to it. I have a level 3 Safariland light bearing holster (police holsters if you are not familiar with them) as well as a blade tech holster(blade tech holster does not accommodate the light---more for IDPA shooting). I also have 4 17 round factory made mags for it.

1. S&W 9mm full- retails for $569 on the S&W website so I am willing to bring it down to ~~$425~~

2. Surefire X300 Ultra- retails for $300 on the surefire website so I am willing to drop it down to ~~$175~~

3. Safariland ALS III holster retails for $217 on the Safariland/holsters website so I am willing to drop it down to ~~$150~~(Plus I had to wait 4 weeks when I originally ordered it online....)

4. Bladetech holster retails for $65 on the blade tech website so I will drop that down to ~~$35~~

5. I bought the 2 additional magazines online for $40 a piece during the gun scare last year so ill charge ~$25~ each.

TOTAL COMES OUT TO ~~~$835~~~

This is a complete tactical kit if you are just entering the ""tactical"" world this would be great for you. I would like to sell it as a package because like I said earlier I am just more of a Glock fan. The only way I would consider selling it in parts is if you were to include the safari land ALS holster in whatever you want.....dont ask me for just the surefire or just the weapon because I don't want to be left with an expensive holster that I will never use again. 

SO, if you want just the weapon, and you already have an X300 than thats fine because I can sell the light by itself. If you want just the Safariland holster, than you can have that too. I live in downtown Richmond, and if you are interested we can meet in a public place like a Walmart parking lot or something (because selling guns in parking lots is cool right?).

This particular model is one of the sportorized versions imported between 1997-199 by Century Arms.  Sportorized stock, chrome lined barrel, and original coatings are some of the features.  The original muzzle cap has been professionally replaced with a traditional AK slant brake.  All matching numbers.

There were approximately 1000 MISRs imported in their true condition in the 1980's.  If this was one of them it would not be on here!  However, this offers one of the truest verions of Russian AK stamping in the MISR form available to the average collector.  This particular firearm has some coating missing from the bolt due to natural wear.

I am putting this AK up as I am interested in fishing the waters for some other 7.62x39 variants that are out there.  I would sell but prefer to trade for something I am interested in.  The itch can never really be scratched when it comes to wanting something different....

I won't be able to get out this fall or anytime soon, so am selling to fund a different project. All I've done it clean it of its packing grease. It has been carefully stored in a Bore Stores rifle case in a climate-controlled safe. It is in immaculate condition (as new). Comes with everything you would expect if you were purchasing new: Case, Owner's Manual, Benelli Gun Oil, all Crio Chokes: Crio C, Crio IC, Crio M, Crio IM, Crio F, etc.

I didn't provide pics because it's new as described; but if you require them anyway, I can email pics. You will not be disappointed. I will even throw in a couple of boxes of FEDERAL TARGET LOAD shotshells (50 total) FREE. 

I am located near Woodbury, but can meet FTF virtually anywhere in the Twin Cities. Please, no lowball offers; they will be respectfully ignored. My offer is more than fair for a new Benelli.

Scope has an Adjustable Illuminated Reticle.

The Nightforce 1-4x24 NXS scope is designed and built to withstand repeated recoil from the largest magnum calibers. Use at 1 power with both eyes open with full field of view (100 feet at 100 yards) or zoom in to 4x magnification. The scope is designed for hunting dangerous game at close quarters, dense brush, and running targets.

The FC-2 etched glass reticle is a fine floating reticle that utilizes all the functional elements of a duplex without the unnecessary obstructions at the 12 and 6 o'clock positions. The FC-2 reticle directs your eye to the center for quick target acquisition using a circle and dot.

The LT104 1 piece scope mount places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range.

Carried a lot, shot a little. I would like to sell one of my favorite concealed-carry guns to fund some other interests. I sent this gun back to ruger 6 months ago so they could replace the slide with a slide that has factory pinned-in front sights. They originally did not have pinned sights, so some of them would move around when shot... they replaced it for free with a pinned-in front sight and went thru the gun and tested everything. (I mailed in on a saturday and had it back Wednesday the next week! ruger customer service is awsome!)

Disclaimer:  (I have removed the internal Mag-drop safety and spring that would not allow the gun to be fired if the mag is removed. I will include the parts with this sale, or if you prefer, i will re-install the mag-drop safety if you so desire before selling it to you.)

I am selling this gun as a package deal, which includes everything from the factory, the box, owners manual, gun lock, etc. I will give you a box of target ammo, and a box of self defense ammo if you show me your valid oregon ccw permit. Including a nice fitted right-handed DeSantis Sof-Tuck leather inner waistband holster to carry it in. These guns ship from ruger with one single-stack 7rd mag. I estimate about 350-400 rounds down the pipe using all different types of ammo, so this is barely broke in and runs flawless! Bluing shows minor normal holster wear from daily carry. No scratches or blemishes.

To cut down on weird texts, and spam please call only. I don't have time to answer texts all day if you have any questions or wish to view this firearm, then please call in person. No B.S. Please respect my time. I respect yours....

I will not ship and no offers or trades, if you want the ammo and holster please have your valid oregon firearm permit to show me, must be 21+ and have valid oregon id to prove residency to purchase this firearm and is a cash-only private face-to-face sale. If you do not have an oregon gun permit, then a simple bill-of-sale stating you are not a felon and you may legally own a firearm may be required (for my information only) at my discretion.

The Beretta 92FS Inox gives you all the features of the legendary 92FS or M9 (the official sidearm of the US military), in a rugged and attractive satin stainless steel finish. The slide, barrel and internal parts are all stainless, while the alloy frame is anodized to match the color and finish of the other components. It also features stippled-textured soft rubber grips that further absorb recoil while affording a firm and positive grip. Besides being one of the most photogenic handguns ever made (it appeared in countless movies and TV shows), it is perfect for home or personal defense, as well as concealed carry and recreational shooting.

I have a used Mini Osprey (Yukon Mini Varmint Hunter, same thing) in great shape with some accessories. The scope is a few years old, I got it in a trade but haven't used it since I got it so its time to make room in the safe. 

The only issue with the scope is some very slight scaling in the far right area of the lens. It is barely noticeable (and probably unnoticeable but I was told when I got it) and doesn't obstruct the field of view or even come close to the reticle but I wanted to mention it. Everything else is in great shape, NV works great (I've used it on a camping trip just to play with it and watch my dogs run around) and the adjustable red cross reptile is awesome. It comes with a dark lens cover so it can also be used during the day. 

It will come in the original soft leather carrying case. Also comes with a camera lens adaptor, extended push button on/off & brightness adjustment that you can Velcro onto a forward grip/rail/frame/etch and has two additional accessory weaver rails attached to the top and left side to add on anything additional (i.e. NV laser or additional NV light). 

Asking $260 OBO for everything and would prefer FTF in Tampa or Central FL (I will be driving to Orlando and Daytona today and tomorrow) otherwise buyer to pay shipping and PayPal fee's or I can take USPS money order.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
         This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers  may take any number of extras we have on hand, at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges.	The CZ83 pistol had its heyday for us from 2010 until early 2013, while we were having loads of fun with the Czech Police pistols, and moved several hundred of them. At press time, we were almost out, but the owners have one of the best pistols in the world. Here are factory CZ magazines for the CZ82 and CZ83 pistols. Manufacturer is Czeska Zbojovka, CZ, of Uhersky Brod, Czech Republic. Importer is CZ-USA of Kansas City, KS.  CZ number is 11301. Construction is serration dimpled blue steel body with steel floorplate and spring, and black polymer cartridge followers. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of .380 ACP or 9x18 Makarov caliber ammunition. That is two fewer rounds than the standard 11302 Magazine; civilian buyers who reside in jurisdictions where the twelve rounders are permitted may sub those at the same per-mag price. All are brand new. These will not fit any other pistol, from our knowledge, besides the CZ-83 in .380 ACP or CZ-82 in 9mm Makarov calibers only. We had to pay dearly for the CZ83 magazines even during the little heyday period, and we had to pay dearly for these as well. Single magazine price is $49 per. We’re offering these steel factory CZ magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $43 each. Own 3	 for only	$ 129.00.	
Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.
