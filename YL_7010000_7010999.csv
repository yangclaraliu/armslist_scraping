Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8” Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5” or shorter barrel. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast® Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawks popular Lady Hawk."

The gun runs flawlessly and has about 400 all brass federal rounds through it. The gun is in like new condition. The trigger is phenomenal and it runs very smooth! I am religious about keeping my guns clean.Why am I'm selling it? I found a great deal on a Beretta DT11 over/under that I can't pass up and my wife will not let me buy it unless I sell some other guns first. I only purchased this pistol as a fun range gun so it's going to go. I'll also be listing some other great guns over the next few days to appease the banker.What's the gun come with? Gun comes with everything seen. This includes the lock, paperwork, cleaning kit, etc. The magazines are high capacity so they are included if your state allows it. I also installed talon grips on it about a week ago. It's the rubber texture instead which I highly prefer. I haven't even shot it with the talon grips yet!Price includes shipping from my FFL to your FFL. My price is higher than retail because it includes shipping costs and FFL on my end.If you have any questions let me know. I'm traveling a fair amount right now so if you'd like specific pictures let me know and I'll get them to you as soon as I can. Thanks!"

I'm unsure of it's date of manufacture, but it's it's in the 460 serial range. The bluing is fairly well worn from years of use/carry. It was my one of my grandfathers guns he passed down to me and as much as I'd rather not sell it I have my own financial obligations I need to meet so it has to go. Internally it's in great shape, the lands and grooves are immaculate and highly visible, it only has one magazine(Triple K makes reporductions), and has original wood grips with what looks like a brass colt logo stamped into them. The proof markings are still visible and legible too. I'm asking for $400 cash. I'm not really interested in any sort of trade offers on the gun as money is the chief concern here but for the right gun I might do the trade. But please no hunting rifles/shotguns or AR-15 stuff. Only AR-15 thing I'd be interested in is a .300 Blackout AR-15 pistol or rifle. I am only dealing locally, but if you live out of state and really want it, $500 and I'll provide shipping and insurance. You can text or call me at REDACTED and ask for Chris if calling. This is my personal number and if I dont respond straight away I will reply as soon as possible. I'm rarely away from the phone except when working or sleeping. By phone is the prefered method of contact but I do check emails fairly regularly but I may be slower to reply."

I converted this from regular field gun into this pretty awesome weapon. I don't need to sell it but I had fun building it and want to do another one with a few changes. I have $275 in the gun I got a pawn shop, $225 in the Cerakote finish, plus over $375 in new magazine extension/spring, new skull crusher choke tube extender, new metal follower, 7 shot side saddle, Hogue hard rubber forend, Mesa Tactical pistol buttstock, and barrel clamp. This isn't a gun for someone who wants a light gun. This is pretty heavy fully loaded out and with 7 in the side saddle. It holds 11+1 2/34"" shells , plus the 7 so that is 19 shells on the gun, almost an entire box. It will demolish a sheet of plywood with buckshot and it's incredible to watch when all 11 are shot quickly. If you don't have long arms you won't want this gun. The empty weight is 9.2 lbs and loaded out with 7 in the side saddle it's about 11.4 lbs. This is a headturner when you go to the range and empty it.  Price is FIRM. If I don't sell it I'l keep it in my collection and just do another one. Local pickup in Jacksonville only. I will need a copy of your FLDL and I will do a bill of sale.  If it's listed I still have it."

The frame is aluminum alloy, and the slide and barrel are carbon steel. The defining feature of this pistol is the 'tip-up' barrel. The barrel pivots on a pin under the muzzle so that the chamber may be loaded with the slide in the closed position. This simplifies loading, unloading, and checking load status. Beretta only made the model 20 from 1983 till 1985. Payment Options:The quickest and easiest method of payment is moneygramm/westernunion or money order.

No letter code, so one of the first 10,000 by Erfurt. The bore is excellent. The rifling is 60%. The pistol still shoots and functions fine. Not that anyone will probably ever shoot it. I only test fired a clip of brass cased ammo. Included with this is a 1916(at least that is what I can decipher by the Roman numeral stamp) holster made by G. Shroters in Munchen, Germany. The leather and stitching are in great shape. Comes with 2 magazines. One is totally original with an unnumbered wooden bottom. The second is original but MAY have a wooden replacement bottom.
