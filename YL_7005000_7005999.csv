To me the Vepr is the highest quality production Kalashnikov pattern rifles on the market. of course with the new santions they are now banned from importation. The rifle has the 23"" barrel, SVD style flashhider and furnture and the quality being a Vepr. There is some polishing on the trigger but nothing else. I'm not original owner but I've never shot it and dont believe it has been fired. There is some normal wear on the bolt carrier from the action being tried out but rails and everything else looks new. I bought it to have something different to hunt with, since the 54R will pretty much take out any North American big game, but have other projects and just dont have room for it right now. This rifle was manufactured in 2013 so it was built in Russia then imported. Comes with the ammo, two factory 5 round magazines, bipod, manual, and cleaning rod. Priced out it comes up around five hundred dollars more than I'm asking and since its pre ban the value will probably go up. thanks for looking."

Only thinking of trading maybe selling because I prefer revolvers for carry and I really don't shoot 9mm that often. I would prefer to trade but I would also consider selling so let me know. I will be using a FFL for my transfer to save a personal one and I will pay my own fee, flexible on what FFL to meet at but I would prefer a fee of $35 or less. All Federal and MA laws will be followed. Thanks and if you have any questions just ask."
