The bore is very clean; lands are getting dull but plenty of rifling left and a nice shine to the bore. This is the early 3-shot version. Most were converted to 5 shot. I will include a 3-shot clip (new manufacture from AV Ballistics). The barrel and the receiver do match, and not force matched either. Bolt however does not match. Dated 1917. I have taken the gun completely apart and cleaned all the grease and gunk out of it (there was alot when I got it). Bolt has a new spring in it as the older one was weak and in pieces. I have a bayonet/scabbard to go with it, sold separately for $150. The only problem with this gun is that there is a wood replacement piece (arsenal job) that is loose behind the tang. When shooting, it may pop out. Easily remedied with a screw or wood glue; I will leave that to you. I will ship on your dime to FFL or C&R. $450 OBO. If you can find a 3-shot carbine selling for cheaper, let me know and maybe we can talk about price a bit."

It currently wears the desert camo livery, though if desired, I can outfit it in standard issue black furniture. The camo appealed to me, but it shows some use. It's not original to the gun, of course. Sure, you can get a PSA shelf-parts gun for $500, but where's the fun in that? There are few Dalphon guns out there and only six people with lower serial numbers. Seriously, when was the last time you saw a single digit gun, eh? C'mon, you know you want it...FTF preferred.
