Also, this pistol has the circular ""SIG"" Logo engraved on top of the slide, as well as, the UID Label Stickers (like on the MK-25 Navy P-226) However, I did not like the look of them so I removed them, but I still have BOTH of the TWO matching UID Labels still if you would like to stick them back on the frame depending on your personal preference.. The reason for these UID Labels (just like on the P-226 Navy models) is since these M11-A1 models are what is issued to the United States Air-Force Fighter Pilots, (just like the P-226 MK-25 models are issued to the Navy Seals) and if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for anyone! It is Double-Action/Single-Action with both the hammer and the de-cocker lever on the side, and it also has the Sig Sauer SRT Trigger System as well! It is in IMMACULATE condition with ZERO blemishes or scuffs and has had ONLY just 250rounds fired through in TOTAL since bought brand new so it is still INCREDIBLY tight and not broke in yet AT ALL!! Still needs multiple range-trips to get her broken into and out of that ""brand new"" tightness feeling!! I have put much into this with the upgraded Night/Day Sights and beautiful BlackWood Grips so the price for EVERYTHING included is $850cash! Or $770 WITHOUT the BlackWood Grips.. However, any trade offers must be valued at around $1,000Thanks for looking!!"

This is a tool guy's tool. Very heavy duty, and weighing in at 1-3/4 lbs, this wrench is not going to break. And at 1/5 of the Knights cost, when they are not out of stock, you get performance, durability and affordability. Just like the KAC wrench, you will need the normal URX wrench to insert into the many teeth side, which will be positioned away from the barrel nut.  Price is 96.85, including shipping. USPS MO, or PayPal G&S preferred. Return for refund if not happy, less 15% restocking - I know you will love this. Handling may take a few days, as I work out of town often, so pls be patient."

Despite this, we like the rifle. It has a been-there-done-that look, the age is honest, there is only one significant repair and we think it could be improved... The rifle looks to have had a lot of handling in its years of service, with poor storage. The screw heads are moderately tooled but serviceable (some replaced). The markings are VERY light. Overall, this rifle rates in about Good condition and has enough age over the refinish that we don't mind it."

The stand disasembles for easy storage and travel to the range. The gongs are all in good shaps with no dents, holes, or cracks... with a can of spray paint you could make the gongs look unused. I built this stand in August 2015 but have only used it about half a dozen times, unfortunately I do not have the time to use it as much as I hoped I would so I've decided to sell it. I'm asking $150 for the whole setup which is just about what I paid for the five AR500 steel gongs alone, the stand cost about $80-$100 in materials from home depot.

I am including a very nice Buscadero belt and holster for those would be quick draw artists.  I really hate to sell this fine pistol but I have reached the age where I need to start downsizing my gun collection.  I hope that whoever buys this gun will love it as much as I do."

It's a great shooting pistol. - Texas star VS grips- Wilson Combat kydex owb holster. - Two 7 rd magazines - Original box and all of the gear.Im asking $850 for everything. The pistol is clean and well maintained. I took it to the range once and carried it once before putting it in the safe. It still gets a wipe down every month or two. I'd rather sell, but if you have something interesting to trade let me know. Text works best. 817-889-24Seven8 Must be a Texas resident, 21 years of age or older, legal to own a firearm and LTC/CHL holder or a bill of sale will be needed. Thanks."
