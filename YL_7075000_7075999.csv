The Walther PPQ M1 is great for self defense and target training at the range. The M1 features a European style ambidextrous magazine paddle release. The PPQ M1 is the result of an updated and improved Walther P99 which predated the PPQ by 15 years. The PPQ M1 debuted back in 2011 and was an enhanced version of the P99 RAD for the Polish Military. The main difference from the P99 is the absence of the chamber indicator located on the back of the slide. The PPQ does away with this feature and just adds a back plate similar to other striker fired handguns. The Walther PPQ features ambidextrous slide release levers that are low profile and easy to manipulate in either hand. The most notable difference is the trigger system. The P99 has two different trigger modes depending on which version you purchase.  The PPQ features the QDT trigger or (Quick Defense Trigger) which basically means that the trigger system includes a safety tang in the middle of the trigger so that if you don't position your finger properly on the trigger the gun will not fire, nor will it fire if it is dropped. The Walther PPQ M1 comes with two 15 round magazines, a magazine loader, and interchangeable back straps.  If you are in the market for a high quality, fully featured handgun with fantastic ergonomics and an exceptional trigger, then look no further than the Walther PPQ M1 9mm."

Built around a 9”, Cold Hammer Forged barrel that is fluted along with a target crown and a standard pistol-length gas system, this versatile, high-performance rifle is the complete package, accurately delivering both subsonic and supersonic projectiles downrange with unrelenting reliability. Because the suppressor is an integral part of the barrel, this weapon system is ready for service right out of the box. There’s no attaching a suppressor and wondering if it’s mounted correctly and/or properly aligned. There’s no re-zeroing for suppressed vs. unsuppressed fire.  The DDM4ISR’s integral suppressor extends the barrel to an NFA-required 16 inches in length, so this platform is not classified as a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR) and therefore only requires a single tax stamp (for the suppressor). The suppressor’s lightweight outer tube is constructed of durable, heat-resistant metal alloys and coated with a protective high-temperature Cerakote-C finish, which is able of withstanding extreme temperatures and harsh environments. The suppressor is also user-serviceable, so its baffle core can be easily removed for periodic cleaning in order to maintain peak performance.   The DDM4ISR comes standard with Daniel Defense’s MFR XL 15.0 modular handguard, which features a continuous 1913 Picatinny rail on its top, for the mounting of iron sights or optics, and Keymod attachment points on the sides and bottom. This longer, multi-functional handguard, in conjunction with a Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip, make the DDM4ISR as ergonomic and maneuverable as it is versatile. We will ship anywhere in the ConUSA for $45.  You must be legally permitted to own this rifle.  You are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations.  Thanks for looking!"

Along with the pistol the sale will include the factory plastic S&W case with all the grip inserts, documents, lock, etc. (5) 17 round M&P 9mm magazines, all very lightly used. A G-Code Incog appendix carry holster made custom to fit with the Streamlight TLR-1/HL attached and a G-Code magazine taco with the belt clip. Also included will be roughly 150 rounds of American Eagle 124gr. FMJ 9mm and the Streamlight TLR-1/HL along with six or so brand new CR123A batteries also Streamlight branded. The pistol has only been taken out and shot a couple of times, round count is less than 250 and I am the original owner. Every time the pistol was shot it was cleaned immediately afterwards and has only been lubricated with slip2000 from Bravo Company. Anyone that has any experience with G-Code products knows that the wait times on this holster and many others averages between 6 and 8 weeks and as far as a kydex holster is concerned you really cant get better quality. Same goes for the mag pouch, it is fully adjustable and will hold anything from a single stack 9mm shield magazine up to a large double stack 45acp, maybe bigger/smaller idk. I've listed this at a price that is a complete steal, the pistol alone will run you $650+ from Buds and there are well over $400 in accesories and ammo included so my price is firm.I am willing to travel anywhere in the state for an extra cost, it won't be much but it won't be free. If this isn't sold this coming week the listing will be removed and I will be keeping it as it is currently my favorite EDC. Buyer must have a valid KY drivers license, CCDW preferred but not required. Thank you for looking, you may call/text me at REDACTED, my name is Josh."

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected. The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. We will ship anywhere in the ConUSA for $35.  You must be legally permitted to own this pistol.  You are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations.  Thanks for looking!"

More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc.
