I am the 2nd. owner and I just took this on a trade.

I got it hoping I could talk my Fiance' into wanting to carry concealed.  No go... darn.
I may just keep it for myself even though I have ape hands, this handsome little guy is quite manageable and concealable.

It comes with the original case, mag, Sig holster, dual tone with beautiful wood grips, paperwork and cable lock.  It also as I mentioned is a Custom Shop edition which includes the deburring and smoothing out of all the sharp edges on the slide etc.  Very solid, and well built little gun.  It has the angle of a 1911 plus it is single action only.  Very nice trigger also with very bright Sig night sights.  I may sell for $800 cash obo or will trade for something a tad bigger of the same value or boot my way only.
Please no lowballers.  Look this gun up.  For its condition and lack of rounds fired it's still very much like new.  I'll keep it before letting it go for cheap.  It's actually growing on me a lot.  But if someone offers me something I may like more, I'm willing to pry my hands off of it.  Thank you for looking and may God bless you and yours.

TOO BAD FOR ALL YOU LOW-BALLERS...YOU MISSED OUT ON A FINE WEAPON! 

This one sold on 9/19 for $450 without a batted eye to a REALLY COOL former marine and new friend! This guy really knew his stuff about S & W weapons and their value. Particularly the model 6946. He told me that he would have expected to pay more for this particular weapon, and so he jumped at the $450.00 price I was asking! 

Obviously HE wasn't like the LOW-BALLING IDIOTS on here who try on a daily basis as a ""business"" to steal guns from legitimate owners! These lowlife LOW-BALLERS prey on sellers  by hoping to find one who may be in financial peril, steal the gun from the seller with a ridiculous low offer, and then re-sale the gun later for a profit for themselves. 

That's the tactic of someone like a maggot pawn shop operator! It takes a REAL SCUMBAG to take advantage of and feed off someone's financial dismay, especially by making a ridiculous offer hoping the seller is desperate and hurting enough to take it! What you LOW-BALLERS don't realize is that there's a lot of guys like me here on AL who buy and trade guns as a hobby...not because we need money...we do it just because we love guns!

In MY book, LOW-BALLERS are SCUMBAGS plain and simple. And they're too stupid to realize that they de-value the entire Armslist re-sale and trading market by being the assholes that they are!! 

All you good people out there selling and trading on Armslist should make a stand against the low-ballers on Armslist by not even acknowledging them! Just do like I did in my ad by saying in print... ""BUYERS adored...LOWBALLERS ignored!"" or ""B.A.L.I."" (Right below your phone number!)

This is not some store bought watered down neutered copy of the real thing or a home build built to milspec this is the real deal built by FN for the United States Military. If you've ever seen an FN M16A2 you will instantly recognize this and the markings to be authentic. It is in very good condition with only a few scratches on the dust cover. It did not ""fall off some truck"" or go missing from an armory. This unit was legally aquired by me and has a bill of sale from the issuing agency to prove it. It was used very little and slated for replacement by the M4. I dont know when it was manufactured but I purchased it in 1999, and the receipt said the agency aquired it in 1993. The Bolt carrier is not original and is a Daniel Defense M16 carrier. I have 3 handguards for it being the vintage triangle, the original round, and a Daniel Defense omega rail free float. It also has removable rails installed on the sight base. The original A2 flashhider/comp is installed. It has a cheap leapers 6 power scope mounted on the carry handle but I will include a Z bar mount with a Bushnell elite 10 power 3200 scope on quick detach ringsand a simple red dot holographic sight. It also has a Surefire flashlight mounted on the handguard. Included is a M203 handguard with the flip sight and a Carryhandle mount M203 sight since it has a havoc ""flare launcher"" with 10 smoke and 10 flare projectiles. A standard G.I. bayonet and sling will also be included. The round handguards have removable rails and an extra rail set for the flare launcher is also included. It has a GPS ALUMINUM grip pod bipod/forgrip as well.

Lower: Rock River Arms LAR-15 DEA contract lower with Armalite 6 position Milspec buffer tube and carbine buffer. Is currently configured with Slidefire OGR 1st gen stock but a regular M4 style collapsable Smith & Wesson stock with cheek risers and monopod recoil pad is included as well as an M16A1 bakelite stock. I can throw in an A1/A2 receiver extension and rifle buffer tube if you prefer me to install it. 

Magazines: Ten 20 round aluminum G.I., ten 30 round aluminum G.I., ten 40 round black Pmags, one surefire 60 round quad stack, and one 100 round beta drum. YOU will be responsible for knowing if magazine restrictions preclude your aquireing these. Military and LEOs will be required to show credentials, and if face to face in Ohio a valid state issued I.D. will be required. I will ship from my F.F.L. to your F.F.L. for a flat rate of $50.00 CONUS. 

Case: I was able to fit everything (except the flares of course) in a plano double scope rifle hard plastic case so I will include it with the purchase and if shipped will ship the flares seperate.

I must have went overboard with the descriptions because i am unable to upload pics so feel free to message me thru armslist for pictures/questions. I will be listing this on gunbroker shortly as well so you may be able to view it easier on there. This has been appraised at $3000.00 replacement value so I will list it as $3000.00 or best offer. I do not need this but I dont need to sell it either so please be respectful with offers. I am also not really interested in trades but may consider partial trades with cash added."

I HATE TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS TO ALL THE LOW-BALLERS...BUT YOU LOW-BALLERS MISSED OUT ON A FINE WEAPON BY BEING IDIOTS! 

This one sold on 9/19 for $450 without a batted eye to a REALLY COOL former marine and new friend! This guy really knew his stuff about S & W weapons and their value. Particularly the model 6946. He told me that he would have expected to pay more for this particular weapon, and so he jumped at the low price I was asking! 

Obviously HE wasn't like the LOW-BALLING IDIOTS on here who try on a daily basis as a ""business"" to steal guns from legitimate owners! These lowlife LOW-BALLERS prey on sellers who may be in financial peril, steal the gun from the seller with a ridiculous low offer, and then re-sale the gun later for a profit for themselves. 

That's the tactic of someone like a maggot pawn shop operator! It takes a REAL SCUMBAG to take advantage of and feed off someone's financial dismay, by making a ridiculous offer hoping the seller is desperate and hurting enough to take it! What you LOW-BALLERS don't realize is that there's a lot of guys like me here on AL who buy and trade guns as a hobby...not because we need money...we do it just because we love guns!

In MY book, LOW-BALLERS are pure SCUMBAGS plain and simple that are too stupid to realize that they de-value the entire Armslist re-sale and trading market for EVERYONE including THEMSELVES by doing what they're doing! 

All you good people out there selling and trading on Armslist should make a stand against the low-ballers on Armslist by not even acknowledging them! Just do like I did in my ad by saying in print... ""BUYERS adored...LOWBALLERS ignored!"" or ""B.A.L.I."" (Right below your phone number!) Maybe then the LOW-BALLERS will get the message and hopefully not ruin this great 2nd Amendment backing red-blooded AMERICAN site!"

This like new Kimber Stainless Pro Raptor II 4""  is no exception.  The highly desired Raptor series of handguns comes from the custom Kimber shop, where they are hand fitted for superior craftsmanship. The raptor series in particular is highly regarded for its blend of form and function.  The pro series is the 4"" commander size and sports a match grade stainless bull barrel for superior accuracy, especially when using the Novak night sights.  I am the original owner, purchased brand new @ 2 years ago.  I have replaced the factory plastic main spring housing with a custom matching stainless Ed Brown mainspring housing that matches the Raptor theme amazingly well(I will include the original plastic mainspring housing).  The Kimber has @100 rounds through her, she has been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated, she would pass a white glove inspection right now easily. I cannot emphasize enough how good of condition the Kimber is in, I have literally seen brand new firearms at the gun counter with more handling marks or factory flaws.  I will include 1 brand new factory upgrade Kimber Pro-Tac 8 round magazine, with all factory rubber base plates and original packaging. This is an upgrade from the original Maxine that comes with these Raptors typically, and many fever these Pro-Tac mags to be some of the best available.  I am also including a new package of x4 Kimber takedown tools, these are a proprietary tool used for disassemble of the Kimber commander series handguns. I am also including the original hard case, original recipt of purchase (4/12/12) and all paperwork. 

I paid right at $1,400 for the Kimber and the few upgrades(Ed brown Mainspring Housing $75, Pro-Tac magazine $35, takedown tool set $10, pro Raptor stainless $1,279.95).

This Kimber has spent its entire life in a climate controlled safe and is from a non smoking home, it will not disappoint!!!!

Only reason for sale is to switch to a 5"" style 1911. I'm addicted to 1911s after owning and shooting this girl.  I am not in a huge hurry to sell, I buy nice things and I take excellent care of them I have it listed for what I want out of it and what I think is fair.

Sale to Ohio residents only, CCW or LE preferred. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. 

I have prices this Kimber very fair and far below what othera are asking. This is a no haggle price.

More specifically the H&K VP9 LE, or a standard VP9 with night sights but I will also settle for a glock 17.

The Pistol has the thumb safety but it is no longer ambidextrous and I had to dremmel off the right side lever(Left hand thumb) to fit the Crimson Trace on (No damage and looks natural).  Pistol has around 300-ish rounds through it, I've never had any malfunctions with it. Its cleaned bi weekly unless I take it to the range in which point I clean it immediately afterwards.  Any questions or requests for more pictures I can be txted at 618-three1zero-5three5zero.
The Listed price is firm for if I can't get a trade for the VP9 then I must buy one.
I love this gun with all my heart and its a damned shame I've made my decision to trade it, but its for my career (therefor my family's well being).

I'm selling this setup because I don't handload anymore. All of the equipment is 1 year old or newer. None of the items I have listed are broken, there is NO slop or movement in the press or powder measure, everything has been properly lubed and taken care of. The 9MM dies and Bullet Puller Die are currently setup in the press and dialed in to properly flare, seat and crimp a 147 GR 9MM bullet. These are top notch quality items and if you know anything about handloading you know that the prices that I'm asking for these items is a steal! I'm willing to negotiate, there's a little bit of wiggle room here.

I haven't shot it since it was purchased.

The philosophy behind this build was to keep the weight low without compromising on components critical to a precision build.

Barrel:
18-inch SPR profile barrel w/ .223 Wylde Chamber (i.e. can shoot both .223 and 5.56 safely), 1:7 twist. I believe it is from White Oak Armament.

Lower:
LMT (Lewis Machine and Tool) Lower Receiver with enhanced Mil-Spec Trigger (very crisp pull) and ambidextrous safety selector. LMT branded Ergo Grip that feels very comfortable in the hand. 

Upper:
Midwest Industries SS12 Gen 2 Free-float Handguard with top rail; Handguard and barrel have been color-matched and Cerakoted OD Green; Optional 3-inch rails (not shown) are included (one of the modular rails has a built-in QD sling attachment, if you prefer that style). 
Factory bipod stud and sling swivel pre-installed and ready for Harris-style bipod without the need for a separate expensive rail mount that will add extra weight to the fore-end. 

Stock:
B5 SOPMOD Bravo Buttstock. VERY good fit, no play on extension tube.

Misc:
BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle; YHM (Yankee Hill Machine) muzzle device; removable Troy ambi QD sling attachment (behind endplate).
Troy Flip-up Iron Sights.
Custom-engraved dust cover. Shows Gadsden snake with text ""Don't Tread On Me"" when closed; ""This End Toward Enemy"" with Arrow when open. If you prefer a more conservative look and less tongue-in-cheek humor, I can replace it with a  standard dust cover.

Bipod and optics are NOT included.

This is a very handsome rifle, but make no mistake - it's a serious work horse built from top-shelf parts, and it WILL shoot sub-MOA if you do your part.

It's best to feed this rifle heavier grain (~77) bullets for serious precision work.
If you're just plinking at 100 yards, she seems to love the cheap 55-grain Federal American Eagle .223.

Asking $1650 for the rifle only (i.e. bipod and scope not included). Price is negotiable, so make me an offer.

The 1.6mm version of this rifle has not been imported for some time, as they have gone to the less expensive 1mm receiver. the barrel on the rifle is a heavy/thicker material than most AK barrels and it is chrome lined along with the gas piston. This gun has only had about 150 rounds put down the tube, and the only markings on the rifle are from the safety (which is par for any AK). The rifling is still very strong given the very small amount of use this gun has seen, so it is good to go without any modifications. The trigger has also been polished and refined so it is a very smooth pull and lighter than most AK's on the market. The trigger actually gives my Smith and Wesson AR15 a run for it's money with what feels like less than a 3.5lb pull. The receiver also has space for a double hook trigger group to be mounted as these slots are already cut into the frame.

Along with the rifle you will also get 2 steel 30 round magazines, 160 rounds of ammo with both FMJ and JHP, and an installed no-slip sling. I fired the 90 rounds one magazine at a time, and the rifle was cleaned after each range trip, even though that is not completely needed with an AK. Let me know what you're offer is and we can talk from there. Blue Book value shows this gun at 90% is worth $750, and since the only mark on the weapon is from the safety, I'd say it was closer to 96% at least. I'm selling for well under blue book value so I assure you I am not attempting to gouge anyone with my price. I'm also flexible so gimme an offer! For trades I'd like to get close to the blue book value of $785. For cash I'd accept $700 OBO. Trades plus cash will fall into the second category.

So close were the designs that AMT was taken to court by Ruger for Patent Infringement. That court case terminated the AMT Production line.

AMT production ran from 1986 through 1993.  Their production facility was located in Covina, California.  The AMT Lightning match pistol is said to be one of the most accurate and reliable pistols of its kind.  This 6-inch bull barrel has a fixed blade front sight and an adjustable Millet rear sight.  This pistol has black rubber grips, a custom target trigger, is in very good to excellent condition and has a low round count. It also comes with four-10 round magazines.

One of which is the saught after Taiwanese version. These are clones of the Dalton Cupid a $450-600 knife. These knives have just been used as display items. They were never carried or used at all so they are still factory condition and sharp. I relubed them with high end synthetic gun lubricant anf also backed out the screws and added loctite as they fire so hard the screws tended to back out which is no longer an issue. They work better than when they arrived now. For those not familiar these knive blade shoot out and lock with the press of a button and became popular after their appearance with the Joker in the Dark Knight Batman series. They are very cool and these are two very functional pieces which are a lot of fun to play with but they are sharp so be very careful.

From the SA site:

The XD® 3” Sub-Compact from Springfield Armory® is designed to bring you the most in a concealed carry pistol. Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.

The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, (9+1 of .40SW) with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.
