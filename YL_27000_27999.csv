265,http://www.armslist.com/posts/27265,"For Sale:  Bulgarian Makarov with LOTS of extras: price reduced, pics added","Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 380,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 24, 2010",Handguns,Walther                                                                                ,9mm Makarov                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a ""Makarov Arsenal"" Bulgarian Makarov chambered in 9 X 18 and it is in beautiful condition.  This is not one of those CAI Maks with the crude engraving on the slide, no, the fit and finish on this one is better than many of the East German Maks I've seen.  Importer is K&G, and the slide was reblued over the stamp.  This pistol appears to be in ""like new"" excellent condition.

I have a lot of extras to go with this piece.

First, I believe I have an example of almost every grip ever made for the Makarov, including custom grips.  They are as follows:

1. Custom hand carved checkered rosewood grip, which are on the piece now.
2. The impossible to find rubberized ""Mak-a-wrap"" grip made in limited quantites for the folks at Makarov.com about a decade ago.
3. The highly desirable black plastic East German grip, with the proper screw.
4. The red bakelite Soviet grip with lanyard ring.
5.  The thick black rubber Pearce grip.

That is 5 sets of grips with extra screws.

I also have THREE 8-rd magazines and a custom suede leather pocket holster to go with the Makarov.

And then there is the ammunition.  I'm guessing about 450 rounds of it:

13 rds Glaser Silver 75 gr prefragmented defense ammo
100 rds Federal 90 gr JHP
29 rds super hot Barnaul 95 gr JHP
150 rds Silver Bear 94 gr JHP
70 rds Winchester Metric 95 gr FMJ (for use at indoor ranges with ammo restrictions)
50 rds Brown Bear 94 gr FMJ
40 rds Barnaul 94 gr FMJ

I paid 325 for the Makarov last year and it was unfired by the prior owner.  I have put exactly 25 rounds down the pipe and it functioned flawlessly.  I paid about 200 for the extra grips, 45 for the extra mags, 30 for the holster, and around 300 for the ammo, so I'm figuring I've got about 900 into the entire package.

The Makarov is considered to be perhaps the most reliable and durable pistol ever made -- far more so than the Walther PP from which the Soviets developed their design.  It is DA/SA with a decocker, takedown is simple, and the capacity is 8 + 1.  The 9 X 18 round is more powerful than the 380 and can be made almost as hot as the 9mm parabellum.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a very nice Bulgie with rare ammo and rare grips 

I would like to trade for a Star BM 9mm, but may consider other compact single stack 9mm pistols or a 38 J-frame.  The only double stack 9mm I have any interest in would be a 469.  Would gladly accept boxes of quality 9mm ammunition as a partial trade (no Wolf, Prvi, or reloads).  Cash price reduced to $380.

I've always said my safe has a revolving door, but this was the only gun without a price tag. Then I decided I wanted to get back into motocross and a badass CRF450R presented itself today! So here it is....my baby.

It's a S&W M&P15T. In case you're not aware, many AR aficionados rank the M&P series of rifles among the best. There are many articles you can Google, as I did before deciding this was the one I wanted. Here is a list of goodies, both from the factory and what I've added:

    * Troy Industries Front and Rear BUIS (Factory Installed)
    * Troy Industries Mid-length Rail with Covers (Factory Installed)
    * Magpul Moe Grip (original included as well)
    * Magpul Enhanced Trigger Guard
    * 3 Magpul Windowed PMAG's with Ranger Base Plates
    * Vortex Flash Hider (original A2 birdcage included as well)
    * Larue Tactical SPR-1.5 style Scope Mount (rock solid!)
    * Vector Optics FFP 1-4x24 Scope with Dual Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle
    * Badger Tactical Charging Handle Latch
    * Vertical Fore Grip (Blackhawk, I think)

In all, I have well over $2000 into this rifle. It is 100% without flaw, as it's been in a padded case since new. This has literally been babied. I bought right after ""Dear Leader"" was inaugurated, but it was soon enough before the price gouging started. I'll probably regret selling this the instant someone says ""I'll take it"", but I can always (hopefully) get another one. I can tell you that when I do buy another AR, it will be identical to this one! Although I've only fired 270 rounds through it, I've fired enough other brands of AR's to quickly realize how good mine is. I won't compare it to Noveske or LMT or some of the other boutique manufacturers, as they're in a league of their own. You also pay much more for them.

Anyhow, here it is. I'm open to shipping from FFL to FFL or FTF if you're in the Pittsburgh area. If feedback is a concern, I have great feedback on eBay under the same screen name. I'll go to whatever lengths necessary to ensure buyer confidence. Email me and I'll give you my phone number and we can discuss further.

Asking price is $1800 OBO for the package. This includes about 500 rounds of Federal brass ammo and a tactical carry case that's in the picture. I'm also open to $1700 shipped to your FFL for everything, less the ammo. I also have the factory hard case and cardboard box it came in, as well as all documentation. I'd say, conservatively, that this package is worth about $2200, if purchased new. I'm pretty firm on the price, as I honestly don't want to sell it.

If you have any questions or would like specific photos, email me and I'll get back to you."

I'm in the process of getting it ready to dye it black.  I have purchased most of the required hardware from HDPS.org for the conversion.

 I have also added the following:

     ZF 3x4° dual optical sight that combines a 3x magnified telescopic sight (with the main reticule designed for firing at 200 m and bullet drop compensation markings for: 200, 400, 600 and 800 m cross hairs and a range-finding scale) and an unmagnified reflex red-dot sight (calibrated for firing at 200 m) mounted on top of the telescopic sight.  The red dot sight is activated by ambient light during the day and requires battery power in a zero light environment. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).

    G36 front Hand guard 

    Heckler and Koch removable folding bi-pod

    Heckler and Koch Folding butt stock

    SW AR15 magazine well conversion-Completed

    Clear Ram-Line AR15 magazine

    Heckler and Koch G36 SEF lower (with SL8 trigger group installed)

I haven't done anything with the barrel. I like the match grade quality of it too much.

The rifle is very nice shooter; it has a very smooth action. I prefer the shooting quality of this rife as compared to my AR-15. The amazing thing is you can shoot over 60 rounds through her and the changer/bolt area wont even be dirty.

Why it's for sale?
  My ultimate goal is to get a solid long range rifle.  I have been hoping to get something like a TRG-22 or a nice 700 in 308.  I also would like to get a quality scope like a Schmidt and Bender 5-25x56 PMII. All trades in different  combinations will be considered.   I believe the value of the rifle I'm selling to be in the $3,500 range as compared to what I have spent on it and what others have sold for.  Please let me know if you are interested.


  Again the gun is going to be sold with the dye job complete.

The upper is a complete $976 Yankee Hill Machine 6.8mm Black Diamond Specter which can be seen here: http://yankeehillmachine.com/store/product564.html. 1 25 round CP Industries mag is included but sights aren't. YHM makes the sickest uppers around, the diamond flutes and handguard are like nothing else out there! You must be legally able to oen this item and I will need a copy of your NMDL, thanks."

Action Work 
Our proprietary ""Old School Action Job"" 

Our factory trained technicians will perform a complete function check of your Mossberg model 500/590/590A1 before a complete disassembly of the the action. All working surfaces are de-burred, polished and hand fitted for the smoothest, fastest action possible. We will also clean and polish the inside of the magazine tube and the follower for improved feeding performance and reliability. The entire action is then treated with a heat applied metal conditioner and lubricant. The gun is reassembled, function checked again, headspace checked and fired for function. The completed action will be smooth and reliable for years to come. In fact, we warranty our action work and any replacement parts just like the factory; for 10 years. *(any required replacement parts are at parts cost only, no additional labor charge with action work) $ 75.00
Forcing Cone Lenghting and Barrel Honing & Polishing 
Our Signature Barrel Treatment

We modify the forcing cone using our proprietary profile, then hone and polish the chamber for improved extraction, and hone and polish the forcing cone and bore all the way to the muzzle to remove tight spots and manufacturing marks. The result is approximately 30% reduction in felt recoil and an improvement in the tightness and evenness of the shot pattern that has to be seen to be believed. This is where the greatest gains in barrel performance occur and our barrel performance equals or exceeds anything out there. $ 70.00
Mag-Na-Porting 
The latest EDM porting system in the industry. Elliptical metering ports electronically cut, not drilled, resulting in reduced felt recoil, reduced muzzle jump and faster follow up shots.

This is a Ruby Extra from the late fifties or early sixties. It is a good shooter and accurate ...but... the blue was bad so it is polished up (bare steel) now. It is a .38 and I would NOT run +P through this. I have used ""cowboy loads"" very successfully. It has decent lock up and a good feel in the hand. It should be a very dependable and accurate pistol but also have a  low price and virtually no collector value. It does have the original parts and grips. Note it also it has the hammer block safety system and working mechanisim of a Smith and Wesson, thus its reliability. So, yes it will safely load and carry 6 shots of .38 stopping power. But alas it is a Ruby and not a Smith so it has a low price. The perfect piece for the night table or for the occasional shooter. I am open to trade but would show preference to a cash deal. I had 2 of these but found them to be pretty good shooters so my Dad (he's 81) now has the other at his place, so yes I have faith in them for defensive use.

I'm only asking and won't take a penny less than $695. Compared to others selling for as high as $1500: it makes my gun look like a real bargain.

Colt was the first true auto pocket pistol built like a miniature 1911 that will fire the .380 auto. It operates exactly the same way as a 1911 .45 cal auto.

Easiest pistol to pocket conceal that I have ever had.

These guns are fast becoming a collector's item, and thus the prices have held up extremely well over the years.

They are loaded with Hornady's ""SST"" 165 gr. ballistic tipped bullets.  I bought this rifle 11 months ago from walmart.  I used it this past rifle season and took a total of 4 deer, using this rifle and ammo, never had to hit one twice.  I spraypainted the camo stock,  it may sound dumb, but if you've ever seen a factory savage stock,  You'll know a little paint doesn't hurt the value.  If you don't like it, you could always remove the stock and rub it with paint thinner and the paint would come right off without damaging the stock.

I was looking to do a possible trade for a 9mm that takes a clip, but would be willing to sell it. I didnt care much for the revolver part and it does not have a saftey switch. Im looking for something with a saftey. Prefer a trade.

All I can tell you is what I was told about it. The friend said that they thought it was made in the 1960's and that he didnt think they were made anymore. It belonged to his father-in-laws best friend that had passed away and that is how it came to be sold. I have included pictures and if you need better pictures or numbers off of it email me.

I paid $400 for it and would like to get that much out of it. 

UPDATE - I found this info on the web if it helps. It's a model 38

The Smith & Wesson Model 38/49 ""Bodyguard"" is a Model 36 that has a ""Camel Hump"" hammer shroud used to prevent clothing snag, as the hammer is concealed in the shroud. The Smith & Wesson Bodyguard was unusual in that the alloy framed ""Airweight"" was released to the public first as the Smith & Wesson Airweight Bodyguard in 1955. In 1957 Smith & Wesson changed the named to the Model 38. When they released the version with the steel frame, they renamed the gun again, to the Model 49 in 1959. So the early alloy framed revolvers are usually the Model 38 and the Steel framed versions are the Model 49."

I have a brand new in the box Sig 556 classic with 2 30round clips and a red dot scope to mount on the picattiny rail. It was manufactured in Oct of last year. As you know and is also the reason I bought this gun is because if you have to choose a gun to protect your life it should be the most reliable, accurate and multi-purpose weapon available. It isn't the cheapest but it is absolutely the best. They tested this gun by firing 10,000 rounds through it. They submersed the gun in water, sand and dirt during this 10,000 round challenge and the gun never misfired.

The CETME was designed by the Spanish and later ripped off by the Germans to create their G3 or HK 91 rifles.  This model was imported and placed on a Century Arms receiver (because all the dumb import laws.)  There are many variations in the CETME rifles.  Some are junk but others are excellent rifles.  The one I have for sale is a well made rifle.  It has a solid stainless steel cast receiver...not the sheet metal stamp job that you'll see on most.  It has wood furniture, and has been stained and lacquered to make it look very nice.  All the Metal on this weapon matches (another rare trait on CETMEs).
I have 3-20rnd mags, and 1-30rnd mag.  Also have a B-Square scope mount (very solid).

I've lowered my asking price to $600.  I'm mostly trying to sell the rifle but I will consider the following for trades.

I'm interested in a nice flat top AR upper receiver. specifically: 1-7 twist chrome lined threaded barrel.  Receiver must be mat black.

The CETME was designed by the Spanish and later ripped off by the Germans to create their G3 or HK 91 rifles.  This model was imported and placed on a Century Arms receiver (because all the dumb import laws.)  There are many variations in the CETME rifles.  Some are junk but others are excellent rifles.  The one I have for sale is a well made rifle.  It has a solid stainless steel cast receiver...not the sheet metal stamp job that you'll see on most.  It has wood furniture, and has been stained and lacquered to make it look very nice.  All the Metal on this weapon matches (another rare trait on CETMEs).
I have 3-20rnd mags, and 1-30rnd mag.  Also have a B-Square scope mount (very solid).

I've lowered my asking price to $600.  I'm mostly trying to sell the rifle but I will consider the following for trades.

I'm interested in a nice flat top AR upper receiver. specifically: 1-7 twist chrome lined threaded barrel.  Receiver must be mat black.

It is a Smith & Wesson M&P15 lower with a DPMS lower parts kit. A TAPCO 6 position collapsable stock is installed on it. A Phantom flash hider has been permanently installed to bring the length of the barrel over 16', which makes it not fall under the National Firearms Act as a short barreled rifle.

I assembled this rifle myself, so I know the craftsmanship is good and that it is fully functional. I built it to keep, but I acquired another AR in the mean time, so this one is up for sale. There has not been a SINGLE round fired through this weapon, brand new! You may find cheaper AR's, but they are NOT LMT and S&W quality! No sense buying junk rifles!

I am accepting trades (partial or whole) for the rifle. I am interested in a high power Savage or Remington 700 with a synthetic stock and bull barrel, but I will consider anything

Make an offer on the rifle, everything reasonable will be considered. Don't waste my time or yours trying to low ball. It's not going to happen!

I also have 4 MIL-Spec magazines and a rear iron sight for sale if interested"
