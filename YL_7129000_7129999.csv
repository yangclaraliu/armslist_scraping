With threaded barrel, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazine. The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to CZ's polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations.  Introduced in 2009, the CZ P-07 was the first handgun to feature the convertible Omega trigger system. A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools. The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.  Product Name:    CZ P-07 Urban Grey Suppressor-ReadySKU           91288Firearm Type      HandgunChambering       9mm LugerMagazine Capacity          17Magazine Type Double StackFrame   Urban Grey PolymerGrips     StippledTrigger Mech     Omega DA/SASights    High Tritium Three-DotBarrel    Cold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length     4.36 inWeight 28.7 ozOverall Length  7.9 inHeight  5.8 inWidth   1.46Safety   Interchangeable Ambidextrous, Decocker/Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety"

AR MAGLOCK solution allows the shooter to re-insert a magazine while the upper and lowers receivers (the action) are closed or open, allowing for faster magazine changes. Allows you to have the ejection port cover open or closed when closing the action, the competition only allows this with the port door closed, causing even slower operation. Does not scratch your upper receiver with an adjustment screw like competition does. Last but certainly not least, AR MAGLOCK also has finger knurling for excellent grip in any and all weather conditions, in addition to coming with the knurled grip tacticool rear take-down pin and accompanying split ring for quick pull operation.  AR MAGLOCK – AR-10 Fixed Magazine Lock and Release Solution. If you purchased this AR-10/.308 kit from us, you do NOT need the Wide Receiver Adapter Kit, the spacer and longer screw are already included. This kit does come with a rear take-down pin but, because .308 lower receivers are so differing in their pin diameter sizing, ours only fits about 50% of the firearms in the market. We can NOT guarantee our pin will fit your lower receiver!"

The gun is in excellent condition, and has seen somewhere between 400-500 rounds. It has been babied since the day I bought it, and cleaned after each range trip. The gun has never malfunctioned in any way. This is an awesome bullpup, and a great addition to any collection out there. The gun does not come with the optic/mount, but does come with everything from factory. I am the original owner.Have you heard about X95s not being accurate? That is simply not true. Don't be fooled by the rumors, this is not a precision rifle. It is a CQB rifle that will do everything you ask of it. It is as accurate, if not more, as your rack grade AR15. With the 1-4 optic on the gun, I was consistently hitting a 10"" plate at 300 yards.As far as trades, I am only looking for Steyr AUGs. Do not offer any MSARs. I really want an OD Green AUG, but Mud or White are fine. Rail length and height are not much of a concern. The top of the list is one with an original 1.5x optic that is cast in the receiver. I can include the optic/mount if need be, cash as well. Let me know what you have and we can work something out.I am a valid CCW holder, and will require a bill of sale be filled out."

Colt first introduced the 16"" LE6940 and 14.5"" LE6944 back in 2009. Basically, they were semi-only versions of the model that Colt had submitted for the 'SCAR' trials a few years earlier. This means they had several new and advanced features for the time, and were built to meet the demands of the United States military. Today, Colt doesn't make many LE6940/6944s each year, but they do still release them occasionally This carbine has a true monolithic top rail, which runs as a single continuous piece from the back of the receiver out to the gasblock. The gasblock itself is of the low profile pattern, with a folding adjustable front sight made of metal; not polymer. The gas system is carbine length, with a straight tube. The metal railed handguard is a Colt proprietary part. It allows the barrel to be free floated, has both side rails with QD sling socket points, is ventilated for cooling and weight reduction, and has a bottom rail which is removable for attaching accessories or for cleaning/maintenance. Other features include: M16A2/M4 style birdcage flash hider, NATO spec."
