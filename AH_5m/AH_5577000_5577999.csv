Double or single action semi automatic. Very reliable hammer action, conversion kits sold to make it a .22, perfect for females or a fun day at the range with the kids. This is one of my personal favorites, bought a new gun last night so it's time to part with this one. WILL NOT SELL TO PERSONS UNDER 18, a valid drivers license and Concealed Carry license must be shown and xeroxed. New slide springs replaced not to long ago. Guns fires straight, easy to cycle, unlike composite fire arms. This pistol really is perfect for a woman. eBay has tons of diffrent grips to costimize and make your own. Thanks for looking Steve"

9mm Sub-Compact. Comes with three 10 round magazines and one 12 round magazine. Original case with all the paperwork and extras. Night Sights. Crimson Trace Laserguard LG-436. And a Crossbreed Supertuck Deluxe IWB Holster.
This gun is perfect for conceal carry. Anytime you add a laser or light to a handgun, it makes finding a holster that works very difficult. The Crossbreed included was made for the Crimson Trace laser that is attached. Works very well, retains the pistol securely and is very comfortable to wear all day long.
 If you were to go into a gun store and buy all of this new, you would be spending well over $800. But I am willing to let it go for $550, or best offer. You are basically getting the laser, holster, and two extra magazines for free! I am looking for cash, but will consider trades. Please contact me with any questions or for more pictures."

It a 9mm designed for IDPA or USPSA shooting. It has the heavier Brigadier slide to help reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip. It has night sights. The G model means it is the de-cocker only model. No manual safety like a regular Beretta 92 FS. It operates more like a Sig 226 in that the de-cocker will drop the hammer safely, but the gun is still ready to fire in double action. These are very hard to find, Beretta no longer makes them. It is very similar in set up to the new Wilson Combat Custom Berettas. Comes with original case and two magazines. I got it intending to use it to shoot IDPA, but I have a Glock 34 that I am able to shoot better with. So the Beretta just sits in the safe. It is time it finds a new owner that will use it as intended! I have some bills I need to pay so I am motivated to sell. Looking for $750 or best offer. I will also consider trades.

I reinstalled the original base plates for use on a full-size pistol, but I will include the four additional 10-round magazine base plates if you want to set up all 4 magazines for a compact pistol.This unit fit my PCR perfectly with no modifications.  It required a very modest adjustment for my SP-01 Tactical, and I was EXTREMELY conservative and stayed with a tight fit as seen by the Cold Blue being ever so slightly worn off from inserting it into the SP-01.  It still fits perfectly on my PCR.  Moral of the story is I would expect this to fit most models as is, or with a little extra filing...I kept it tight on the SP-01 in case of resale and because of the perfect fit with the PCR.  I have shot 50 rounds through my SP-01 and about 120 through my PCR, so it's like new (purchased last August from CZ Custom).  I am selling b/c  I will be selling my PCR (girlfriend just cant get used to the slide) and sending my SP-01 to Cajun Gun Works for trigger mods which might make little too light for consistent use.     Price of $400 iis firm and fair, (Paid $565 plus shipping paid).
