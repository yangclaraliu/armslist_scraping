The sight is a burris fast fire 2 and works quite well on handguns. Gun was built off of the large frame SF version and has a springco recoil rod assembly in it. The spring setup was designed to shoot 460 Rowland power level loads and does so without battering the frame. I was trimming 460 brass down to 45acp length but now that Lone Wolf will chamber for 460 rowland I would send the barrel in and make it easier on yourself. A very nice pistol that packs some serious punch yet is versatile enough to fire 45acp, 45 super, and 460 rowland power levels.

It is also about 2 lbs lighter that the Sage EBR and includes three adjustable rails.You can read all the specifics on the stock at the web site: www.m14.ca/m14m1a-blackfeather-rs.htmlThe rifle has Smith Enterprises trigger parts and a trigger shoe. The trigger shoe allowes the trigger to pull straight back instead of back/up as in the original M1 design. Pulling the trigger straight back is needed for accuracy when using a stock with a grip.It has a national match barrel, front sight, and a Sadlak NM spring guide. The muzzle device is the CA legal. The stock is a MAKO Fab Defense and the cheek riser adjustable and very solid.The bipod is a Atlas clone but is a really close match and very stable.The sight mount is Basset Machine, bassetmachine.com and a riser to clear the optic. The optic is a Burris Fullfield 4-20x50 and it is supposed to be OD green but I think they missed it. It is labeled OD on the box. The Burris is in excellent condition with outstanding glass clarity.I have the original box for the rifle and optics as well as the install info for the stock.Less than 100 rounds fired.Asking 2100 for the whole setup and 1800 without the optic and mount."

AC not hooked up/working - has ac but I have never used it because I only drove with the ttops off. When you turn the ac on it blows air but not cold - I just found the belt that was removed for the ac motor in a rear storage compartment. I’m pretty confident that the front right brake caliper is sticking – so will need new brake calipers. Note: new brake lining was put on a few years ago but has not been driven often enough I do not know what condition it is in. Contact me for more detailed info. thank you."

When you purchase a gun from them you recieve these as a bonus/incentive to retur. I have found it to be quite valuable. As you know gun returns if not satisfied. You loose 50% when you walk out the door if you want your money back.I do not know if it will work for you, in the past they have allowed me to keep the pass and have reused several times. I believe it is a good arrangement. I put a deposit on a Smith & Wesson . I wanted a manual saftey. I used the pass to shoot the S&W 9mm and rented a Beretta PX storm. The beretta blew the Smith & wesson away. they applied the 500.00 deposit. and walked out with a much better gun.

Carrying an extra magazine in the appendix position can help balance the weight of the firearm, and distribute the bulge that can sometimes occur carrying AIWB. But the most important benefit is actually having an extra magazine at your disposal. Something we believe is a prudent necessity when carrying a firearm.The MK V (our latest version of this rig) is an all-in-one design. The mag carrier is canted slightly for increased comfort and easier access due to natural body mechanics. Next to the trigger guard are two holes. These holes are used to attach one of our Raptor Claws. The Claw pulls the firearm grip closer to the body for easier concealment. One Raptor Claw is provided with every Sidecar. It can be used or removed based on your preferences. Both the firearm and magazine carrier feature variable retention so you can adjust it to your preferences."

Other MK4s being sold are a combination of MOA adjustments with a mil reticle, or mil adjustments with an MOA reticle which can be a real pain. Having mil/mil adjustments with a mil reticle is very handy.It will come in the original box, but I have misplaced the manual that came with it so that may or may not be included.I’m going a different route which is why I am selling. The scope has zero issues.

This police package came from an estate sale.The revolver is a 1968 model Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. This gun has not been abused, as this is just honest wear from being on the job for many years. There is wear primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster, but there is also much evidence externally of it being a true ""on the job"" weapon. Bore and chambers on the cylinder are good and have been well maintained. After all, this officer's life depended on this gun working every time he might have to pull the trigger.The gun came to me with beautiful custom-made dark walnut with target thumb rest grips. I will include them in the sale, but the buyer has their choice of an additional pair of either Smith & Wesson wood grips or rubber Pachmayr Gripper grips. I have attached pics of the gun with the original target grips, as well as pics of both options to help you decide which of the two bonus options you prefer.I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets. The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions.$275 for the entire package. Please contact me if you would like to see the belt and holster pic and other pictures I have available."

AFFORDABLE, AMERICAN-MADE MODERN SPORTING RIFLE WITH THE RUGGED RELIABILITY THAT YOU HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM RUGER. CHAMBERED IN 5.56 NATO.    Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (model 8500 only), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. (Model 8500 only.)   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.     Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG® (model 8500 only) or one, 10-round metal magazine (model 8502)."

Made for us here in Columbia by FN Manufacturing, the barrels are high pressure tested, mag particle inspected and finished off with a taper pinned, f-marked, front sight post, standard mid handguards, and an A2 flash hider.  Upper: Forged 7075-T6 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer. Bolt Carrier Group:  For AR15 and M16 rifles and carbines.  Made in USA.  Bolt is made of Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, High pressure tested and Mag Particle Inspected.   Gas key is machined out of bar stock, chrome lined phosphate coated, and secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is phosphated outside and chrome lined inside
I added the Magpul Mlock Handguard, Magpul Rear flip up sight and a magpul mil-spec SL stock. The lower is an Auger Precision Firearms Forged Lower Made in Levittown PA by Auger Precision Firearms. The lower is complete with Spikes Tactical parts kit. Mil-spec buffer tube and assembly.  I will throw in 2 Pmags and a 200 hundred rounds of ammo.  You must be a PA resident and yes I know longs guns in PA do not need to be transferred, however I will require the transfer/background check take place at a FFL just for peace of mind. Only reason for selling I have too many Ar’s and I am using the funds for another gun build. Price is $525 no trades price is firm this a great shooting AR and not overpriced."
