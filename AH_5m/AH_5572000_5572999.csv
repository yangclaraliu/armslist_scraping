I bought this new a few years ago, it was my first and only gun. I am selling because I wish to get a Glock 43 for easier CC purposes. For your $650 you get everything in the photo:1. Glock 19 generation 3 in OD green, serial number starts with NLT. I would estimate I have put about 2000 rounds through it (never had a problem). Cleaned and oiled it diligently after every use. The grip you see in the photos is just a bike tire inner-tube, you can easily rip it off if you don’t like it. No damage, no problems with this pistol. If these photos don’t show up hi-res enough, I can email you the original photos and they will probably be better.2. Crimson Trace Laser Grip ($200 value). You will also get all of the tools that came with it, as well as the original black bar that slides through the back of the grip (not sure what you call this). You have to replace the original black bar with a slightly longer one when you install the CT.3. Four magazines ($25 value each). Three of them are Glock oem. One is KCI brand – this is the one that I use at the range and I have never had a problem.4. A lighter weight trigger connector ($20 value). I got this to try it, but preferred the original oem part. I believe this reduces the trigger pull by about 2 pounds.5. I will include a box of Hornady Critical Defense rounds, unless you don’t want it ($22 value).ABOUT ME Yes, I have my CCW permit and I will show it to you when we deal. I ask you to do the same.First time on Armslist, but my eBay handle is JDBrass01, where I have been a member since 2000 and have a 100% rating.TRADES I would consider a trade for a Glock 43 plus cash.

I have since returned it to stock aside from the following: extended firing pin, stainless steel guide rod, talon grips and Dawson precision fiber optic front and blacked out rear. It has the box and factory 2 mags. Also included is the Aliengear Cloak tuck 2.0 IWB holster. Located in the lakes region. Shoot me a message. $425 as is. Trades considered.I can also change out the target sights for XS Big dot sights if you intend to carry this gun. That would be a total of $455 (These sights go for $110-$120). Basically, you'd get them for 30 bucks, and I'll even install them. I can also change the gun back to a decocker if you you prefer that, and are not comfortable doing it yourself.If you do not want the holster, $400 as it or $430 with the big dots."

It is a 1943 M44 Mosin carbine. This is one of approximately only 50,000 that were made for that year and were used on a trial basis before being officially adopted as the Model 1944 Carbine in 1944.This particular carbine is in very nice shape, matching numbers and has a pristine bore that is very bright with no pitting or counterbore. It also bears the features of the earlier M44s in that it has a single ear bayonet lug, and the narrow front sight base.I have never fired this rifle in the years I have owned it, so I can't brag about how accurate it is (or isn't). While the 1943 carbine isn't the rarest Mosin variant, they are indeed rare, and it isn't like you would just happen to find one anywhere like you could with other dates of manufacture when you used to see them on shelves everywhere.Price is set at $325. I can also have it shipped to you through an FFL. If shipping, prefer payment through Paypal so that way I can get it to the FFL and sent out even faster.No trades, unless you have any surplus M2 .30cal ball ammo, or a US M1-C paratrooper helmet (the helmet with fixed D bales for the chinstrap) with the 506th PIR spade stencils on the sides."
