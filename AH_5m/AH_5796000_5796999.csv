I am valuing the Para Elite Commander package at $900 (the gun's MSRP alone is $950) and $700 for my Stainless Steel Colt Pony 90 Series .380. The Para has about 300 rounds through it, give or take. I bought it new from a local shop when I was on a 1911 kick and have the receipt. It comes with a ton of extras (2 kimber SS mags, Galco IWB Leather Holster, Rubber Wrap Around grip, and some Ammo)...as well as all the goodies it came with new (2 factory mags, paperwork, lock, etc....)I bought the Colt from my brother-in-law who purchased it brand new back in the late 90's and I would say it has about 200-300 rounds through it. It's very clean and nice looking and was only produced for 2 years. It comes with everything it came with the day it was bought (2 colt factory mags, colt case, all paperwork and manuals) and it comes with 2 holsters as well.  If you are not familiar with this gun Google it and do some research, it’s a real GEM and fun to shoot! I am looking to trade these guns for any Springfield M1A, it can be a standard rifle, or a scout or even a SOCOM 16. I can toss some money in with the right deal but obviously I am trading what I have because I don’t want to drain the checking account!    Let me know if you are interested and I can send more pictures and more detailed descriptions of what is included with both guns. 6one2-29six-509three"

499,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5796499,For Sale:  Armasight Predator Thermal Vision Rifle Scope,"Santa Clarita, Los Angeles, California","$ 2,600","Listed On: Monday, September 5, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a brand new ARMASIGHT Predator 336 2-8x25 (60 Hz) Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight. This is Armasights brand new model which i purchased late last year for $4k. It has excellent reviews online and was never used always kept in its case. You will get as part of the sale- Armasight Predator Weapon Sight- Armasight Mil Spec Hard case which i purchased for $100- Armasight Advanced Wireless Remote controlDescriptionArmasight is excited to introduce its latest and most technologically advanced family of Predator Thermal Imaging weapon sights to the sporting, law enforcement, and military markets. The Predator product line is based on the latest FLIR Tau 2 VOx microbolometer core. Each model of the line has optimizing performance, price, and state-of-the-art technology for a variety of uses and mission applications ranging from the seriously committed hunter to the military designated marksman. While primarily designed as a weapon scope, the Predator functions equally well in its collateral assignments as a magnified spotting scope or handheld thermal imager.The Predator is a solid state, uncooled, long-wave infrared, magnified dedicated weapon scope intended for day and night engagements without the need to remove the sight from the rifle. The 24/7 mission capability is just one of its many strengths. Thermal imaging technology also allows you to detect targets by cutting through snow, dust, smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants. Unlike the use of laser targeting or near-infrared illumination to augment Night Vision equipment, the Predator thermal imaging weapon sight is extremely difficult to detect with other devices, as it emits no visible light or RF energy.In addition to being the smallest and lightest in their class, Predator thermal imaging weapon sights are characterized by their simple and intuitive controls, functions, and features that are layered among direct button adjustments, direct combination button functions, and electronic menu selections. This “layering” of easy-to-understand control functions provides the operator with a framework for customizing his preferences and exploiting the robust variety of setting options available in the Predator. The Predator has a series of selectable color modes based on a rich, upgradeable software package. A wireless remote switch is included to activate the Predator thermal imaging weapon sight when positioned in the “standby” mode. The Predator has the ability to record videos with optional Digital Video Recorder and is also equipped with a video-out capability in operator selectable NTSC or PAL formats. The Predator uses the same multipin connector to provide video-in imagery, where there is a need for map or rangefinder display overlays, and external power access. Predator weapon installation is easy, repeatable, and reliable based on a unique and highly user-friendly MIL-STD-1913/ Weaver/ Picatinny rail-compatible, quick-release locking mechanism. The solid state technology and software algorithms, combined with a complementary color reticle platform, ensures maximum reticle contrast, highlevel target accuracy, and boresight retention that cannot be achieved with mechanical boresight adjusters and traditional ballistic drums. This level of accuracy is translated into the electronic zoom (e-zoom) function of the Predator thermal imaging weapon sights, which can be progressively increased from 1x to 2x and 4x, without changing the pointof- aim to point of-impact relationship of the targeting reticle.The Predator thermal imaging weapon sight represents one of the most sophisticated sighting devices available in today’s market to hunters, SWAT teams, and military personnel, due to its superior price-to-performance value.• Special User-Adjustable Imaging Tools • Active Contrast Enhancement (ACE) – a digital “Contrast” correction that allows for a smart scene optimization based on dynamic adjustments where a variety of contrast levels occur depending on relative scene temperature. • Second Generation Digital Detail Enhancement (DDE) – a “Sharpness” correction that is digitally enhances the picture to present clearer imagery, significantly improves edge sharpening and further reduces image noise. • Smart Scene Optimization (SSO) – a fine-tuning computational correction that significantly improves an overall visual acuity for targets that have thermal signatures similar to a surrounding background. • Automatic Gain Control (AGC) – a “Gain” correction that used to automatically adjust the gain to an appropriate range, the weaker the image signal, the stronger the gain. • User-Controlled Manual Non-Uniformity Correction/Flat-Field Correction (UCMNUC/FFC). There is a mechanical shutter between the camera sensor and the lens. This shutter is used to perform a non-uniformity correction (NUC) also known as flat-field correction (FFC. During FFC, the shutter presents a uniform temperature source to each detector element in the array. While imaging the flat-field source, the camera updates the offset correction coefficients, resulting in a more uniform image after the process is complete.

Features include tactical bolt handle, picatinny rial and b-ipod. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid cooling. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined-in during production. Along with the new barrel design, we brought together a host of other cutting-edge features on our super-accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding.

This is the latest generation of the Sub2k released from Kel Tec. From the factory: The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model). The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools. We will ship for actual shipping charges to the FFL of your choice."

Rifle comes new in the factory box with (2) 30 round magazines. From Kel-Tec: The Kel-Tec CMR-30 Rifle is chambered for the .22WMR cartridge (22 Magnum). The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included. The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle. We will ship to your FFL for actual shipping charges."

Pretty accurate for a Mosin- I've added a long eye relief scope and scope mount.
Also removed the peeling/chipped original shellack, sanded and refinished the stock with linseed oil.
Bore is in good shape (for a 80-year old Mosin), I've maintained this in a safe with dehumidifier (in a basement with a dehumidifier) and always cleaned after shooting corrosive.
I've been working on further accurizing it- added cork to the front of the stock and light HAND sanding to the trigger sear with 400 grit paper (lot of Youtube videos on this). Scope zero might be off somewhat as a result of the corking. I was still playing around with it a little.
I'm selling because I don't have the time I used to to shoot and play around with this- rather focus time+money on CCW type stuff and hunting.
