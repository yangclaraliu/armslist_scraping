It's probably got around 100 rounds through it and has been in my gun cabinet ever since. I standardized my carry to 9mm, so this thing got left to hold down a shelf in my safe. It's a good shooting gun and is comfortable in the hand. It's light enough to carry, but still packs the wallop of a .45. I'm including a hard case from Kahr, a second magazine (also from Kahr), and a blackhawk size 1 marsupial (with spare mag carrier) holster. It's not the best fit, but I have carried the pistol in it a bit without issue. I'm flexible on the price. When I bought this they were worth a bit more than they are now. I'm just selling to fund another rifle purchase, so feel free to offer up trade options.I will only sell if you have a CCW or pistol purchase permit from NC.

Mr. Page and Mr. Lewis had been associated with Stevens then went out on their own, made guns for Eugene Reising, and later sold their operation to Savage who also acquired Stevens. Eventually Page Lewis guns were sold by Stevens under their Springfield brand name (not to be confused with the government's Springfield Armory which was about 10 miles from the Page Lewis and Stevens operations in Chicopee Falls , Mass. These folks also were involved with the Stevens- Duryea automobile Company, L.S. Starrett (tool makers), Hunter Arms Company, High Standard, and several other non-gun related manufacturing enterprises. People forget that innovative gun-making technology was at the very core of the rise of American manufacturing and tool making success, but that is another long and interesting story in itself.Page Lewis started off making simple rolling block rifles with frames of laminated steel (a sandwich of two thin side plates with a inch thick spacer piece between) and then moved on to simple bolt action designs. Their model ""D was an entry level gun for junior shooters that had to be manually cocked, a desirable safety feature for youthful shooters as well as less expensive to make. This model was produced 1923-1928 with a 20 inch barrel. During this time Savage/Stevens bought the assets of Page Lewis and in 1928 they introduced the Model 50 Springfield Junior which was little more than a Model D with a bit larger stock and a 24 inch barrel. This model, priced at $5.87 was discontinued in 1933 in favor of the Model 52 with a 22 inch barrel and this model sold for $3.98 in the 1933 Sears Roebuck catalog. Most inexpensive rifles and shotguns were not serial numbered prior to the Gun Control Act of 1968 when a requirement for serial numbers was imposed on all firearms.

Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.  Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.  The .416 Barrett caliber brings new levels of precision shooting to the Model 99. With the enhanced accuracy and increased velocity of the .416 Barrett cartridge, this rifle offers incredible long-range precision.  The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. Model 99 in action  The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.  Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.**This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE and full payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.

The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod. 2™ Service Model a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Service Model on target for round after round.

While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of the competitor models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity. A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why the Mod.2™ Tactical Model is fitted with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul. The slide takes most of the day to day wear and tear, so it's constructed from Melonite®-treated carbon steel too. While it is always recommended to properly care for your handgun, the Mod.2™ Tactical isn’t one that will require babying. This combat-ready gun is designed to be used, not left in the safe. Fast and accurate shooting requires control, so all of the Mod.2™ enhancements are included. Springfield High Hand™ grip near the beavertail and below the trigger guard allow you to put support close to the bore line to minimize muzzle flip. The new GripZone® contours and texturing are specifically designed to provide maximum purchase at specific points where your hands and fingers require the most contact. Three different textures provide the friction needed without painful overkill. Users have responded very positively to the lightning fast sight combination of fiber optic front paired with a low profile combat rear sight, so you’ll find that combination on the Mod.2™ 5″ Tactical model too. If you prefer different sighting options, that’s no problem – dozens of aftermarket sights fit the standard dovetail cuts. New! Keep Calm... Shop at Upscale Pawn!

Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.  Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact. New! Keep Calm...

It was carried for a couple of years and has only seen light range use. It is a second generation model. It's a nice single-stack .380 in a compact size, but I no longer have a need for it.Located in Gallup, NM but can meet in the ABQ area or somewhere between if the time is right.From Kel-Tec website:The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

This was a fairly high end build, only cheap thing on it is mount and rings and they are only on there because the dnz I ordered was off kilter so I returned it and never replaced, I've got over $1200 invested into it, looking for $450 cash."
