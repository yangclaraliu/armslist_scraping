We will start with the gun, it is a like new Mossberg 535 ATS – Turkey 22” barrel Adjustable Fiber Optic sights Vent Rib and will shoot all 12 gauge shells up 3.5 as the gun is chambered in 3.5. I added the ATI AKITA stock it’s very comfortable and absorbs most of the recoil, four Position Adjustable Stock, Length of Pull Adjusts from 12 3/8"" to 14 3/8"" also included is the original stock if you want to put it back on. The gun is topped off with a Cabela’s Slug Shotgun Scope 3x9x40.  Comes with the original turkey choke, and comes with carlson’s extended ported improved cylinder choke tube. The gun comes with a soft cover case and about 80 rounds of ammo, most of the ammo is hornady rifled slugs, and hornady turkey shot ammo. The gun has about 40 rounds through it also included is a bore snake.  This package come with an orange safety vest sixe xxl, I bought it on the bigger size so I can layer clothes under it. Also is a brand new set of camo real tree Frog Troggs never worm size XL again bought its sized up to wear layers underneath.  Also included is a never worn Rocky Silent Hunter Water Proof pullover size XXL again bought a size bigger to layer underneath. This Silent Hunter shirt features Scent IQ. That means this camo shirt has special fabric that controls human scent by destroying it down at the microbial level. If your scent tips off your prey, you could go home empty-handed.  If you bought everything separately you would be spending well over 1k, so my asking price is very fair.no low ball offers 400 firm thats a steal this package is worth way more than 400"

I thought I wanted to get into reloading but I just never could get all that interested in it, so I'm selling the set that I bought.
Set Features:
 
1 Franklin Arsenal Digital Caliper
An assortment of spent .45 apc and .38 special casings
1 4pc set of .45 acp Lee reloading dies including
     Carbide factory crimp die
     Powder through expanding die
     Steel shellholder and powder measure
     Carbide sizing die
     Bullet seat and feed die
1 Lee load-all 2 for 12 gauge shotgun shells
1 Hornady electronic scale GS 1500
1 Lee safety powder scale (this one's manual)
100 CCI large pistol primers no. 300
An assortment of 45 acp 230 gr bullets
1 unopened Lee case conditioning kit
1 tube of Lee resizing lubricant
1 Lee safety primer feed
1 Lee perfect powder measure
1 Lee breech lock challenger
Every piece of equipment still has it's own instruction manual. I also have included a hodgdon data manual, the Lyman Reloading Handbook 49th edition, and of course all the nuts and bolts and little bits and whatnot you need along with it either in their original packaging or safely placed in plastic bags, and all accounted for.
 
Basically, pictured here is everything you need to make your own ammo, except for the powder. I'm a student, I need money, and sadly, this setup was sitting around collecting dust."

These rifles have milled parts and threaded barrel lugs as opposed to later guns with stamped parts and pinned barrel. The down side of these guns are the stocks. The stock on this rifle has some dents and nicks and scratches. Most of these guns stocks are this way so I just left it this way, I thought it was kinds cool.

This King Cobra has been shot but as you can see from the pictures, in mint condition. It has a slight turnline with very faint burn marks on cylinder but other than that, is pristine in original box and papers with outer sleeve. The Enhanced Models derive from when Colt Supposedly ran out of hardware and other parts and until more where available they equipped the King Cobra Models with the cylinder latch from the Anaconda model and recessed the barrels and simply dubbed them the ""Enhanced Models"". The Enhanced models were not produced as much as the regular 4” King Cobra and is a must for all collectors. The 4” Coly King Cobra is a wonderful revolver to fire. Even though it fires the powerful 357MAG, it doesn’t kick like it is firing hat powerful round. It is a smooth firing revolver that will never be made again. Shipping is $25 to your FFL.

This is the gun that is issued to the Navy SEALS (NSWG = Naval Special Warfare Group.) There were three versions of this gun. The first model had no rail. The second model (the MK-24) had a SIG rail that was not mil-spec. The current model (the MK-25) has a mil-spec rail and a smart code tag. My understanding is that the internals of the MK-24 and MK-25 are the same. The model that I am selling is the MK-24. The date of manufacture of this gun is 2011. It's in like-new condition, with less than 300 rounds through it. No marks or scratches. Comes with three 15-round factory magazines, SIG factory night sights, all paperwork and manual, and original box. (The model number label on the box reads E26R-9-NSWG.)

It has somewhere between 1000-1500 rounds through it. It has some upgrades including the APEX forward set sear and trigger kit with the polymer trigger, APEX reset assist mechanism, and a set of Warren Sevigny sights. The APEX sear and trigger kit gives a more comfortable trigger with a crisp, clean break and the APEX RAM significantly improves the felt reset. The Warren Sevigny sights are a noticeable improvement compared to the stock sights. The blacked out rear sight combined with the fiber optic front sight draw your focus to where it should be. I'll include extra fiber optic rods of different colors in case you like something other than the red.The slide, sights, takedown lever, locking block, sear housing, and both barrels have been refinished with a Blacknitride process by H&M Metal Processing and all look better than they did new.On top of the upgrades listed above, I've got a lot of extras that will go with it:-Extra OEM 4.25"" 9mm barrel with zero rounds through it-2 17rd OEM magazines-3 OEM magazines with Taran Tactical extended basepads (22 rd capacity...sometimes can get 23 rounds in these)-Comp Tac IWB holster-Bladetech Competition holster with Tek-Lok attachment-Blackhawk CQC OWB holster-Fobus OWB holster-M&P Catalyst extended magazine release (have the OEM mag release with it as well)-Maryland Gun Works M&P sight pusher tool. Great for making sight adjustments and any work requiring removing sights -Original parts replaced by the APEX kits (minus the actual trigger as I gave it to a friend to replace his broken one)-Miscellaneous small replacement parts. Some extra coil pins, striker spring guide, frame key plug, rear sight set screws w/hex wrench, and truglo replacement fibers.

• The design of the gas piston system and operation rod completely eliminates carrier tilt.
• This design ensures reliability by preventing hot gases and carbon particulates from entering the receiver and fouling the chamber and the action. Diminished heat reaching the upper receiver means that Cleaner Lubricant and Preservative (“CLP”) applied in this area will evaporate at a lower rate and not dry out. The design allows less maintenance and increases the overall reliability of the weapon.
• A newly designed vent cover houses the piston exhaust ports, which protects the operator from exhaust heat and cuts down on the weapon’s signature.
• Mounting the piston on the underside of the rail system allows the barrel to float freely, ensuring greater accuracy of the weapon.
• The lower half of the rail system detaches with a unique tool free design for ready access to the piston and gas tube for operational maintenance and cleaning. The operating system can be cleaned faster than the existing weapon’s cleaning routine.
• The operator in the field can adjust the piston’s cyclical rate to keep the carbine operating within control rate of fire parameters, resulting in less wear on the carbine’s critical parts.
• The piston design is machined with close tolerances so that gas rings are not needed, eliminating another potential maintenance issue for the weapon."
