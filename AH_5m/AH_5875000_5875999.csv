Marlin model 782 bolt action rifle chambered in .22 Magnum. Seven shot magazine fed. It's in overall very good clean solid condition but HAS ISSUES. It will cock but will not stike hard enough to fire and the safety doesn't work. There are no missing parts and I will not speculate on what the problem is. It is what it is and guaranteed NOT to fire. A slacker local gunsmith had it for over a year and never attempted to repair it so I brought it home. I will meet within a reasonable 10-15 mile radius from my home. The price is cheap enough and take it or leave it. If it does not sell within a few days it will go back in the safe. I can strip it for parts later and sell the pieces online and get more than I'm asking. Would make a good shooter if it was repaired.

This gun is in great condition. It has been in a safe for most of it's life, shot very little and recently when I took it out to shoot, I decided it was time to move it on to someone who would ""use"" it. Walnut is in great shape. Bluing overall is great, just some wear on receiver, which happens on 94s. Mainly, from sitting against felt in the safe for many years. Shoots and works smooth.

Please be 18 or over, Va resident and willing to sign a BOS. The gun was recently at the Gunsmith for a disassembly and cleaning to ensure it is in proper working order after many years of being in a safe. NOTRADES PLEASE, just looking to sell."

The barrel is vent ribbed with mid and front beads and, with the choke, the barrel is 26 1/2"" long. The metal and blueing are excellent with no dings, pitting or rust. The bore is shiny with no pitting. The wood is also excellent with only light scratches and handling marks. It is chambered for 2 3/4"" shells. Although it is difficult to date the year these were made I believe this shotgun is from the 1970's.  Winchester Model 1200 and 1300 barrels are interchangeable with this shotgun.For sale only to Tennessee residents eligible to legally own a firearm.Please Email through Armslist with questions.  Additional pics can be sent to serious buyers."

This is a german made, single shot, bolt action chambered in .22 long rifle. This old war horse has seen some stuff in it's lifetime. Story I was told by the owners son, is that it was used in a slaughter house back in the day. Stock was cracked somewhere along the line, and was repaired many many years ago. Very old repair. Whoever repaired it did a right fine job, using small dowels to pin it back together, then it was refinished. All most all of the blueing is gone, but no rust or pits anywhere. Still has the original Geco stamp on the top of the receiver and on the right side of the stock. Complete with the extractor (which would be very easy to lose when you remove the bolt) Action works as it should. Bore is still pretty decent, no pits, but needs a good cleaning which I will leave up to the next owner. All I have done is apply a light coat of oil for protection.VERY RARE PIECE!!Interesting Trades considered. Willing to add cash on my end if need be.Reasonable cash offers considered."

Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

The German Police forces were quite different than the police forces here in the United States. The WWII German Police forces were composed of several para-military groups with duties ranging from standard police work to controlling the populations of the occupied territories. Some police forces fought the anti-Nazi Partisans and some even saw front line service. This pistol is a ""Variation 4"" PP Police. It features the somewhat crude unpolished military blue finish without slide legend and is simply manufacture code marked ""ac"" for Walther. It bears the Eagle/F Police acceptance stamp on the left side of the trigger guard. The Nazi Eagle test proofs appear on the slide, chamber and tip of barrel. The slide and frame are properly serial numbered to match and there are NO import markings.

A lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The 93 F has a weather resistant synthetic stock, and a blued barrel and receiver. The receiver comes drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Factory installed sling swivel studs accommodate attaching a rifle sling, or a bi-pod to the forend. The bolt features dual extractors for positive extraction of spent cases. A 5-round, detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading the rifle. The 2-stage safety is located on the right side of the receiver. The Savage 93 F Bolt-Action Rimfire Rifle in 22 WMR reaches out well over 100 yards to take varmints, small game, and medium sized predators such as coyote, fox, and bobcat with minimum muzzle blast and pelt damage.

Paid extra to have it upgraded from the factory with an ambidextrous lower receiver back plate sling mount and rail-mounted sling mounts so it's all ready for your one or two-point sling. Only test fired from POF at the factory prior to shipping. Paid over $2300 for it last year and has been sitting in my climate controlled safe ever since. Buying a house so need the cash. This is the highest end, most reliable, and most accurate AR15 money can buy. I own six other POFs in 5.56 and .308 and have never had a single issue with any of them. POF piston-driven rifles have been tested to go over 70,000 rds in full auto fire with only minor parts (buffer spring, extractor, etc.) needing replacement at 35k-70k, with no loss in accuracy. This is a fire breathing dragon and the perfect tactical pistol to put in your nightstand for the ultimate home defense weapon or for close quarter combat. Willing to accept cash, USPS Money Order, and credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover any PP fees. Private sale, no FFL fees or paperwork to hassle with. If a face to face meet isn't possible, shipping is $40 private party to your FFL or $60 if I have to pay my FFL to ship it. This on the list for Hillary and the other Democrats to ban so get it while the political climate allows its transfer.

I have fired between 800-1000 rounds and It functions flawlessly. It has some pretty severe holster wear on the slide. I called Glock and the customer service rep informed me they will refinish it for less than $100 and while they have it they will replace all the springs at no additional charge. I'd have it refinished but it really makes no difference in the way it functions and I carry it at all times so I don't want to be without it.
