 Description from manufacture:
The Huldra Mark IV Tactical EVO features the Samson Evolution Series Free Float forearm that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block. Two accessory rails come standard with the rifle and can be reconfigured easily to adapt the hand guard to your needs and can also be mounted at 45 degree offsets. The ergonomics of this rail set a new standard. The anti-rotational tabs make this handguard all the more impressive by virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail losing alignment even under hard use. And the QD sling mount that is included just makes this package that much more outstanding.
The Adams Arms piston system is one piece and is accessible from the front of the piston block. Iron sight optics (not included) are designed to be affixed to the sturdy piston block which is attached to the barrel, as opposed to attaching front sights to our competitor's inherently flexible rails that have to be frequently removed and reattached. The Adams Arms patented piston system will run cleaner, cooler, and longer. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them incredibly hard.
 The Magpul CTR butt stock is designed for light, fast action. The CTR features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and an ambidextrous QD sling mount. A standard rubber butt pad provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage, even with body armor or modular gear. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable.
The Melonited corrosive resistant Chrome/Molly/Vanadium 41/50 barrel provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receiver is machined from high quality mil-spec 70/75-T6 aluminum forgings and hard coat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 70/75-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed Chevrons for improved control.
What really sets this rifle apart is the size of the barrel. It is 14.5 inches. We have permanently affixed an elongated flash hider to give you the benefits of a shorter barrel, without the expense and hassle of obtaining an ATF tax stamp. Not only that, our flash hider is “reduced radius”, allowing a gunsmith or armorer to remove the piston block for servicing the weapon. The elongated, reduced radius, permanently attached muzzle device gives you the legally required overall barrel length.

Priced to sell. Trade value $440.00. Rare de-cocker only model. This is a rugged extremely well built pistol by Ruger. In fact they are out of production since 2009 as the plastic fantastic took hold. Ruger built this pistol to last generations. They don't make pistols like this anymore.. Many upgrades. Includes Hogue custom rubber grip, upgraded wolf extra power recoil spring, two 7 rounds mags, one 8 round mag and one 10 round mag. Very accurate shooter. Bought from a estate sale, looked barely used. Less than a box through by me. Only selling to fund another project. $400.00.(FIRM)    Sorry no trades. Low-ballers will be ignored. (If the Ad is still up, It's still available.)"

I got it new so I know that's a true round count. It's a 1:8 twist hand lapped match barrel. I haven't worked up a load just ran the same load i had for my other barrel. And it will shoot 1"" or under at 200 yards. One hole at 100 and that's with a crappy mil spec trigger. I know this barrel will shoot one hole at 200 if I worked up a load for it. That was using 69gr tipped match kings. This is not a cheap barrel. It's a mid length gas system. Only reason i got it up for trade is I would like a 24 or maybe a 20"" heavy barrel. Looking for a good quality barrel fairly low round count would be nice. I would sale it also 250.00 obo but would rather trade for a longer barrel. Low pro gas block don't come with the barrel unless yours has a low pro block and gas tube. Then I can let it go with the barrel. If your barrel has a rifle length gas tube and you have the tube I can trade ya out tubes as well. Also so have a USA made mil spec 16in barrel 400 rounds threw it. 1:9 twist Carbine gas system. It's a sub Moa shooter as well. With 69gr or 55gr bullets. Has a bird cage flash hider. 60.00 obo. would trade towards a stripped upper as well. I also have a Daniel defense muzzle break. Has had 15-20 rounds threw it. Works great keeps ya on target no barrel rise and it don't blow your ear drums out as bad as a couple others I have used. 50.00 obo just paid 75.00 for it. Also trade towards a stripped upper. Harris bipod 6-13 I believe. Has the notched legs functions great has been spray painted but that comes off real easy. 60.00 obo.

You even get all the markings on the stock and barrel for that. If you feel guilty about only paying 50 for this beauty, I won`t turn down 75. I wouldn`t want it to bother you getting such a good deal. Ok, you must be able to come to me to pick it up. I have been disabled and bed ridden for 25 months now, so travel is out of the question. Arslist says my files are to big, so I only put one photo up.
