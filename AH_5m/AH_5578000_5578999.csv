Tiger striping in the butt of the stock - this is a very nice piece of walnut.  The rifle is in very good condition, no rust.....and the finish is in good shape for it's age.  The rifle was re-barreled several years ago,  in the original 8mm Mauser (7.92 x 57 JS) chambering.  The barrel is in very good shape.The action has been glass-bedded into the stock.The rifle wears a Japanese-made Weaver Classic LER scope,  2.5 - 8 X 28.   The trigger is a Timney Sportsman, single stage,  set to 3.0 lbs.  This is a good all round,  absolutely reliable shooter and great classic hunting rifle.  It will produce about 1.5"" groups at 100 yards at best.  ""Normal"" groups are about 2"", with my current hand loads.  Included with the rifle are a scope cover,  leather sling and a soft case.  Also included are approximately 600 rounds of 8mm Mauser hand loaded ammo (170 grain soft point hunting loads).  Further, I will include some additional 8mm Mauser brass,  1 box of Speer 150 grain SP bullets.....and a complete set of Lee reloading dies.  The ammo alone, if estimating only $10 per box (at which price you'd NEVER find it these days).......is worth more than $300,  by itself.  The scope is only about 1 month old......and cost $240.The Timney trigger cost $60.  I am offering all of the above at $550.  The price is somewhat negotiable,  but only somewhat.  All obvious ""low-ball"" offers will be ignored (no response will be made)......so unless you are serious, don't make an offer.  I will NOT ship the rifle or other items, due to the weight (and therefore, the cost).  Face to face meeting only.  I will travel a reasonable distance to meet a buyer - a reasonable distance - but I expect the buyer to make an effort also.  The rifle is NOT a ""collector rifle""..... and that is why I am pricing it very reasonably.  I am selling it because A) I no longer hunt.......and B) I am getting a bit old and can no longer tolerate the recoil.  Finally, a Bill of Sale will be provided.  The buyer will need a valid photo ID (which information will be listed on the Bill of Sale)......and both parties will sign said Bill of Sale.  All relevant laws WILL be complied with - no exceptions."

This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."

Originally known as the K-38 Combat Masterpiece, it was renamed the Model 15 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is a shorter barrel version of the Smith & Wesson Model 14 Target Masterpiece and essentially an adjustable-sight version of the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 (""Military and Police"") revolver with target shooting features. The main production run of the Model 15 was from 1949 through 1999.

Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period. Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection. The 92FS Inox is also available in stainless steel, as the 92FS Inox."

These are interesting in several ways. First of all, in that there is a true series. Not one that emerged over time as variants were introducted, but a series conceived and sold all at the same time. This offered small, single-stack pistols in 9 mm Parabellum, .40 S&Wand .45 ACP, and a double-column — but otherwise identical — 9 mm as well. Secondly, these are a mix of mechanical features. Though constructed firmly in the modern era, they are still single action. Slide rails are inverted, and the locking system is generally of the most modern styling, with coned barrels which did not otherwise emerge until the M31 and Megastar. The trigger system is, however, almost identical to that of the classic series, even forsaking the removable backstrap of the modern series pistols. Other mechanical differences include the lack of a firing pin stop plate. To remove the firing pin, the rear sight must be removed (by hammering it off), and the drop safety pull out the top. The trigger is basically that of the 1911 clones like the B series, and retains the disappointing single side transfer bar. Although I can only surmise the point of these guns was to capture the same concealed carry market the then-discontinued PD blazed, they never achieved the same following. Though reasonably popular sellers, by the time they emerged, there were a number of competitors, including a large selection of increasingly compact 1911s. They were also rather heavy by comparison, and the only alloy-framed pistol offered was the double-stack M234. I do not have manuals for every pistol shown on this site. However, in many cases there is a related manual. Partly to make the series relationships clearer, and partly to assist with speed and accuracy of updating, all manuals can be found in one place, the manuals page. All manuals available are provided as downloadable PDFs, or you may purchase a printed copy of the entire set of handgun manuals. There is one good warning not included in the manuals. Use some caution when stripping these pistols. The safety lever is only prevented from over-rotating by the grip panels. If they are removed for cleaning or maintenance, the safety can be rotated too far, and the the detent plunger will fly out. This is a very, very, small part and will almost certainly become lost. The safety lever is very important to the safe operation of the gun, so use caution not to lose the detent pin. If you do loose this part, a very tiny ball bearing can replace it perfectly well, but good luck getting ahold of one."

It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is rated for full auto fire.

The magazine holds 4 plus 1 in the chamber. This rifle is in exceptional condition with both factory front and rear sights, and a Browning factory 3x9 scope which I believe was ordered with this rifle new. The rifle functions perfectly and had been cleaned properly after every season but probably after ever time it was used. Please keep in mind, this is a well cared for piece of history. This gun has been used several seasons and didn't become a safe queen until I got my hands on it 5 years ago. This rifle is a North American Mammal slaying machine. I would keep it, save for the fact that I don't hunt anymore. This gun needs to go to someone who will continue using her for her intended purpose, taking down prey. The sling in the photo is not included. Please email me with questions or to request more photos as I have taken plenty. I welcome trades and I'm asking $1000."
