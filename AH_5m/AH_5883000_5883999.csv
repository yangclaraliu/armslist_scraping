It also has the straight cut ejection port instead of the curvy/scalloped one. It's very functional, good condition, and has 2 original Detonics mags, and one spare magazine I don't know the brand of. The Detonics mags feed flawlessly from my expirience, but the off-brand mag causes some problems occasionally. The blueing is good as well, but has some wear in the common areas, like the backstrap and safety, not bad though. Completely rust free and the bore looks good.It's also a nice little piece of history for being the first compact tilting barrel design, at least successful one. I'm just getting rid of it becuase I just got another compact 45, and don't have a need for this anymore.I can do a private transaction to SC residents, and I will also do a FFL transfer for those out of state or far away.

I'm guessing it has less than forty rounds down the barrel in its existence, a few to zero, a few to get comfortable, a few to show an old buddy I could outshoot his Remington, and that's about it.  So the barrel still needs to be broken in.  I'm not in a mood to put up with stupid offers, so please be a gentleman/gentlewoman in this regard.  Please don't tell me that your uncle has one a lot cheaper, just buy your uncle's rifle.  I would keep it, but I've had medical problems and I have to so I have to do some safe cleaning..  I will consider trade plus cash offers, but it's still face to face unless you want to pay all the fees encountered in shipping.  Trade value is above $1250. Thanks for looking."

The gun includes all papers, box, tools and a brush. At the range she commands attention so bring extra ammo because everyone will want to shoot it! I hate to sell her because it is so accurate and it's even very carry friendly but I'm ready to switch gears. Also included but not shown is a nylon OWB holster.Since Chiappa does not take trades on their Gold plated Rhino 60, neither do I."

The condition is original and I'd guess it has at least 150 rounds through it.  24"" heavy barrel with a 4 screw butt plate. Overall condition is good to better.  The stock is beautiful.  I recently polished/wet sanded out any small marks so it looks great.  The metal shows a little blue loss and has a bit of freckling, but nothing awful.  I had the bolt lapped and reblued a while back.  Head space is perfect.  It shoots very flat and is extremely acurate with 90 grain hpbt.  I'm converting to all stainless and downsizing so it's for sale.  The scope is an old but very clear and useable Bushnel Banner. I'd like to sell to an Ohio resident in a face to face sale.  Cash is prefered and I'm not interested in trades.  Shipping maybe an option, but it can only ship to an FFL, no exceptions.  Please email with questions."

We also mounted a Troy Claymore brake. $1650Saturday, Oct 10th is our last tax free day and this beast qualifies.Check out our Facebook page for daily information and information about our upcoming 3-gun event. https://www.facebook.com/theminutemanarmory/"

Unfired except from the factory (with factory box, paperwork, owner's manual included). Comes with the following; 5-30rd mags (3-Hungarians, 2-Russian bakelites), 1-20rd Korean steel mag, an all steel magazine clamp, sling, and 600 rounds of Russian non-corrosive FMJ ammo (not pictured). Also have some small spare parts that I can throw in with the gun (i.e., hammer springs, trigger spring, bolt spring, etc). I bought this gun late last year from one of the local gun shops in Lexington. It's a 2014 production gun. All made in Romania. Not Century Arms parts gun. And to my understanding that it's not being imported anymore. It has a brand new KAK Industry Shockwave Blade stabilizing brace (with an ATF approved letter), mounted on a USMachinegun folding stock adapter. Also has a KAK Industry muzzle brake installed. Wood handguard/forearm and pistol grip were stained with a Russian red finish (7 coats of shellac mixed with red dye). Factory plastic grip and flash hider are also included. I like this Mini Draco a lot, and it's a really nice gun. But I need handguns that I can use more, and carry. This gun just sits in my safe. Must meet around Lexington, Winchester, or Nicholasville only. Face to face deals only. Kentucky residents only, and must have proper ID or proof of ID that you are a Kentucky resident. I will check your ID, and you can check mine. I do have a CCDW. Trade value is $1,100 for all (got over $1,100 invested on the gun and extras). Package trade only. Will not break up the package. All low ball offers will be ignored. The blade stabilizing arm brace and folding adapter assembly alone cost me $200. And I will not respond to ""call me, text me"" replies. I prefer to communicate via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. If the ad/posting is up, the gun is still available. I will take the posting down when the gun is traded (and do not ask me if the gun is still available after I posted all that, cuz you will be ignored asking dumbass question like that). Thanks for looking.*** Trade only **** This is a repost. Had a buyer, but he was a no show. So serious inquiries only please. And trade only for now *"

While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.  A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul."

This gun has never had a single bullet go through it,  the only reason it has not been fired is because earlier this year I had bought it brand new and am the original owner and VERY shortly after, I had to have emergency surgery which has stopped me from doing any more two gun competitions. I have a gun for everyday carry but need something for my everyday passions. The gun is in like new condition. There are no signs of wear and tear on it at all. I do have a valid SC driver's license and CWP, and would be more than willing to provide photocopies and a bill of sale should you want it.  This gun is flawless.  I would sell it outright for $325, or will trade for a decent quality electronic drumset. I would like to move this fast,  because if I have to pay cash for the drums, I found a really good deal that will end soon.  Feel free to reply to this email or call or text me at REDACTED I am a SC resident,  the only reason my phone number is from out of state is that my wife and I were having serious problems with someone stalking and harassing us, so I changed it to throw off their trail.  It would be preferable to reply to me via phone,  because I respond to texts a lot easier than I can reply to email just because of location and dead spots.  As you can see from the pictures there is no sign of wear or use anywhere on it,  and it has a safety and two magazines with it.  If you are interested, please feel free to call or text me with your offer.  The gun is also under Smith & Wesson lifetime warranty.  This gun is utterly perfect for concealed carry without compromising on the caliber and could be a very good gun for two gun competitions.  I am open to hear anyone's offers so feel free to contact me,  thank you and have a blessed day."

Some rounds have minor corrosion and blackening, but it is surface discoloration only. None of these are too badly corroded as to be unsafe. Being so old, it has minor hangfires that are barely noticeable, which is pretty typical of ammo this age, but they are very minor, but of the 40 or so rounds I fired, I had zero fail to fires.I don't have a set price, but feel free to make an offer.

This rifle is listed as used, however it is only listed that way because I bought it. It essentially has only had 10 rounds through it to test function. Let me give you a run down on this rifle. It has been professionally upgraded and straightened! Without getting into it about Century and it's wonderful work quality, I can absolutely guarantee this rifle is done right! For those who know, buying one of these rifles was a crap shoot at best! Sites came canted, mag wells came cut crooked, the incorrect bipods were installed, the wood furniture was unfinished, and the guns finish was terrible! These problems have all been addressed, and corrected on this rifle! To start, the correct Romanian heavy adjustable bipod has been installed! To do this, you must remove the front site to press the bipod collar onto the barrels chrome pad. To get around this, Century was installing the incorrect, quick release, non ajustible PKM bipod! They even welded shims onto the barrels chrome pad to do this! This is just poor workmanship. This rifle has the correct bipod that adjusts, cants the rifle left and right, and pivots it side to side! You can remove the cleaning rod, it properly locks into the front site, and you can stake the pads into the ground! The site alignment has been corrected and literally made, lazer straight! Even the rear site block was moved and re pinned with a oversized pin! The entire gun was cerakoted a tasteful flat black! A considerable improvement over the original finish! The Tapco G2 trigger was polished and profiled to prevent dovetail damage! The pull is extremely crisp! A krebs pin plate was also added replacing the shepherds hook that's been known to fail. The magazine well was fixed. It was surprisingly too tight! I couldn't get most magazines in the rifle at all. Now it accepts all double stack magazines perfect! The wood was finished off in a nice color and property sealed. A short PKM flash hider was added, as well as a surplus Romanian leather sling. You would be absolutely hard pressed to top this RPK! With the rifle I'm including two Romanian 40 round magazines! They have also been cerakoted the same flat black as the rifle! For 75.00 more, I'll include a Romanian top load 75 round drum mag also cerokoted flat black, the real deal!I can accept payment via cash, USPS money order, or discreet PayPal friends and family!"
