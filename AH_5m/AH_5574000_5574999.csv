When I received this rifle, the entire thing was spray painted Tan. I have since removed 95-99% of the paint, but there are some little areas where it still needs to be cleaned up. Underneath all that paint was some very nice smooth bluing the metal with only a little bit pitting on trigger and magazine area. This is a non numbers matching rifle. Headspace checked out. Rifling is a little dark but otherwise in decent shape. Does have the electro pencil import mark on the receiver but is not counter bored. The original stock it came with was in pretty sad shape. Wood was heavily dinged up and had large crack in the center that previous owner filled in with epoxy. I decied not to use this and replaced it with a correct M44 style, but incorrect country (Romanian), stock in really nice shape. Does not have cleaning rod.
 
Seeing how some people are selling Mosins for $300+ these days, I am asking only what I have invested into it. I am not desperate to sell, as such will not entertain any offers for less than asking price. This is a great opportunity to buy a shooter grade mosin for a reasonable price. Buyer must have valid drivers license for my records. Sale must be FTF in Livingston (Brighton, Howell area)"

When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is only 6.5 lbf (compared to 12 lbf for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the trigger at rest position. The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 8.5 lbf. If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 6.5 lbf. To engage the intermediate reset the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired.In bare-bones description, the DAK mechanism provides a hammer-fired full-length double-action trigger pull, with complete repeat-strike capability, that is notably lighter than other full-length DAO pull mechanisms. Developed by the engineers at Sauer in Germany, the new DAK trigger system delivers a smooth, consistent 6.5-pound full-length trigger pull that is much closer to the weight of a Glock than any conventional DAO but also has complete restrike capability without any pretensioning or prestressing of the internal firing mechanism. There is nothing magical about the design; everything is accomplished by simple mechanical advantages in the trigger/hammer linkages. The key is that the engineers were able to extend the ""leverage arm"" of the hammer from the pivot point (like sitting farther from the fulcrum of a seesaw) so that less force is required from the trigger while remaining within the existing dimensions of the P226 and P229 frames. Externally, the only visible difference between a SIG DAK mechanism and a conventional SIG DAO mechanism is that the DAK trigger has a slightly slimmer profile and the DAK hammer sits completely within the frame when at rest, while the DAO hammer protrudes slightly. Other attractive features include the fact that the slide must be locked back and the magazine removed to disassemble, and it can be disassembled without having to pull the trigger."

579,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5574579,For Sale:  Generator 5k Watt,"Franklin, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 450,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 22, 2016",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Made by DeVilbiss (the big construction tool company) and using a Briggs and Stratton VANGUARD 9 hp engine. 5000 running watts / 6250 starting watts. 120v and 240v receptacles. Very easy to pull start -- always starts on the first pull.
 
It is in as-new condition. I bought it a few years ago when our house had a well and pump for the water supply, and while you can light candles for light, life is really a hassle if you have no water supply, so needed this to run the 240 volt appliances and well pump. Don't need to worry about that now.
 
Using the 240v receptacle and a transfer box, this size generator will basically power everything in the house except the Air Conditioner and the oven. Has seen very little actual use -- maybe a total of 6 hours actual run time during one outage. I have changed the oil -- started with and always used Mobil 1 synthetic.
Has the wheel kit installed. Handy to have as an emergency back up for home, or if someone is looking for something to use in construction.
 
There's a very wide variety of brands and prices available at Lowe's, HD, etc. Obviously some of the China-made units can be found cheaper.... if you want to miss the whole point that this is ready and RELIABLE during an emergency. I've priced this significantly below an equivalent size genny with the desirable B&S engine from the big box stores.
$450 firm, or since this is Armslist might trade for guns. NO OTHER TRADES. Lowball offers will be ignored and deleted - the price is a great deal and it is firm."

Holster w/ Bird Design Fink Leather Shops Kansas City, MO This High Standard Model B was manufactured in 1939. The Model B is a self-loading, recoil operated, semi-automatic pistol that is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The pistol originally had a blued finish but it is starting to turn a brownish patina color now. This pistol has a 6 3/4 inch round barrel that is not easily removed (as seen on other High Standard pistols such as the Supermatic S-101). It is fed by a single column 10 round detachable box magazine. On the pistol's butt there is a European style heel magazine release. The pistol does not employ a slide hold open feature to inform the operator that the last round has been fired. There is a manual thumb safety lever located on the left side of the receiver and behind the grip panel. The High Standard Model B was first introduced in 1932 starting with serial number 5000 and it is basically the same pistol as the Hartford Arms 1925 automatic. The Model B was the company's first pistol design. The Model B along with later models such as the C, A, D, E and S designs have come to be known as the letter series. The company manufactured approximately 65,000 of these Model B pistols. The Model B was offered with either a 4 1/2 inch or a 6 3/4 inch barrel. The Model B and the Colt Woodsman look almost like identical pistols, although they are not. They were both derived however from the same earlier Browning design."

This is a Glock 21SF (Slim Frame) pistol hammered in 45 acp. This is a great gun and we all know the Glock dependability. This comes with a case, 100 rounds of target ammo, 49 rounds of winchester personal protection jacketed defense ammo, Bladetech/Looper Leather Carry holster, 3 13rd Glock magazines, extended slide release, polished/mirrored feed ramp, stippled frame (feels great), fiber optic front and rear sights, and the pistol itself. This is everything you need to be ready to carry and hit the range.  I would also consider trades on this. No bows, 40s, blackpowders, 22s, etc. Easiest bet is to make me an offer at REDACTED (text only), worst i can say is no. i also have a very large amount of additional defense ammo available at less than retail if you would like to purchase some on top of what is included.  Need to meet in Norman on this.Thanks for looking and happy hunting."
