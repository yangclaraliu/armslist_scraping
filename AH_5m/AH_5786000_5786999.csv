Anyone who collects Brownings knows the value of these guns and the workmanship that went into handbulding each and every one of these. The Citori was designed based off of the Superposed, but having owned both, the Citori does not compare to the overall fit and finish. This one has beautiful wood. It was inherited by me from my grandfather. I am more interested in collecting the Browning A-5s, so I plan to use the funds from this sale to purchase another A-5. 
This gun has the auto ejectors, it has a full choke top barrel and modified bottom barrel. This is a shooter and has some bluing wear but still has the beauty that would be expected of a Browning Belgium Made AND Belgium assembled shotgun. They just don't make them today like they used to. Please let me know if you have any questions. I have this gun priced to sell. I don't think you will find another at this price range. Thank you!"

And nothing beats the Beretta 950 BS for firepower in such a small package. You know the first rule of gunfighting. This is a gun that disappears in a pocket, or purse, or pack bag, or ankle holster. Is 25 ACP underpowered? Maybe, but I don't see folks lining up to take rounds. When things go bad, better to have 9 rounds headed toward the bad guy than nothing at all.This Jetfire has been a faithful companion and has never failed to fire. I put a thing strip of neon green on the back edge of the front sight blade that really makes the sight picture pop. To prove a point, I put rounds on a torso-sized target every 10 yards out to 100 yards. Completed the exercise in 28 rounds. Not bad for a small go-everywhere gun.Shows typical wear from every day carry. A previous owner put some wear on the right grip, but it has no impact on use or performance. Very smooth action, tip up barrel snaps free without friction or slop. Magazine drops free with release. No grit. Good luck."

Daniel Defense V11™ (Mil Spec +®)   The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail.  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Mil Spec + Cerakote.
