I will ship it with the box and everything I got with it. The condition of the rail is pretty much new. I accept USPS Money Order as well as others (PayPal, Cash app, etc). Just email me if you have any questions. I don't know why it says I won't ship (I don't know how to change it!), but the price I'm asking includes shipping to the lower 48 states.

Manufactured by Howa in Japan for Smith & Wesson.  This rifle is not a collector's piece, but it is a great shooter...highly accurate with easy recoil.  It has been my go-to deer rifle for the past 10 years.  This gun will easily put down a buck at 300-350 yards, if you can make the shot.  Rifle is topped with a zoomable SIMMONS ""Whitetail"" 3-9 x 40 scope.  Stock was sanded and refinished in a satin/matte finish by a previous owner.  Bluing does show wear, but no rust...just a few minor pitting spots on the barrel.  Bolt action functions smoothly.  Rifle has always been well cared for, cleaned, oiled, and kept in climate controlled storage for 9 months each year (when deer season is not open).  Again, this is no collector's piece...but a highly reliable ""old faithful"" type of rifle.  This piece would be a perfect first rifle for a beginning hunter or a great addition to any collection.  It's a real nice shooting rifle. Many people don't even know S&W made a hunting rifle.  I've seen prices vary widely on these rifles, but based on overall condition I'm asking $275 OBO.  If interested, make me an offer.  All reasonable offer will be considered.  Please contact me with any questions.  Many more pictures are available...just ask.  I can email or text.  Thanks for looking."

This is an amazing looking tactical shotgun and it outperforms most others.
 
The Mossberg® 590® Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a corrosion-resistant Marinecote finish, inside and out, to withstand the punishment of harsh saltwater environments.
This is an ideal self-defense shotgun to have in a boat or yacht; as well as carrying in a vehicle that frequents humid costal areas. The 590 Mariner also makes a practical, low-maintenance home defense shotgun and is one of the best firearms to carry while fishing or camping in bear country. The 590 Mariner is an extremely compact, fast-handling shotgun that stows in minimum space and deploys in an instant.
 The U.S. Military's choice of Model 590 pump shotgun for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 590 utilizes dual action bars to prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action, and a single, large locking lug locks the bolt into the barrel extension, ensuring a solid steel bolt-to-barrel connection.
Dual extractors take a solid grip on the shell's rim for reliable extraction, and an anti-jam shell elevator ensures reliable feeding. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous.
 The Model 590's simplistic design makes fieldstripping easy by tapping out a single pin, and the magazine cap-nut removes for cleaning the spring, shell follower, and any debris in the mag tube. The 590 Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a synthetic buttstock and forearm, a durable recoil pad, and sling swivel studs. The Model 590 cycles 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells interchangeably.
