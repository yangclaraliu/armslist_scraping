I am thinking you keep most and reload some for me as a trade for saving the brass. I am not sure if anyone would even want to do this but I figure it is worth a shot. Right now I only shoot 223/556 and 9mm luger. Maybe a 1/4 deal would be good. You reload a quarter for me and keep the rest. Definitely negotioable on that since I don't really know what it costs to reload. Just hoping to make a deal with someone that is worth while to both parties. If you are interested let me know.

The grip texture is fantastic, the slide finish is smooth but extremely durable, picking up the PPQ gives the sensation that you are holding a quality built firearm from Germany. The gun is also ambidextrous for you lefties out there! It also features a modular backstrap to accomdate all hand sizes. Breakdown takes about 5 seconds by pulling down the piece by the ""Made in Germany"" stamp and then pulling the trigger, that easy!

Handgaurd is Magpul MOE. Complete specs for this upper are available on Palmetto State Armory website.   The lower is Spikes Tactical lower Punisher rollmark. Has PSA lower kit and Magpul MOE grip and buttstock. Also comes with 3 D&H Teflon coated aluminum GI style mags and 2 Magpul Pmags. Also comes with 90 rounds of Federal AR556 55 grain ammo and 80 rounds of PMC X-Tac 62 grain M855 ammo and 436 rounds of factory reman  .223 55 grain ammo. I really like this rifle but it never gets shot and I am trying to get a motorcyle so I am selling this. This rifle has never been fired and all parts are new except for one of the Pmags which I got used. More pics available. Thank you  Must have permit and valid ID to buy"

This is a nicely slicked up gun now.

It is a former police use revolver, so it only fires in double action mode.  I imagine knowledgeable gunsmiths could make this SA/DA but i dont know how and had no desire since it was safer as a home defense firearm in its current configuration.The revolver is in overall good condition with some external wear, but very clean and shiny bore.  the cylinder locks up nicely and it shoots accurately for what it was intended.  I would like to sell it this week if possible as my wife does not like it in the house even unloaded.  I paid over $525 with taxes and fees and I am asking $475 for it.NO CASH AND CARRY!!!!  Only legal xfers will be done at a licensed FFL shop within 15 miles of 91360, but I will not go to the san fernando valley.  If you have an FFL in simi, camarillo, 1000 oaks, etc., we can arrange to have it done.

This LaserMax laser is designed to work exclusively with Ruger® 10/22® Rifle models featuring a barrel band. The bright red 635 nm continuous wave laser is visible out to 100 yards in good lighting conditions and is pre-aligned at 25 yards, but can be easily adjusted for windage and elevation when necessary. Weighing-in at less than 2 ounces, each laser is constructed from Fiberglass Reinforced Nylon (FRN) to withstand exposure to the elements and rough handling. Each laser comes installed with a 1/3N Lithium cell battery for approximately two hours of continuous run time. The two, integrated Picatinny rail surfaces are perfect for attachment of additional accessories, such as a tactical light or infrared laser. All LaserMax lasers are covered by an extended 5-year warranty. The Benchmark for 22 Rifles – Experience the Tradition. The Ruger® 10/22® rifle is America’s favorite 22 LR rifle, with proven performance in a wide range of styles for every rimfire application. Ideally suited for informal target shooting, ""plinking,"" small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. With a variety of choices – from the standard 10/22 Carbine, to the tack-driving accuracy of the Target model, the 10/22 is still today’s most popular 22 rifle. It looks right, feels right, shoots right and continues to perform under heavy use - inspiring the most fanatical loyalty from its owners. With proven design, legendary reliability and the modern features demanded by today’s 22 LR shooters, these firearms are priced right to make keeping tradition affordable. This Ruger 11129 has a MSRP of $399! We are offering it for nearly 1/3 off!!  The LaserMax Laser sold separately on the Ruger site retails for $129.95 and I have seen them as high as $153 This model is being sold on the Gander Mountain site for $349.99 and you would need to add tax and FFL fee to that price to get it shipped here. Bud's Gun Shop has them for $268.83 plus they want you to buy insurance to insure it arrives safely and you will have to pay the FFL fee on top of that. These are available NOW here in Rio Rancho. No FFL fee! No hidden charges. We also have .22LR ammo available for sale so you can shoot the rifle as soon as you get to a proper location. We also have additional magazines up to 32 round capacity available also."
