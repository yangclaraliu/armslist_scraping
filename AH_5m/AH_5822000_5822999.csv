Included with the firearm is a beautiful custom handmade leather holster from Frontier Leatherworks. I have the original bill of sale, as well as the case. I will also throw in some soft-point 44 magnum rounds if you decide to purchase.  $600 or best offer.The ported barrel and padded backstrap make recoil from factory 44 magnum rounds highly managable. A frequent misconception is that the Raging Bull is the same as the Taurus Model 44 - it is not. This model (444) has a larger frame and because of this increase in size, can handle any 44 magnum loads with much more managability and accuracy than the standard frame. The model 44 has also been subject to some reliability issues. Please feel free to message me if you would like more information.
When the purchase is made, for the protection of both the buyer and seller, both parties will sign a bill of sale.  Thanks for looking!"

Buyer backed out. Looking to sell or trade my Arsenal AK. I've had it from day 1. If you're looking for a totally stock factory rifle, this is not for you. If you want a shooter, this one is. The barrel has been shortened to 14.5"", with a pinned and welded PWS brake. Has a Tapco trigger group, Wolffextra power recoil spring, and Magpul pistol grip. I do have the original pistol grip and recoil spring. The sight post is not Arsenal, asthe original was damaged during the barrel shortening?? No idea how, but whatever. The bolt has been polished after I used degreaser on it and removed the paint. It has around 1000 flawless rounds through it. This is rifle only, no mags. I have other AK's, so I need them. I do have 5 or 6 Tapco mags that I will include, if you want them. They worked great. I live in Galveston County. I will meet within reason. A bill of sale, with ID is needed. If I ship, it will be FFL to FFL, after payment has cleared. Shipping will be on buyers dime. If I missed anything, don't hesitate to ask questions. I will trade for an AK pistol, or an AR pistol upper in 7.62x39 or .223. Thanks for looking. Price is firm. Lowered from the original ad. Was  $950."
