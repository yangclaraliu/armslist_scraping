The rail has keymod sections on the bottom and accepts bolt on picatinny rails on the sides. I have included 1 rail section with the upper. Here are the specs:* PSA 11.5"" Carbine Length 5.56 NATO SS9G2 Melonite Upper* 1:7 Twist Rate* 8.5"" Midwest Industries lightweight railI had this upper mounted on my registered SBR. It is the most lightweight upper I have ever had. I was able to sink sub 1"" groups at 50 yards and 1"" groups at 100 yards with a red dot. Like all my rifles, it has been well maintained. It has less than 500 rounds through it. I recently replaced this upper with a PWS piston driven upper with an adjustable gas block for one of my supressors. As such, this upper has been sitting in the safe. Like everyone, I need to make room in my safe. This upper sells for $349 on PSA's website plus shipping. I paid $125 for the NB BCG at a gun show from a local CNC machine company in Raleigh. All in, I have $475 in this setup. I am selling it for $275. This represents a 43% discount for being used. This is unheard of on Armslist. This will make for a great budget pistol or SBR build. I accept cash only, no trades or partial trades. My price is fair and firm. I do all transactions at my local FFL here in Apex, NC. While this is not a serialized item, I still require a copy of CCP or pistol purchase permit to make sure that I am selling to responsible gun owners.

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm. Key Features:  Non-radioactive luminescent three dots sights for fast target acquisition. Accessory night sights also available. P30SKS variant has ambidextrous safety levers located on both sides of the slide V3 Double Action/Single Action model has spurred hammer and decocking lever. LEM variants have a no-snag bobbed hammer. 6 grip panels and 3 backstraps can be easily changed for a custom fit  Specifications:  Caliber: 9x19mm Length: 9.42"" Height: 4.57"" Width: 1.37"" Barrel Length: 3.27"" Weight (with Empty Magazine): 23.99 oz Magazine Capacity: 10"

The Jager is the rifle for the precision shooter, competitor, or varmint hunter. This rifle was built with accuracy and high level performance in mind, and it does not disappoint. The rifle features an Ergo ambidextrous grip, Magpul CTR stock and Samson Evo rail for a top level furniture package. In addition to being comfortable it is also rugged and durable even in unforgiving hunting, competition, or tactical environments. The 15 inch Samson Evo rail was made with modularity in mind, allowing the user to place accessories and rail sections where they want them. The long length of the rail also allows the user to use rests or sand bags with ease, and the option of mounting a bipod further away from the stock for exceptional balance and stability. Additional rail pieces and other mounting options are available as well. The rail also features anti rotational tabs making the rail that much more impressive, virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail loosing alignment even under hard use.
The fire control group of this rifle features the amazing JP-EZ trigger system. This trigger provides a clean, crisp break at approximately 4.5 lbs. and a distinct strong reset. The performance of this single stage trigger is impressive as there is virtually no creep or take-up. The trigger also allows the user to configure the trigger to their needs by using different spring kits. This rifle also features an ambidextrous safety.
The rifle-length direct impingement gas system is the original gas system of the M16/AR15 family of rifles and has been tried and true in all environments and has been in use by our armed forces for decades. The gas block is firmly secured under the Samson Evo rail with Unbrako set screws. By using a low profile gas block, the longer Samson Evo rail can be used allowing a longer sight radius if iron sights are used. The gas tube has been Melonite treated for extra corrosion resistance and reliability.
The bolt carrier group is an M16 weight carrier made from 8620 steel and is finished inside and out with a new, cutting edge proprietary coating process by Adams Arms called Lifecoat™. The Lifecoat™ process offers multiple advantages over and above traditional current coating processes on the market today. These advantages include a harder surface level then hard chrome, superior lubricity properties, and excellent corrosion resistance, all superior to traditional Mil-Spec Parkerizing. The gas key is heat treated and finished with the same new coating process as the carrier, attached to the carrier with Grade 8 fasteners manufactured in the United States, and properly staked. The bolt is manufactured from proper Mil-Spec Carpenter No. 158 ® Steel, magnetic particle inspected (MPI), and has a carbine extractor spring, insert, and Crane O-ring.
The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical dimensions held within +-.001” and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil spec receiver extension/buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a 2010 endurance test, a randomly selected P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. P30 and P30S models are available in 9 mm and .40 S&W. Key Features:  Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Multiple trigger firing modes available Patented HK recoil reduction system One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Corrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finish Ambidextrous slide levers and Ambidextrous magazine release magazine Patented lock-out safety device Bobbed hammer (LEM models) Spurred hammer (DA/SA models) Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties Ambidextrous safety levers (P30S model)  Technology  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore: During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame: A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.

Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol. Features and System Characteristics:  Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Grooved target triggers Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel No snag, bobbed hammer Flared recurve trigger guard Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Contoured, extended slide release Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator Patented Lock-Out Safety device  Specifications:  Caliber: 9x19mm Overall Length: 6.81"" Overall Height: 5.00"" Overall Width: 1.38"" Barrel Length: 3.58"" Sight Radius: 5.31"" Weight without Magazine: 27.20 oz Weight with Empty Magazine: 1.60 lb Magazine Capacity: 10/13 Rounds Sights: Fixed"

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a 2010 endurance test, a randomly selected P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. P30 and P30S models are available in 9 mm and .40 S&W. Key Features:  Spurred hammer Ambidextrous slide levers MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories Ambidextrous magazine release Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates  Technology:  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore: During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame: A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

It is a fantastic rifle. The most reliable firearm you can hunt with, and TONS of class. It is in great shape, with the metal all near perfect and the bore shiny and bright and the wood being near perfect with only a couple minor surface marks in the finish, from light field use.I primarily shot handloads at moderate pressure with lead bullets and it is an absolute tack driver. I am including a handloading kit for it, so all you need is powder, primer and projectile. there's a couple youtube videos that explain it pretty simply. There is also the 20 fired brass that have been reloaded once, and the loaded ammunition. The nice thing about reloading for this rifle is that your cases last a very long time. If you want to push the caliber's limits, this is one of the few that will easily do it.It's also a huge piece of history, as this weas the design that put John Moses Browning on the map, as a firearms designed and builder.I am mostly looking for a straight across trade for a simple, good quality AR. If your's is home built(not from a well known manufacturer), I will want to run at least 2 full mags through it before the deal is final. That's non-negotiable. I will run it through drills, so if you aren't 150% sure that thing will give the same reliability as a colt, then please, don't offer it. I'm not looking for something to entertain myself. I'm looking for a tool. Other than that, No other trades. No offers of less than $950. I will not accept it."

It has not been refurbished in anyway. The accessories in the picture come with the rifle ...sling, ammo pouch, oiler. There is still cosmolene packed in the rifle. I have not fired this rifle at all so it needs to be checked out by a qualified gunsmith before firing.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719. Key Features:  Patented HK charging supports make pulling the Vp slide rearward effortless Enlarged, heavy-duty extractor for reliability also functions as a loaded chamber indicator Low profile right side slide release lever Extended Picatinny rail rated to handle lights, lasers, aimers, and other accessory loads up to 5.6 ounces with no impact on performance Trigger safety latch Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference  Technology  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore: During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame: A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719. Key Features:  Patented HK charging supports make pulling the Vp slide rearward effortless Enlarged, heavy-duty extractor for reliability also functions as a loaded chamber indicator Low profile right side slide release lever Extended Picatinny rail rated to handle lights, lasers, aimers, and other accessory loads up to 5.6 ounces with no impact on performance Trigger safety latch Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference  Technology  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore: During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame: A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

I have been working on it ever since, customizing it and converting it with the help of a gunsmith and a machinist into the longer-range version of the AR-15, the SR-25. We have put so much time and effort into this gun that I am a bit sad to see it go. However, it is time to move on to my next project, and I want to ""clean house"" a bit. There are a lot of extras coming with this gun, between upgrades, included parts, magazines, reticles, ammunition, and case/lock. Please bear with me if I forget to list a specific part, as I don't even remember all of the upgrades that we put in. If you email me, I can send a complete list of everything, or at least as complete as possible. I know one of the three of us has the list somewhere.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP).

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Or trade, or trade and cash. Price will double if Hillary gets elected.The 556R is a piston-operated rifle, so there are no requirements for a stock buffer tube. That means there are no limitations to the type of stock that can be affixed to this handy little rifle. The standard configuration of the Sig Sauer 556R has a fixed-length folding stock. That means in the “stock open” configuration, you have a fixed length of pull. For discreet transport or operation in tight quarters, you can fold the stock into a snap-locked position along the right side of the receiver. You can reach the bolt, trigger, and magazine release in this configuration and fire the gun. I tried that and have to admit it’s kind of fun. Make no mistake, if you want to shoot accurately, you’ll want to use the stock. Just know the pistol option is there if you want it.Here are its factory specs:Caliber: 7.62×39 mmOverall length: 35.875 inchesRifling: 1 in 9.5 inchesNumber of grooves: 4Barrel length: 16 inchesWeight without mag: 7 lbsWhile the rifle design is classic Sig, they’ve built the 556R to accept standard AK magazines. You’ll find a short magazine well to properly accommodate the sharply curved magazines. The magazine release is a hinged lever on the lower front edge of the trigger guard. Just push that forward to release the mag. It won’t drop free on its own accord due to the “rock in” seating method. To insert a magazine, stuff the top leading edge into the well first and rock the magazine backward until it locks into place. It’s an easy and positive operation on this rifle—you won’t be needing to finesse the magazine into the proper position.By completing this transaction YOU confirm that YOU are legal and are in accordance with all federal and state laws regarding firearms ownership.Trade, Cash or PayPal only.

Has some minor (VERY MINOR) marks of wear on the top of the slide, but no deep gouges or scrapes. Gun has been well cleaned and cared for. Included are 82 rds of Hornady Custom (runs flawlessly in the weapon,) an extra mag, and a custom pocket holster by Lisa Hedley. The gun fits the holster perfectly. Unquestionably one of the best holsters I have ever used. I also added a custom grip extension to a magazine as you can see in the photo. The weapon will come with all the paper work and original box, and the original mag plate that I removed for the grip extension. Gun is to be transferred at Pullman Arms in Worcester. Buyer pays fee: $25 cash or $35 card. Price, meeting place, and buyer paying transfer fee is firm. Cash only. Any email negotiating the price will be ignored. This is a difficult gun to find, and I have a lot of money invested. After this, it goes back in the safe. Thanks for looking!"
