Little about Springfield Armory In the mid 1980s, the US military began the process of retiring their old warhorse. In 1985, Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois first offered newly manufactured 1911s to the gun buying public. The next 28 years firmly established Springfield Armory® as the leading manufacturer of 1911s – and the standard by which all other 1911s are judged today.

The smallest of Steyr’s pistol line, the S9A1 has a 3.6” (91mm) barrel and the same short overall length as the C-A1 but features a short grip for ultra-concealment. As with each model in the Steyr A1 line of products, the pistol features a low bore-axis which minimizes recoil and improves control while the ergonomic grip offers optimal control for a variety of hand sizes. The lower frame of the gun offers a standard slide-lock thumb tab, right-handed magazine ejection button and pivoting break-down lever. A key-operated manual safety feature is located next to the break-down lever and 2 keys are provided with each pistol. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action.  S9-A1    Caliber 9mm   Magazine 10+1   Trigger Reset Action (double action)   Grip Frame Synthetic Grip   Dimensions 6.5""x4.8""x1.2""   Barrel Length 3.6""   Weight 1.67 lbs    Great pistol Review by SRW       Quality      As good or better than any striker fired polymer handgun I have fired. Not what I would call a sub-compact, comparable to mid sized Glocks. Ergonomics are excellent. I have fairly large hands while my wife's hands are very small yet I fits well for each. Very easy to control recoil. Approximately 1000 rounds fired and I only recall one malfunction that could be blamed on the gun, a failure to extract. All rounds fired have been reloads so it could have been my ammo. 115 and 124 grain ball and a few JHP bullets, it isn't picky. The Trapezoid sights take some practice if your used to three dots. I like them, fast and precise. Still debating on getting aftermarket tritium three dot. The trigger is excellent for a striker fired gun. I like the Ghost triggers in my Glocks, the Steyr is as good or better out of the box. Reset is short but not as easy to feel as the Glock, takes a few hundred rounds to get the hang of it.  I also have the M40-A1, it is equally good. If you are looking for a striker fired gun take a look at the Steyrs, pull the trigger, check out the sights and grip, it may be just what you want. While no handgun is perfect for everyone, these are top quality guns in every way.

A full-length integrated Picatinny rail allows for mounting of nearly any standard light and/or laser and two recoil groves in the rail provides adjustment for whatever accessory is installed on the firearm. The slide of the Steyr L-A1 also features slide-racking grooves at both the rear and front of the slide.

I don't know all of the places to find the serial numbers but from what I can see, the components have matching Serial #s. The last time I shot this rifle, I was rolling a garbage can at about 600 yards with iron sights while a friend of mine spotted for me... so yes, it's a tack driver and I'd hate to be on the receiving end.I'd like to get $299 out of it but feel free to make an offer; just know that at some point the intrinsic value of a working gun will outweigh my desire to sell it.I'll let the pictures talk now.

Has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range, and only two to three mags per trip on the few trips it has seen. Incredibly accurate and easy to shoot, my wife and I can rip the bulleye out of a 6"" target at 20yds no problem. Premium quality pistol that is a great representation of the CZ brand. It comes in the original case with all original paperwork and 2 16rnd mags and the cleaning rods. Same size as the glock 19, and much much nicer. This is truly a go-to-war gun that you can bet your life on. Offers will be considered:) I have the kydex mold for an alien gear holster I can include if you have a cloak tuck holster. Paid $580 for it. Looking around they tend to run in the $500-530 range online plus shipping and transfer, so pretty much what I paid last year seems to hold true now. Get it here for less hassle and save $100. Ill even include some ammo so you are range ready. Only selling to fund purchase of CZ sp01.The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.http://www.gunsholstersandgear.com/gun-reviews/cz-p-07-duty-review/"

I am looking to purchase a gun that would be a good open carry gun. So no revolvers or sub-compact/body gaurd size pistols. I am looking in the price range of $200-$350ish (cheap, but reliable) but it can be more depending on if it comes with a holster, cleaner, lubricant or other accesories. If you are just selling a handgun with magazines, Id have to spend at least $100 just for cleaner, lubricant, holster and everything else you need. I know my price range is a little bit on the lower side but I know there are plenty of decent reliable handguns out there for this price. My last one was a $250 9mm 1911 style handgun that was made in Serbia and it was actually a great gun but it just wasnt practical for day to day open carry use... it was more of a range practice gun or home defense gun so I sold it. I have bought and sold all my pistols private party and prefer to keep it that way, less of a hassle. I do not have a CCW, I dont conceal carry. I am not a felon and will not buy if you are a felon. I would like to do a bill of sale because I would like record of the transaction. Below is a list of specs I am looking for...Must be at least:-Semi-Auto-9mm or higher caliber -No revolvers-No Sub Compact/body gaurds-Barrel size of 3 1/2"" to 4 1/3"" (3.68"" is what I had before and it was perfect size)-Dont really care how much the magazine holds-Weight of gun doesnt matter to me-Have no preference on brandSerious sellers only please. Contact me if you are selling something close to what I am looking for and we will go from there. Thank you. JayREDACTED"

The .22 caliber Walther/HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense. Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Walther, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries. The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.
