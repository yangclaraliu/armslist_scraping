Rifle started as a complete Bushmaster XM15-E2S 6.8mm SPC lower, changed out the handgrip for a CAA rubberized grip, the upper is a generic A3 upper with no dust cover or forward assist to keep the rifle looking smooth and clean, the handle on the top is also a removeable add on with built in hard sight and removeable scope mount. The butt stock is an Ace LTD fixed skeleton style with nice padding and a tacticalsprings.com heavy buffer spring and extra heavy buffer inside. The barrel is a Stag arms 16"" medium barrel and also included the muzzle break and combination front sight/gas block. The forward stock is a UTG aluminum quad rail currently holding a magpul grip. Internally there is a LWRC 6.8mm SPC combat bolt and firing pin as well as a generic 3-9x 40mm scope to round it all off. I built it about a year ago and since then have never had a chance to shoot it. The rifle will also include 2 metal 25 round magazines, the original stag arms forward stock and hardware, original bushmaster handgrip, original spring and buffer, an extra gas tube and the 2 6.8 dummy rounds i got for it. Action works very well, spring is super strong and it takes some effort to cock the gun but the combination of the heavy buffer and spring plus the LWRC combat bolt makes it feel nice and smooth. Rifle has no issues loading the dummy rounds into the barrel or ejecting them and firing pin lines up and strikes good. And not that i know why but if anyone was so inclined the lower and bulk of the parts are standard and the gun could easily be converted to a standard .223/556 with just a couple parts.

 The Advantage Tactical Firefly front sight inserts, the newest Advantage Tactical product, incorporate the latest chemical and manufacturing technology to produce glow in darkness. The Firefly night sight upgrade will swap out with any of our standard nylon front sight inserts, for all of our products. The Fireflies come two per package -- one in the yellow spectrum and one in the green spectrum.Firefly insert upgrades will glow for many hours with a short exposure to a strong light source, for example: 1 minute of strong sunlight exposure for an 8+ hour glow; positioning the firefly 1” to 2” from a 75 watt lamp for 90 seconds for a 6 hour glow. In addition, when the glow has finally diminished after many hours, just two seconds of a tactical light will bring back the glow for another 90 minutes or so. Once charged, casual exposure to some ambient, will increase glow time duration. The Fireflies never wear out or lose their glow capabilities. One may expect decades of use with the Firefly, along with unwaning glow times.Slightly used, only 2 months old.  $130 for this setup from the manufacturer.Text Doug @ 719 640 96zero1.  If this listing is active, the item is still available.  Listing gets pulled as soon as item is sold.Thanks for looking."
