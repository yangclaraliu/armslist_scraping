25,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5712025,For Sale:  Beautiful Early Smith and Wesson Model  44 Double Action Frontier #3,"Lexington, VA, Virginia, United States","$ 1,400","Listed On: Saturday, July 23, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Chambered for the 44-40 cartridge, this is a seperate model from the 44 double-action 1st model. It has the longer (1 9/16"") cylinder like the 44 double-action first model. Produced from 1886 to 1916 there were approximately 15,340 built. This revolver is an early model with a serial number of 1167*(star stamp).  The gun was sent back to the factory in July of 1940 and had the top break release replaced. The current owner bought it some 40 years ago and it is believed prior to that it was in the same family since purchased. There is no available documentation of what work was done other than the sight replaced. However I believe it was refinished at the factory then, as there are two year stamps on the barrel that are not clear and it is in such beautiful condition it is hard to believe it is the original finish. All parts except the top-break release have matching serial number 1167. The gun is in almost pefect mechanical condition. Trigger is crisp, solid and functions like a new gun. The trigger retains it's gun-metal petina again no rust of any kind. Top break is tight and ejectors are smooth in almost perfect condition. The rifling in the barrel is still quite crisp for a gun this age. The barrel, as any gun this age is lightly pitted but no rust and one of the better barrels I've seen on this age of gun. Current owner reporst it is a good shooter as well. BUT YOU SHOULD NOT USE MODERN 44-40 loads. These where made with 1886 metal and were charged with BLACK POWDER not modern smokeless. The finish shows light ""buffing"" scratches. It appears previous owners spent more time polishing it than shooting it. There is a long very light scratch that runs from the front of the cylinder to just past the rear of the cylinder that appears to be caused by holstering. As is often seen with these guns, there are two series of 1/8"" notches directly infront of the topbreak release. The design of the gun is such that unless you take extra caution the release slides over this part at the rear of the barrel and will sometimes make two marks. The original hard rubber handles are in excellent shape save for three small nicks on the left side on the front of the diamond around the resessed grip screw. Bluing on the trigger guard is near perfect. If you were not familiar with these revolver you would swear this gun was manufactured less than 20 years ago. It is just a beautiful gun in all but perfect mechanical condition. I am advertising this gun for an elederly neighbot who is liquidating a good portion of his extensive collection. As a collectable we know that the apparent refinishing takes it out of serious collectors consideration. BUT as a display model I don't think you will find a better example. He is asking $1,400 but serious and REASONABLE offers will be considered. This is just an out and out a beautiful firearm and one of the finest examples of an early, fully functional and beautifully finished Smith and Wesson #3 Model 44 Double-Action Frontier Look closely at the pcitures (more available) as I've tried to describe every issue but may have missed something. Many more pictures are available and I can email them to serious inquiries. . Shipping to FFL and insurance will be $25 USD.Even though this is an antique it is capable of firing modern ammuntition so I must send to FFL through FedEx or UPS."

First, the rifle has never been refinished, this rifle shows honest wear - there is honest wear on the stock, given age and use, but none, that would render this rifle, unsafe to shoot, in my estimate. The stock has never been refinished, or molested - the condition you see it in, is the condition it was in, after they dumped it into an armory, up until century arms started importing them here into America, sometime back. This is a Finn M39, parts and matching, do not go hand in hand, for most rifles, that the Finn's built, from captured rifles, after the Winter War, given the mass quanity of stock, captured by the Finn's, and the fact that, they had to fight yet another War (Continuation War) subsequentally, and drive the Germans out, and throw together as many rifles as they could.About the rifle - The action and barrel, are in decent shape, the bore is shiny. The receiver, has no markings, other than ""S"" and ""A"", stamped onto both the left, and right side, of the lower metal tang. The bolt assembly, does NOT match, the magazine and bolt, serial numbers, don't match, and the bolt head has a Tula star, on the left. The barrel skank, is stamped ""S.A VKT 1944"" followed by the ""D"" indication, which means the rifle can shoot 7.62x54r machine-gun ammo (typical, of all Finn rifles, produced, during this time). I can text pictures of the rifle, provided I have a phone number. The only trades that would interest me, would be a Ballester Molina, or Star Model B 9mm Pistol.I have a valid FOID and 03 FFL, so I can ship to any 03 FFL in Illinois, or, if you don'th have an 03 FFL, I will ship to your local FFL dealer.All Federal, State and local laws apply. It's your responsibility, to ensure, you can lawfully acquire, and possess this Title I Firearm, as defined by the Gun Control Act of 1968."

The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."
