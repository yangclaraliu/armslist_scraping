Only used once with 50 rounds.  Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter.   The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of a trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action."

Come with 3 10rd magazines, sling, and PSO1 scope. Romania Cugir, this rifle has matching serial number magazines & scope from Romania by Century Arms International. Can an meet in palm beach or Broward county.   Prefer CCW holder.  Details below.PSL rifles are made at the Regia Autonoma de Tehnica Militara (RATMIL) - CUGIR arsenal in Bucharest Romania. Their primary purpose is to be used by a Designated Marksman to extend the reach of a typical soldier beyond the capabilities of their issued AKM carbines. The PSL uses an RPK reciever (stamped versus the milled Dragunov receiver) with the AK long stroke piston for the 7.62x54r cartridge, and is similar in appearance to the SVD Dragunov. The weapon is chambered for the venerable M1908/30 7.62 x 54R (rimmed) cartridge, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of the SVD in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian magazines. The magazines, though they look similar in shape, are not interchangeable between the SVD and PSL. The PSL is typically issued with a version of the PSO-1 telescopic weapon sight, this version lacking the battery compartment is illuminated by mildly radioactive Tritium. The tritium is usually removed before export. The optical sight is of 4X magnification and the lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian scope. The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the locking lever open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy use of the iron sights. The Design: The gas system on the PSL consists of a one piece gas piston and bolt carrier which is similar to the AK series rifles. The buttstock is made from laminated wood and features a cheek pad designed into the comb. Internals of this rifle also differ considerably from the Dragunov design. The PSL, has a trigger and hammer very similar to AK-type firearms. The rifle features a 23.4 inch chrome lined barrel with a 1:10 right hand twist and a 2 ¾ muzzle break with twelve vents. The rifle features sights which range from 100-to-1200 meters, with 100 meter increments."

Nicest thing is no shovel handle looking buffer tube sticking out the butt like AR's have, so you can get around a corner easier! NOTE: If you are reading this, yes it is still available. Ad will be taken down once it's gone. Thanks!WHAT IS IT? WHAT's INCLUDED? It is a KelTec PLR 16 that looks very different from what it left the factory looking like! Vltor rail (over $200) and forend system. This system is not a direct bolt on. The gun and system had to be fabricated to fit together. Magpul buis iron sights ($95) and angled foregrip ($40), Noveske ""flaming pig"" flash hider ($125) This piece sends the sound forward so you aren't blasted by the sound wave these guns produce (from the factory, these guns are louder than ANYTHING I've ever heard shot). The sound and accompanying flame that shoots out the front is enough to send a thug home crying. Also included is one Pmag (30 round, cost $15) and the padded carrying case (cost $85). Add everything up, including the base gun (cost $500) and that's $1,060 before tax, fees and before what I paid for the rail fitting, the sling adapter the sling and the small front rail attachement(about another $150 all together, so over $1,200 total).I would like to either sell it for $825 cash (Firm) or can accept a partial trade with cash. Only trades I'm interested in are 9mm pistols (WITH CASH) or if you have a S&W SV or SD .40 at a decent price ($200-$300 trade value depending on age, model and extras as that's what I've bought them for pre-loved in the past). I also need some (not a lot though) 9mm ammo. NOTE: I have received a lot of offers with folks offering a ton of ammo. I only want maybe 2 boxes. Also, I need some cash on top of whatever you have to trade. Will only consider trading for two handguns as a straight trade if their combined trade value is $1,200+. Not interested in releasing any cash for a trade up. Thanks for reading all of this and considering it in your offers!!!"

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.

Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area only.  I will ship, but it will run $20-$30 per container or probably around $40 for both.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This gun doesn't shoot like a Glock, Honestly there is no gun comparable on the market that isn't custom built.  It has the Zev Fulcrum trigger system which pulls at about 2.5 pounds, so this gun should only go to someone who is familiar with guns and knows how to handle them safely. This gun costs $1650 dollars with the barrel, and is in excellent condition. It is very easy to shoot this gun well, the trigger is the best striker trigger on the market, and the gun is capable of extreme accuracy. The original Glock barrel will be included with the gun."

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping.  I’m in College Station so anywhere in the Austin-DFW-Houston triangle is do-able.  If you can meet me part-way to help reduce my driving time that would be appreciated but it's not required.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  I’d prefer cash please so I can go buy something else.  Sorry, not interested in trades..   Price is firm and I’m definitely not interested in low-ball offers.  Thanks!"

I have a like new Ruger Charger 22lr pistol. Excellent condition and barely used. Comes with all original materials.RUGER box, 15 round bx mag, and utg bipod and extra Ruger BX 25 round magazine.Has a threaded barrel and custom shark muzzle brake. Also comes with a RUGER carrying zip up case.I upgraded the stock to an Promag Archangel AR pistol stock and added promag steel sights. The front sight post is painted white and red for higher visibility and makes for quicker target acquisition. Also has an installed blackhawk sling adaptor for a sling. If you need a sling I can throw in a paracord sling for you as well if you would like. Has been flawless and only about 200 rounds through it. This charger has been fun but I decided I want to maybe get a rifle and start a new project. Asking 380 or best offer for everything listed above.I also have an optional very nice truglo red/green dot 4 reticle open sight that retails 60$ and is sighted in Co witness as shown in the picture with the iron sights. I can throw in 200 rounds of cci mini mag with the deal and a Wobble shooting target that retails 20$ shown in the picture.So with the 200 rounds of ammo, target, and the truglo red dot I'm asking $440 for the Ruger Charger with everything included.  I'm open to trades for AR15s, AK pistols, glock, sig, sw handguns. Let me know what you got and maybe we can make a deal. We will meet at ffl for transfer and will cost 25$. If my asking price of $440 is met I will also throw in an additional 100 rounds of 22lr which will help with the ffl transfer fee."
