But since I moved here I have not been able to get the free time to go to any matches. So, now I have this sweet pistol that fires like an absolute dream, and I can't use it. I bought the Racegun with no sights, but I added my C-More to it. I have taken it to the range a couple times to test different types of ammo to see what works and what doesn't (race guns are notoriously picky) but this baby ate anything I put in it!! I have tried 4 different types of ammo so far. For a total of about 250 rounds (probably less)As you can see in the I tunes, it comes with the weapon itself (obviously), spare springs of different weights (which have never been used), one mag, the C-More, and 2.5 boxes of American Eagle 38SA +P and one box of Remongton .38SA +P, half a box of Armscor .38SA, an awesome gun case that has combination lockAt 1500 the pistol itself is a steal, add the C-More and you can't get a better price.I have a few more pictures and willing to share, just ask. Any sales will be to people with proper ID and can do a FFL transfer if desired at the gun store (FGC more than likely, but we can figure that out.)"

218,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5601218,For Sale:  ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT),"Sunriver/La Pine, Bend, Oregon",$ 65,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 21, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT).The ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.Note: HardLubing is ALG's term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT's single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components.1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter• The ALG Defense ACT trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components.• Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged.• Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness.• Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness.• Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications.• A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition.• Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated.• Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.0lbs.2. Advantages for the Armorer• The ALG Defense ACT trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.• Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.• As a trigger meeting the essential U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense ACT can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements."

Like new, perfect with no blemishes or wear. If you are not familiar with LaRue, their machining is absolute perfection – this is the best lightweight AR-10 money can buy.From Larue's website:The PredatAR 7.62 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 7.62 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly-accurate OBR 7.62 “Heavy” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 7.62 rifle.The barrels are lightweight-profiled and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24.The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.Included with the rifle: ($3900)Geissele SSA triggerSurefire SOCOM muzzle brake, properly shimmed and clocked.All black LaRue tactical furniture.

Buy everything together for $4900.FTF preferred, I will pay transfer at FFL of your choice in the greater Tacoma/Olympia area. I may consider shipping to an FFL but would rather not. If I were spending this kind of money on a rifle - I would want to shoot it first - and so can you! If you are serious about buying, and willing to drive to Paul Bunyan Rifle and Sportsman's Club in Puyallup, you are welcome to shoot it before you buy.Please research the components before making me an insulting offer. This is a fair price – and that's not even considering the fact I had to wait almost 2 years to get this rifle, or factoring in about $400 in taxes on everything. I don't believe in tallying up all my reciepts and passing that on – I just ask for a fair price for a very desirable product. Why am I selling it? Because several match pistols have caught my eye and I am more of a pistol shooter anyway. Also, I need a new washing machine!Thanks for looking."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.Made in U.S.A.FEATURESNext-generation impact and crush resistant polymer constructionModified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec platformsConstant-curve internal geometry for smooth feedingAnti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliabilityLong life USGI-spec stainless steel springOver-travel insertion stop on the spineRibbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handlingPaint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification markingFlared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouchesPop-off Impact/Dust Cover to minimize debris intrusion and for ammunition protection in storage and transit"

Retailed for up to $500 new plus accessories.  If you are worried about my (obviously) poor paint job you could have it bead blasted for $25 and then it would be flat dark earth again. It is worth WAY more than I am asking because I am selling it super cheap to raise money for an AK purchase. The red dot it brand new - purchased, installed and painted only.

I thought I would.  The condition is near perfect. It was last fired in 2015, and was cleaned afterwards. Included is a 2nd magazine, with extended grip, and 7 round capacity.  This is an excellent back up gun, for law enforcement. This is a personal sale, however, I'm a small business owner, so, I can accept different payment types, and will ship, to a confirmed FFL holder ONLY. I would ship UPS Ground, insured, for (an additional) $13 total.  Shipping only to the lower 48 states."

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.
 
The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on current models are 18"" long; a longer barrel length of 24"" available as the hunter variant.. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style flash hider.  All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel assembly. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from optics and sight systems available on the market. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.$1800 for rifle, $2200 with optional EOTech sight"

Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. Easy to Operate The controls of the 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.  Convenient Tip-Up Barrel Design The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.  Easy to Conceal and Shoot  Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense."
