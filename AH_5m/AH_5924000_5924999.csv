Sells for $12/20 in local stores, I will sell these 7 boxes for $70Total of both sets of ammo is $355. If someone buys both lots together, I will sell both together for $330 as a package deal. I'm not interested in splitting up the lot at the present time and not interested in any trades. I work in Huntsville near the Gate 9/Research Park area and live in the Grant area, so I am willing to meet in those locations or anywhere in between. Please be an Alabama resident with a valid drivers license. Thank you for looking and I look forward to helping supply someone with some quality 223 ammo. -Mike"

It has right at 225 rounds through it, with 20 of those being LC XM193 55gr FMJ for break-in and 200 being 69gr PPU BTHP match. No steel case has ever been shot. I hand built this rifle myself late last year but just don't shoot it enough to justify keeping it when I shoot my other ARs more. With quality 69gr and 75gr Ammo, it shoots 0.7 MOA and shot sub-half MOA with 5 handloads I tried using 75gr Hornady BTHP and Varget that shoots well in my other rifles. Below are the build specs on the rifle and scope:Anderson A3 Upper + Anderson Upper Build KitAnderson Lower + PSA MOE Lower Parts KitMidwest Industries Gen2 SS RailAnderson M16 Full Auto BCGAnderson CHAnderson Mil-Spec Buffer Tube AssemblyMagpul MOE Carbine StockYHM Low Profile Gas BlockGreen Mountain 16"" Fluted 1:7 GM-M6 BarrelA2 Flash HiderPrimary Arms 4-14x44 FFP MIL/MIL ScopePrimary Arms Deluxe Extended 30mm Scope MountI have built over a dozen AR15s for myself and close friends over the years and always build them correctly following all torque specs. I also properly lapped the upper receiver for better barrel alignment and increased accuracy (I do this on all ARs I build). The gun is definitely a good shooting rifle that doesn't break the bank (intended goal of the build). I will sell the gun, scope, and mount for $900, or I will separate the gun and scope/mount for $725 and $250 respectively. I am not interested in any trades. Please be an Alabama resident with a valid drivers license and I would prefer you have a valid Alabama CCP as well. I work in Huntsville near the Gate 9/Research Park area and live in the Grant area, so I am willing to meet in those locations or anywhere in between. Thank you for looking and I look forward to supplying someone with a quality rifle setup who can use it more than I currently am. -Mike"
