It was common back then for a hardware or sporting goods store to raffle off a .22 rifle, and what better way to draw attention than a nickle plated one in the front window. There's no way to tell how many of these were ordered but I would have to guess at least 50. It's still a rare rifle, though. Anyway, I would like to trade it for something else. I never have shot it. Just don't care for the clack, clack of a model 63 as it cycles. The rifle has some minor rust on the rear sight and you can tell it has been shot some. Make me an offer of something you would be willing to trade for it. I am valuing it conservatively at $800. It's probably worth a good deal more....."

Its small size makes it easy to store in a number of easily-reachable locations in case of an emergency, or even to carry on your person. Best of all, because a handgun requires only a single hand to operate, your other hand is left free to engage in other actions such as holding a flashlight"

Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic. VTAC M&P Sights are compatible with M&P full size, M&P Pro, M&P Shield and M&P Compact. Tapered Front Sight; Serrated Front and Rear Sights; Fiber Optic Speed Sight; Tritium Night Sights.M&P Product information:Reinforced polymer chassis, superior ergonomics, ambidextrous controls, proven safety features. The new standard in reliability when your job is to serve and protect and your life is on the line.In the design of the M&P, we considered the needs of military and law enforcement from every conceivable angle.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in a emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.Features:- Always red - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use.- 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.- In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy.- Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes.- Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifiers and Concealed Engagement unit.- Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.- Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).- Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.- Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with both covers closed in an emergency.- Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.- Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. (Adapter available for carry handle mounting)- Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.- QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.- Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage, fingerprints and scratches.Applications:- Law Enforcement carbines, rifles, shotguns and sub-machine guns- Optical Data- Objective Lens: Band Pass coating for NVD- LED, Light Source Wave Length: 650 nm, red light- Red Dot Size: 2 MOA*- Eye Relief: Unlimited- Optical Surfaces: All surfaces anti-reflex coated multi-layer coated objective lens- Magnification: 1XElectronic Data:- Battery: DL 1/3N- Battery Life: 3 years continuous at setting 7**- Dot Intensity Regular: Rotary switch- Settings: 4 NVD and 6 Daylight including 1 extra brightMechanical Data:- Surface Finish: Hard anodized- Adjustment: 1 click 1/2"" at 100 yards- Mounting Method: QRP2 mount for M1913 standard Picatinny rail, and spacer for AR15/M4 carbine application included.Environmental Data:- Temp Range: -50 - 160F- Water Resistance: Submersible to 150 feetDimensions:- Length: 5.1""- Weight: 11.6 oz. including mount and spacer- Ring Diameter: 30mm- * MOA (minute of angle) 1 MOA 30mm at 100 meters 1"" at 100 yards- ** at room temperature"

Based on Benjamin's proven American-made PCP platform, the Pioneer can be cocked with two fingers (and decocked just as easily), fires 8 shots in the same amount of time it takes to fire three from a crossbow, all up to a blazing 450 FPS / 160 FPE.At 33.5"" in length and just 2"" wide, no crossbow can match the maneuverability of the Pioneer. The ambidextrous top cocking bolt can be easily operated with two fingers and is also used to de-cock the weapon, making it particularly easy to use in tree stands and ideal for archery enthusiasts who can no long draw a bow or pull a cocking rope.The superb shot placement capability of the Pioneer comes from the unique method of propelling the arrow. Arrows are pulled from the front rather than pushed from the rear as with crossbows, resulting in remarkably tighter shot groupings. No Archer's Paradox, canting or other disturbances result in 2"" groups at 50 yards.Every Pioneer ships with a CenterPoint 6x40 mm scope specially designed for it. The adjustable objective provides parallax settings from 5 yards out and the custom MTAG reticle provides aiming points out to 75 yards. A canted Picatinny base provides 20 MOA of additional adjustment.Also included are three Airbow Arrows with nano ceramic Victory ICE coating for increased speed, greater penetration and easier retrieval. Benjamin Airbow arrows are 375 grain (includes 100gr field tip), hand-fletched helical vanes and feature a unique spine alignment for top level performance.The pressure gauge for the air reservoir is located at the front of reservoir. An included adaptor is inserted into the reservoir just behind the gauge, connected to your fill solution (tank or pump) and easily filled. The Pioneer features an integrated pressure regulator that ensures consistent velocities.Features:- Can be cocked with two fingers- Sling mounts included- Picatinny rail mount- CenterPoint scope designed specifically for the PioneerSpecifications:- Action: Bolt- Ammunition: 375 Grain Arrows- Trigger Type: Two Stage- Safety: Lever- Max Velocity: 450 FPS- Power Source: PCP- Scope: 6x40mm- Stock: Ambidextrous- Front Sight: None- Rear Sight: None- Length: 33.5""- Weight: 7 lbs"

The lower is a mil-spec multi caliber CMMG. I've fired about 30 rounds through this thing just to make sure everything works properly and there are no problems.

It requires no modification to your lower receiver. Uses same push pins like the standard AR-15 / M16 upper receiver. Each XMG comes complete with all parts. It is capable of semi-auto-fire-only operation with AR-15 and variant weapons and selective-fire with M16 and variant weapons but may not be used on transferable machine guns (but can be used on a legal post sample m16 lower). It has a cycle rate of 700-1000 rounds per minute. The XMG is fed from MG34/42 50-round metal belts, two or more of which can be joined end to end. Its design is based on the MG-34 and it utilizes some parts from the MG-34. Most important are the bolt head, barrel, feed cover/tray, and muzzle parts. NO TRADES!!!"
