No longer imported to the United States, due to executive orders against importing Russian arms. Imported by EAA Corp. Perfect for a new conversion to what you want it to be.Barrel has a 1:9 twist rate, and IS properly chambered for the 5.56x45mm, although it is marked .223 Remington. As such, it will not cause the overpressure problems (popped primers, overly high chamber pressures, etc.) associated with firing 5.56 in a .223 chamber.Rifle has usual wear marks of a used AK, but none reach into the metal, they are just surface marks. Furniture is somewhat scuffed, but will likely be replaced in a conversion anyway. In short - rifle is fine.I do not have any mags for it, it came with one magazine that was for a different caliber entirely, which I traded away, since it was not useful. As such, I have not tested reliability, but hey - it's a Russian AK. If you would like, I can point you to some sources for Saiga mags when you buy it."

This is a very uncommon Romanian SAR-3 AK-47 in .223/556. Have not been imported in many years. This is NOT a WASR. This is a PRE-WASR (PRE-BAN) gun (original high capacity receiver which has the ability to accept double stack magazines). Romanian built on a Romanian receiver, with a Romanian barrel. After Ban that was not the case.
It is super accurate, low recoil and functions flawlessly. It comes with: (1) Romanian Sling  (1) Cleaning Kit (Butt-plate spring loaded chamber) (1) Cleaning Kit in Mag pouch (4) Romanian 30 round magazines  (1) East German bakelite mag,  (1) Romanian Mag pouch.
Those mags alone are valued around 250$ and not easy to find locally. This gun is in nearly immaculate condition, super clean inside and out. Romanian barrel is chrome lined and super bright and shiny. Also Equipped with NC-Star 3x Tactical Scope and a leapers quick detach scope mount. 1100$ trade value.
