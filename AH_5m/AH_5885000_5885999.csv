This police package comes to us from an estate sale.
The revolver is a Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.
The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. The grips closely resemble custom-made dark walnut Bull's-eye target thumb rest grips. There is some wear in a couple of areas, primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster.
My experience with Model 10-5 revolvers is that they are really fine shooters with nice triggers. I took this one out to the gun range tonight thinking I would shoot the handful of loose .38 caliber I had in a range bag just to make sure it fired okay. That was just a tease, as I ended up shooting that handful and a box of 50 Remington factory ammunition. It is a really good shooting gun with a nice trigger and the custom grips made for a really comfortable hold and lack of felt recoil.
The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets.
The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.
This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Contact me for additional pictures.

Through a sequence referred to as Tag, Track and React (TTR™), the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System allows the shooter to designate the desired location of a shot (""Tag""). The advanced internal ballistic computer immediately generates a firing solution based on a far greater number of inputs and factors that affect the bullet's flight than other ballistic calculators or tables. The shooter then simply adjusts their point of aim to bring the ballistically corrected reticle on target (""Track"") and take the shot (""React"").
