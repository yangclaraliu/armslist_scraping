This gun is immaculate if you went to Buds and bought one, after taxes the gun would cost about $575.  $525 cash, not looking to trade.I live outside of DANVILLE and will meet up with you as long as it's reasonable.  MUST be at least 21 years old AND a Kentucky resident with proof of age and identity.   Thanks for looking!"

Ha!John Wick used the P30, but I am guessing he would love the new refinements of this one and the better concealability (Ok..enough movie references and back to reality..Ha!) This is CA after all...HK factory installed night sightsTHREE 10 round magazines and everything else you see in the box (this one also use the full size P30 magazines)The quality is amazing and I am selling because I just prefer the P320 SC for a few extra rounds in the magazine and Glock 43 for when I need a deep cover option.  From HK: The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.The completely adjustable P30 grip feature--consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels--is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK.  This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.An abbreviated Pictinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted.  All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot.  If you are still reading... great!  Well done... you may just be interested!I will meet a LOCAL buyer at a FFL of your choice within 30 miles from Riverside, CA.  UPDATE:  Thank you all for the many trade offers.  I apologize if I have not responded to everyone.  I should have mentioned ""no trades.""  I can not blame you for asking.  But feel free to send me a cash offer.  And serious offers only.  I am going to attempt to include a link for a good youtube video review if Armslist will allow it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnOUeTYK1rUThank you!"
