HL1-D-TN
Includes 360 Helmet Mount and battery
Designed originally for military and SWAT applications
Yellow-Green Primary LED’s, IR Secondary LED’s, Top IR LED
Yellow-Green with IR Secondary is one of the most sought after combinations for SF Personnel and those needing an IR “flood” light capability that can be helmet mounted.
Also the mount can be rotated 360, so you have light where You need light. Most Surefire helmet lights don’t come with these as they are a special order item that most don’t even know is available.
Not a lot of these in the marketplace, but not a lot of people need the IR “flood” capability. Needless to say they are hard to come by used and expensive to buy new or used, $120-$190
 
The SureFire Helmet Light provides low-signature, night-vision friendly illumination for night navigation and close-quarter work like reading maps, loading gear, or repairing equipment in the field. Featuring virtually indestructible LEDs, the compact, weatherproof Helmet Light produces white, colored, and infrared output at multiple power levels.
 Compact, hands-free, low-output illumination source for navigation and close-quarter work like reading maps and documents, loading gear, or repairing equipment in the field. The lighting scheme on this version of the SureFire helmet light provides yellow-green LEDs for the primary beam, and IR LEDs for the secondary beam. The IFF beacon is delivered by IR LEDs that blink in the appropriate pattern.
 It attaches via a mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any helmet by means of two socket-head machine screws. Once attached, the light can be easily slid onto the mount, where it locks into place. Depressing a small lever enables the operator to slide it off easily and use it without the mount.

Standard Issue USGI NVG Helmet Mount Arm
""Rhino"" Mount Arm
NSN: 5855-01-457-2953
Maker: N-Vision Optics LLC
Material: Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy
 
The Rhino Mount clips into any helmet shroud that has a universal interface such as the standard MICH and PASGT shrouds, the OpsCore VAS Shroud, Wilcox L4 One Hole Shroud, and the Norotos Universal Shroud. The Rhino will accept any night vision device or adapter with a standard bayonet interface. It has an auto shut-off feature that will turn off the night vision device when it is flipped up over the helmet so the lit-up green glow from the eye piece lens does not show down-range. The arm articulates with a “force to overcome” motion meaning the user simply pushes the device upward or down into position.
 
PVS-14 J-Arm, Swing Arm
NSN: 5965-01-444-1216
 Standard issue USGI “J-Arm’s” are used to adapt the PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular to the standard issue USGI Rhino Mount. It screws into the threaded hole in the PVS-14 body housing and lines up two contacts which complete an electrical circuit. This gives the J-Arm the ability to shut down power to the night vision device when the user flips the Rhino Mount up; saving battery power, and limiting visibility of the green glow emitted from the ocular lens of the PVS-14.
 
Both are in Excellent Condition

This is the harder to find and highly popular 4.5"" inch model equipped with a rear sight adjustable for elevation and windage. This pistol was manufactured 3/23/1992 and weighs a well balanced 31.5 ozs.
It comes with 2 magazines, one readily available 10 rounder and one orange follower pre-ban high capacity 12 round magazine it came with which are so rare now they go for up to $100 on eBay. The2206 has a unique magazine release recessed in the front of the grip. There is a safety lever and a slide stop lever on the left side that holds the slide open after the mag empties. There is also a magazine safety so if the magazine is removed a forgotten round in the chamber cannot be fired.An adjustable trigger stop is provided to custom tune the short travel of the crisp release target trigger.  
The 2206 uses a simple blowback principle with only the rear portion of the slide moving. The radically unique difference is the barrel is mounted as low as possible in the frame so the focus of the recoil is as close to the top of the hand as possible. This in conjunction with the added weight of the stainless steel frame greatly reduces muzzle flip and felt recoil making this a favorite for match shooters requiring highly accurate follow up shots.The barrel is retained in the the frame by a slotted, threaded sleeve and is easily removed. Another plus for this design is adapters are available to allow the fitting of a suppressor without losing the use of the factory sights.
This pistol is in perfect shape and comes with a new Wolff spring set to backup the new S&W recoil spring, a spare new firing pin, a new padded case, and a new 100 round box of premium CCI High Velocity 22LR 40 gr. copper plated Mini-Mags.

The 350gr Sierra MatchKing BC is .805 @ 2,200 fps and above .780 between 1,700 and 2,200 fps and .720 @ 1,700 fps and below. Consider this at less than a $1 in 500qty from Sierra or cheaper online. The .375 Holland & Holland Magnum (9.5×72mmB) is a medium-bore rifle cartridge. The .375 H&H was only the second cartridge ever to feature a belt, now common among magnum rounds.The .375 H&H often is cited as one of the most useful all-round rifle cartridges, especially in shooting large and dangerous game.[4] With relatively light bullets in the region of 235 to 270 grains (15 to 17 g), it is a flat-shooting, fairly long-range cartridge ideal for use on light to medium game, whereas with heavy bullets of 300 grains (19 g) and greater, it has the punch necessary for large, thick-skinned dangerous game. In many regions with thick-skinned dangerous game animals.Unlike what is seen in most calibers, many .375 H&H rifles also achieve nearly the same point of impact over a wide range of bullet weights at all commonly used distances, further simplifying a professional hunter's choice in selecting different grain bullets based upon the game hunted by requiring fewer scope or sight adjustments, which further serves to popularize the .375 H&H Magnum among professional hunters.Production historyDesigner Holland & HollandDesigned 1912Produced 1912—presentVariants .375 H&H Ackley Improved, .375 Weatherby MagnumSpecificationsParent case UniqueBullet diameter .375 in (9.5 mm)Neck diameter .404 in (10.3 mm)Shoulder diameter .448 in (11.4 mm)Base diameter .513 in (13.0 mm)Rim diameter .532 in (13.5 mm)Rim thickness .050 in (1.3 mm)Case length 2.850 in (72.4 mm)Overall length 3.6 in (91 mm)Case capacity 95.3 gr H2O (6.18 cm3)Rifling twist 1-12"" (304.8 mm)Primer type large rifle magnumMaximum pressure 62,000 psi (430 MPa)Ballistic performanceBullet weight/type Velocity Energy200 gr (13 g) JFP 3,195 ft/s (974 m/s) 4,534 ft·lbf (6,147 J)235 gr (15 g) SP 2,964 ft/s (903 m/s) 4,585 ft·lbf (6,216 J)250 gr (16 g) SP 2,835 ft/s (864 m/s) 4,463 ft·lbf (6,051 J)270 gr (17 g) FS 2,694 ft/s (821 m/s) 4,352 ft·lbf (5,901 J)300 gr (19 g) SPBT 2,645 ft/s (806 m/s) 4,661 ft·lbf (6,319 J)The 375 H&H Magnum was so well designed and popular that it became the parent cartridge to all those listed below, especially noteworthy are the popular 300 Win Mag, 338 Win Mag, and the 6.5mm and 7mm Rem Mag.

Bore scope the barrel looked to be in good shape for a production barrel, does not appear to have been shot much, nice grooves and lands very typical for what you'd expect out of a newer barrel. Leupold scope is a fixed power--I'm not sure what, my guess is 4-6xI shot two groups with the rifle earlier this weekend to try it out. Got about a 1 3/4 in group at 120 yards as I was dialing it in. Let the barrel cool, changed targets (one with 4 shots), locked down another 3 shots, came in at just under an inch, then I decided to shoot one more and jerked the rifle a bit, throwing my shot low right (lower right hole). Accurate rifle, I was using Remington Core-lokts 150 grain so nothing special.I am fairly mobile and very willing to meet within reason, don't hesitate to ask!"

This rifle has a 16 inch barrel, Timney 517 flat trigger, a Weaver 20 MOA rail, a custom bolt knob from Parker Mountain Machine and Bell and Carlson lightweight tactical stock with the full-length aluminum bedding.

Will include about 30 already loaded rounds and approximately 200 pieces of Lake City brass, all head stamped number 14 that have been shot exclusively through this rifle. The primer pockets have been uniformed and all pieces have been fired two to three times.
