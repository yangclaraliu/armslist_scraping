Let me know what you have, plus or minus cash so we both get a fair deal. MUST have valid CCW or pistol permit and be legal to own a pistol in NE.Also would be interested in trading for a large 4K TV."

The newer Marlins are NOT even close to the quality of this rifle.  I am open to realistic offers.  I will ship ONLY to a Current FFL $45.  CA, Hawaii, Alaska and a few others will have additional costs.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Key Features  Patended HK charging supports make pulling the VP slide rearward effortless Enlarged, heavy-duty extractor for reliability also fuctions as a loaded chamber indicator Low profile right side slide release lever Extended Picatinny rail rated to handle lights, lasers, aimers, and other accessory loads up to 5.6 ounces with no impact on performance Trigger Safety Latch Ergonomic grip profiels with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore  During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns.  Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame  A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines can be tucked in any kid of holster or pocket for deep concealment. Available in .22LR or .25ACP, it is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design. Practical, Safe and Reliable User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. Advanced Materials Keeping an eye on uncompromising quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics ahead of the pack. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize a touch forging process for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock - and frames from solid aluminum forgings. The new stainless-steel version (""Inox"") employs the finest and toughest steels, making it exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable. Two Finishes: Black and Stainless In addition to the traditional black finish, the 21A Bobcat is available in Inox (Stainless Steel) finish. This model has a stainless steel slide and barrel. The alloy frame is grey anodized to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The other metal parts (trigger, hammer, trigger guard, safety, magazine) are black finished. Features  Fixed Low-Profile Sights: This handgun is deal for concealment (even deep concealment). As such, it has no protrusions that may be prone to snag upon holstering and unholstering. The fixed sights are easy to instinctively align on target, while offering a smooth profile that won't catch on your clothing or holster. Tip-Up Barrel: The tip-up barrel design has several advantages. It makes it easy to visually check whether the chamber is loaded and it allows for effortless loading and unloading without racking the slide. Tip-Up Barrel Release Latch: The Bobcat's barrel tips up (that is, it swings upward ivoting near the muzzle, thereby exposing the chamber); this is achieved by simply operating the tip-up barrel release latch on the side of the pistol. Frame Mounted Safety: The safety control on the Bobcat is intuitive and fool-proof. It is mounted on the frame, and features a simple, safe and effective two-position on and off. Contoured Tang: The Bobcat will gently hug the web of your shooting hand, minimizing the chance of ""slide bite."" Thanks to this and other details, the Bobcat will feel ergonomic and efficient in your hands, in spite of its diminutive size. Recessed Magazine Release: The mag-release button on the Bobcat is designed to do two things. First, it postively releases the magazine when you intend to swap it or remove it from the pistol. Second, its recessed design makes it virtually impossible for you to accidentally press it when the pistol is in the holster or while shooting. Single-Stack Magazine: The Single-Stack magazine of the Bobcat contributes to its slimness and low weight-making it easy to carry and conceal.

Steyr is the “other” Austrian gunmaker, maker of fine rifles, shotguns and pistols; this pistol is what the Glock should have been, but as much as I’ve tried, I just don’t care for striker-fired polymer pistols.No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga area."

No trade inquiries please. I'm offering this handgun for cash only, accompanied by a bill of sale. This easily hidden handmade pocket pistol is a Concealed Carry beauty. It's a stainless Seecamp .32 ACP with 3 magazines, two perfectly concealable holsters and the original box. I am the original owner.All Seecamp pistols are double action only (DAO), and are similar in size. Barrel length is 2.06 inches and weight is 11.5 ounces. Grips are glass-filled nylon and checkered. These pistols are not equipped with sights because they are intended for use at close range. The Seecamp utilizes a very compact and reliable DAO trigger mechanism. Each pull of the trigger first cocks then releases the hammer. The hammer follows the slide after each shot and rests in the down position.Seecamp's LWS-32 was designed around the only hollow point .32 ACP ammunition available at the time, Winchester Silvertips. Ammunition with an overall length exceeding 0.910"" (23.1mm) may not feed or chamber correctly. Operation is through chamber-ring delayed blowback where a raised ring at the rear of the chamber retards the rearward motion of the slide. This model uses a magazine with a capacity of 6 rounds. The LWS-32 remains Seecamp's most popular firearm. During the height of demand, production guns were selling out years in advance with individual guns selling for up to $1000."
