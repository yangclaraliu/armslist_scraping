We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————VX-1 Rimfire 2-7x28mm Fine Duplex  Gloss Fine Duplex Reticle   Thinner posts and crosshairs allow for less target coverage, making precision shots on small targets easy.   Leupold Rimfire riflescopes are built and tested to the same high standards as all Golden Ring riflescopes. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio 1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).   Tactile Leupold Selector Proprietary Nitrogen Fill Process One inch Maintube 6061-T6 Aircraft Quality Aluminum Durable Lens Cover   Keep the lenses of your Leupold riflescope looking like new.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————      FX-II 6x36mm Wide Duplex  Matte Wide Duplex Reticle   Leupold designed the Wide Duplex reticle with a larger center gate for lightning-fast target acquisition, even on a moving target.   The FX Series of riflescopes is made for those hunters and shooters who appreciate the ruggedness, accuracy, bright sight picture, large exit pupil, and of course, the purity of a fixed Leupold riflescope. There's an FX riflescope suited to nearly every shooting sport, and nearly every firearm, from rifles, to shotguns, to handguns. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Super Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Micro-Friction 1/4 MOA Finger Click   Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).

This reticle also preserves the instinctive fire capabilities of the Leupold Circle Dot reticle in short range, low magnification engagements typical of 3-gun competition and Close Quarter Battle in the 21st century. This unique blend of capabilities allows the various optics platforms equipped with this reticle to perform equally well in open desert, heavy cover, or the urban environment. The CM-R2 reticle is comprised of a 0.5 MOA dot surrounded by a 5.0 MOA circle for a perfect combination of precision and speed. The harsh marks on the horizontal stadia can be used for leading targets moving at 5, 10 and 15 mph respectively. The tic marks on the vertical stadia serve a dual purpose, allowing the user to quickly estimate the distance to 18"" targets while serving as precise holdover points for targets between 300 and 900 meters. For best results, the CM-R2 reticle should be zeroed at 200 meters using M855 5.56mm NATO/.223 Remington ammunition producing a muzzle velocity of 2810 fps with 62 grain FMJ bullets. Once zeroed at 200 meters, the center point of the reticle also serves as a 50 meter aiming point.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 8.5-25x50mm (30mm) M1 Mil Dot  Matte Mil DotReticle   Mil Dot reticle was designed to help the US Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches. Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.   Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes are built to a higher standard. In fact, Leupold build them like our lives depend on them, because Leupold know yours will. Incredible accuracy. Impeccable optical quality. Outstanding ruggedness and absolute waterproof integrity. Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes excel in even the worst conditions, including the rigors of competition and hunting. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   GenerousEyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 3.5-10x40mm (30mm) M2 Illuminated Tactical Milling  Dark Earth Illuminated Tactical MillingReticle   The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference point. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable Leupold riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you're at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   GenerousEyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 8.5-25x50mm (30mm) M1 Illuminated Mil Dot  Matte Illuminated Mil Dot   Illuminated Mil Dot reticle was designed to help the US Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches. Range estimating with the Illuminated Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Illuminated Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Illuminated Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.   Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes are built to a higher standard. In fact, Leupold build them like our lives depend on them, because Leupold know yours will. Incredible accuracy. Impeccable optical quality. Outstanding ruggedness and absolute waterproof integrity. Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes excel in even the worst conditions, including the rigors of competition and hunting. Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable Leupold riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you're at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

It also features several methods of accurate range estimation, using the height or width of the target as a guide. To use the system, simply determine the range of target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target. For targets that are inside 300 yards, simply use the center aiming dot to engage.   Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes are built to a higher standard.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 6 3-18x44mm (34mm) M5C2 Riflescope - TMR (Illuminated), Matte The Mark 6® 3-18x44mm sets a new standard for high performance in a small, lightweight package. With a length of just 12 inches and weighing in at 23.6 ounces, this optic sets a new standard for riflescope performance.In addition, the Mark 6 series offers state-of-the-art features that are common throughout Leupold’s Tactical product line. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic. Xtended Twilight Lens System Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System®, using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2 Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2™, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   6:1 Zoom Ratio A powerful 6:1 zoom ratio delivers crystal clear images from edge-to-edge throughout the entire magnification range. Many higher power scopes provide the best picture at each end of the zoom ratio, leaving the middle ranges weaker on clarity and resolution. The Leupold 6X erector system was engineered from the outset to provide consistently exceptional image quality across the entire visual field throughtout the entire zoom range. Twin Bias Spring Erector System features berylium/copper alloy leaf springs and 30% more holding force to withstand the most intense recoil and abuse.   Blackened Lens Edges Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical perrformance. Dual Use Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications. 34mm Maintube 2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece Side Focus M5C2 Elevation Adjustment Dial The low-profile M5C2 ZeroLock™ elevation dial automatically locks at the zero position and provides 20 Mils of elevation travel in two revolutions of the dial.

352,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5757352,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T 6.5-20x50mm,"Coral Springs, Broward, South Florida","$ 1,195","Listed On: Friday, September 2, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Price Match! We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.———————— Mark 4 LR/T 6.5-20x50mm (30mm) M1 Illuminated Tactical Milling  Matte Illuminated Tactical MillingReticle   The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference point. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable Leupold riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you're at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   GenerousEyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

Message us or visit our website at www.ArmoryX.com———————— Mark 4 LR/T 4.5-14x50mm (30mm) M1 Mil Dot  Matte Mil Dot   Mil Dot reticle was designed to help the US Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches. Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.   Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable Leupold riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you're at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting.

Message us or visit our website at www.ArmoryX.com———————— Mark 4 ER/T 4.5-14x50mm (30mm) M3 Front Focal Tactical Milling   Description:  Matte Tactical MillingReticle   The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference point. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Long range accuracy and the constant subtension of a front focal plane reticle make the Mark 4 ER/T uniquely qualified for engaging targets at all ranges and in the most critical of situations. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   GenerousEyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

We will meet or beat any reasonably advertised price!* Contact Us with any questions or price match inquiries.————————Don’t see what you’re looking for? Message us or visit our website at www.ArmoryX.com———————— Mark 4 LR/T 3.5-10x40mm (30mm) M1 Mil Dot  Matte Mil Dot Reticle   Mil Dot reticle was designed to help the US Marine Corps estimate distances. It's now standard for all military branches. Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.   Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are arguably some of the most dependable, highest performing riflescopes you'llama find anywhere. Their accuracy is proven in the field. Their rugged and absolute waterproof integrity is unquestionable. They are everything a tactical shooter, long-range shooter, target shooter, or hunter could ask for. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

Message us or visit our website at www.ArmoryX.com———————— Mark 4 LR/T 8.5-25x50mm (30mm) M5 Illuminated Tactical Milling    Matte Illuminated Tactical Milling Reticle   The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference point. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes are built to a higher standard. In fact, Leupold build them like our lives depend on them, because Leupold know yours will. Incredible accuracy. Impeccable optical quality. Outstanding ruggedness and absolute waterproof integrity. Leupold Mark 4 riflescopes excel in even the worst conditions, including the rigors of competition and hunting. Multicoat 4   Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

Message us or visit our website at www.ArmoryX.com————————      Mark 6 1-6x20mm (34mm) M6C1 The all-new Mark 6 1-6x20mm scope was engineered based on the years of elite riflescope making expertise in order to deliver relevant performance features to competition shooters and tactical operators in mid-range to CQB scenarios. Built around a rugged, ultra-bright daylight visible illumination system, the Mark 6 1-6x20mm offers a true both eyes open situational awareness at 1x, while also offering the ability to identify and engage targets out to several hundred meters at high magnification. Several notable mechanical/optical advances include the new low-profile, mil-based ZeroLock™ windage and tactical features that are common throughout Leupold’s Tactical product line. Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic. Leupold Tactical Optics; we listened. And delivered. elevation dials to prevent unintentional adjustment in the field and caliber-specific front focal plane reticles.  Matte TMR-D (Illumianted) Reticle  The Tactical Milling Reticle expands on existing Mil Dot reticles by using various sized and spaced hash marks on the vertical and horizontal stadia for increased ranging precision, accuracy, and quick one-meter range estimating reference points. All Mil Dot calculations are TMR compatible. To use the system, simply determine the range to the target using the mil system, then use the corresponding aiming point that is matched to your cartridge to engage the target.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold’s index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   Front Focal Plane (FFP)  The reticle magnifies along with the image, so you can estimate range at all magnification settings. These reticles are ideal in tactical situations, yet also provide greater accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters.

Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   Generous Eyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.

Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.   Xtended Twilight Lens System   Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System, using Leupold's index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won't be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When Leupold combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.   DiamondCoat 2   Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we've ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set ourselves.   GenerousEyebox   The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.   Blackened Lens Edges   Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.   Twin Bias Spring Erector System Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece 3:1 Zoom Ratio Dual Use   Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4 Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.

Quantum Optical System   Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.   2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing   While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend.

Like new. Usable in any normal press... $30This old rifle is in very good condition. The rifling is deep , sharp and defined. Bore is shiny still. Obviously never shot much.Shoots well. I have put a few magazines through it over the last two years , maybe 60-70 rounds ...Light weight , easy handling. Would make an excellent Zone 1 or 2 woods rifle.If I parted it out on Ebay I could easily get $700-750 just for the rifle parted out.  No. 5 parts lots are crazy in last minute bidding. I saw a 1/3 complete part out go from $87 to over $350 in the last 5 minutes. And that was only 1/3 of the pieces needed to build a whole one !... But I cannot bring myself to tear this thing apart and sell it piecemeal. It is just too fun to shoot...Plus , the No.5 is a rare piece of WWII-era  history...  Only around 260,000 of these rifles , total ,were actually produced by BSA-Shirley and the Fazakarley factory from 9/44 (when actual production of the finalized design began) until early 1948...There were about 1500 trial rifles made in 3/44 and 4/44 respectively by Fazakarley. $600 cash. Firm. Correct barrel band has been added. Price has been adjusted accordingly.This is a very good price for such a comprehensive package. With everything itemized at current selling (not listing) prices ,there are over $400 in extras included with this rife.Mainly interested in trades listed below...Thank you..."
