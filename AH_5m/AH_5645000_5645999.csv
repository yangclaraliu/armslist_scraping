The rails are like new and give you more than enough rail space for any accessories you could think of in almost any configuration.The MD Arms MD-20 magazines hold 20 rounds of 2.75"" 12ga, and have been tested to cycle and lock into the receiver flawlessly.  No fitting was required on these, they worked without incident straight out of the box.  Both a replacement clear and black cover are included with each of these, the smoked clear cover is installed on them at the moment.  They also each come with the original owner's manual.The MD Arms V-Plug is the most recent addition, and arguably the most important for the running of the firearm.  This device when properly installed and set up allows you to properly adjust the gas system to make the shotgun far more reliable than many of the factory 2 position gas plugs allowed.  It also allows the gas to be adjusted by hand without requiring a tool to depress the locking detent, making on the fly adjustment a reality rather than a pipe dream.  The original manual explaining the proper setup and adjustment is included along with the original gas plug.  It's not a difficult process, and the plug in this gun's gas tube just happens to line up for a very easy install if it is ever removed for cleaning.So overall, the good for this gun?  It's stupidly reliable.  Any failures to run the gun I've had were from accidentally closing the gas system too much, or using an inferior made magazine that didn't maintain the proper feed angle or have enough spring tension to push the next rounds up fast enough.  That's operator error and third party accessory error right there, not related to the shotgun itself.  It has always been meticulously cleaned after every range trip, and the action is silky smooth.  Run proper magazines through it and take it out to the range to get the gas setting dialed in for the ammunition you'll be using and this thing will run beautifully.  Even if you aren't obsessive about cleaning it, it'll probably keep on chugging.  It IS an AK at heart, after all.  I have not had a single part installed in this gun ever break on me or give me any problems.The bad for this gun?  It ain't pretty.  Well, to be honestly accurate, it's pretty ugly.   This was not sent off to Tromix or another company for a conversion.  This was done with the conversion parts and a reciever that happened to already have the proper cuts required to make the conversion doable in a garage.  This is not to say that the conversion is shaky or unreliable.  It just doesn't look like it came from the factory.  All parts are solid, but the job itself technically counts as aesthetically unfinished.  For example, binder posts are currently covering the holes left over from the trigger relocation as I did not have access to a welder to permanently close these, and the metal around the new trigger location is still bare.  I was going to cerakote or paint this, but I figured if someone was picking it up and wanted to do their own paint/finish job on it, there was no sense in doing that.  These are both cosmetic issues and do not affect the gun's function in any way shape or form.As fun and reliable as this thing is, it's time I move on.  I'm only selling it because I'm moving to a VEPR-12 or a KSG, not because the gun is flawed in any way.  I built this way back when they were first imported from Izhmash.  The VEPR wasn't even close to being imported back then, so converting a Saiga-12 to AK layout was the only path available.  It is still a reliable workhorse and does great for pretty much any purpose.   It would be right at home used for self/home/property defense, makes a VERY fun range toy, and is even surprisingly effective at chewing through clays.  I really hate to see this thing go, but it's time I move up.$900 takes it, other offers will be considered.  I can meet anywhere in or East of Dallas.  East and North of downtown is greatly preferred, but I can make exceptions if needed."

This pistol has been recently refinished and customized and looks and functions AMAZING. Ordnance was originally a Canadian company before being purchased by Remington when it became known as Para Ord then Para USA. It has many upgrades, changes, and overall configurations to improve its function. The slide and frame has been contoured, and the slide has porting and lighting grooves. It has two barrels both with improved ramps and a tight lock up, one ported and one match grade unported. The ported barrel is the original stainless that has been improved, the match grade is a fitted and improved stainless Para USA barrel. It comes with 3 recoil systems to give better ammunition options (from light match loads to heavy game stoppers) depending on the pistols use. All parts have been changed to WC, LB, VZ, cylinder and slide, Fusion and others all consisting of high quality steel, stainless and titanium that have been hand fit... No MIM, tin, or recycled soda can parts. It can be ran in a 80 or 70 safety reliably with the part provided. Trijicon sights have recently been installed. Both barrels have been crowned flush to bushings to protect the crown. The slide, frame, and controls have been refinished in Cerakote and KG depending on use and placement as each finish wears well in different areas. Also includes many Canadian made original Para Ordnance 14 round magazines that have been refinished with Cerakote and resprung, many new unused 14 round Para USA and Mecgar (same maker) magazines, and 2 used 14 round Para USA magazines... there are at least 15 mostly new magazines . There are many aspects that will be covered in person or via phone conversation, as there are so many alterations and aftermarket parts. Machining, matching, and refinishing past $2000 on the pistol just last year, this doesn't include the cost of the premium added parts. I'm wishing to part with this pistol as I don't use it and would like to reduce the amount of pistols I seem to only store but never use. The base pistol itself has never seen heavy use, the total rounds fired from the pistol since it was new is less than 2000, mostly 185gr & 230gr range loaded FMJ. The slide to frame contact is still very tight, and that has not been altered during the updating.*Machining work done was front serrations added, contouring to all aggressive angles on slide, lightning/porting on slide, lug matching, trigger guard relief, magwell, honing and deburing of frame, frame contouring. Widening and angling of ejection port (even more than 1991 improved port or other modern 1911s) for reliable ejection, milling of each barrel bushing for a custom fit for each barrel. The overall external contouring gives the pistol a smooth modern look and feel and the internal work gives it the reliability and accuracy found in hand crafted 1911s. *Most internal parts have been replaced with top of the line 1911 parts from a variety of well known manifactures. Wilson Combat, Les Baer, Ed Brown and other names I can't recall. All factory plastic, polymer, and early MIM parts have been removed which does make the pistol heavier but it shoots like a dream.*While the pistol has been upgraded and modified all original factory parts have been kept, including the original 1990s case and manual.*The pistol has had little use since it's refit and refinish, you will be very impressed once you see it, once your fire it you'll find it will run circles around any Para USA (and many other 1911 makers) put out.  It also includes all original parts, manual and hard case. I am the original owner. I will send needed photos to serious buyers or traders. The photo shown is with ported barrel.*Local person to person transactions only for many reasons.  I will not ship. All transactions must be 100% legal. Please dont simply ask for me to send pictures unless able to make a honest offer."

I am FIRM on the price, and any lower offers will be ignored.
You must have FOID, wait 72 hours, meet in person, and sign the transfer paperwork.
 
This is for those that feel the need to haggle over price even after I say it’s firm:
Yes, I know you can get one in blued finish brand new with a single magazine for $250 online… which is closer to $300+ after you pay for shipping and FFL transfer.  This, however, is a full nickel finish model that sells for $350 out the door.  I’m also including the optional wrap-around grips which are $40 directly from Bersa, as well as two additional ORIGINAL Bersa magazines that sell for $37 a piece, and two 10-round Pro-Mag magazines that sell for $22 each on eBay.  That’s over $150 in extras.  While everything is in mint condition, I do realize it’s not new, and therefore I’m not asking $500, but at $300 it’s more than fair, and any lower offer will be ignored.
