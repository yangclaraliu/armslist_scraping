It is built off an imported 2009 Russian Saiga IZ132 Sporter Rifle in 7.62x39.  Imported by the RWC Group, it was sold to Century Arms, who performed a back-end conversion on the sporter rifle, and gave it an item number of RI1808E-N.  The conversion turns it from a sporter configuration, into its current original AKM configuration by moving the fire control group further back in the receiver, installing an AKM pistol grip and buttstock, as well as installing a bullet guide to allow feed of the double stack AKM magazines.  Century also needs to completely refinish the receiver due to the moving of the fire control group, and subsequent moving of retaining pins/holes.  The conversion process is difficult for most to do at home, and is expensive to have professionally done - so this particular rifle gets you an authentic Russian AKM without all the fuss!Specifications:
-Does NOT have the hated Russian “Chamber Step” for marking cartridges!

The new company invested what funds they could in the purchase of WWI and WWII Mausers. They bought a larger number of Swedish model 96 Mausers which they sporterized as Kimber 96's . These guns were stocked in inexpensive synthetic stocks, and sold at reasonable prices in order to raise funds for the company's tooling up to build the 1911 Colt pistol design, under the Kimber name. Along with the Swedish model 96's a smaller number of WWII VZ24 Mauser 98's in surplus condition were purchased, and re-barreled as sporterized guns with synthetic stocks. The 98's were cobbled up as 7mm Rem &338 Winchester magnums and shipped, in large part, to Alaska for sale there as economical hunting pieces. This beautiful .338 Win Mag is just to hard for me to handle. It's sighted in and is a tack driver. It also comes with 4 boxes of ammo (not shown).

Yes, these are like gold as you know if you are looking, yes they are priced at current market value which is high at $100 per brick of 1,000, but I have a few bricks for precision shooters willing to pay like myself, please don't complain I paid too much as well but would've paid even more. I have a few extra bricks if interested. If you've been checking cabelas, sportsmans, bass pro, Walmart, anywhere for the last year and a half almost every day like many of us, then 100 is a drop in the bucket just to get some. Price firm for now, Not in a hurry to sell as prices still climbing and I may change price with market, however I don't expect these to last long.  The only guy selling these on gunbroker is doing so illegally (you can't mail primers only loaded ammo) and prices are higher than this with shipping anyway. I may accept your trade offer but needs to be more appealing than 100 cash and something I want. Guns ammo, glass, knives and related items only unless it's just a screaming deal on a non related item, you never know. Face to face only, I'm in Cheyenne but I'll meet as far south as Fort Collins, west to Laramie, north to Wheatland and east to Scotsbluff for an extra ten bucks gas money unless I'm already heading that direction."
