At one point, it was stippled on the front of the grip, but that has been removed and now there is a rubber wrap around style grip for a nice feel covering that area.This gun is priced to move.  There is nothing wrong with it, I am just tired of the color. Could I take it down again, refinish, and put back together? Yes. But I have lost excitement in tinkering with it any longer. This gun is very highly upgraded, the only reason it is priced so low is because the frame mods dont suit everyone and I know that.  My boredom is your gain.  I am accepting trade offers as well."

This is my like new Sig Sauer P220 Scorpion Elite in .45 ACP. Purchased brand new by myself less than a year ago, and has only seen 200 rounds of Speer Gold Dot to test for function. This thing is an absolute tack driver, and is very mild on recoil. Only carried a handful of times and Cerakote shows no signs of wear. If I didn't tell you, you wouldn't know this gun has seen the light of day outside the factory. Also included with the firearm is original box and paperwork, 3 magazines (2 8 round, 1 10 round), a DeSantis Speed Scabbard leather holster, a Leatherneck Tactical Kydex holster, a Blackhawk Close Quarters Concealment paddle holster, a Safariland model 079 leather dual mag carrier, a Safariland model 123 p-leather single mag carrier and a Hoppes Bore Snake. All said, I have just under $1,300 spent, as well as 1,350 rounds of mixed Speer Gold Dot (350 rounds) and Winchester Service Grade ammo (1,000 rounds) I'd be willing to part ways with for the right trade or price. Ammo has been stored in a dry, dark area in steel ammo cans with desiccants, and is in original packaging. If selling or trading for a different caliber, I'd rather include the ammo as well as this is the only .45 I have in my collection. Contact me if you wish to outright purchase firearm and all ammo and we can work on a price."

I was informed by the msp ""firearm expert"" that because it measures less than 26 in aol in its shortest fireable state, stock folded, it had to be registered as a pistol so it is registered as such. See below. This was aug 11 2015
 
If the folding stock rifle meets the definition of a ""pistol"", it must be registered in Michigan.  ""Pistol"" means a loaded or unloaded firearm that is 26 inches or less in length, or a loaded or unloaded firearm that by its construction and appearance conceals it as a firearm.Sincerely,Karen JohnsonFirearms Records Unit ManagerCriminal Justice Information CenterMichigan State PoliceP.O.

The base rifle is the 700 Tactical series with a 20"" heavy barrel and topped off with a custom ParaBellum 4 port muzzle break that effectively reduces almost all felt recoil. To help lighten the gun, it is sitting in the Magpul Hunter 700 Chassis and the bottom metal is the Magpul Hunter detactable magazine bottom plate. Included is one magpul magazine and one AICS 10rnd metal magazine. To top everything off you will be able to mount any type of Optic to this with the weaver picatinny rail that is mounted to the top. This gun shoots flawlessly and I'm pricing it to sell fast. No trades and I'm open to best offers.Thank you"
