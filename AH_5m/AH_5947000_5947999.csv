The problem with 5.56 pistols is with such a short barrel you lose velocity and knock down power. With the 7.62x39 round, not only is ammo cheap and plentiful but you hardly loose power with the shorter barrel due to increased mass of the bullet 123grain vs. 62grain. Why do you think 300 black out is so popular now? At a dollar a round for 300 black out, you should skip out and go for the AK round.This veteran is going back to college!

This is the enhanced performance round (ERP). The steel penetrator tip is a different tip from green tips. Also the load is hotter. The m855a1 also uses a stab crimp on the primer rather than the common circumferential crimp, which holds better under the higher pressures. I think Lake City is the only munitions plant that makes m855a1 rounds, but I might be wrong, either way, the rounds I am selling have the “LC” Lake City head stamp. Check out the videos on The Wound Channel on YouTube if you are not familiar with these rounds. Pricing is difficult on these rounds. On gunbroker.com the starting bid is $8/round. I see past prices here on armslist being from $7.50/round to $5.00/round. If I were on the buying end, I would be thinking that these are too high, especially the pricing upwards of $7. I guess I will ask for $4.00 a round, which is still pretty expensive in my mind. However, these are not easy to come by and others are asking for double what I am wanting to get out of these. I am also open to offers. Feel free to text at (509) Nine 9 Eight - 9 three 9 five or just email through the armslist service. I have a few other things I am selling as well in order to pay for some home improvements. I have a plate carrier with ceramic plates, a Mosin Nagant in monte carlo stock, and an AR-10 up for sale.UPDATE: Plate carrier with plates sold. I sold 25 rounds of the m855a1, have 75 left."

THIS IS NOT A COLT, but there's no option for FI and it was destined to be the Colt Pony. The internet says the CPA prefix for the serial numbers stood for ""Colt Pony Auto"" due to a pending deal for F.I. to make these to be sold as Colts.  Apparently the frame was to be made by Colt, the remainder of the parts supplied by Star and the pistol marketed by Colt as the ""Pony"".  That deal never happened (Colt was pretty chaotic during that time period) and FI made these for a few years.  Later Colt made the .380 Mustang. It's 6"" total length, adjustable rear sight, and one original 6-round magazine. It's a single action semi-auto, like a little 1911 with the swinging link. It doesn't appear to have much wear on it.  Bore is excellent.  No Import Marks.  Nice well made, interesting pistol."

Their looks however leave something tonbe desired.The SR9 is wearingna less than perfect DIY duracoat job.  The mag button is sticky, and the mags do not drop free.  This is a common and easy fix (source:  internet).  Te magazine disconnect safety has been removed as has the loaded chamber indicator.  These parts are included along with 2 extra trigger return springs and 2 17 round mags and the holster pictured.  The trigger and ergomonics of this gun are great.  Perhaps it is right for you.  The price is 200 bucks.The HS2000 is a neat and great gun.  The finish on the slide has taken a hit.  It was not done on purpose butnhas a very worn look (which some may like).  It has a terrific trigger and comes with 3 16 mags.  One of which may be missing a floor plate.  It may be a great option for you.  The price is 200 bucks.I will be completely honest with these pistols.  I know you have to ask, so here goes:  yes, they work.  Yes, i know they have cosmetic flaws.  No, i will not sweeten the pot or take less (even if you buy both).  The price includes you picking it/them up around Haywood mall.These would be great for someone with not alot of cash (although do not be shady), someone who needs a truck gun, first pistol etc."

This is a brand new Noveske 12 1/2 inch pistol. If you are looking at this, im sure you know the absolute quality of this piece. As you can see, it has the Sig brace pistol stock with it and the VLTOR rail system with a free floated barrel. The barrel is (in Noveske's words) double chrome lined. It is bead blasted on the exterior. This also has a ""flaming Pig"" flash suppressor on the barrel. I bought it brand new but without a bolt carrier group. After much research, I added a Spikes Tactical Bolt carrier group as it seemed to get better ratings than anything else I saw. It also came with the KNS anti-walk trigger/hammer pins. (which keep the pins from sliding out when shooting the gun) It came with a really smooth Timney 3 1/2 to 4 pound trigger group installed.SO, this is a top notch AR platform pistol, brand new and unshot. I have never seen fit and finish quality on an AR like this one. The sight is an Aimpoint C-3 red dot and the trippler is a Primary Arms with a Burris mount. It is a great system. The trippler swings to the side for up close and personal shooting and you can take mid-range shots much better when you swing the trippler back up. Also comes with one Magpul windowed 30 round mag and All Weather Tactical hard shell case. I'm selling ALL of this for 2400.00 (which is, if you have checked Noveske) is an awesome deal. If you prefer, I would sell just the firearm without the case and Aimoint for 2000.00 even. Also, if you have an offer I will listen, maybe partial trade or whatever...just keep it within reason. This is a really nice AR pistol, as im sure you know.THE ONLY reason I am looking to sell it is that it has just sat in my safe since i've had it and I dont see myself shooting it anytime soon.  Message me if you have questions. Must be a legal Tennessee resident and have drivers license. thanks for looking."

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, but I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf East or North of Dallas, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Here is a BRAND-NEW, NEVER MOUNTED Magpul furniture set for the Remington 870. But this set has had Urban Digital Camo Hydrographics applied. The Magpul stock and forend are awesome, and when paired with the one-of-a-kind look of Urban Camo, your 870 will be the best-dressed shotgun on the block. I paid $100 to have the stock and forend dipped, so you're looking at $240 to have a comparable setup done. I'm asking only $225 for this gorgeous set of 870 furniture. Cash only. No checks, money orders, or other scams.Thanks,Brad"

The M1 rifle is a .30 caliber, gas-operated, 8 shot clip-fed, semi-automatic rifle.[26] It is 43.6 inches (1,107 mm) long and it weighs about 9.5 pounds (4.31 kg).[27]The M1's safety catch is located at the front of the trigger guard. It is engaged when it is pressed rearward into the trigger guard, and disengaged when it is pushed forward and is protruding outside of the trigger guard.[28]The M1 Garand was designed for simple assembly and disassembly to facilitate field maintenance. It can be field stripped (broken down) without tools in just a few seconds.[29]The rifle had an iron sight line consisting of rear receiver aperture sight protected by sturdy ""ears"" calibrated for 100–1,200 yd (91–1,097 m) in 100 yd (91 m) increments. The bullet drop compensation was set by turning the range knob to the appropriate range setting. The bullet drop compensation/range knob can be fine adjusted by setting the rear sight elevation pinion. The elevation pinion can be fine adjusted in approximately 1 MOA increments. The aperture sight was also able to correct for wind drift operated by turning a windage knob that moved the sight in approximately 1 MOA increments. The windage lines on the receiver to indicate the windage setting were 4 MOA apart. The front sighting element consisted of a wing guards protected front post.During World War II the M1 rifle's semiautomatic operation gave United States infantrymen a significant advantage in firepower and shot-to-shot recovery time over enemy infantrymen armed primarily with bolt-action rifles. The semi-automatic operation and reduced recoil allowed soldiers to fire 8 rounds as quickly as they could pull the trigger, without having to move their hands on the rifle and therefore disrupt their firing position and point of aim.[30] The Garand's fire rate, in the hands of a trained soldier, averaged 40–50 accurate shots per minute at a range of 300 yards (270 m). ""At ranges over 500 yards (460 m), a battlefield target is hard for the average rifleman to hit. Therefore, 500 yards (460 m) is considered the maximum effective range, even though the rifle is accurate at much greater ranges."""
