This means we will be able to build you your dream rifle and assist in the upkeep of your new rifle. All of our precision rifles will start with a Surgeon, Stillers, Defiance Machine, or Bat Machine as the heart. To ensure the most accurate rifle systems, the custom action of choice is paired with the finest barrels, triggers, and stocks or chassis available. We coat the rifle and all necessary components with baked on, ceramic coatings known as Cerakote and DuraCoat. Color and other options will determine the coating that is used.After the parts are coated, they are then bedded to a stock or mated with the chassis of the customers choice. Once installation is complete, the stock is finished and the rifle is assembled. Once the rifle is assembled, it is run through a course of tests developed by the action manufacturer to ensure that everything is functioning properly and that the rifle delivers the expected accuracy. Once complete, test rounds will be fired and a custom load developed for your rifle. Forty rounds of hand loaded ammunition will be included with each rifle. The above rifles are guaranteed to be sub MOA using high quality factory match or custom, hand loaded ammunition.For the shooter that is not as serious or a little more budget minded, rifles based on the Remington 700 or Savage PTA actions will be available. These rifles will still have the same care, quality parts, and sub MOA guarantee as the precision rifles above.https://facebook.com/CarolinaCustomPrecisionRifles"

I bought these a few years ago, was hoping to restore the S&W but I just don't have any time. I really don't want to take them apart and sell on eBay if anyone can take them on as their project.
The Remington has a good cylinder and the trigger parts and spring are pretty good. The grips are very good. Bore is rusty, might be able to be used, but I'd say it's for parts only.
The Smith is chambered in 38 S&W I think. It's complete, double action, but does not index and the double action does not work every trigger pull. Someone was in it years ago and buggered the main cover screw. Bore shows rifling but worn (tried my best with pics on that), ejector works properly and quickly. Grips are complete but severely worn. I think it could be restored with some love, but is a very good parts gun.
I'm asking $125.  I am willing to ship. I'll answer what questions I can and I'll provide more pics as requested. Thanks for looking."

This rifle has not been shot or used. The weapon includes a Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20X tactical scope with locking elevation adjustment and the front-focal TMR (tactical milling reticle), which is secured to the weapon via three Leupold Mark 4 steel rings in a ""Euro"" configuration; this scope's reticle changes size based on magnification, allowing its graduations to be utilized as a metric range-finder; the scope also includes a detachable sunshade with its own flip-open cover. Also fitted with a Karl Nill AR-15 palm-shelf walnut grip with Rhomlas checkering - this is the same style of grip as the HK PSG-1 and made by the same manufacturer of the PSG-1 grip, and is pretty much the best grip that can be fitted to a sniper rifle - its base is also adjustable via screws on its sides; also included is the factory plastic grip and a green Hogue rubber grip. I had also experimented with some sling options and found that the Vicker's M240G sling, modified with 1.25"" HK-style snap hooks, is the best sling option for this rifle, especially when paired with the included ultra-rare matching Eagle Industries padded scope cover, which actually makes this weapon comfortable to carry without jabbing you in the back; I also include the Eagle Industries muzzle cover in case you want to use this system on a smaller rifle (the muzzle cover won't fit over the M95 brake). In addition to the above accessories, the rifle includes a total of five factory 5-round magazines, a factory monopod, and of course the standard Pelican case, cleaning kit, and manuals; I also made a ballistics chart and placed it in a luggage tag that can be tied to the scope or its mounts if desired."

If you can find them cheaper on other sites then please do not bother me! I'm sorry for the negative ad but I've had to deal with some ridiculous people of late that definitely shouldn't even be able to own a gun. If you sell on here then you know exactly what I'm talking about. That being said these are 2 Colt preban rifles and one is in the original blue label box. They are in near mint excellent condition. You'll never find nicer and more collectable AR15's than what I am offering. I have around 10 or so extremely hard to find Colt rifles that I will be selling so if you are a collector then you may really want to pay attention. I've never let anyone pull the bolt back on any of my rifles. Most look like the dust cover have never even been down. That's no exaggeration whatsoever. I have 9mm, flat sides (which are extremely rare) and preban rifles that are in fantastic condition. If you want to text me then my number is 256-997-six2nine9. Thanks."
