Will shoot .22 lr, .22 long, .22 short, and .22 powderless.  It is like having 4 revolvers in one. No worries about failure to feed because it is a revolver.  Reply to this ad or contact me through my mewe.com group Washington Hunting Trader.  https://mewe.com/group/57aeaf27c859f40850baaff5"

Molded from a P220 pistol but will fit a P226 / P227 / P220. The holster is new, hand cut, hand stitched. The leather is 8-9oz vegetable tanned quality leather. I've made the holster with a sweat shield to keep the slide away from your skin and help in re-holstering. The leather has been hand dyed Saddle Tan and has been sealed with an acrylic coating to prevent sweat from penetrating through the holster and damaging your gun. The leather is thick and durable and should last a lifetime. The stitching is all done by hand using durable waxed linen thread. This particular holster rides high and very tight to the body. It has no outward slop like other cheap thin holsters that are mass produced. Keep in mind you should be wearing a quality belt to conceal properly. The belt slots easily allow 1 1/2"" wide belts that are 1/4"" thick. This holster was made with an ""FBI""15-20 degree cant that's perfect for the 3:00 - 5:00 position. The gun ""clicks"" in to the molding perfectly and will not fall out. Thank you for looking at my ad and supporting my leather work. Please email or text with any questions.CG - REDACTED"
