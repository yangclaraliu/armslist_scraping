This rifle has not been shot or used. The weapon includes a Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20X tactical scope with locking elevation adjustment and the front-focal TMR (tactical milling reticle), which is secured to the weapon via three Leupold Mark 4 steel rings in a ""Euro"" configuration; this scope's reticle changes size based on magnification, allowing its graduations to be utilized as a metric range-finder; the scope also includes a detachable sunshade with its own flip-open cover. Also fitted with a Karl Nill AR-15 palm-shelf walnut grip with Rhomlas checkering - this is the same style of grip as the HK PSG-1 and made by the same manufacturer of the PSG-1 grip, and is pretty much the best grip that can be fitted to a sniper rifle - its base is also adjustable via screws on its sides; also included is the factory plastic grip and a green Hogue rubber grip. I had also experimented with some sling options and found that the Vicker's M240G sling, modified with 1.25"" HK-style snap hooks, is the best sling option for this rifle, especially when paired with the included ultra-rare matching Eagle Industries padded scope cover, which actually makes this weapon comfortable to carry without jabbing you in the back; I also include the Eagle Industries muzzle cover in case you want to use this system on a smaller rifle (the muzzle cover won't fit over the M95 brake). In addition to the above accessories, the rifle includes a total of five factory 5-round magazines, a factory monopod, and of course the standard Pelican case, cleaning kit, and manuals; I also made a ballistics chart and placed it in a luggage tag that can be tied to the scope or its mounts if desired."

Before I start out the magazine disconnect WAS removed on this gun and if needed I can easily reinstall it for you. I thought I should be up front about that. I also put on a slightly lighter hammer spring to reduce the double action trigger pull. Gun shoots great, no failures to fire or extract. The reason I am selling this is it doesn't fit my hands very well, the gun with either of the two Hogue grips and I don't like the factory plastic grips Smith used. With someone with slightly larger hands, this would be an excellent night stand gun or carry gun. It is fun at the range too.

These carbines used a paper cartridge. Plenty of information online on how to make them. Shiloh manufacturing has an excellent reputation for making high quality Sharps firearms. They were located in Farmingdale, New York before moving to Montana. Don't confuse these with some cheap imports ! This carbine was probably built in the 1980s and does show some wear, but overall is still very nice. Mostly cosmetic wear consistent with age. The two major defects are someone put tacks in the stock and the clean out screw is seized. The tack holes are an easy fix, an iron, a little glue, and light sanding will take care of them. I already started working on it.The seized clean out screw is a common issue. Most people just clean through the nipple. A good machinest can drill it out and replace it with a hex head in no time."
