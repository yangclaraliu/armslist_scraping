Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.
With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.
The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.
The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.
The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting.Please read and understand conditions of sale!Those that do not will be ignored!

I do not know exact details of where this was accquired but I know this is not a surplus or a training model. The man who brought it back from the war gave it to his son (family friend) who passed it on to my father and eventually my father gifted it to me. My father had shot it a small amount when he was a teenager but it has not been used for decades. I have given the gun a quick once over to keep it clean and happy, I wouldnt hesitate to shoot it today. If this doesnt sell I will most likely sporterize it for big game.
The Imperial Chrysanthemum and all serial numbers are in perfect legible shape.
The stock is a little beat up from war service, not storage or post war use.
There is only one place that has any rust which is the end of the barrel and it is very superficial/light.
The action of the bolt and pin are still very solid and smooth.
All original components, no modifications.
As far as a trade I am interested in a small CCW style handgun 380/9mm. I am also interested in Jeep ZJ 98' compatible suspension components for up to 3'' lift and/or tires in good shape for 15''wheels 5x4.5 lug pattern.

This gun is in perfect shape internally, as you can see by the picture of the barrel, but does have some minor cosmetic wear but only on the slide as I tried to capture. This gun only has about 250 rounds through it, I can text or email you more pictures but it does have extremely shallow scratches on the front of the slide and on the back near the sights, then a gold line that may just be over the finish, other than those 3 spots the rest of the slide looks great and the frame is great. This tacops model is the top of the line Sig P226, it comes with 4 extended magazines that all hold 15 rounds that sell on Sigs website for $62 a piece, it has night sights that glow very bright, an upgraded short reset trigger, a pretty nice Blackhawk CQC OWB holster, an extra set of hogue grips, and the frame has a bevertail. I would prefer to sell this gun but I am open to trades but only for 9mm and 45 pistols, maybe a 300 win mag rifle. I am asking $800 OBO, the MSRP is $1329 and the cheapest I found them for online was $1100 + shipping and transfer, so please do not low ball me because this is a great deal.

Our Tactical Grade Glock Trigger has been thoroughly tested to insure reliability, consistency, and uniformity of weight. You will immediately notice the difference in your shooting performance after installation.The trigger face is totally and geometrically flat: Look at all the match rifles used to set combat rifle marksmanship records. They all use flat triggers. Flat triggers are totally flat and straight, not just ""square faced"" curved triggers. ""Flat and straight"" triggers improve your mechanical leverage and allow you to consistently place your shooting finger in the most advantageous location for you. Additionally, these triggers maintain a more consistent feeling trigger regardless of where on that trigger your finger is placed.The trigger safety is much wider than an OEM unit, allowing you to quickly place your finger in the optimal firing position via a tactile index and thus build improved consistency and accuracy via smooth operation through the entire length of pull. Reduced pre-travel and crisp reset improves the shooter’s ability to place follow up shots with speed and accuracy."

It's older (2002) but has surprisingly crisp lands and grooves.  It's been carried a lot, and at some point developed some minor corrosion on the slide, mostly on the cerrations on the left side (I'm told this is very common with these guns, and due to perspiration). Now the good part (ok, BETTER part).  When I contacted Keltec to find out the year of production, they told me they can re-blue the slide for $40; I didn't think it necessary, but it's at least there as an option. Mag holds 10, and there is an extra mag included (but it tends to stick-- the original mag drops right out nicely).  In terms of accuracy and , it shoots about exactly how you'd expect a 3"" barrel 9mm to shoot.  Comes with original box, and an IWB nylon holster.  I'm obviously not the original owner, and haven't owned it all that long.  But I have shot it, and it shoots fine.  Shot a box through it with no jams, misfeeds, double feeds, stove pipes, or other hiccups. 
Upgrades:  
Brand new set of sights installed.
Brand new metal guide rod (the old polymer one is included).
Brand new Hogue ""Handall"" grip (helps accuracy a lot).Set of thru-frame bolts to mount a belt clip (I inadvertently forgot to order the actual clip though, and at $10 a pop for shipping, decided to just forget it). 
A second set of brand new sights (it was cheaper than the postage, so why not).
A good ""truck gun"" or ""woods gun,"" or... for a 10 round mag, it's remarkably small and carries quite comfortably.  Priced to sell quickly, at $240 (less than what I've got in it). You must have a valid NH drivers license and concealed carry permit, and be willing to let me write the info down on a bill of sale.  Otherwise we can meet up at an FFL, and I'll split the cost of the transfer fee with you. Would consider trades (ammo?)."

This will sell at the gun show this weekend.  Get ahold of me soon if interested. Almost new GLOCK model 42, .380 ACP, 6+1 capacity. Great slimline, subcompact pistol for everyday carry or as a backup. Totally loaded with all the add-ons that make this pistol even better- extended magazine release, extended slide release, 2 factory 6 round magazines, 2 factory magazines with Ghost brand +2 extensions, and an Uncle Mike's ankle holster. I've also got plenty of ammo available as well, ~1,000 rounds of both high quality range and carry.These came out about 2 years ago and are still not the easiest models to find for sale, especially a lightly used one for sale privately. The choices for a slim 'pocket pistol' before these came out weren't anything great unless you wanted to spend the big bucks.  Best of all, Glock made these in the USA at their Georiga plant! I just went through the gun and there's very little visible wear on the inner workings and no holster or handling marks on the exterior, you won't find a nicer one. I've had Glocks for over 15 years and they are the ONLY gun I trust my life with. I've had this one for close to 2 years and just haven't used it very much, it has less than 100 rounds through it. Don't need the money or anything like that, just hate to see it sitting in the safe when someone else can put it to use.The total of all the extras included in this package are over $150. The Ghost brand magazine extensions are a big step up from other options like Pearce. They come with an extended spring and separate body that uses the factory floor plate. I've got everything that came with the pistol- box, manual, paperwork, cleaning rod and brush, factory magazine springs, etc.Feel free to ask any questions about this package, general gun or concealed carry. I'm a disabled veteran who's been around guns my whole life and have lots of experience with all sorts of weapons platforms. Face to face sale or can ship to your local FFL.  Thank you! For those not familiar with this new addition to the GLOCK family:The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."

This is the gun that tamed the west. Lever action 30-30s have arguably killed more deer, elk, moose, and buffalo than any gun and are a blast to shoot.

Also I am a CCW holder and Nevada resident so rest assured this very lightly used rifle comes from a good home. Interested in AR's, pistols, just let me know what you've got. Thanks."
