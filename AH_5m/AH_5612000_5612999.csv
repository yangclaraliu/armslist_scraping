It is missing the right side grip panel. Also included is one factory 5 round magazine. It would make a nice carry gun or project gun. Finish is pretty good, with light scratches and no rust. Also includes new Wolff Recoil spring and firing pin spring.IMPORTANT: It's come to my attention that AMT's are of questionable reliability and quality. I've never fired the gun, as it needs the right grip panel to retain the trigger bar. While the website that I got it from claimed it was a good shooter, I'm gonna say that It may be better for parts or a project gun, and you may be taking a gamble if you want to buy this gun for carry. Please keep this in mind, as I don't want anyone getting hurt cause I sold them a gun that turned out to be junk. Stay safe!"

The long beach model is nearly identical to the TRP except it has fixed trijicon night sights instead of adjustable, doesn't have ""TRP"" or ""Tactical"" all over it and has a different set of grips. The long beach model is made for long beach CA PD. Springfield only makes these every 2-3 years.

Thank you for checking out this post.  Anyone who can legally purchase a firearm may have this transferred to them at any FFL dealer.   This is a Generation 4 Glock 34 with a few upgrades.    First of all, the internal metal parts are professionally polished to a mirror finish. The factory trigger was not bad but I installed and tested the Ghost 3.5 trigger connector (included the factory connector). You get one 10 round original Glock Gen4 magazine. I wish I could include all my 17 round ones but as you probably know, that would make me a bad guy and you a bad guy as well for having them.  
Heinie Straight Eight night sights
Anyway, I have fired about 300 rounds of range ammo through it and 100 cheap federal Wal-Mart stuff through it without any malfunctions after all modifications. Thanks for reading.  Cash only.  Buyer pays transfer fees."

C. HIGGINS 20 GAUGE BOLT-ACTION SHOTGUN MODEL 583.19 Some history: The JC Higgins (Sears) Model 10 The Sears and Roebuck listed the Model 10 bolt-action shotgun in their catalog from 1946 until 1958 and priced it at $30 (you could get a cleaning kit and case for about 45 cents more). It was a “man sized, hard hitting shotgun” according to the catalog. They came in .410, 12, 16 and 20 gauges, had a four-round capacity, and most could be bought with either a modified or full choke barrel. The Model 10 has never been the center of controversy per se, but there was and is an ongoing debate about its history and even its name. Though it’s generally accepted that High Standard, a company most notable for its .22-caliber competitive- and Olympic-quality pistols, manufactured the bulk of the Model 10s, there is still debate on who was originally produced it. Some conjecture that the early ones were made by H&R because H&R sold a bolt-action shotgun at that time that was very similar to it. Also, I’m referring to it as the Model 10 as do most people, but on many of the units you’ll find “583.xx” stamped on the barrel (the last digits denoting slight modifications). The 583.xx is another number Sears used on these guns and others like it, so needless to say it may get confusing. Asking $140 obo. This is a 20 gauge model. Full choke. In good working order. Shows sign of normal wear for its age.  Will need to see IN driver's license and LTCH. Would like to keep transaction to Indianapolis/Zionsville/Carmel area. Thank you for looking."

From the manufacturer- ""Unlike most other ‘NATO’ ammunition on the market GGG GP21 is new production; not old surplus, product overrun or ‘NATO-like’ imitations. GGG GP21 is 100% authentic military ammunition exceeding all STANAG and MOPI requirements. GGG manufactures and qualifies GGGGP21 ammunition to the same rigorous standards whether the end user is the US commercial market or a front line military combat unit. GGG spares no expenses in the manufacturing process using only the highest grade of brass with deep annealing that is excellent for reloading. The military grade boxer primers are non-corrosive, non-mercuric and exceed all sensitivity requirements for combat use. A high quality double base smokeless propellant is used. The full metal jackets are made from tombac. The case mouth and case primer joint have a waterproof sealing. As a result of both the quality manufacturing and the packaging, when stored in this fashion, GGG NATO ammunition has a minimum shelf life of no less than 25 years. GGG NATO qualified ammunition far exceeds the benchmark and typical performance of other NATO ammunition.""In other words good stuff- not the inspection rejected XM855 Lake City/Winchester/Federal stuff you see in abundance out there- the ""X"" stands for ""rejected for military use""."

Part number 431-0017-05-00, includes pelican case, charger, Larue mount and accessories. Save thousands over retail.The FLIR Thermal Advantage - Is the ideal night vision scope because it detects heat energy, instead of visible light. Day or night, the body heat of animals will stand out against cooler backgrounds when seen through the R-Series scope.Conventional image intensified (I2) night vision scopes can't match the power of thermal because they require illumination from moonlight or other sources. They also can't reveal what's hiding in the shadows or in low-contrast environments in the same way thermal can.The R-Series offers up to six different detection palettes, including FLIR's exclusive InstAlert TM, which displays the hottest temperatures in red so you can detect animals, people and other warm objects more easily.Rugged Reliability - The ThermoSight R-Series is built to perform under extreme conditions. An internal shock reduction system (SRS-M) is qualified for a MSR semi-automatic platform, up to .308 Cal. Plus, the R-Series' water-resistant casing can be submerged in up to three feet of water. R-Series offers a three-year warranty (with registration) on the scope, and a 10-year warranty on the internal sensor. Advanced Imaging, Simple Design - The R-Series combines outstanding image quality with an easy-to-use design. The scope optimizes images automatically using FLIR's own advanced image correction technology. And large, glove-friendly buttons combined with a simple menu interface give you access to every key setting in three clicks, or less.I can ship, can paypal or bank trasnfer, no PO BOX and will be fedex ground insured with adult signature.Cash only, not interested in trades, NO foreign buyers, BS or scams."
