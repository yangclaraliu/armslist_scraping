Absolutely no wear or blemish on it. If you know CZ, you know these are soft shooters and very reliable handguns. This is not the Omega trigger model, but it is double/ single action that can be carried cocked and locked. At this weight and size, you can shoot all day (or until your money runs out on ammo) and not feel a thing in the recoil department. Will come as shown with 2 mags 1-10 round and 1-16 round, I will fill both with blazer brass for the range for you.

We can perform the money exchange and transfer upon mutual confirmation of all parties. CMMG PISTOL, MK4 PDW, 300 BLK PRODUCT #: 30A81D2The Mk4 PDW is CMMG’s smallest, most compact pistol equipped with the RKM7 1.36” I.D. KeyMod free floating hand guard and a nitrided 4140 Chrome Moly (CrMo) steel barrel. The Mk4 PDW in 300 BLK; equipped with a Magpul MOE pistol grip and trigger guard, along with a magazine and CMMG’s lifetime quality guarantee. The Mk4 PDW is a gas-impingement operated semi-automatic AR-15 pistol. Because this gun leaves the factory configured as a handgun, it does not require the additional tax stamps required to convert a rifle into a handgun or for short-barreled rifles. However, attaching a shoulder stock or a vertical grip to the hand guard of a pistol like this one will change its legal status. The pistol arrives without a sight system. However, the top of the receiver and the RKM7 KeyMod free-floating hand guard provide a total of 13.5-inches worth of Picatinny railing to support removable sights and optics. KeyMod accessory rails can be attached to the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions of the handguard to mount accessories like lights and laser modules. The upper and lower receivers are formed of precision forged 7075-T6 aluminum and treated with a matte black hard anodized finish. The 8"" medium-weight 4140 chromoly steel barrel features a black nitride finish and is fitted with a standard removable A2 flash hider. The fluted anodized buffer tube supports an ambidextrous sling mount where it connects with the lower receiver. The controls for the Mk4 PDW, including the charging handle, bolt release, safety lever and magazine release, are all located and operated in typical AR-15 fashion. The trigger is of the single-stage mil-spec variety. It demonstrated a 5 lb. 15 oz. trigger pull when checked with a digital trigger gauge. The rest of the gun's features have been provided by Magpul, including a 30-round Gen 2 PMAG magazine, an MOA over-sized polymer trigger guard, and an MOA textured polymer pistol grip with a storage compartment. • Caliber: 300 Blackout• Barrel: 8.0, Medium Taper 4140 Chromoly Steel 1:7 twist RH, 6 Rifle Grooves, SBN• Action: Gas-Impingement Semi-Auto, Gas Port Location: Pistol• Muzzle: A2 comp., threaded 5/8-24• Hand Guard: CMMG RKM7 KeyMod hand guard• Furniture: Magpul MOE pistol grip• Receivers: Forged 7075-T6 AL M4 type upper, AR15 type lower• Trigger: Single stage mil-spec style trigger• Weight: 5.3 lbs (unloaded)• Length: 25 inches• Sights: None• Capacity: Accepts AR-15 Magazines"

This is a beautiful German Makarov and it is in excellent condition.  It has been well maintained and operates very well. The bluing is very nice for a pistol like this; however it does show some signs of typical wear. For example, where your thumb and index finger (crotch of your hand) and where your fingers wrap around the grip and touch the metal when holding it is where the wear is. This is pretty minimal though and typical. I tried to show it in the pictures.  Over all it is very nice and all things considered I rate the bluing at a strong 95%. The bore is nice and bright and shows no signs of damage. This pistol comes with two magazines and the original leather holster in very good condition. I also have the original grip which has been replaced with a modern one with a thumb rest so if you wish to change it back to original you can. Also I will include 65 rounds of non-corrosive ammunition. *Please note I will only sell handguns Face to Face to individuals who have a CPL (Concealed Pistol License).
