Glock 23 Gen 4 Semi-automatic Double Action Only Compact 40 S&W 4.02"" Polymer Matte 13Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Right Hand Fixed Sights PG2350203The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

56,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5857056,For Sale:  Browe Combat Optic (BCO) 4x32 Red Chevron,"Downtown, Indianapolis, Indiana","$ 1,200","Listed On: Friday, September 2, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I mounted this to a rifle and zeroed it, but other than that it is like new. It comes with the hard case, lens brush, new Surefire CR123 battery, box, and paperwork.From Browe:4x32 BROWE Combat OpticThe 4x32 BROWE Combat Optic (BCO) is a state-of-the-art optic that delivers highest quality optical glass, high precision machining, with a rugged military design.  The BCO is a purpose designed and built optic ideally suited for tactical scenarios and well suited for military, police and sportsmen. Its titanium housing is compact and light weight, yet nearly three times stronger than its aluminum counterparts, enhancing its ability to survive the rigors of field abuse under the most severe environmental conditions. The BCO’s list of evolutionary technology is long and includes such features as:  Target Light Sensor Technology The BCO has a cadmium-sulfide photocell located in the optical path providing great sensitivity and accuracy of the target light that is being transmitted through the optic, not ambient lighting. In tactical environments lighting levels are very liquid and constantly changing. When nanoseconds count there is no time to make manual illumination adjustments or search for a poorly illuminated reticle. The Target Light Sensor Technology simplifies the operation and allows the operator to focus on the job at hand.   Single Intuitive Control (SIC) Gives the operator a simple button designed to control the illumination systems and simulate muscle memory. With a single press of the SIC button the BCO will enter Automatic Mode; this will utilize the Target Light Sensor Teechnology by measuring the light transmission and automatically set the reticle illumination to the proper brightness. The second press of the SIC button the BCO enters into Manual Mode. This gives the operator complete control of the reticle illuination with the choice of 10 day settings and 3 night vision settings.  BCO Utility Port The BCO utility port is a sealed port on the backside of the battery housing. This port can be used to update the operating firmware or customize the existing program. It can also be used to plug in a remote pressure pad switch, so the SIC button controls can be placed at a secondary location on the weapon. This port can also be used to import or export power. This means that accessories such as lasers or mini red dots could be powered from the BCO battery. Alternatively, the BCO utility port is capable of importing power, to run on an external power source such as a central power system.  Vibration Motion Sensor Designed to conserve battery life by placing the BCO in SLEEP mode if motion is not detected after two hours. The BCO has an average battery usage life of over 2000 hours with a minimum of 775 hours on max brightness. In sleep mode the battey current is less than 1uA, which will give the BCO a shelf life of over 10 years. Optical Design The BCO optical design is based on an internally adjustable roof prism optical system with an etched glass reticle. This design was incorporated to maintain a short overall length, a platform that has proven itself successful with currently deployed products. All lenses are precision ground of the finest quality optical glass available and are broad band anti-reflective coated possessing excellent light gathering capabilities even under low light conditions. The glass etched reticle incorporates an LED coupled with microprocessor technology and a cadmium-sufide photocell to measure target light levels, automatically adjusting the reticle to match target lighting conditions."

PRICE IS FOR THE SET. The M1911 with 5 INCH Colt National Match barrel manufactured by Ithaca in 1944. SN: 1253639.  The Colt National Match barrel is stamped with three lines of alpha-numerics:  The frame has the SN on the right side. Nearly the entire pistol is engraved with Germanic leafy scrollwork with a punch dot background. Hammer has jeweled sides. Mainspring housing is checkered, engraved, and marked “K. JAGER/MAINZ.” Front strap and grip safety are finely checkered and embellished with engraving. Slide stop and frame safety are engraved. Trigger guard is engraved. All screw heads are engraved. Plunger tube between the slide stop and the grip safety is engraved. Even the rod ends of the slide stop and grip safety are engraved. The Ithaca frame has a lanyard loop at the base of the arched main spring housing. The pistol has a blade front sight and a notch rear sight. The magazine is solid blue with a 100% engraved floor plate. This heirloom/museum piece wears a pair of period correct ivory grips with relief carving and checkering. Both grips are checkered all over except where they are carved at the top and bottom of each grip. Near the top of the left grip is carved a patriotic “WWII Army Air Forces” style circled wings touching the top of a 5 point star. Each wing consists of 6 feathers, each of which is detailed. Near the top of the right grip is carved a China-Burma-India (CBI) emblem consisting of an emblematic shield with 4 vertical panels and an overarching field containing a 10 ray sun on the left and a 5 point star on the right. The CBI emblem incorporates the Chinese sun symbol and the Star of India symbol on an American-style shield. The symbol for Burma at the time was a peacock and was not represented when Colonel Frank Dorn designed the CBI emblem for the Allied troops flying in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. At the time when he designed the CBI crest, Colonel Dorn was a member of General Joseph Stillwell’s HQ staff sometime around 1942. Bottom of each grip incorporates a carved profile of an elephant’s head with up-raised trunk, long tusks and flared ears. Both elephants appear to be bellowing. Both have one “red” eye. The M1911 is 1 of 3 US made firearms engraved and stocked by Kurt Jaeger, apparently as a package for a presently unidentified person, presumably an individual connected to the US Army Air Forces & the Chinese-Burma-India campaign; may have had a last name beginning with the letter “R”. The other 2 firearms in this three WWII-era handgun set are S&W Victory revolvers described & photographed individually. All 3 handguns come in custom wood case.

I have ridden it a total of 4 hours this year and with family and work I don't see myself getting the time to ride to justify keeping it. The bike has a total of 47 hours on it. At 40 hours a top end rebuild was completed including all new gaskets, ring and piston. The bike is in great shape overall. There is a scuff on the main fairing on the left side and a crack on the right side. A new fairing kit is less than $100 if you wanted it to look brand new, but it never bothered me so I rode it as is. The bike has never been ridden without a clean fresh air filter and it is always cleaned after every ride. I have followed the manual for all maintenance and changed oil/fluids as directed. Runs great without any issues. The bike has the following aftermarket parts (most are new this year)-Lectron Jetless Carb-P3 carbon fiber pipe guard -Enduro Engineering Radiator braces and guards -Enduro Engineering Skid plate-Enduro Engineering Clutch Slave Guard-Acerbis bark busters-Midwest Mountain Engineering clutch and brake levers-Moose hour meter-Fastway oversized foot pegs-FMF exhaust-Emig grips-KTM grab handleAdditional Items-Enduro Engineering shock wrench-Enduro Engineering Power Valve Wrench-Steahly Flywheel weight kit new in package-Twin Air wash cover-power valve springs -3x spark plugs-KTM black bag with manual-Renthal Twin Ring Sprocket 52 (new in package)-Renthal Twin Ring Sprocket 49 (new in package)-matrix concepts gas can-multiple KTM motorex fluids (oil, brake, coolant etc. -battery trickle charger-KTM tie down straps I also have ridding gear if your interested.

The condition is excellent with very little use. The barrel is a 28"" ported ""Crio"" barrel. The Crio® System combines a barrel frozen to -300° F with a cryogenically treated, longer choke tube. Freezing the barrel relieves the stresses caused by hammer forging and creates an even-grained, slick surface. This means less resistance against wads and shot and a stronger pattern. There are 5 extended crio chokes included. The benelli autos feature an in-line inertia driven recoil system with a rotary locking bolt face. There is a shim kit for changing pitch. The Legacy Sport model has ""AA Grade Walnut"" with a satin finish. The pad is a gel recoil pad. The Legacy Sport model receiver has game scene etchings. There is a take down case also. This item will be carefully packaged and insured for the selling price and shipping available"
