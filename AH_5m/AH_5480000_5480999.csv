The gun will come with (2) 5-round shell saddles as shown. These fit in standard AR mag pouches, and while removable, they are sturdy and rigid. This is a great HD gun and a ton of fun all around.

This gun is very similar to the Benelli Sport II shotgun, but was manufactured by Franchi which is the mid-grade Benelli brand (under Benelli but above Stoeger). Fit and finish is stellar. It is inertia driven, has a 30"" ported barrel with lengthened forcing cones and is threaded for Benelli Crio Plus chokes for consistent and even patterns. The gun's capactiy is 4+1+1 due to the fact that you can ""float"" a shell in the receiver with a full magazine and a loaded chamber. I used to shoot in college but now I'm no longer competing so it has to go. This gun is in great shape and is ready to break some clays.The gun comes with the original hard case, as well as 5 extended chokes (C, IC, M, IM, F). The retail cost of this gun and chokes is around $1200 (before tax), you will not find a better shotgun for this money."

Shot a couple rounds out at ASC and while it was fun, it's not a passion and my fun time has other priorities.  This is a perfect entry/mid level trap gun set up and will take you as far as 99% of us can go.  For the 1% with the talent, free time, and endless bankroll there are other great options.
Browning BT99, 12 Gauge, Grade 1, two barrel set in excellent++ condition.  I would be surprised if gun has seen 500 rounds.  Lock up is vault tight and action lever well to the right.  Barrels are 34"" full choke and 32"" mod choke for 25 and 16 yard trap respectively.  32"" barrel is un-fired.  Comes with original boxes, paperwork and Browning hard case.
 The stuff-  Two Mec reloading presses- one progressive (manual indexing), one single stage (like a turret, you move the shell from station to station), a full bag of #8 shot, a few/several bags of wads, a couple bricks of primers, a butt load of 1x fired Winchester AA shells and some red dot powder.  Everything you need to start your own shotgun shell reloading obsession.  I've come to my senses just in time for you to get in deep without breaking the bank. I'll update wit more exact quantities as I sort it out.  Package price FTF in Wheaton or where convenient is $1200I'll sell gun, barrels, original boxe and Browniong case for $1000

The stocks have double outlined checkering that is sharp & the wood fits tight to the metal. The metal is equally as nice with an engraved receiver, gold trigger and strong bluing in all areas. It is the nicest Sweet Sixteen I have ever seen. This is a beautiful shotgun with high quality Belgium Browning workmanship of what I consider to be the best semi-auto shotgun ever made. My friend’s father was the original owner who bought it new and I am not sure he ever used it, or if he did…rarely. It has been sitting in a closet for decades coming out every so often to get oiled. Dad has now passed and I am helping his son sell it. It comes with the original case and original cleaning kit."

In 2014, the pistol was sent to the Glock factory to be upgraded.  All the internals were replaced and the frame was upgraded to a gen 3 frame.  ( paperwork in pic ). Gun had a box of rounds shot through it when it came back.  Since then it has been put away.  No marks on this pristine piece.  It comes with case, lock, 3/15 rnd mags,1/22 rnd mag, and a lonewolf 9mm conversion barrel.  Two of these with less extras sold for 1300+ just last month.  So feel free to make an offer.  Local pickup"

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. Safety The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.this weapon is one of the most stunning guns I have ever owned it is a great investment in a very expensive weapon this 44 mag is powerful I have never fired this weapon it is brand new and hard to find most the local shops have a standard gold for 2200 plus tax I am selling this one to move. ,  must have Ohio I'd and sign bill of sale the price is firm and is worth more then I am selling it for thank you. .  last chance on gunbrokers I must move it please text me at REDACTED if it is listed I have it. ."
