The rock solid interface of the 90 Tooth Ratchet Taper™ system minimizes point-of-impact shift and enables users to fully explore the accuracy potential of their host weapon. The durable, fully-welded 100% Inconel 718 baffle cores of the SR-5™ and SR-7™ are designed to minimize back pressure and feature a newly designed blast baffle that provides additional erosion resistance for use with short barreled hosts. Although optimized for 7.62mm x 51 ammunition, the SR-7™ is an excellent multi-caliber silencer that offers excellent performance on hosts chambered in 300 AAC Blackout, 6.8 SPC, and 5.56mm.

My buddy drove it off the lot in Columbia brand new. Newer rear tire. All black It is a touring model so it has slightly higher handle bars but that just makes it a bit cheaper on insurance.

Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck. CALL JOHN AT REDACTED"

These were German Kar98ks left behind in Yugoslavia after the war, most German markings were scrubbed off. However, it is a German gun, with a laminated stock, a few of the German factory marking are visible. Repro cleaning rod, sling, bayonet included. Very smooth action (It's a Mauser), mirror like bore, overall excellent condition. Cleaned after each range trip. I'm not the best when it comes to iron sights, but the rifle is definitely more accurate than I am.  Also comes with ~300 rounds of 150gr Romanian surplus ammo (steel surplus), some PPU 198gr ammo (brass) on stripper clips, and a waterproof softcase.Questions welcome, email for more pictures."

The QK01 has a spring loaded button that when depressed allows the operator to slide the knob up or down on the Actuator Rod quickly into the desired sight picture. When the button is released, the fine threads are re-engaged and the operator can make the final adjustments by rotating the QK01 knob.

This is my second and I've been very pleased with them, just going a different direction. This one has been installed on my M4 but was never fired with it installed. These make for a quick and easy break down of an AR for transport in a small bug out bag or just for the ""cool factor"". It comes packaged as it did new in the factory box. It will work with a rifle or pistol that has a low profile gas block or an A2 front sight. These are $200 new, I'll sell this kit for $160 FTF in Charlotte. Obviously, the rifle is not included, nor for sale. The pics are of the actual kit for sale and just for reference.Only Trade would be for a brand new in the box FailZero 5.56 AR-15 bolt carrier group.I will not respond to any messages simply asking ""still available"" or ""I'm interested"". If you're interested, at least send me a complete sentence with your name and number so I can contact you. These one liners are considered spam and/or scams and will not get a response from me.
