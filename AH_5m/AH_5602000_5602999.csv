I am looking to purchase ANY pre built lower, BUT I do prefer a unique AR-15 or AR-10 lowers. Only looking for lowers, nothing more. I would really like to find a Magpul Lower , SanTan ,  or Seekins model (I know a couple companies have made limited runs of unique lowers like the Spikes Florida ) which would be cool to have as well, but I'm looking to pay reasonable prices and not $400 for a lower that was originally $100. If the lower originally costs $250 ( such as a San Tan than I'm happy to pay $200 or a little less than the new price ) , but I would rather have something that I like and find unique / appealing to me at a good price rather than pay 5x the amount for a lower that is rare for how many were built based on the logo.) but am also interested in any strange, weird, special, engraved (etc) lowers that you may have. I would love to buy one of the Silencer Co lowers or the lower with the Big Girl and ice cream scoop lever functions. I prefer the funny, but not seen often lowers or lowers that have a nice unique style like the Seekins model lowers. I also like the Honey Badger , Crusdaer , Jack , Warthog or other similar lowers as well, but you can find them new all the time so I wouldn't want to pay MSRP if I can buy one for that. Please provide pictures of your lower and a price when responding. Any questions or offers, just ask. Please text me at 904-5zero9-zero517Thank you! PLEASE DO NOT FLAG.

The fire mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot; the first level of safe mode disables the firing mechanism and the second level of safe serves to lock the bolt down against the stock and also features a press-to-release tab that locks the SBS switch in the safe position.Another feature is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage that locks the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated while not engaging and chambering the rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the operator with the option of loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. One more tap to the bottom of the magazine then seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading.Bill of Sale Required."

The PPS-43C, model of 1943; is an improved version of the Soviet Army’s PPSH-41, more compact and a better SMG for use by tank crews, mobile recon groups and paratroopers. This model, the PPS-43 was made between 1943 and 1946, after WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world and manufactured in those countries. The Polish model that we offer has been redesigned as a semi auto version and shoots from a closed bolt, it is ATF approved and made of all new parts of the famed Radom plant in Poland. The stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the weapon is classified as a pistol, furnished with 4-35rd magazines."

It will come with the original synthetic stock, although it feels quite a bit like a toy with that stock on the action. Right now (as in the picture) it's wearing a Blackhawk Axiom adjustable LOP stock in Coyote Tan right now.  That stock will come with the rifle too. Really cool, lightweight stock with a pistol grip.  Below is a link to the manufacturer's webpage.Asking price for the whole shebang is $325.  I will consider trades or partial trades.  I'm looking for levers in 30-30 or .357, lightweight carbines, or a bolt action .22LR with a decent trigger (old or new, doesn't matter).

Holds 7+1 and remains very light weight. It is perfect for a CCW piece. Easily concealable either in the pocket, IWB or OWB. The gun has a rail for accessories, however, I haven't mounted anything. The fun does come with a LazerLyte side mount laser. It's a red laser and quite brite. It has constant and pulse mode. It's very accurate and easy to activate upon draw. I also installed a Hogue grip sleeve. The sights are basic and drift adjustable. I paint pen colored the front sight, but it can easily be removed. All in all its a very slim and compact gun. Very reliable this far and extremely easy to conceal. I am looking for $300 cash and am pretty firm. I am reasonable, so feel free to shoot me an offer. I realize this is not a high end piece, and it's priced accordingly. I will entertain trades within reason. I am particularly looking for a Smith&Wesson Bodyguard with laser preferably.
