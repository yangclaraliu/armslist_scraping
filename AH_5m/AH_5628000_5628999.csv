A typical six position telescoping stock is standard, along with sling mounts allowing for single or double point sling attachment. There is even a bayonet lug just in case. All of the M&P15 Sport’s parts are interchangeable with the rest of their AR15 product line.The M&P15 Sport’s barrel isn’t an M4 cut. This cut in the barrel will allow to mount a M203 grenade launcher. This additional cut also does not help the harmonics of the barrel. We think this a advantage that will help accuracy but will ultimately come down to the ammo used. The Smith sports a full profile barrel of American 4140 Steel. The barrel sports their Armornite coating. There have been reviews of the first model firing 85,000 rounds of various brands of ammunition without any visible damage to the Armornite finish. We have found this to be a very reliable platform and so have law enforcement and countless other agencies.

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.
The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system and is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.
The KRISS Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the KRISS Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterparts and is civilian legal in most states."

It will shoot MOA with a good load. It has a tight chamber. If you are using fired brass you will need to bottom out your die and let it cam over a bit. Virgin brass and ammo loaded with virgin brass with chamber just fine. Because it has a tight chamber you will want to reduce your loads by 10% and work up, watching for pressure signs.

At only 4.125” long by 1.25” in diameter and weighing in at a feather-light 3.8oz, the Poseidon offers sound suppression comparable to industry-leading silencers that are twice its size and weight. Using artificial environment and wipe technology along with a proprietary mono-baffle stack, the Poseidon features a unique design that helps to seal in the end-user’s ablative medium of choice until the suppressor is used; thus eliminating a major downside of wet suppressors. In other words, your ablative medium won’t run out in your pocket! As an added selling point, the Thompson Machine Poseidon is also a true multi-caliber suppressor, and is very quiet on .22lr, .25acp, .32acp, 9x18mm, and .380acp host weapons. The Poseidon easily and fully disassembles for cleaning, and includes the necessary take-down tools at no extra charge. The Poseidon 9mm is available in either 1/2-28 or 13.5x1LH thread patterns."

Nothing wrong with it, I just decided I wanted one with a quad rail and flip up sights because of the style platform I want to run. I could change the rail on this one and put a gas block on it to accomplish my goals but I'd rather just upgrade to the M&P 15t Tactical which is about $300-400 more.

The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6s had fixed sights only. Genuine P225s manufactured for the West German Police will have a ""P6"" stamp on the right side of the slide. German police pistols can be identified by the hammer, which has small ""ear"" or ""hook"". According to section 7.7 of the German manual, the cutout is the Deformationssporn, which means “deformation spur”. This was a requirement of the West German Police for all their pistols, regardless of manufacturer, to alert police armorers if the pistol was dropped on its hammer.This is a German police surplus gun issued NEW in Germany.The SIG P6 is a more compact version of the SIG P220. The Swiss Army wanted semi-automatic handgun, that would provide excellent functionality with a double-action trigger. The 9mm SIG-Sauer P6, debuted with various new and inventive features. It utilized a single column magazine holding eight 9 mm rounds and has a 3.9 in. barrel.A new German police standard, in the mid-1970s, prompted SIG-Sauer to develop a new pistol that met the standard: The SIG-Sauer P225 (known as the P6) and the Heckler & Koch P7. The SIG-Sauer P225 was the least expensive (due mainly to the inventive design) and received the majority of the orders. To be able to manufacture that many handguns, SIG acquired a controlling interest in J. P. Sauer & Sohn in Eckenförde, Germany to manufacture parts. This is also where all P225s were manufactured. The only difference between the P6 and P225 — the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6's trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6's have fixed sights only. Because of its compact size, the P225/P6 is quite readily usable for concealed carry. In U.S. states where high-capacity magazines were prohibited, the P6/P225 is in high demand."
