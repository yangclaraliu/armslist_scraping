SHIPPING available at actual cost - send me your zip code for a price. payment cash in person for local pick up.  otherwise via paypal or check or money order 
INFO:

 

Similar to the Mark I, but .177 caliber, and a bit more scarce. The Crosman Mark II Target is a .177 caliber single shot CO2 air pistol. The metal paint on this one retains about 98% of the original finish. The grip is in very good condition.
 
 
Single shot - very accurate pistol, and nice collector’s item.  marked = Crosman Arms Co. FAIBPORT N.Y.
 
HISTORY 
 
The Crosman Mark I and Mark II target pistols began production in 1966. The .22 caliber Mark I stopped production in 1983, and the .177-caliber/BB-caliber Mark II continued until 1986. There were two main variations of both models. The first version featured adjustable power and lasted through 1980, and the second variation continued to the end of production for each model. These guns were produced right at the time America transitioned from .22 to .177 caliber as the principal airgun caliber of interest. 
 
The magnetic tip of the Mark II bolt is thinner than the tip of the Mark I bolt, and that may have given airgunsmiths the idea of reducing bolt thickness at this critical gas-flow point to allow more gas to flow past. It’s right at the transfer port, which is essential to the gun’s performance. Whether this is true or not, I don’t know, but thinning the bolt tip is now a standard trick in the power modification of the Mark I.
 
Today, you’ll see many more .22 caliber pistols of this type than were originally made. That’s because many .177 Mark IIs were rebarrelled with premium .22 pellet barrels because of the power potential of the pistol. That’s not to say you can’t get a pistol rebarreled with a premium .177, but .22 caliber is by far the most desirable. You can tell a Mark II by the presence of black plastic grips, while the Mark I has a reddish-brown grip. But grips are easily swapped between the guns, so this is not a positive I.D. You have to read the frame to know for sure how your pistol started life.
 
The operation of loading is separate from that of cocking. The loading bolt simply pushes the pellet into the breech and seals the breech against gas loss. Cocking is accomplished by pulling forward on two round knobs located on either side of the receiver.

A few things I would not mind having more of right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Straight trade on two Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area only or will ship to TX resident for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Ammo capitalizes on copper's ability to be very finely machined to make a bullet that, upon impact, performs unlike any other hollow point available today. The RIP bullet features a unique one hundred percent copper, petaled-trocar design which gives it the ability to not only penetrate deep into a target but also fragment in fluid. This iconic bullet design has just enough rounding on the trocars to feed and cycle well in modern pistols. Upon entering a gel or fluid the petals break from the base and create 9 individual wound channels as the base continues on course. This penetration and separation delivers not only a maximum shock wave but wound path as well. Specs: Caliber: 9mm Luger Weight: 96 gr.

Upon appraisal it was listed 90% and considered to be in very good condition. The appraisal value astounded me, twice as much as what I was expecting. There is no rust on the firearm and the internals are just as clean as they were 98 years ago. (SN 985517). This is a flawless working piece of machinery. I have recently discovered what looks like ""MARTINEZ"" lightly etched on the off-side of the chamber and also has a parade sling that has ""UMC 1944"" stamped on it. With knowledge of history it is a possibility that this rifle was carried by a soldier or Marine during WWII, but since the Army were able to use the M1s and the Marines were still using the 1903 until later in the war this could have been one of those rifles. It is also likely that this rifle passed through several hands of recruits in training between WWI and WWII. Either way, this rifle is a relic and should be treated as such. All parts are original with Springfield Armory stamped on the barrel and ""10-29"" nomenclature listed under the SA bursting bomb. I know how much this rifle is worth and will not accept anything less. This rifle is for the experience collector. If you have a serious desire to see any more photos just ask. Do not contact me with rediculous offers, I will not respond. Text is the best form of contact, my phone number is 859-TWOFOUREIGHT-2738."
