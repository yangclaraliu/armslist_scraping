Choose from 44MAG, 45 Colt and 357MAG. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition. Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy.They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle. The traditional 20? octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds.Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today.The 44MAG can also shoot 44SP rounds, and the 357MAG can also shoot 38SP rounds."

All of the mags function perfect. The barrel is cold hammer forged and chrome lined. It says it is chambered for .223 Remington but will function (and actually is chambered in 5.56 NATO)as per Saiga. They were marked as .223 because of import laws of military caliber rifles and .223 is a ""Sporting"" caliber. Check my location before contacting me. I am FIRM on the price and it is a steal at this price. Since Obama banned the importation of Saigas you know they are hard to find and will definately get much more costly as the election nears."

I've shot it to 1550 with good results. I've also shot quarter minute groups with it at 100 yards. The only reason I'm selling it is its size and weight, I just wanted to try one but I don't shoot PRS, nor will I hunt with it. These are hard to find in this caliber, so cash only, no trades (unless you have a barely used Sig Legion SAO in 9mm or Sig MCX .223). Then we may talk.) Nothing else. It it is wearing a Magpul PRS stock currently, but that is not included with the price. I will throw it in for $200 extra (sorry; I have $250 in it)."

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster, but at a much more affordable price.   Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.  Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.   Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around.  Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility. In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for more than 60 years.  26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells Receiver milled from a solid billed of steel for maximum strength and reliability Silk-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting for maximum strength and reliability Offered in 12- and 20-gauge  Compact versions available with 13"" length of pull  Jr. version features 12"" length of pull     Specifications  Manufacturer Number: 25582 Gauge / Bore: 20 Gauge Magazine Capacity: 4 Barrel Length: 26"" Barrel Type: Vent Rib Rem Choke (Mod) Sights: Single Bead Receiver Finish: Matte Blue Overall Length: 46 1/2"" Length of Pull: 14"" Drop Comb: 1 1/2"" Drop at Heel: 2 1/2"" Stock Material: Laminate Stock Finish: Satin Average Weight: 6.25 lbs"

Savage's AccuTrigger® enables shooters to obtain exceptional accuracy with the Savage 93 F, by allowing you to easily adjust it to your desired weight of pull for a light, crisp release with no creep.

The 93 F has a weather resistant synthetic stock, and a blued barrel and receiver. The receiver comes drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Factory installed sling swivel studs accommodate attaching a rifle sling, or a bi-pod to the forend. The bolt features dual extractors for positive extraction of spent cases. A 5-round, detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading the rifle. The 2-stage safety is located on the right side of the receiver. The Savage 93 F Bolt-Action Rimfire Rifle in 22 WMR reaches out well over 100 yards to take varmints, small game, and medium sized predators such as coyote, fox, and bobcat with minimum muzzle blast and pelt damage.Must be able to purchase a firearm through normal processes.

Just examne the pictures, WOW! This is by far the nicest looking stock ever seen on one of these early models and the pattern of the grain is phenominal! The Ruger Finger Groove models were made from 1966-1971. This one has a serial number indicating it was made in 1970. The fingergroove models featured a walnut, Monte Carlo style stock with a beavertail forearm (fingergroove), a black plastic butt plate with the Ruger eagle cut into it, and a pistol grip with a black plastic cap has a Ruger eagle that some say looks like ""scrimshaw"" work. Unlike the standard 10/22 carbine, the fingergroove model came with factory-installed sling swivels. William Workman, who wrote the definitive book: The Ruger 10/22, stated that ""The Fingergroove is the best looking 10/22 ever made."" This 10/22 has been used a few times, but both the wood and metal remain in an overall excellent condition. There is some very slight blue wear on the trigger guard underneath. It can be seen in one of the photos. Other than that, there isn't any significant cosmetics to list. It was well cared for. There was a discussion about Finger Groove models early this year on Calguns.

Very small, but has that quality feel that all Berettas have. This would be a nice pocket gun and also a nice compact gun for a person that does not want to carry a full size gun. This gun has never been carried. I bought this about seven or eight years ago and it has been sitting ever since. I am the second owner. I have another just like it in a separate listing. They are both in almost the same exact condition. Guns like this, but with very rough finishes, are going for more than $300., so please do not offer me a ridiculous lowball price. This one comes with the one mag and the factory manual. Adults only and I am not interested in any trades. Local only - no shipping. Thank you."

Slide the latch, barrel tips up, load a round in, close and you are good to go. Single/double action. Has a safety and you can carry cocked and locked if you wish. Very small, but has that quality feel that all Berettas have. This would be a nice pocket gun and also a nice compact gun for a person that does not want to carry a full size gun. This gun has never been carried. I bought this about seven or eight years ago and it has been sitting ever since. I am the second owner. I have another just like it in a separate listing. They are both in almost the same exact condition. Guns like this, but with very rough finishes, are going for more than $300., so please do not offer me a ridiculous lowball price. This one comes with the one mag.Adults only and I am not interested in any trades. Local only - no shipping. Thank you."
