This is a Smith & Wesson Model 29-2 that's factory ""Class A"" engraved and finished in bright nickel! Chambered for the powerful .44 Magnum, this revolver wears the long 8-3/8"" pinned barrel and has the counter-bored (recessed) chambers. It has the target hammer, target trigger, and smooth Goncalo Alves target stocks. Overall condition is excellent and the original bright nickel finish rates about 98%. There are a couple of very small dark spots on top of the barrel near the front sight that were caused by some surface corrosion. There are a couple of small handling marks and a light cylinder turn line. The stocks are excellent, free of cracks, chips, dents or dings. The mechanics are in perfect shape with good timing and lock-up. The bore is also excellent. Although it does appear that this revolver has been fired, it does not appear to have been fired very much! This impressive revolver comes in the factory mahogany wood case. The interior of the case has been nicely relined in blue velvet."

I have fired less than 200 rounds through this rifle and other than an improperly staked bolt carrier key screw it functions flawlessly. I looked online and plenty of people say you can either stake it with a punch and hammer or a staking tool. I haven't had the time or money to get it restaked by a gunsmith and I didn't want to try and restake it myself. If you tighten the screw by hand it functions fine for about 60+ rounds but after that it starts short stroking and fails to extract the spent cartridge. Other than this, the rifle is in great condition. I'm formerly active duty and have spent pleanty of time using and maintaining AR platform rifles. I have babied this rifle and made sure it never got put back in the safe with out a thorough cleaning and a proper coating of CLP. The rifle comes with one factory aluminum magazine. I have installed a Magpul B.A.D lever and it can be included with the rilfe if buyer wants for an added cost. I'm asking $750 or best offer, I won't sell to anyone who can't produce a valid NV Drivers Licence or ID card at the time of sale.

Product information from Beretta
A400 Xcel Multitarget:Today’s Most Versatile Competition Shotgun.
The name of the A400 Xcel Multitarget says it all: it is a target shotgun designed for all three types of competition–trap, skeet and sporting clays.
It can claim this versatility thanks to its fully-adjustable design; this enables you to customize the way it mounts and its point of impact not only for different disciplines, but also for possible changes in clothing thickness, weight-gain or loss, as well as vision capabilities. Just as importantly, it offers such premium versatility at a price-point that puts it well within the reach of most shooters. So, if you would like a single shotgun that will break the highest number of clays in all three disciplines, you will simply love the A400 Xcel Multitarget.
Never the Wrong Gun
Whether you enjoy all three disciplines equally or haven’t yet committed to one, the A400 Xcel Multitarget will always be the right choice. Thanks to the Beretta B-Fast logic, the comb is adjustable with 4-way drop and cast regulation; in addition, a shim system makes it reversible from right- to left-handed use and the safety may be easily switched from left to right. The same B-Fast system enables you to adjust the rib to modify the point of impact depending on discipine, while the balance cap can be tuned to obtain your ideal point of balance.
Fast and Low-Recoiling
With the A400 Xcel Multitarget, you truly get a “jack of all trades, master of each one.” This is because the core of the shotgun and the technology around which it is built is not–and has never been–a compromise. The A400 action features Blink technology, which is measurably the fastest action on the market today. Capable of firing 4 shots in less than 1 second, it is 36% faster than any other semiauto shotgun on the market. In spite of its lively feel in the hands, this gun is also low-recoiling thanks to a kick-absorbing Micro Core recoil pad and the available Kick-Off system housed in the stock.
Hyper-Accurate, Consistent, Elegant
The Beretta proprietary Steelium barrel with its cold-hammer forged construction ensures accuracy and durability regardless of type of shot used. This perfectly-concentric tube is also outfitted with the Optima HP choke system, color coded to let you always know which choke you are using (3 chokes included). At the range, the A400 Xcel Multitarget will never fail to turn heads, thanks to its handsome walnut stock and trim receiver with an elegant and durable anodyzed silver finish. In short, this shotgun delivers features only found in high priced, specialized over-unders–in an elegant, affordable and incredibly versatile package that will give a lifetime of enjoyment."
