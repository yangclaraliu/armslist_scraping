Mainly looking for cash, so not really looking for trades on this, but may consider some if they interest me. Would consider a 4 or 6 inch 38/357 mag revolvers. Rugers, Smiths, etc. Also would take very partial trade for Stripped Metal Ar lowers. Most trades will need boot on your end, but for the right deal i may consider it on my end.

First off you have the base model 556R Gen 2. Upgrades include the Troy Quad rail. The Troy quad rail for the SIG 556 has been discontinued, so it can be hard to find. Also include is a low profile set of Sights by LPA. Sights are fully adjustable, and you have four different size apertures in the rear sight. Included you also get 15 magazines, 14 are standard 30 rounders and 1 is a 47 round magazine. To fill those magazines I also have 1500 rounds +/- One thousand rounds unopened and 500 or so loose in an ammo box. 
I'm asking 2,000 for the entire set up. I am not looking to separate because without the gun I don't need the mags or ammo, and vice versa. 
Price Breakdown
Sig 556R - 1100
1500 rounds of Wolf 7.62 - 375
Troy Rail - 300
LPA Sights - 100 
150 Magazines - 150
total is 2025 but 2000 is a nice, even number. 
 
Side note - If you are one of those people who asks whats the lowest or bottom dollar I will take you will be ignored. I am willing to entertain offers, but I don't negotiate from the bottom. If you try and offer me your bubba'ed Mosin and it's Archangel stock you'll also be ignored."

Additional features include an adjustable stock, adjustable cheek piece, vented fore-end, and swivel studs. The Model 12 Palma also utilizes Savage’s AccuTrigger system. This inclusion features a dual-stage trigger design in which the first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism. Once this occurs, the second trigger can be depressed in order to activate the firing pin – the trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The Savage 12 Palma rifle is a beautiful gun and a tremendous tool for long range precision.  The rifle has a 30"" stainless barrel, an overall length of 49.75"", and it is chambered in .308.  The rifle has an adjustable comb, adjustable length of pull (LOP), and an adjustable cheek riser.  It also comes equipped with an adjustable Accutrigger that may be adjusted from 1.5 lbs. to 6 lbs.  This rifle also comes with a Seekins Precision 1 piece rail affixed to the top of the rifle.  I purchased this rifle new from Savage in November of 2015 for just over $2,100, but with few opportunities to shoot, much less do any shooting at a reasonable distance, I've decided to sell the rifle to someone who may have an opportunity to enjoy it.  I have shot the rifle on one occasion at the range and loved it but I do not get enough opportunities to shoot at any distance.  This is the only use the rifle has seen and it is in perfect condition.  The rifle comes in its box with the manual and any items that came with the rifle.  Please contact me if you'd like to take a look in person.I am primarily interested in selling though I will consider select trades.  Glock 19s (Gen 3 or Gen 4) are of particular interest to me while I've listed a few other items that I may also have an interest in trading for below.  The price for any trades or trades plush cash shall be $1,300.  Aside from those items listed below, you are welcome to inquire, but I am likely not intereseeGlock 19 Gen 3 or Gen 4Select Over/Under 12 Ga.

It features hand lapped button rifling with a 1/8 twist rate and M4 feedramps. As with all BCM barrels it is proofed (HPT) and magnetic particle inspected (MPI).  To give the shooter the best accuracy this BCM SAM-R barrel has a service match heavy weight profile and a rifle length gas system. 410 stainless is a harder and more corrosion resistant than the conventional 416 stainless found in most barrels. Requires the use of the .750 gas block or front sight base.This is an ""open box"" part.  I personally installed it on a build then decided to go with a shorter barrel.  This barrel retails for over $300.  I have discounted it because technically it is not new, although you would never know!  If you'relooking for a longer and heavier barrel for your AR pick this up at a argain price."

Comes with all the original equipment, chargers, box, manuals, carrying bag, etc. which have never been removed out of their original packaging. This is great lightweight portable thermal. I would estimate it will pick up a hog or deer at 350 yards, but the further the distance it's sometimes hard to make out exactly what animal you are looking at, but you know there is an animal there because of the heat. The more you use it the easier it is to differentiate between the various animals.  Will consider Glock 19, Marlin 45/70 Guide Gun, 10/22 with cash added to them, Remington 700 bolt action rifle, 6.5 Creedmoor, RPR, Smith & Wesson revolver 44 Mag, Benelli SBE II 12 Gauge, Over/Under 12 Gauge, or any nice rifle or PVS 14 Night Vision Housing/Parts Kit.

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. Bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. Main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16x7 inches to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. Rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.         Beretta A96                            Caliber-Gauge .40 S&W   Specific Caliber .40 S&W   Finish Blue   Type Black Grip   Barrel Length 16.1   Capacity 10   Tactical Tactical   Made in the USA Made in the USA   Long Gun Web Model SUB-2000"
