Thanks for reading and I'm not really looking to sell for cash , mainly trades only 700 value seems far compared to what's selling on the browning A-bolts. Trust me new it was 1000 when we walked out of the store with nothing but the gun and a cardboard box it came in."

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

It is the 5.25 competition version. I have put about 1,000 rounds through the gun, and it still performs perfectly. I have made slight modifications that are totally reversible, if one desired. I have put Talon grips on it, which are great. I also did some paint work to make the lettering on the slide white. Again, these are totally reversible and don't interfere with the mechanics of the firearm. Included is the usual gear that comes with a XDm, including: paddle holster, mag pouch, interchangeable back straps, gun lock, etc. The one kicker is that since the law has changed in Colorado, I cannot include the magazines with the purchase. I can refer potential buyers to some local shops that have found ways around the magazine restrictions. For that reason, I am posting it <$200 below retail. Call, text, or email.JakeREDACTED"

It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder and exposed hammer. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a blued finish with wood grips. One grip is a darker shade than the other, something I didn't notice until I had them off and they were on the table side-by-side while I was cleaning the gun.This most intriguing aspect of this pistol is that it has areas with a black cherry color to them. This is most apparent under bright light, with the barrel and lug showing the most pronounced tone and the cylinder having a slightly black cherry tint.  There are many theories on why some of some blued guns take on that black cherry tint, because it also happens to brand-new never fired blued weapons. Some possibilities include the concentration of salts in the bluing process, alloy of the steel, parts of the gun being made in different batches at the S&W factory, subsequent rebluing, etc., but without knowing the entire chain of command and history of this gun is isn't possible to know the origin of the black cherry tinting on this pistol.This nearly fifty year old classic revolver is obviously used, but it is clean, nice for its age, and is a great little shooter at a good price. I have disclosed all I know about the gun in the interest of transparency, perhaps to the point of overstating the color issue. However, I want to ensure you have complete knowledge of all I know about this gun. I put fifty rounds of Winchester .38 Special manufactured ammo through it Thursday evening and it was accurate and fun to shoot. This will make a great carry conceal, recreational, range, shop, vehicle, or house gun.Please contact me for several additional pictures. Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

These guns preceded the 336, were made before micro-groove rifling (it has ballard rifling), and were only made a few years pre-war. They are collectible. Except this one.This gun has the receiver drilled and tapped. I am a collector, and that is a one-strike-and-out thing. Now, its virtues:Overall wear is good and honest! Bore is beautiful! Case hardening still visible on and under lever! This gun is chambered in the hard hitting ""32 Special"" (aka .32 Winchester Special). Lyman front sight with rear sight missing, but properly plugged with Williams blank.The receiver was professionally drilled; work performed by Bubba is nowhere to be found. Screw heads are nice all over. Nice, vintage Weaver see-through scope mounts and Tasco Pronghorn scope with good glass. Now, why one would put see-through mounts on a gun, then remove and plug the rear sight, eludes me.If the receiver had not been drilled and tapped, I'd be keeping this gun. It is that nice and honest. If you are looking for a level action deer rifle, this one would be hard to beat. Asking $349. Look at the quality of the current Marlin 336s, then see this gun. There will be no comparison.As a collector, let me know if you have an old gun you might want to trade. Worst I can say is, ""no, thanks anyway"". If it isn't more than 50 years old, I am not interested. Priority order of interest are lever actions then bolt actions, with Winchester leading the pack, or good number-matching military rifles.Thanks, and take care."

They not only sent me a brand-new gun of my choosing, they installed factory Glock MH3 night sights for me as a surprise upgrade (case shows GNS on the label.).This Glock has only been fired at a gun range and was never carried or holstered. It is in excellent condition, having only two boxes of fifty round factory ammunition through it. Not a single failure to feed or fire and the shots downrange were right on target. Once I was satisfied with its performance, I cleaned, lightly lubed the recommended areas inside the gun, and applied a fine coat of protection to the exterior of the gun before safely storing it in a protective gun-friendly environment.This Glock has a great feel to it, is extremely accurate, and would make an exceptional carry and conceal or home protection pistol. This Gen 4 Glock 26 comes with factory installed night sights, three 10-round magazines, Glock protective case, modular back straps, lock, brush, tools, and paperwork.The Glock 26 Gen4 9mm pistol introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""baby Glock""—the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."
