Great accuracy(for what it is), feeds fine, very manageable recoil despite its size, smooth trigger w/fairly long travel(purposely designed for safety since there's no traditional/manual safety), and very compact it's just not for me. I bought it used up at Scheel's because I always wanted a Kahr, but not a huge fan of .40 so I'm seeing what else catches my eye. Comes w/original box, papers, trigger lock/keys, supplied 6rd mag, and a Kahr brand 7rd mag. I also have 30rds of Winchester JHPs I'll throw in. I've ran less than 50rds through myself si it may still be in break-in period. Sale will be done legally at an FFL, preferrably M&M Pawnbrokers on Harrison in Davenport which benefits buyer too because transfer is only $10.70. If you want to shoot it before buying, I'm willing to do that depending on schedule and of course potential buyer will pay all expenses (range time fee, ammo, etc.).

I bought this with the intention of getting into Cowboy Action Shooting but i never seem to have the time. This gun has less then 75 rounds through it. There are 2 very minor marks on the stock from sitting in a rack during 1 of the 3 actual matches i made it to, I would put this gun between 85 to 90% probably closer to 90%. I will mention one note the safety has been modified on this gun it DOES work manually, but the pin has been shortened so it does not auto engage every time you break open and snap it shut. This can be easily fixed for less than $20.00 by installing a new pin which is very easy, but anyone who has shot Cowboy knows you want the auto safety disengaged to save alot of time. If you have any questions or would like to see it give me a call. I am somewhat flexible on the price but not much as this gun retails at $500 plus new. I would consider a partial trade for a basic Ruger 10/22 that is in good shape."

This pre-war combination rifle/shotgun has every feature they could put into a single firearm. Claw scope mounts, folding leaf rear sight, buffalo horn trigger guard, grip cap, and butt plate, cartridge trap in the stock, cross bolt lockup with double underbites, set trigger on the rifle barrel, cocking indicators, and a solid rib on the barrels. Bores are shiny with strong rifling in the bottom one. The shotgun barrel is 16 gauge and the rifle comes with a chamber cast that is marked 6.5 X 48R, which I believe is close to a 25-35. It has a small ""ding"" in the shotgun barrel just to the right of the front sight which you can see in one of the photos. The only visible crack in the wood is behind the lock on the left side and visible in the photo and doesn't extend from there. They engraved every available bit except the barrel tubes and spared no effort to make this a very ornate fine gun. It's been in my personal collection for many years. Drillings and other vintage firearms like this should be inspected by a qualified gunsmith before shooting and get his recommendation for suitable ammunition. If you have questions or would like additional photos please ask."

Gently used.
Material: Aluminum with black hardcoat.
 
The upper handguard is designed to be the lightest, lowest mounting railed upper handguard on the market. It mounts optics as low as possible, while still accepting all designs of mil-spec 1913 optic mounts. Uses 4 set screws (included) for fine adjustment, allowing it to retain sight zero, while still allowing for quick one-pin removal. The set screws can also be used to compensate for slightly crooked gas blocks, common on many rifles.
 
It is deliberately designed not to meet flush with lower, this allows for lighter weight, better ventilation of hot barrel, less chance of hand pressure affecting zero, and the ability to look better with any variety of lower handguards. Uses standard VZ58 takedown pin, plunger, and spring (all included) for proven quick takedown, with out the chance of pin popping past detent and becoming lost. This upper handguard comes already assembled and ready to mount.
