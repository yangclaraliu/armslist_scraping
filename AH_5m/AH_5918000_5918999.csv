Also this is a great gun for those that have problems with heavy recoil.   It is in 20 guage so recoil will be a lot less than a 12 gauge but it still has the power to get the job done. Barrel is also ported to help reduce recoil and improve a followup shot. Front sight is fiber optic and is highly visible.  Shotgun has two rails to mount whatever you want.  I would recommend a flashlight or even 2 lights to make targets very visible and also shine lights in faces to temporarily blind bad guys.If interested in paying $300 then contact me and include a phone number.  Offers of less than $300 will be added to ignore list.  Offers without phone numbers will be deleted. Thank for your interest and understanding. Please allow a couple days for a response.  Sale is for GA residents only.  Will not mail.  Will meet withing 30 mile radius of my residence.

Quick verification of depth setting eliminates slippage issues that can ruin parts. Designed to hold tolerances using a common hand-drill. A drill press is not required, the milling is done with a router. Pocket drilling requires 10 holes drilled once. Traditional jig requires 42 holes to be drilled once, precisely aligned and clamped, then re-drilled to a larger diameter. Trigger pocket can be cut in 6 to 11 passes versus 25 passes required with a drill press. Hand-drilling the trigger group/safety selector holes is faster to setup. The whole process can be completed in 1 hour instead of 3 hours with the old drill press method. Can be used to make dozens of lowers. All components are hard coat anodized for extra wear resistance.

Just tossing them in...If you look at the FDE frame, you'll see that I added my own touch to the gun. I added a manual slide stop. Nano's don't come with manual controls, so I modded the slide stop to be able to manually lock the slide back instead of having to use an empty mag (because that's really the only way a Nano's slide will lock back is on an empty mag). The included extra factory slide stop would be used if you wanted to use the black or pink frame. Or if you choose to, you can easily modify the black and/or pink frames to work with the modded slide stop. Also, the internal components have been polished for a smoother trigger pull.I do want to mention that this was my daily carry handgun so it does have some holster wear but is a great shooter and the laser is dead on! About 400 rounds or less through it.I am selling this complete package for $500. I paid about $700 for everything, so I'm taking a huge loss.The only trade I’m looking for is a Gen 4 Glock 19.Thanks for looking!"
