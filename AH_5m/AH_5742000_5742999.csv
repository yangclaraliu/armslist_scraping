This rifle has not been shot or used. The weapon includes a Leupold Mark 4 ER/T 6.5-20X tactical scope with locking elevation adjustment and the front-focal TMR (tactical milling reticle), which is secured to the weapon via three Leupold Mark 4 steel rings in a ""Euro"" configuration; this scope's reticle changes size based on magnification, allowing its graduations to be utilized as a metric range-finder; the scope also includes a detachable sunshade with its own flip-open cover. Also fitted with a Karl Nill AR-15 palm-shelf walnut grip with Rhomlas checkering - this is the same style of grip as the HK PSG-1 and made by the same manufacturer of the PSG-1 grip, and is pretty much the best grip that can be fitted to a sniper rifle - its base is also adjustable via screws on its sides; also included is the factory plastic grip and a green Hogue rubber grip. I had also experimented with some sling options and found that the Vicker's M240G sling, modified with 1.25"" HK-style snap hooks, is the best sling option for this rifle, especially when paired with the included ultra-rare matching Eagle Industries padded scope cover, which actually makes this weapon comfortable to carry without jabbing you in the back; I also include the Eagle Industries muzzle cover in case you want to use this system on a smaller rifle (the muzzle cover won't fit over the M95 brake). In addition to the above accessories, the rifle includes a total of five factory 5-round magazines, a factory monopod, and of course the standard Pelican case, cleaning kit, and manuals; I also made a ballistics chart and placed it in a luggage tag that can be tied to the scope or its mounts if desired."

The Super Modular Rail (SMR) MK8 M-LOK is Geissele’s bombproof, ultra-modular model which utilizes Magpul M-LOK technology
These rails are designed to give the user full modularity while maintaining a strong and rigid platform. Maximum venting at the lower 45° quadrants create maximum heat dissipation and also dramatically reduces the rail's overall weight. Utilizing Magpul's M-LOK technology at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, as well as the upper 45° quadrants
The SMR MK8 also features Geissele's proprietary 2"" long barrel nut. This increases the surface contact where the rail interfaces with the receiver and creates a platform that can be trusted to be straight and true the entire length of the free float rail. This increases accuracy and zero repeatability during disassembly and reassembly when performing maintenance.STRIKE INDUSTRIES:The SI Strike Rail was developed to fulfill the requirements of certain agency partners, who wanted a lightweight, but feature packed rail that they could depend on when entering harm’s way. In service of this mission, we bring to you, the new SI Strike Rail.  Lightweight, high strength, everything you need, and nothing you don’t.1.57” internal Diameter for suppressor compatibilityMagpul M-LOK compatibleAmbidextrous QD socket placementBuilt in anti rotation feature in railReinforced Steel Mounting Nut and Bolt"

I have (4)  Evil Roys for saleThey are all brand new, never used. Awesome targets, extremely well known!$230 ea. No discount if you want them all. I am keeping my used ones & just looking to get my money back on the ones that are still new because I am moving in a few months.I aslo have (1) Action Target ""PT Twist"" .22 caliber target for sale @ $40
These targets are handgun & rifle rated AR550 STEEL, so you can shoot them with any handgun, your AR’s, AK’s, hunting rifles, shotguns, whatever you want to. Super portable; we have customers that put several of these into the trunks of very small cars, so anyone can transport these to the range or out into the desert (see first video below). Steel has many advantages over paper such as: instantaneous audible & visual, positive feedback, knowing instantly if you are on target, no screwing around with flimsy stands, paper, staples, or tape, and no worries when shooting in windy conditions. These are heirloom quality steel targets. Pour as many thousands of rounds onto these as you want to, you will never wear these targets out.
Heads can be easily swapped out for over 25 other shapes, sizes, and configurations at any time. Height can be adjusted to both three & four feet high. Heads are angled to 20 degrees to dissipate the energy of the bullet & to direct splatter directly down to the ground. Unlike inferior steel targets, the shooting surface on these is completely smooth to avoid ricochets commonly found in other targets, that have bolt heads on the shooting surface.

This rifle is unique because it was stored by a collector in it's import state since the early 90's. I found this rifle at his estate sale and the family told me that he purchased the rifle during the early 90's and never got around to shooting it or even cleaning it. I have removed all of the cosmoline and have verified that all numbers are matching. This is a rare find these days as this rifle is in it's original form with matching numbers and has been kept by a collector since it's purchase. Everything is included from the bayonet which has never been attached to the original cleaning kit in the rear compartment. I am located in Edmond and looking for cash or trades.

This is the ""Wiley Clapp"" special edition, model number KSP-321X-NVK.  It's a Talo distributor exclusive model.  Differences between this and a standard SP101:
--- Really nice Novak dovetailed sights, which can be drifted to adjust.
--- The front sight has a bright brass bead.  The sight picture is easy to see compared to a standard SP.
--- The top strap of the gun is a solid slab of steel, not machined out for a sight groove like the regular SP.
--- The cylinder is tapered for easy holstering.
--- The grips have a nice wood inlay.--- The action and external surfaces are more nicely polished by Ruger.  No sharp edges along the trigger guard, etc. like on a standard SP101.
You can read a good review of the Wiley Clapp model here:  http://www.luckygunner.com/lounge/ruger-sp-101-the-shooters-snub-nose/
I have only put 150 rounds through this gun and it's truly a perfect specimen.  I mean, this is like an heirloom-quality gun.  The nicest SP101 I've ever seen or handled.  The barrel/cylinder gap is the tightest I've seen on a revolver made in the last few decades, but it doesn't drag on the barrel; my feeler gauges show a .003-.004"" gap.  The cylinder locks up totally tight with no shake at all, and the trigger is very, very smooth.  I have lightened it up further with a Wolff 10-pound hammer spring, and the full Wolff spring set is included with the gun, along with the stock 16-pound factory spring.
The 150 rounds I put through it showed it to be exceptionally accurate with .357 or .38 special.  From a sandbag rested position I was shooting <3” groups at 25 yards, but most of that variation was probably my lack of skills.
Gun comes with everything still in the box right down to the little yellow protective disk and all the plastic and manuals.  Also included is a nice, leather OWB holster and the Wolff spring kit.
Price is $600 cash, firm.  No trades.  Pick-up at my place in Southwest Lincoln most evenings and weekends.  Buyer will need to show everything required by law: valid NE purchase permit and ID, or NE CHP permit.
