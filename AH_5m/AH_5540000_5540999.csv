This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle.

This rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide."

Year of manufacture is hard to determine because the stamping on the Rifle is not complete. Only the tops of the numbers show so the best that I can tell is that it could be 1940, 1942, 1943, 1946, 1948, or 1949. I purchased this Rifle from Joe’s Sporting Goods about 8 years ago before they went out of business. This is a surplus Rifle and shows typical wear indicative of these types of Rifles with dings, dents, scratches etc. However this one does appear to have fared a little bit better than others. The bore is nice and bright and appears to be perfectly fine. I have fired about a dozen or so rounds through this Rifle and it operated perfectly fine. Overall for a surplus Rifle I would say that this is one of the better ones but it is not perfect. *Please note that I will only sell through a reputable FFL with a license number that I can verify. I prefer to sell Face to Face however I will ship Firearms and sell outside of the State of Washington.

The best I can tell all the serial numbers match including the receiver, bolt and the bayonet mount. I could not see any other serial numbers on any other parts of the rifle. About 8 years ago I purchased this Rifle at Joe’s sporting goods before they went out of business. This is a surplus Rifle and shows typical wear indicative of these types of Rifles with dings, dents, scratches etc. This Rifle is marked GF (Grenade Firing) and at some point in time a bolt was put through the stock to strengthen it to fire grenades. These Rifles would usually have coper wrapped around the stock however this ones coper is gone and you can see the imprints and marks from where the coper used to be. The bore looks pretty good it is a slightly dull and not super bright. I have fired this Rifle and it operated very well and was surprisingly accurate despite how the bore looks. I also have a Bayonet that I am selling with this Rifle. This is the correct Bayonet for this Rifle and snaps right on the end of the Rifle with no problem. Overall I would say that the Bayonet is in very nice condition and I have not cleaned it so I have not taken away any of its original patina. The blade appears to have never been sharpened and there are 5 nicks in the blade that are most likely from combat use. It has the original Scabbard that is in great condition as well. *Please note that I will only sell through a reputable FFL with a license number that I can verify. I prefer to sell Face to Face however I will ship Firearms and sell outside of the State of Washington. This will cost an additional $80 and that covers Shipping, paper work done by my FFL and the Sales Tax Washington State charges.

I've seen converted Saiga 12 sell for well over 1,500 -2,500 with less accessories than mine. I know I'd be able to get more money if k auctioned them on Gunbroker but I am pressed for time. The only reason I'm selling them is to get out to Florida to see my family and I was hoping to already be there by now. I've made the unfavorable decision of cheap selling both my Molot Vepr 12 and my Saiga 12 in effort to sell FAST. I do ask for a bill of sale and I refuse to sell without completing one. If you have an many questions please feel free to ask and I will sell them separately for not much more. I just really need to see my grandfather who is ill to spend as much time as I can with him while he's still here. Thank you and God bless.  Saiga 12:The conversion and all work has done by my local gunsmith. I've got factory 5 round mag, the SGM tactical 12 round mag, and the MD Arms 20 round drum. I've added the SGM Tactical quad rail with 5 position folding vertical grip but I do have the factory forearm as well. It has a Magpul MOE AK pistol grip, Tapco collapsible butt stock, Tapco trigger, and the bushnell TRS-25 red dot optic. I haven't done anything to my Molot Vepr 12 because it is such a quality well built shotgun out of the box. I did buy the SGM 12 round magazine and I have the factory mag as well. I both shotguns brand new so I have the original boxes they came along with every thing that came in the box like tools books stuff like that. I always clean and oil them regularly and they look brand new still. In fact the spring on both is still not broken in yet so it's better for High brass shells but It will cycle Federal Low brass birdshot for skeet shooting just fine and that's all I have ever used it for."

7.62x39mm ammunition.
750 rounds of Olympic FMJ, Boxer Primed.  5-30 round boxes and 6 bags of 100 rounds, loose.
Look up the M67 Projectile it has aboard.
You're getting the equivalent of Yugoslavian ammunition with a noncorrosive primer and reloadable case.
$50 per 100 rounds.
This is non magnetic, non corrosive, and is good for indoor ranges, or for those who would like a reloadable brass casing.  Or, if you want a good defensive round that isn't corrosive like the Yugoslavian stuff.  At 50 cents a shot you're getting a bargain.

This one will be hard. Only 40 rounds thru this amazing AR10. Wilson builds this specifically for 1000 yard competitions, and that is where I was headed with it. Never made it. It is FDE in color, and all small parts plus barrel are black. Gorgeous rifle. I have 10 round and 20 round mags depending on what is legal in your area. Only extra option I bought was Wilson's excellent BUIS. These sights are some of the nicest iron sight I have ever seen. New price was just over $3200. And as I said, 40 rounds only. There is one irritating thing about selling a brand new rifle like this. And it is the shooting bench I used at a range had a piece of metal sticking up on the edge I did not see, and there is a very light 1/2"" scratch just forward of ejection port(tried to show in 2nd pic). I have never been one to worry about that, as it is a rifle, and it is supposed to get used. But if you are one that is worried about that, be aware it is there. Wilson told me they would recoat the upper for free, but I just don't care about it enough. I do have Wilson rifle case, paperwork, and dog tags. ****Light, tripod, sling, sling attach point, scope, and mount not included, but I will sell them. Vortex Viper 6-24 PST, Vortex mount, Atlas tripod, Vickers Tactical sling, Wilson QD fwd sling attach point, and Wilson/Streamlight weapon light. All also brand new. Open to trade for a smaller, cheap, economical car. No junk. I can pay any possible difference, or I have other firearms and ammo I can include.  Thanks for looking!"

Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.- See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-mod-2-3-sub-compact-40sw/#sthash.A32daSmC.dpuf"
