The Makarov was Mother Russia's premier sidearm and police issued pistol from 1951 all the way up until 1991. Although with its short stature and only 8 round capacity magazines, this little pistol has definitely been put throuth the ringers. The accuracy of this pistol is exceptional due to the fixed barrel attached to the frame. The Makarov is similar in design to the Walther PPK and the CZ82/83, as they are straight blowback actions. According to the serial number, this pistol was produced in 1988.Specs:- Length: 6.36""- Height: 4.49- Width: 1.16- Barrel Length: 3.6""This pistol was a surplus buy that was covered in cosmoline. Now, it is cosmo free and functions flawlessly! This Makarov comes with a black leather holster, bakelite and black range grip, cleaning rod, and service manual. This is an all matching numbers pistol with two matching numbers magazines. These pistols are becoming harder and harder to find, especially in like new condition. Some websites are selling these pistols still covered in cosmoline, without the extra goodies, and only one magazine for more money. Asking $350.

Fantastic pistol; one of the most accurate I’ve ever fired. Only selling because my arthritic hands have a little trouble gripping/racking the slide, due to the CZ-inspired slide-inside-frame design (the only reason I sold all my beloved CZs). This design wasn’t a problem for me ten years ago, but age and arthritis have won out. I can still rack the slide, so don’t “need” to sell it, but it requires more effort than it should, so...

Absolutely no exceptions. Sorry, some douche tried to scam me on this gun once already and I have no time for such shmuckery. The gun is also on Gunbroker.

Got a 1942 Mosin Nagant, with all matching numbers and a spliced stock (pretty rare). This rifle shoots great, and is extremely accurate. However... It is painted and has a kill count carved into the stock (I did this), as it was my hunting rifle in Alaska. The paint will come off easy with some paint stripper on the metal and some sand paper to the wood.  Planned on stripping it down and restaining and cleaning it up, but I have too many projects going on as is. So $150 takes it. Come as you see, with a round sheath, and a custom made cheek rest that makes for a great and truly consistent sight picture. Rifle is badass, just can't shoot it enough or give it the make over it deserves right now. Text me REDACTED. MUST PICK UP IN FAYETTEVILLE"

This barrel was produced by a high-end firearms manufacture as part of a limited production run and will most likely not be produced again for a long time, nor will be made available again for purchase on the commercial civilian market.

This is a Yugo captured German 98k. The rifle sits in a laminated stock with metal cup buttplate.  The barrel, receiver and stock (forced match) share the same serial number. The bolt does not match, but matches itself. The prior owner had the headspace checked and I have personally fired this rifle, no problems. The barrel receiver, triggerguard, and stock parts have a deep rich bluing. The bolt has a worn patina look to it.  The stock has an area on the right side that looks to be staining (blood?) that dripped as the rifle laid flat. The is also wooden pins on the right side near the trigger guard area that looks like a lamination repair. The bore has shine and is in very goof condition, muzzle is tight. I am asking $325 that will include a 70 rd bandoleer of Turkish mauser ammo or 60 rds of Greek 8mm ammo, Your choice. Or $350 if you want both qty. of ammo (130 rds). Pickup will be in Gilbert (Sportsman's Warehouse works for me), or in Tempe during the week (lunch hour).

This one is one of my favorites. The 300 blackout chambering offers superior ballistics in a compact package, making for a great trunk gun, backpacking gun, home defense, etc. Basically, it hits like an AK but pops more like a 9mm, which is why these guns run great supressed. Blackout ammo prices keep falling (found some for about 40 cents/round the other day) and people are saying that the 5.56 may go the way of the dinosaur. I doubt that, but still, this is a fantastic chambering to have in your AR. One of the best things about it is that the only difference is the barrel, so if you do just a simple, easy, quick barrel swap (it takes about 15-20 min with an armorers wrench) you can go back and forth between 300 blackout and 5.56/.223. The magazines, the bolt, everything else is the same. It shoots very nice and is easy to become proficient at, especially with the single point sling. I've dropped the price to the rock bottom so this is priced to sell and I don't expect it to last long. Comes with a magazine and 30 rds of ammo and there's more I can sell you if you want. You can't buy or build an AR this nice for this price anywhere.

Text is best: REDACTED - Ben
This is legally considered a hangun because of the short barrel and lack of stock, but it appeals more to usage as a carbine-replacement or a sub-gun so I'm listing it as a rifle."
