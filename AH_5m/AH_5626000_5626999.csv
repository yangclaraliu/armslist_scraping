UTG 200 Lumen Long Range Spot Focus LED flashlight with build in QD mount.  Has 5 functions (H, M, L, Strobe, SOS).  Sells on Amazon for $60 with great reviews.  Very nice light.Grip pod forward grip with rapidly deploying bipod that shoots out of the bottom at the push of a button.  No markings of a brand on the pod.  Id guess a value around $40Fake suppressor, threads on to a 1/2x28 (most 223/556/22LR) threaded barrels.  It comes back over the barrel and imitates a shorter barrel with a suppressor, pretty cool looking. These are typically around $40Total value of these items is around $255, I'll sell them for about half price at $125 for everything.  Will also consider trades."

Built around Beretta® PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm™ Semi-Auto Pistol delivers rapid shots with precise accuracy due to its ergonomic design and unique action. The PX4 utilizes a rotating barrel locking system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. The corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame comes with 3 interchangeable backstraps to obtain a proper fit according to the individual shooter's hand. Non-slip texturing on the grip also aids in weapon control. An integral Picatinny rail provides rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The PX4 Storm is a double/single action semi-automatic pistol with an external hammer. The ambidextrous safety doubles as a decocking lever. The slide features a Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating for superior corrosion and wear resistant finish, while forward and rear serrations provides a non-slip hold on the slide when loading and unloading the weapon. White, 3-dot sights provide quick sight acquisition in varied lighting. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. The Beretta PX4 Storm Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips quickly without tools into 5 subcomponents for cleaning and maintenance.- Modular, ergonomic design- Rotating barrel locking system for reduced recoil and muzzle rise- Fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame- Non-slip textured grip- Integral Picatinny rail- Ambidextrous safety/decocking lever- Bruniton non-reflective coating- Fieldstrips quickly without tools- Barrel length: 4 inches - Caliber: 9mm - Magazine: 17 + 1- Overall height: 5.51 inches - Overall length: 7.68 inches - Overall width: 1.42 inchesWill trade for:Open to FNS, Springfield, Glock, others.

The gun has no more then 150 Rounds through it, I bough it brand new less than 2 years ago. It comes with all the original accessories, the backstraps, 3 mags, cleaning rod ect. I'm also including a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster. There are some wear marks on the slide from holstering and unholsering but that's to be expected and they aren't that bad. I was originally planning on making this my everyday carry but after inhereting a Walther P99 and buying a compact 9mm I really have no use for the Glock anymore. If I'd have know when I bought it I was going to eventually get a compact 9 I would have bought the full size Glock 40 instead.This pistol is extrememly accurate, I took my concealed carry test with it after only have run about 50 rounds through it previously and I shot the best in the class. It is a fantastic firearm for concealed carry with a lot of firepower at 13 +1 rounds of 40 cal. I'm asking $450. Give me a text at REDACTED and thanks for your interest."

I bought this 90% completed with the intentions of finishing it off. It will require an ejector, and ejector rod. As result, gun is being sold AS-IS. At first I found the parts were a little hard to come by, but recently have found out that the stainless steel version, the Rossi 851 is the same gun. So if you can live with stainless parts on a blued gun, then spare parts are available to complete this. I will include two freebies, a Metro RH thumb break holster for 4in revolvers, and a brand new pair of Rossi rubber grips. For less than $30 you can get the parts online and turn this into a inexpensive working truck gun, or whatever. As such, am asking only what I have into it, $100, FTF in Brighton.

I absolutely love the gun but I'm going to be moving and looking to downsize. If I don't sell it then I'll gladly hold onto it though.
