The M&P Pro C.O.R.E. models come with factory suppressor-height sights, a factory cut & drilled slide for mounting an optic, 5 factory slide adapter plates, 3 factory stippled grip backstraps (S, M, L), and 2 factory 17-round magazines. This gun also sports an Apex Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit, installed by a licensed gunsmith. The stock trigger is also included along with the factory case and papers.It has about 800 rounds down the pipe. It has no major cosmetic blemishes, although there is normal wear where you would expect it (namely, on the barrel hood). There is one small, fine scratch on the left side of the frame near the slide stop lever, but you'll hardly notice it. I am the original owner and have taken great care of it. It is ergonomic, accurate, fun to shoot, and a fantastic suppressor host.Depending upon the trade, I have extras to balance out the difference in value:- Factory threaded barrel (1/2""-28 TPI, 1:10 twist) with thread protector (about 500 rds through it)- Wolff extra-power spring set and guide rod. The extra-power springs are 17#, 19#, 20#, 22#, and 24#, and there are 3 standard-power (5#) striker springs included. An extra-power spring helps counteract the back-pressure generated by the suppressor and helps extend the dwell time (barrel/slide lock-up), which aids in suppression.- 4 additional factory 17-rd mags (3 are still new in package, 1 is an older-gen mag that works great)- 2 BLACKHAWK! SERPA CQC matte black right-handed retention holsters, including 2 paddle attachments, 2 belt loop attachments, and 1 S.T.R.I.K.E. plate attachment for MOLLE gear (not pictured)I'm in the Mountlake Terrace area and can travel (within reason) depending upon the trade.

It is still in the original 30-40 Krag caliber. Whoever sporterized it did a very professional job. Not Bubba'd in any way. The barrel was shortened, stock cut down and it has a redfield front sight and I believe Ruger 10/22 folding rear sight installed. The stock has a few very slight dings in it but nothing bad. Bolt is smooth as butter and the trigger is light and crisp. The only negatives are 2 spots of minor rust on the bolt (which I'm going to remove soon) and a spot of very very light pitting in the bore. Not bad enough to affect accuracy though. All in all it is a very good rifle. Gander mountain quoted me about $1100 for it. I have about 10 rounds to go with it. I will ship. Shipping is $35.

The QDC compatible Flash Hider will mount any of the KAC 7.62mm QDC suppressors. The SR-30 has 99% parts compatibility with the SR-15, requiring only a dedicated barrel and muzzle device. Seamlessly transition from subsonic ammunition to supersonic with nothing more than a change of the magazine.  E3 Enhanced Bolt  The E3 Enhanced Bolt from Knight’s Armament features a number of components designed to make this bolt the most durable and reliable bolt available. It is a proprietary bolt specifically designed for our SR15 and 16 models. The E3 Bolt boasts several features that add to the its overall performance such as the enlarged bolt face, rounded lugs, reduced cam pin, and proprietary extractor and firing pin designs. This E3 Bolt is manufactured with an enlarged bolt face that provides more positive engagement in the chamber and lugs which are rounded to help to reduce chipping, cracking and snapping. This strengthened design helps to increase the life of the bolt and ensure a proper seating each time the weapon cycles. The E3 Bolt’s extractor design is also a unique achievement that helps to provide an extremely reliable component. It’s shaped like a rounded ‘T’ and sometimes referred to as a ‘butterfly’ shape. The pivot point of the extractor is shifted forward to help balance out the extractor and apply constant pressure on the shell which reduces cases of extraction failures. Another strong feature of the unique design of this extractor is the use of two full size extractor springs, as opposed to the standard micro spring. This allows for a reduction of relative compression while the extractor is in motion and provides a failsafe in case one spring fails. The bolt will continue to function properly and afford a user the opportunity to continue with their mission or firing schedule. The E3 Bolt is designed with a thinner Cam Pin and Firing Pin whose overall size has been reduced. The thinner Cam Pin allows for a thicker bolt web which is a common failure point in normal bolts. The reduction of the Firing Pin size is to accommodate the thinner Cam Pin. The full capabilities of the E3 Bolt are realized when exposed to full auto or extremely high cyclic firing rates yet the bolt performs gracefully under casual firing conditions. This component was designed to be exposed to the most stressful and unrelenting conditions and exceed expectations for durability and service life.  Ambidextrous Controls  Knight’s Armament designed this system to give shooters the maximum amount of options in their controls. Under this design all of the weapon’s major controls can be accessed from either side of the lower receiver. Left-handed shooters see the immediate benefits of being able to access the weapon’s controls in a more intuitive manner; however, there are a number of other benefits that right-handed shooters will enjoy under this system.   Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-side bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon’s controls from the non-operating side. KAC has also introduced modifications to the design such as the scalloped safety selector switch. This allows a lower profile for the selector switch on the non-operating side of the receiver which helps to relieve any interference between the switch and a shooter’s glove or hand. For the maximum amount of configuration and operation options, Knight’s Ambidextrous Controls offer a sure solution.    Two-Stage Match Trigger  All of the weapons available from Knight’s Armament come equipped with a 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance The first stage is a ‘no-poundage’ stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle. Our 2-stage trigger is meant to inform a shooter of exactly where their weapon is going to fire. This bolsters a firer’s confidence and can also assist in reducing trigger jerk, thereby increasing accuracy. The 4.5lb 2-Stage Trigger from Knight’s Armament is a highly calibrated and smooth component that is sure to be a welcome addition to any setup.  Quick Detach Coupler  The Quick Detach Coupler (QDC) line of Sound Suppressors and Muzzle Devices are proprietary items designed for secure interoperability. The coupling device itself consists of multiple ball bearings arrayed in a circular pattern which fit into sockets specifically machined into various muzzle devices to accept the QDC. The bearings are aligned with the sockets by way of a V-shaped notch that seats the device onto an index pin. Once aligned, a simple twist of the outer retaining ring locks the device securely into place.   This system was developed to provide fast and easy operation and interoperability between weapons and suppressors. Knight's QDC line of sound suppressors all feature this method of attachment. Various muzzle devices, such as the QDC Flash Suppressors and the MAMS muzzle break, also feature the QDC pockets to accept sound suppressors equipped with this coupling device. Secure interoperability and intelligent, efficient design are the intended goals of this quick and easy technology.   300 Blackout   300 Blackout is the high powered, 7.62x35mm ammunition developed by Advanced Armament Corporation which exhibits exemplary performance while suppressed. This compact .30 caliber round was developed with several requirements in mind, which included utilizing certain preexisting AR15 hardware, such as an unmodified AR15-style bolt, DI Gas System, and unmodified 30-round magazines; be able to meet or exceed the muzzle energy seen in 7.62x39mm rounds fired from an AK47; and cycle reliably when fired suppressed or unsuppressed, and super or subsonic. The resulting lightweight round is an efficient, high-mass projectile that uses less powder than a standard 5.56 round yet is able to more effectively penetrate barriers. Knight’s Armament Company has developed several new products that take advantage of this technology and combine it with the unsurpassed legacy of KAC engineering and manufacturing.  URX 4  The URX 4 is a continuous top-rail system that utilizes the Keymod mounting brackets developed by Vltor and Noveske. This rail system is built stronger and more stable than previous designs due to the absence of a removable bottom rail. The modular layout allows an end user to fully customize exactly where to place accessories without the use of specialized tools, small parts, or additional forces applied to the barrel. The URX 4 is currently available for 5.56 rifles in 8.5”, 10”, 13”, and 14.5” lengths, and is equipped with Knight’s unique IBN mounting configuration. The idea was to create a more modular, and thus more serviceable, rail system that still maintains its strength and stiffness. Th IBN system torques the rail onto the weapon and allows the rail to act as the barrel nut. This design was developed to increase stabilization and provide a simpler solution that requires less specialized tools to install and maintain. A full array of modular accessories, iron sights, and panel kits utilizing the Keymod mounting brackets have been developed specifically to accompany this rail system. With the introduction of the URX 4, Knight’s Armament Co. demonstrates its continuing determination to intelligently design effective products.

Includes:  Rear Flip-up iron sight Quad Rail SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace 10 round magazine Rail Covers Buffer Tube Pad  THE BENEFITS OF NP3® PLUS EXTREMELY CORROSION RESISTANT: A 1mil (.001) thick coating of can withstand a salt spray corrosion test of 1000+ hours per ASTM B-117 SELF-LUBRICATING: PTFE is deposited throughout the coating so for most firearms no additional lubrication is needed after initial break-in. ACCURATE PLATING THICKNESS: Coating thickness can be predetermined for nominal tolerance to suit your weapon system. VERY ABRASION RESISTANT: NP3® Plus is a very hard, abrasion-resistant coating with an as-plated hardness of Rc 35-50. In certain applications it can be heat treated to Rc 68-70 EASY TO CLEAN: NP3® Plus is easy to clean; in most cases wiping with a rag will suffice (We do NOT plate the inside of barrels; these need to be cleaned conventionally). LONGER FIRING PERIODS: NP3® Plus allows for longer firing cycles as the dry, self-lubricating PTFE-rich surface makes it harder for powder residue and debris to adhere to surfaces SERVICE LIFE IS EXTENDED: NP3® Plus has a high lubricity and low coefficient of friction; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to less frictional wear. NO COROSSION MIGRATION: In cases where the coating is damaged and perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating. EASY TO REPLATE: NP3® Plus is chemically strippable and can be re-plated without any damage to the substrate. Weapons subject to heavy use can be refurbished to as-new condition. The application of NP3® PLUS is auto catalytic, which means that the plating process does not require electricity. The auto catalytic process is preferable to standard electrolytic plating as all active surfaces are evenly plated, which is not the case with electrolytically deposited coatings. NP3® PLUS is a true composite coating. Sub micron particles of PTFE are co-deposited in the nickel matrix. As wear occurs, fresh particles of PTFE are exposed, maintaining the lubricating qualities of the coating. NP3® Plus gains its superior corrosion resistance by a process of Duplex Coating – the inclusion of a very corrosion resistant undercoating working in harmony with the nickel / PTFE plating process giving a coating of outstanding corrosion resistance.  Will consider Trades"

Comes in the Browning factory-fitted leather box, with leather reinforced corners, faux inside fur, flipup luggage locks, and brass feet for when it stands handle up. I was expecting a full complement of chokes for it and there is a big compartment in the box for them, but all you get here is what is sitting on the barrels: two long Browning goldtipped Skeet choke tubes for both 410 and 20g, and only one of the said Browning Sk choke tubes for the top barrel of the 28g set, although the bottom barrel is also threaded for chokes. Some of the choke tubes have tiny dings at their muzzles, but nothing serious. All three double barrels are perfectly matched and numbered to the receiver and the forearm, and fashioned to give similar sight picture and weight for near-identical swing feel, no matter which caliber is being fired. It features the single trigger that fires the top barrel first and readies the other firing pin, and if you don't fire the lower barrel the ejector only kicks out the upper empty. It was owned by an old skeet guy with too many guns, but he did shoot this one once in a while. It looks like his favorite caliber in this set was the 20g, as that barrel seems to be the one that's the farthest from looking unfired here. I didn't say it had the most wear because it barely shows any wear! Examining all 3 barrel sets, though, it is striking how little wear they have. You will find a tiny scratch or nick on a vent rib or the side of a barrel, but the only scratches worth mentioning here are the small ones right at the muzzle of the 20g set, about 1/16"" long or less, on both sides of the top and bottom barrels, maybe from a brief rub on asphalt possibly, but hard to notice unless you look for them. The forearm looks wonderful too, from the same gorgeous chunk of walnut that the receiver is mounted in, and of course with the same soft satin finish as the stock. The only flaw to mention on it is that the front edge of the schnabel-style curve has some very minor little dings that pepper the edge line and blunt it a bit- very minor but if I fail to mention it somebody will bitch about it for sure. Lastly, the stock looks similarly wonderful, but is also not entirely flawless. The metal there looks wonderful, no flaws or nicks to report on it, but the beautiful wood does have a few minor scratches and rubs from light field use. The low-cut, hand-checkered diamonds all look mostly as they came from Miroku, but you'll see they have very minor point rounding in places, again from low to moderate field usage. Looking closely at that region, the only real wear showing is at the pointed forward edge of the pistol grip- very minor rounding of the edge there. Moving rearward, the left has a very shallow 2-inch long minor crease near the first cheek support , but little else to mention on that side. Moving to the right side, about the same length crease is there, but farther back, along with a few tiny marks scattered around, but again nothing to arouse any alarm or ire, just minimal, honest wear that can easily be corrected if necessary. The cheek rest looks to be adjustable up and down, and the recoil pad is hard rubber mounted on an ingenious internal recoil-reducing part that slides into the stock and compresses against a strong spring to blunt and prolong the sensation, for a big reduction to the shoulder. In addition, the 20g barrels are both ported, for a further reduction in muzzle rise. An extremely beautiful and functional piece of shootable art, no less, so belly up and bid! The distance from the front of the trigger to the extended butt plate is almost 15 inches. The owner had a piece of what looks like black naugahide stuck to the entire cheekpiece upper surface, and a bit of that is starting to curl up on the left side bottom edge.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed steel front sight, picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

This is an excellent pistol that has been very reliable and a joy to shoot and maintain. The P320c is also able to be converted into many different configurations and is a modular platform. I purchased this pistol in March of this year, and have since run about 700 rounds through it with no issue at all; It is technically just past the ""break in"" stage of 500 rounds. This pistol has been awesomeand reliable for me.I have also purchased about $120 in easily updated parts. This is important because some of the P320c's that are out there do not have all of the updated parts in them. In late 2015 Sig changed the design of 3 small parts; they are as follows.1. Flat Takedown lever (installed)2. Forward slide release (installed)3. The Adverse trigger which prevents debree from entering trigger (installed)(Total $77)There is also a brand new sealed slide release which is another $33 plus shipping from Sig.I also purchased a brand new grip module in order for it to be completly updated. The good news about this pistol is that all of the parts are easily changed; so that old parts are still included and you can swap them out and try what you like. I myself prefer the old trigger so it is nice to have options, this pistol really does it all!The pistol will include all the new and old parts, along with the factory case, lock, outside the waistband holster, manual and gun grease. This pistol has been extensivley cleaned by myself also. I was using this as a carry gun and home defense gun so it was maintaine very carefully. Overall the pistol is in great condition. I will mention again that this pistol also has night sights so that is an upgrade you will not have to make. To conclude I wish I did not have to sell this gun but I am working on another project right now and also have another one that I use. With all the parts added up which are included I have spend over $670 on the platform. I am looking to be fair and make a quick sale, so am pricing this at $520 with the extra parts. This also insures that you get one with the most recent parts, as most dealers are still selling ones with combinations of the old parts and updated ones can be hard to find.  The price is also firm! This is a great way to get a good deal shipping and tax free. I prefer to meet F2F in the Grand Rapids area at an FFL to make things easier with a pistol transfer since it is Michigan and there really isn't a ""private sale"" due to our pistol registration laws. I am a CPL holder so everything is okay on my end. If we meet F2F in a private sale then I will only sell to someone with a CPL because it cut's down on paperwork. If you are interested please email the listing.Thanks!"

Featuring the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2 .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3"" barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XDs, the Mod.2 Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone ergonomics set the XD Mod.2 apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2 Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry.
