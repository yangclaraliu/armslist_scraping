176,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5616176,For Sale/Trade:  Franklin Armory BFS Trigger,"Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 350,"Listed On: Sunday, June 26, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Note: The bases finish is purely cosmetic and does not affect balance or function of the trigger.This is a pull and release trigger from Franklin armory. I purchased this trigger to plink with my cmmg conversion bolt, hoewver due to the hammers size it will not hit home on the firing pin. It functions great with a standard bolt carrier, but for my purpose of one trigger for multiple bolt swaps it is just not there. Any standard bolt is fine, but the cmmg has a slightly smaller hammer gap. The reason for the thickness to these triggers for its safety disconnector. When one makes too rapid of shots it keeps the trigger from following the bolt. When this occurs just switch it back to semi and it will release the disconnector. By ATF ruling this is not a machine gun. The trigger is stated to have two seperate functions the ""pull"" and the ""release."" this trigger comes with everything that was sent; original packaging and all. The raised base is to be ground to meet perfectly to one's lower. If it sits too low, they come with peel away shims to raise it to meet any receiver tolerance. For myself I did as directed and gradually remove light layers until the trigger roll pins slid into place. The trigger has been tested for full functionality with sixty rounds and functioned as it was intended. The safety disconnector operated as it should without an issue. There are quite a few videos of this trigger in action. Certain setups will run better than others.
I will ship the trigger, but payment must be through PayPal $6 is needed for shipping."

The honest reason I'm selling this Norinco is because I'd like to put the money towards a Yugoslavian SKS because I appreciate the Yugo's a bit more than the Chinese versions. That's not to say this particular example isn't a good one, it's just not my taste. The stock condition on this rifle is excellent. With that being said, this stock isn't the one that came with the rifle, but it's still a Chinese stock. I acquired the stock in the pictures from LibertyTreeCollectors. With this sale I'm including the original stock that came with the rifle. It's been hastily refinished in attempt to try something different, but the result wasn't exactly what I expected. Maybe you can do a better job than I did. The metal on this rifle lacks a bit of bluing, and it gets a bit faded near the forend of the rifle. I duracoated the rear of the rifle (receiver, dust cover, and rear of the barrel) in a matte black finish. Other than that, the metal looks great with the exception of very minor surface rust on the butt plate and gas tube. Keep in mind these don't impede the function of the rifle. I've only fired 40 rounds through this rifle, and the bore, I would consider excellent condition, extremely shiny with strong grooves. Like I said, I'm including the stock that came with the rifle if you'd like it. $400 firm, in the Brandon area.

The original plastic butt pad is included as well. It is a Model 235, made somewhere between 1912 and 1915, since they don't have specific dates for these guns at that age (due to Stevens having a factory fire, if I remember correctly).

The M9 Semiautomatic is a 9x19mm Parabellum pistol that was adopted in 1985 as the ofﬁcial sidearm of the United States military after winning a competition in the 1980s, beating out many other contenders. The 92F survived exposure to temperatures from -40°F to 140°F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds, the equivalent to ﬁve or six times the pistol’s service life. It ofﬁcially entered service in 1990. The Chiappa M9-22 is a replica of the US Military sidearm chambered in .22 rimﬁre.

I sold off my .45 a while back, so I can't use it. This stuff is top notch, burns clean, and I've never had a FTF or FTE with Freedom Munitions reman rounds. The brass brand is the only difference in rounds. All large primer, all reloadable. I bought it before ammo came back down. It will cost you the same right now on the Freedom Munitions site (their shipping factored in).$125 PRICE IS FIRM. WILL NOT SHIP. YOU DRIVE TO ME.I will entertain trading straight across 500 rounds of BRASS cased .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO 55gr or heavier. Will only consider new or professionally remanufactured. Not interested in anything you reloaded yourself."
