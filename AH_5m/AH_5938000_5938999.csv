Would like to stay at $250 cash on a gen 3 plus a lot of 1,700 rounds in 380acp, 38spl, 357mag, 9mm, 40s&w and 45acp but mostly 40s&w and 9mm (about 1,000 in 9mm and 40s&w JHP alone), was going to have it destroyed because I want the extra space and never get the range time to use it so it would come sorted by caliber and if its JHP or FMJ (just keeping a box or two for myself). All laws will be followed. Thanks."

If I buy a bunch of hot rod, badass parts from 20 different manufacturers and have Joe blow down at the local gun shop slap it all together, I've got an awesome gun that I will probably lose my ass on if I try and sell it. This is the unfortunate reality of the situation. There is nothing wrong with the gun, but most people want a factory weapon.

A uniquely designed action with balanced sear - plus inertia firing pin - prevents discharge unless the action is completely closed and the trigger is squeezed and released after each slot. The large, side-ejection port stays unobstructed when shooting over walls, car hoods, and other barriers; the blaze orange magazine follower also permits quick, safe inspection of the chamber and magazine. This positive, cross-bolt safety is conveniently located near the trigger for fast operation, even while wearing gloves. A recoil pad on the wood and synthetic stock models permit greater control by eliminating slippage while firing. The grooved, steel-lined fore-end provides a better grip, and sling swivel studs are standard on all 870s. The 870 features a bottom-loading, side ejecting receiver, tubular magazine under the barrel, dual action bars, internal hammer, and a bolt which locks into an extension in the barrel.12 guage 4 + 1WILL SHIP ANYWHERE BUYER PAYS COSTSCC ADD 3%M/C VISA DISCOVER AMEXDEALER TRANSACTION, NICS CHECK & OHIO SALES TAXANY QUESTIONS CALL REDACTEDPOWELL OHIO REDACTED"

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge
North American Arms' .22 Magnum can be used with all popular .22 Magnum ammunition, including .22 Magnum shot shells (called Snake Shot by some manufacturers).
This only one gun with 3 sets of grips, pics show each installed on the same gun.  They are the factory black rubber grips, custom machined pewter grips which make it feel weighted a little better, and a holster grip which also has a belt clip. I’ll even throw in a box of .22 mag ammo.
Gun is in great condition, shot very little. Great little pocket pistol.
