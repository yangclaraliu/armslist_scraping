At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days Personal Protection Made Easy The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue. Easy to Use and Maintain The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

Manufactured in the late 70's, my brother carried this revolver during the late 80's - early 90's while on duty as a Police Officer. When he retired from law enforcement in 1993, he gave me this revolver in lieu of money that he owed me (true story). At the time, he only owed me about $200, so it certainly seemed like a fair trade then, and with the passing of time has proven to be so. This revolver has been in a zippered case in my bedroom closet for the past 23 years and hasn't been shot once during that time. But according to my brother, the last time he had it at the range, it was loud (which is certainly not a surprise), and true. Text me at at # (443) X 906 X 0103   for more details and pics"
