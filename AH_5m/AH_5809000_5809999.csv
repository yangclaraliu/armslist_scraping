It is completely stock and in very good condition. It comes with the original Colt blue box and all the manuals and paperwork that it came with the day it was bought. Also included are 2 Colt factory 7 round magazines as well as 2 carry holsters (leather OWB belt holster and clip-on IWB nylon holster). This gun is almost 20 years old and has been shot maybe 300 times, 50 of those were from me when I first bought it 3 years ago and since then it sat in my safe. The original owner was a family memeber that bought it new back in the late 90's.  Looking to sell to fund another rifle project. I am asking 700 OBO. I have seen these go for less but I believe the shape of the gun and the fact that I have all the original stuff (box, paperwork, mags) warrants the price. Thanks for checking out my ad."

 I prefer a face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you, no middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship.  I will also drive within a 100 mile radius of Jacksonville to meet you.
 
This is an AMT AUTOMAG III 30-Carbine, FACTORY NEW in BOX, NEVER FIRED!  Tell Dirty Harry to move over, you have this incredible Automag III! 
 
The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
 
My selling price of $1,450 is firm.  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than the price a Used Automag! 
 
Hurry, this is an incredible bargain! 
 
Obviously, my selling price of $1,450 is firm!   Trades? I will only trade for an Auto Ordnance 1927 Thompson semi auto, w/finned barrel, new condition in box. Unless you have a NEW Thompson, I am NOT interested in any trade!"
