This limited run has created an opportunity for the dedicated military collector and/or long range shooting enthusiast. Remington has begun to convert these surplus rifles into a NEARLY NEW CONFIGURATION. Each rifle will have a NEW BARREL, NEW M24 ACTION (marked with the original M24 designation and drilled and tapped for the receiver mounted open sights), and trigger. Aside from these critical parts, all other system parts will be 100% serviceable military surplus, if at all possible (new parts were substituted where needed). Additionally, the rifle will feature the original stock and external hardware that was issued and used in service by a US Army Sniper. Pictures best represent what you are buying as this is the EXACT firearm that you will receive!!! Manufacturer: Remington Arms Company, Inc. Model: M24 7.62 NATO S.W.S. Collectors Edition with Leupold MK4 10X Optic and Deployment Kit Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester Barrel Length: Heavy Profile 24"" Capacity: 5 Round Internal Box Overall Length: 43"" Barrel Material: 416R Stainless Steel Twist: 1/11.25"" Rifling: 5 radial land grooves Barrel Finish: Powder-coated Rem-Tough Trigger Adjustable External: 1.98-7.94 Lbs Butt Plate Adjustment: 2"" Weight with sling: 5.4 Kg (12.3 lbs.) Stock: Synthetic Aramid Fiber Optic: Leupold ULTRA 10X M3A (Early Mark 4 Predecessor) Description: Designed for and used by the United States Military, the M24's popularity also stretches from SWAT teams nationwide to International Military and Government agencies. Based on Remington's legendary Model 700™ and 40-X™ rifles, famous for their ""out of the box"" accuracy, the M24 has quickly gained a reputation for precision among the sniper system community. An essential element in the M-24's accuracy is its heavy, hammer-forged, stainless steel, Rem-Tough powder-coated barrel. The barrel's unique 5-R rifling delivers combined advantages of reduced bullet deformation and metallic fouling, even pressure curves, higher bullet velocities and longer barrel accuracy life. The M-24's H-S Precision aramid fiber-reinforced, fiberglass stock with an aluminum bedding block, is utilized for exceptional strength and dimensional stability in all weather conditions. Combined with its sophisticated sighting options, the M-24's Sniper Weapon System remains the standard against which all sniper systems are compared. This is a complete M24-R with optic and deployment kit, as pictured. This model includes a NEW M24 Long Action Receiver and NEW .308 Win 24 inch Heavy M24 barrel mated with prior service US Army stock , Prior Service Leupold ULTRA M3A 10x40 day scope and components. This model also comes with an M24 deployment kit which includes tools, cleaning supplies and spare service and maintenance parts. SWS is packaged in a standard Remington box. NO Case is included. This is a VERY RARE opportunity to OWN a piece of US Military history that saw actual service. Better still, with its new “zero” time barrel, you are, in essence, getting a brand new rifle for far less than the current new product M24 SWS would cost. The scope and accessores will most likely have seen a combat zone but will be fully functional."

There have been 5 rounds through it, 5 00buck. The iron sight accuracy of this shotgun was amazing. This has a flip-up front sight at the muzzle, a picatinny rail on the receiver and a notch rear sight at the rear of the picatinny rail. The barrel is a great innovatively designed 3 bore barrel which acts as an internal choke and recoil reducer. From 15 yards, all 9 pellets from 00 buck would group in a 6"" circle- no b.s.. This baby is dead on, lightweight and really, really low recoil. The PULSE PISTON system reduces the recoil and acts with a perfect progressiveness instead of gas operating semi-auto shotguns with valves working only OPENED or CLOSED.The result is a very light, accurate, fast cycling tactical shotgun. Definitely the best I've ever handled.You cannot find one of these in the US. The new model FABARM SAT 8 TACTICAL model does not bear the HK logo, and can only be purchased in Canada.

Modifications are as follows: - It has a great feeling sweat pea aluminum trigger installed on it, which has adjustable travel.- 13lb recoil spring is currently in the gun, which reduces recoil drastically, allowing for much better follow up shots.- Talon grip overlays, which feel fantastic.- +1 baseplate on the factory magazine, allowing it to hold an extra round.
