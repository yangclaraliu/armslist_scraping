It comes with the factory case, 4 factory magazines (2 flush, 2 extended), and DeSantis holster.  Carried more than it was fired.  I'm not even sure they make the Diamond Black models in the stores anymore since I haven't seen one in ages.  The entire package cost about $1,160 when new.  Don't bother googling it and saying you found one that sold 5 years ago for $600 or something if you want a response.Both function perfectly; however I don't use either anymore and my recently wife got in an accident so I need the money for insurance co-pays.Emails asking my lowest price or of these are still available will be ignored.  You must be over 21, and have a valid ID and CCW permit or give me your name and birth date for a court background check to buy these.  Unfortunately I've learned the hard way that not everyone on AL can be trusted.  I will give a discount for a cash buyer of one or both, but lowball offers will be laughed at and ignored."

350,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5734350,For Sale:  .45-70 Trapdoor Custom Titanium Front Sights,"Lake Tapps, Washington, United States",$ 35,"Listed On: Friday, July 29, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Field tests at 100 yards with the original .45-70 Type 3 Front sight.
Based on this drawinga few stainless steel prototypes were made that I again went out and field tested.
 
 
Now, most of you know the Trapdoor really starts sight in at 200 yards. I wanted to customize the front sight for 100 yards. The end result was 5 packages of 'finished' Titanium front sights for an extremely low price for the set of 4, and free shipping, if you'd like one. There are only 5 sets  available Shoot me an email if interested. REDACTED
 
The .350 is the best overall front sight. This front sight combined with the peep hole on the Buffington sight just below the 200 yd mark puts the 405 grain bullet pretty much spot on. When using 500 grain bullets at 100 yards, one must bump the rear sight up to the ""200"" mark to hit near bull at 100yd. Then incremental from there. (200 yds, bump the rear sight up to 300 yds.)
 
This makes a nice compromise between a range shooter (typically 50-100 yds) to a long distance shooters (2000 yds is the max for the Buffington sights) by simply adding 100 yards to the Buffing sight.
Naturally you'd use the taller sights (.400 and .450) for closer range shooting.
 
Pictures: A package of 4 titanium EDM-cut front sights suitable for Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 -established Model 1873 Trapdoors. These will polish up nice and shiny if you want to but I prefer them ""Cut color"" as they closely match my barrel.
 
2nd pic is my field test results using the .350 sight at 100 yards (marked 200 on the Buffington peep sight) with 500 gr reloads."

1-button activation provides 8 intensity settings, including a low/high indicator. Battery saving Motion Sensor Technology automatically deactivates illumination after 5 minutes of inactivity, yet reactivates instantly as soon as any movement is detected so no fumbling with on/off switch or constantly changing battery because it was accidentally left on. Index Matched Lens System combines with edge-blackened lead free lenses and 30mm tube for astonishing clarity and light transmission for use in all lighting conditions. Extreme fast-focus eyepiece ensures optimal diopter adjustment in the field. Second generation waterproofing resists the effects of thermal shock much more efficiently than standard nitrogen. Extended Range Focus - 3:1 Zoom Ratio - CDS (Custom Dial System) - 1/4 MOA Finger click adjustments - Matte Black Finish - Leupold scope coat - Lens pen
Great scope for those big bucks that inevitably come in right at first or last legal shooting light but still too dark to see and shoot through most scopes. Also with the 50mm objective lens and illuminated reticle, great for night hog hunting."

It is in excellent condition with no obvious handling marks, perfect wood grips and the look that only Nickel guns can muster. Includes factory box numbered to gun with paperwork and cleaning kit.History The .357 Magnum is the oldest ""magnum"" handgun cartridge. Smith & Wesson played a major part in the development and success of the cartridge and revolver that went with it. Firearms writer and experimenter Philip Sharpe is credited for its development during the 1930s when police agencies were asking for a more powerful round. S&W's Dan Wesson agreed to produce a new revolver that would handle ""high-intensity"" .38 Special loads, but only if Winchester would develop a new cartridge. Elmer Keith, a well known author and wildcatter at the time, was experimenting with hand loading .38 Special ammunition beyond their original specifications, taking advantage of the newer and better designed firearm frames and metallurgy, and also played a major role in the development of the .357 Magnum. Winchester introduced the .357 Magnum, which was dimensionally identical to the .38 Special except for a .125 inch longer case, and the first revolvers (referred to as "".357 Magnum Models"") were completed by S&W on April 8, 1935.[1] Retired Assistant Chief Patrol Inspector of the U.S. Border Patrol, famous gunfighter, and noted firearms and shooting skills writer Bill Jordan consulted with Smith & Wesson on the design and characteristics of the Model 19. Jordan's idea for a ""peace officer's dream""[2] sidearm was a heavy-barreled four-inch K-Frame .357 Magnum with a shrouded barrel like the big N-frame .357 and adjustable sights. After a year of experimentation with improved-strength steels and special heat-treating processes, the result was the .357 Combat Magnum (later designated Model 19), with the first serial-number gun (K260,000) presented to Jordan on November 15, 1955.[1][3] The .357 Magnum, four-inch barreled model was standard issue to uniformed officers of the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as well as Patrol Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol until both agencies adopted .40 caliber semi-automatic pistols. The .357 Magnum, 2.5” barreled model was standard issue to Special Agents of the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as well as Patrol Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol working plain clothes assignments until both agencies adopted .40 caliber semi-automatic pistols. Styles The Model 19 was produced in blued carbon steel or nickel-plated steel with wood or rubber combat grips, an adjustable rear sight, full-target or semi-target hammer, serrated wide target trigger or combat-type trigger, and was available in 2.5"" (3"": Model 66—rare), 4"", or 6-inch barrel lengths. The weights are 30.5 ounces, 36 ounces, and 39 ounces, respectively. The 2.5- and 3-inch barrel versions had round butts, while the others had square butts.[1] The Model 19 was produced from 1957 (first model number stampings) to November 1999. The Model 66 was produced from 1970 until 2005. The Model 66 differed by its use of stainless steel and its smooth target-type trigger. The Model 19 and the Model 66 had the same trigger options.[1] Engineering changes were designated with a ""dash-"" number after the model number. The engineering changes are as follows:[1] Model 19 19 (1957): Stamping of model number. 19-1 (1959): Change extractor rod, right to left-hand thread. 19-2 (1961): Cylinder stop changed, deleted triggerguard screw. (1963): Introduce 6"" barrel. (1963): 50 manufactured with 2.5"" barrel, serial range K544672–K544721. (1966): Introduce 2.5"" barrel as standard. 19-3 (1967): Relocation of rear sight leaf screw. (1968): Delete diamond-insert grip. 19-4 (1977): Change gas ring from yoke to cylinder. (Not really an ""improvement"". It did make it slightly easier to clean if there was heavy leading, but basically was a cost-cutting measure.) 19-5 (1982): Eliminate cylinder counterbore and pinned barrel; small change in cylinder length to 1.62"". 19-6 (1988): New yoke retention system; radius stud package; floating hand; hammer nose bushing. (1992): Blue finish only is catalogued. 19-7 (1994): Change to Uncle Mike's Combat synthetic grips; drill and tap frame; change extractor; change rear sight leaf. (1995–96): Delete square butt features. (1996): Discontinue 6"" barrel production; begin shipments in blue foam-filled plastic cases. (1997): Change to MIM thumbpiece; ship with Master trigger locks; change to MIM trigger. 19-8 (1998): Change in frame design: cylinder stop stud eliminated; eliminate serrated tangs; change to MIM hammer with floating firing pin; change internal lock work, September 1998. (1999): Discontinue 2 1/2"" barrel."
