Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the course designer’s most difficult stages.The V11 Pro carries the new SLiM Rail 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue.

They are basically the same guns- but the FS has the very comfortable finger finger groove grips & the classic rounded trigger guard (that fits most holsters better) & they both have highly visible steel adjustable sights.
 There weren't  a lot of Bersa Firestorm Pistols chambered in .22 around to begin with, & a lot fewer of them were Two-Tones- so you'll rarely see this configuration for sale.
To me; the 2-Tone Bersa Firestorm (Black Frame with Silver Slide/Finger Groove Grips/Round Trigger Gd.) is their best looking .22.
 This pistol currently has it's mag safety residing in a plastic bag- & it only takes a few minutes to re-install if you so desire.
 These are great little pistols, & are plenty accurate; but being based on Bersa's .380- they do prefer hotter ammo (like CCI Mini Mags Or Remington's Golden Bullet).
 Bersa sells their pistols with only one magazine, but this one includes an additional Bersa Eagle factory mag (a $30 value). Asking $280. May trade all/part for Silver."

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck. CALL JOHN @ REDACTED"
