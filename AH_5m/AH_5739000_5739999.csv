It has the following, Warren Tactical Fiber Optic Seveigny model sights, Apex Competition Trigger Kit installed, Apex Match Grade SDI Barrel, M&P Compact magazine baseplates. Overall pistol is in great shape. It shows a little wear from drawing from holster. The pistol is stippled. It is USPSA Production class legal stippled approved. ITs a good stipple job not a hack job. Very grippy but not uncomfortable. Comes with 5-17rd magazines. Also comes with all the stock trigger parts, stock sights, stock magazine baseplates, stock barrel, mag carrier (Carries 2) and 2 single homemade mag carriers that work really well. Also comes with a custom kydex holster OWB  that I used for USPSA and another OWB holster that I built for a battle belt. I never mounted it on a battle belt so you need clips to hang in and some minor forming to the belt for best fit which is very easy to do. Pistol shoots a sub 1inch group with 115g at 20yards and under a 2"" group with 147g at 20yards with APEX Barrel. Very reliable and accurate. Its how it should have come from the factory. Has about a 3lb trigger never measured it. Buyer will pay for all transfers and shipping. A great way to get started in USPSA or just wanting a great tuned M&P9. Just for the record I have no idea of a round count in this. I bought it new and if I had to guess Id say about 10k-12k total. Price is for everything listed. Email for more pics of other components. Will trade for Dillon press, or a bolt gun .308, .270, .300. etc."

Buying & Registering A suppressor/silencer/Short Barrel Rifle This page will guide you through the process for legally buying a Suppressor / Silencer Buying a suppressor is much easier than you may think. Just follow the steps below or give us a call and we will be happy to walk you through the entire process. What paperwork will I need to legally register a suppressor? There are two main methods for registering your suppressor:   Registration using a “Trust” (easiest method)   Registration in your name   Option 1 Registration using a “Trust”   Set up your trust   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out your Form 4 and Mail in your $200 payment to ATF   Sit back and relax because you are done!   It will cost approximately $100 more to buy using the trust method, but it will save a ton of time and provide a great deal more flexibility than an individually registered suppressor. There are many advantages to using a trust for registering a suppressor.  Some of these advantages include:   more than one person (family or friends) can legally use the suppressor if they are listed on the trust   one trust can be used for multiple suppressors   trusts can be modified to add or remove people without approval from the ATF   most importantly you DO NOT have to get fingerprint cards or your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on the purchase.  These benefits will save a lot of time and hassle down the road.   There are many places you can go online or locally to download a Trust to be used for registering your suppressor. Here are a few examples which range in price from $99 - $129:   http://199trust.com/   http://www.thefirearmlawyers.com/   http://www.guntrust.com/   Option 2 Registration to an individual   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out Form 4 and $200 payment for ATF   Obtain 2 Passport Photos   Obtain Chief Law Enforcement Officer Sign Off (Must be in the county you are a resident in)   Two copies of fingerprint cards (FBI form FD-258)   Complete Certificate of Compliance – ATF Form 5330.20   This is a less expensive method for registering your suppressor since you will not have to pay the $100 for a trust to be set up. However, you will be the sole owner of the suppressor and will have to be present any time the suppressor is being used (this includes your spouse and kids). In addition you will have to complete several additional steps (Steps 3 – 6 above) that you do not have to complete if you opt to register your suppressor using a trust. FAQ’s Am I eligible to own a suppressor? If you are 21 years old or older AND able to legally possess a firearm then you should be eligible to purchase a suppressor. This also assumes you have verified it is legal to own in your State and County. Is it legal to own a suppressor in my State? Suppressor ownership and hunting with a suppressor is legal in most States. Please reference the map, provided by the American Suppressor Association, below to see if suppressors are legal in your State. This map is for reference and you should be sure to check your State and County laws before making any suppressor purchase.    * Minnesota hunting law to take effect August 1, 2015.* Maine Hunting and Shall Sign laws to take effect mid October.   How long is the wait? Wait times will vary throughout the year but can be anywhere from 3-6 months. Once you submit your paperwork you will be able to contact the ATF to inquire about the status of your paperwork. Just keep in mind this is a government process that is out of all of our control and you will need to be patient. As they have told us in the past, “It will be ready when it is ready”. 7 Step Process To Order A Suppressor From Gun Pro:   Use the Gun Pro FFL Locator for Class III dealers to find a dealer in your area. If you can't find a Class III dealer contact us and we will assist you in locating one.   Make sure the dealer will take “Title II” or suppressor transfers and inquire about their transfer fee.

Once our transfer forms are in place with your dealer, usually 2 weeks, we will email you the Form 4 information you will need to complete. You can complete this information and submit it right away. Please check with your local transfer dealer for their policy and procedures.   We will transfer the suppressor to your local dealer and they will contact you once your Form 4 has been approved.

He was an avid marksman in north central Pennslyvania. Rifle was not used since 1962, as Dad had moved to NY in '62. No long range shooting opportunities there. Rifle consists of US Remington Model 1903 action, serial number 3118907, Flaig's medium heavy barrel in .243 Winchester, M.H. Canjar trigger model 03-1, a J Unertl scope, 1 1/2"", 18 power, mounted to a custom solid walnut stock with maple and padouk (an african wood) inlays. I had this rifle appraised and it is the opinion of the appraisser that the rifle was built by Flaigs Gun Shop, located just outside of Pittsburg. This makes sense to me as my father was born in Johnstown and went to college at Pittsburg University. My Dad moved to north central PA in 55, and the barrel has a date stamp of 1952, so I beleive the rifle was made in that timeslot. The stock was made in 2002 to add to the rifles uniqueness.

No one has buggered with this one on the inside. He also said timing is spot on and tight, should be good to go for years to come. I have 3 sets of grips for this cool carry piece, the original Colt wood stocks, a nice set of Colt Agent magna size skip checkered 70's grips by Sile of Italy, and a nice set of rubber bootstrap style grips, so you can alternate/experiment with the three to suit your preferences.

Less than 200 rounds down the barrel. This is the a complete manufactured firearm from those that actually developed the 300blk cartridge.  $1600 new. Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer.

It was holstered at the competition and as a result there are a few very very light scratches that under the right light when you hold the gun the right way are visible (I will try to get a picture that shows this) at the barrel end of the slide. Only other sign of wear is on top of the barrel at the front of the chamber where the slide ramps up when fired(will be pictured below). Everything is factory, internals and sights. Not really interested in trade at this time, I actually hate to get rid of this gun because I wanted an fee for so long but I'm going to be finding a new project.

Have a Springfield M1A Standard with OD Green Stock as well as a New (Never shot it) Archangel Stock. Stock was slightly modified to fit (as instructed in instructions); had to slightly shave area where trigger mech locks into place; apparently it varies slightly from rifle to rifle and therefore has to be custom filed to size.
Anyhow, The rifle has less than 100 rounds through it; I traded my AR for it a few months ago, and the original purchaser says he put about 50 rounds down range and sighted it in and that was it. I believe him, simply judging by how clean and like-new the rifle is. I put about 10-15 rounds down range myself just to ensure it worked as it should when i traded for it. I haven't had time to hit the range again since, and don't really want to spend hundreds on a good scope mount and piece of glass for it, so i am now looking into possibly purchasing or trading for something else. Both stocks will be included, as will 5 or 6 Mags. I believe two looked a bit different than another four, and i know at least some are Korean mags; possibly all, i'm not sure.
The rifle is in great condition. The Archangel stock alone runs at over 200$ new.
Located in Woodbridge NJ, but may be able to meet in East Brunswick, as well.All sales/trades will require proper paperwork with Matching drivers license and FID..Need it gone.. Will take 1200$ Cash for rifle & a mag only, 1400$ With Archangel and extras.. FIRM on price."
