Awesome system built with no expense spared!! More powerful than a .45, holds sixteen 10mm rounds, flat trajectory. The 10mm Auto is marketed for hunting, defensive, and tactical use and is one of the few semi-automatic, rimless cartridges that is legal for hunting white-tailed deer in many U.S. states. The G-20 is as reliable as a powerful auto gets and relatively compact. High-power defense caliber against humans or animals, and for hunting by those who prefer the flatter carry profile and higher cartridge capacity of an automatic pistol versus a magnum revolver. FBI Hostage Rescue Team, Special Weapons and Tactics Teams, and various other law enforcement agencies in the United States issue or authorize the use of 10mm. In military use, the government of Denmark has issued the Glock 20 to the Slædepatruljen Sirius (Sirius Sledge Patrol) headquartered in Daneborg, Northeast Greenland. The pistols were issued as a defense against polar bears which the unit encounters during patrols. thank for looking. you can email; mavi.j@yahoo.com"
