Maybe I'll try a 10-22 next...who knows.Anyway, gun shoots perfectly. Extremely smooth, no issues with it. It's tube fed, holds 15 rounds. Rear peep site swivels out of the way to look down a scope, front sight has a cool 5-sight system where you can flip up multiple different front sight posts. The front posts are a bit worn out but at least 2 of them still lock into place. The stock has a small chunk missing off, looks like the previous owner glued it back on but it just fell off when I was firing it. Does NOT affect function, just cosmetic. All parts for this thing can be purchased very cheap from places like Numerich and Havlin sales. This also comes with a soft case, and a 100 round box of Remington Golden Bullets.

It has the split barrel band at the front, a rack number painted on what seems to be the original stock (has a faint cartouche), and the only thing I think is wrong is the trigger guard but I have a correct Springfield guard that goes with it. I believe it was rebarrelled after the war with a Springfield barrel- markings are SA 4-5 and I can't make out what's after the 5, but definitely a Springfield bbl. The wood has plenty of character marks but is solid, no cracks or repairs, and the finish is worn as you can see.
