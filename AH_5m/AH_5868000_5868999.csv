I got 500 rounds to use as plinking ammo with my MP5 clone but it is not loaded quite hot enough to run well in my ammo-picky MP5. I tried it out of my Glock 19 and Sig P226 and it worked great, but I have everything set up to shoot 124gr 9mm out of those so I dont have much use for more 115gr ammo. Please keep in mind that as this is remanufactured ammunition it is always a good idea to check rounds over before loading/ shooting them. There was one round that was too long to chamber out of the 60 that I shot, but the rest were fine. Because of this I would definitely consider it plinking or range-only ammo (like Wolf, Tula, etc)."

The barrel must have the original 98k sights that accepts the short 98k handguard. The condition of the bore does not matter, just so all of the sights are there.
 
I have up to $75 for a stock set barrel combination. I have a box of 333 rds of Federal bulk packed 22 lr ammo, 70 rd bandoleer of Turkish 8mm ammo for trade in place of some or all of the cash.
 
If you sporterized a German 98k and have these parts that are collecting dust and taking up space, let me know what you have. Include you phone/text number in your reply.
 
If you have these parts from one of the Yugoslavian captured 98k, I will consider them.
 
I have included stock pictures of samples to show what I am looking for. The third picture shows what I mean for sporter bolt stock cut.
 
I live in Gilbert, but work in Tempe during the week, so I am sure we can meet some time/place.

I am the 2nd owner and would estimate total round count between 2,000-2,500. Virtually all small parts have been replaced. Frame, slide, barrel and front sight are stock, but pretty much everything else is 10-8, Ed Brown and Cylinder & Slide. I don't remember which brand each part is (original owner did the work), but I do know that no MIM parts remain! Off the top of my head, the trigger and rear sight are 10-8, and the grip safety, GI guide rod, slide stop are Ed Brown. The original mainspring housing was also replaced with an aftermarket version with a magwell. The trigger pull is NICE on this 1911 and overall the pistol is in very good shape. I'll include a Wilson 47D and CMC Powermag as well. Looking for $850obo and prefer transfer in Camas/Vancouver area. thanks, Greg"

Savage's AccuTrigger® enables shooters to obtain exceptional accuracy with the Savage 93 F, by allowing you to easily adjust it to your desired weight of pull for a light, crisp release with no creep. A lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The 93 F has a weather resistant synthetic stock, and a blued barrel and receiver. The receiver comes drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Factory installed sling swivel studs accommodate attaching a rifle sling, or a bi-pod to the forend. The bolt features dual extractors for positive extraction of spent cases. A 5-round, detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading the rifle. The 2-stage safety is located on the right side of the receiver. The Savage 93 F Bolt-Action Rimfire Rifle in 22 WMR reaches out well over 100 yards to take varmints, small game, and medium sized predators such as coyote, fox, and bobcat with minimum muzzle blast and pelt damage.

It is in fantastic condition, the only defect is the finish on the wood handguard is scratched up from the sling rubbing on it. The bore is excellent, with nice, crisp rifling. I believe mine is one of the few that were imported from Romania as a complete rifle and not one built from parts here in the US. This weapon features last shot hold open, which most PSL's do not. The weapon shots excedingly well for a PSL, I can repeatedly (10/10) hit a reduced size steel silhouette placed at 200 yards with russian surplus from the 1970's. None of the other PSL's I have had the opportunity to shoot could do that. The wood furniture still features the original reddish finish, with the previously mentioned scratches on the handguard. This rifle cycles perfectly and I have put around 300 rounds down the tube and never had a malfunction. I clean my weapons after every jam session and this rifle is extremely well maintained. Rifle comes with 2 magazines and an aftermarket optic. I do not have the original optic. Both magazines function perfectly in this rifle. I would rather not have to ship it if at all possible. I am willing to deliver up to 120 miles. I am located in Pittsburg, KS. Only trades/partial trades would be for a K31, M38, K98k, G/K43, or a really clean PTR.

Gun is in very good condition with no holster wear or signs of excessive wear internally. I got it used, so I don't have a total round count, but the gun looks like it was more of a safe queen than a regular shooter. It has 3 dot sights. Comes with (1) magazine. No box, instructions or lock.This is the decocker only model, which means no external safety, just a heavy double-action trigger pull for the first shot, with much lighter single-action pulls for the follow-up shots. The decocker lever lets you safely drop the hammer, even on a loaded chamber, when you're done shooting. This would make a great truck gun, BOB gun, GHB gun or bedside gun. It's probably a bit heavy for concealed carry, but it could be done. That weight makes shooting .40SW much more pleasant. There are also rubber grips available on the market if you want an even softer shooting gun.Price is $225 cash FIRM - BUYER pays transfer/BGC fee at the FFL. Use the ""Contact Seller"" button to reach me - I can respond usually within 2 hours during the workday. This will be done through an FFL, please don't ask me to do a private sale without an FFL, you'll just be wasting both of our times.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less as you will not get a response.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.
