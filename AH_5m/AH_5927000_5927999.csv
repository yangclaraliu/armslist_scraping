Worst I could say is no, and I'm a big fan of firearms in general, so I probably have at least some interest in whatever you are selling.Thanks and have a great day"

The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. The Ruger LCP is a well-designed, reliable Semi-Auto Pistol that one can count on in an emergency. Incudes 1 magazine extension and a soft case. Made in USA.BUYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHECKING WITH ALL LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS BEFORE PURCHASING FIREARM. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES OF ITEMS.

Mark Graham of Arizona Response Systems. He has a stellar reputation for building HK rifles and is a refinisher for HK (see his website). It is built on a PTR receiver and a NEW HK POF parts kit. The kit is from POF which was an HK licensed manufacturer. The barrel is an HK barrel and it was cryogenically treated before assembly. It has the bipod cut so you can put a bipod on it with the wide handguard. The aluminum PTR handguard that is on it makes for a slimmer feel for better handling. It also has an extended cocking handle, extended safety lever and enhanced heavy buffer which reduces recoil by 50%. The gun is finished in his Metocol III Satin Black finish for a super durable coating. See his website for the details of this coating. Two magazines are supplied with the Metocol III Satin Black finish as well. This gun is only test fired and is considered new. I also have some extra magazines for it that I can sell to the buyer as well as some other accessories like scope rail and cheek riser. This is truly a special rifle and built by the best with the best parts. This is much better than a PTR rifle and I would consider it at least as good as an actual HK rifle without the high collector cost. I will accept Paypal with a 3% fee"

The lower frame is dipped to look like Carbon Fiber. Making for a great looking firearm. The layer aids in grip allowing for an almost rubber like feel.
The Strike One semiautomatic pistol comes to the USA scene in January of 2015 as a completely new and revolutionary gun!!
The Strike One semiautomatic pistol comes as the fastest, most controllable, most accurate and hard hitting service pistol available today on the world market.
A full 5 inches cold-hammered barrel, along with a 75 Hrc surface Nitrite treatment for barrel, locking block, slide and operating pin industrial production standard, warrant safe and flawless use of the pistol in excess of 50.000 rounds.
The frame of the Strike One was also engineered with exacting and unprecedented standards: the operating frame block, again made of the best 42CrMo4 steel, features long rails for total axial and torque control of all the moving parts, pins and springs. The frame itself, with it’s unique and true 3D hand grip (and not just “millings” on a flat surface) comes today as the only service pistol with a full fledged IPSC standard magazine insert “miniskirt”, allowing Special Operation and SWAT teams to work as if they were using a competition pistol.
The trigger system of the Strike One, again like no other before, operates mainly on the horizontal plain, without raisers with variable and long, rubbery trigger pull, but with a crisp and short firing pin release: this is the secret, along with a lighting fast locking mechanism, behind the unbelievable semiautomatic firing speed of our pistol."
