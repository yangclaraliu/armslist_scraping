One of those that you love more than the rest. She's been babied her whole life, I am the original owner, and I made it my personal project when I wans't working on other client's guns. Has been kept it in a dehumidified safe.  Work done:   - Hand-tuned cylinder timing
 - Reduced power Wolff J-frame springs throughout
 - Mirror-polish job on sear and trigger lip 
 - SA and DA trigger pull have been successfully halved, and DA is smooth as butter.  
 Round count is exactly 100 (2 boxes) to test that the grips were dialed in and the reduced power springs were still allowing for positive primer strikes (which they did, 100%). Cleaned OCD-style, barrel, cylinder face, yoke, frame, internals, etc. If you want the ultimate snub nose Smith&Wesson, look no further. This little girl is a finely tuned beast! If you're like me, you don't want to pay for accessories you wouldn't necessarily put on yourself, I get that, I do. But this is the ONLY gun I've ever put Crimson Trace grips on, as a practical accessory. The short range and minimal sights made it a good idea in my eyes, and the grips are dialed in to approximately 20 feet. BUT, even though the grips were bought new for $250 only a month ago, I'm valuing them at $75 (price included in total price). The original price of the Model 60 was $550, plus labor, parts, and love. IF YOU DONT WANT THE CRIMSON TRACE GRIPS, ILL TAKE $50 off price
I’ll even toss in a box of buffalo bore wad cutters :) I realize that, due to the pricing, and not knowing the kind of quality of work I do, please feel free to ask me any questions you have!   TULSA AREA ONLY please! Thanks! Shoot me a text at REDACTED for any questions!"

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

S&W cartridge. Different versions of the SUB-2000™ rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines (see list below).  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage.   The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel.  Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories.  The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories.    The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort.  Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position.  The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories.    The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly.  The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.    The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model) or 9/16""-24 threads (.40 cal S&W).  The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.
