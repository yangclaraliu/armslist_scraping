Shot a couple cylinders threw and never carried it. I realized I probably will never carry it as I have other guns I carry. Gun has sharp recoil when shooting 357s but is quite comfortable with 38 specials. Steel frame so it is a bit heavier at 24oz but that helps to tame recoil and adds durability.  Will need to see PTC/PTP. Have box and everything it came with.

I'm not much of a .40 guy, but with this heavy frame/slide combo, it takes a lot of the snap out of the .40. The double action trigger is very smooth and suprisingly accurate. I put all of my shots in the black at 15yds, and it even shot better than my G19.Its a nice shooter, but I'd rather have a 9mm. So my loss is your gain...I'd rate this 8/10 condition. Honestly, it looks great, but it shows wear from use/duty carry, but not much. Some finish is missing from the rear sight, but a touch up or aftermarket rear sight would fix that if it bothers you.A great carry gun, bedside gun, or range gun! Your choice.This comes with two factory magazines. One matches the gun and is 10 rounds, the other is parkerized and is 11 rounds.FREE BOX OF TARGET AMMO!

Chambered in 7.62x39. Picked this up less than 2 weeks ago before prices went up and many places sold out. Refinished the upper and lower wood handguards myself with MINWAX Bombay Mohagany Satin stain and followed it up with matte polyurethane finish. I'd rate the finished product about a B+. Unfortunately while reinstalling the upper hand guard on the gas tube, I caused a small 1/4-inch crack in the wood. Everything still assembled fine and is fully-functional, but I want the buyer to know this. If you're planning on replacing the upper handguard with an Ultimak or similar, then none of this matters. Lastly, I removed the welded factory thread protector, sanded down the excess and repainted with high-temp BBQ flat black paint, and replaced with a CNC Warrior M92/M85 Booster muzzle device in its place (held in placed with a Manticore Arms detent kit). This gun is new and otherwise perfect - just opting for an AK47 rifle instead. Selling for what I paid. $615 cash only. Price is firm. NO TRADES. Will provide a Bill of Sale to buyer.

Though I've not seen the XCR as much in the U.S., the rifle is very popular in Canada, while distribution in the US, seems to be more limited.  In those areas of the U.S. where consumers have been able to use and learn about the XCR, there seems to be many happy owners.  The XCR's piston driven platform is extremely reliable, easy to clean and maintain, and very accurate.  The XCR has a folding stock, a quick change barrel system with conversion kits for .300 BLK and other calibers available. Unlike the ACR however, the XCR is not made of polymer but rather is made entirely of metal, including the very rugged and tough FAST stock.  The XCR has a monolithic rail system as the upper reciever and the forend/handguard are a continuous single piece.  I have owned this rifle since late 2013 and have put somewhere between 500-750 rounds down range with it.  As mentioned above, this rifle comes equiped with the FAST Stock as shown in the pictures, however I also purchased the ACE Skeleton stock for the XCR and this second stock is also included.  Though the skeleton stock is lighter, I personally prefer the FAST stock, which I find to be superior to the various stocks that are available for the SCAR or ACR.  The FAST stock not only extends to one of six positions, but it also has an adjustable cheek riser.  The r rifle's trigger has also been upgraded with Robinson's 2-stage match trigger which provides a pull weight of 3.5 lbs with a 2 lb. first stage and a 1.5 lb. second stage.  Relative to the 5.5 lb. single stage stock trigger, this upgrade greatly improves accuracy and rate of fire.  The stock single stage trigger is also included.  Another upgrade that I've added is the compensator/muzzle brake, which mitigates muzzle rise.  Finally, the stock pistol grip has been upgraded with a Hogue rubber pistol grip and I have added Magpul ""Pro Gen 3 flip-up backup sights.  The total value of these extras and upgrades is just over $500.  The rifle has a quad rail system, (though you'll notice in the pictures that I have rail covers over the rails), and a 16"" chrome lined barrel.  I have plenty of additional pictures so please let me know if you'd like to see them or if you'd like to check this rifle out in person. Included with Purchase: Robinson XCR-L in 5.56 Robinson FAST Stock ACE Skeleton Stock Robinson 5.5 lb. Single Stage Trigger Robinson 3.5 lb. 2-Stage Match Trigger Your choice of Magpul Pro Gen 3 Flip-Up Sights OR YHM Flip-Up Sights Magpul Rail Covers Single Point Sling and Sling Attachment  Competition Compensator/Muzzle Brake Though primarily looking to sell, there are some trades that I would consider.

Additional features include an adjustable stock, adjustable cheek piece, vented fore-end, and swivel studs. The Model 12 Palma also utilizes Savage’s AccuTrigger system. This inclusion features a dual-stage trigger design in which the first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism. Once this occurs, the second trigger can be depressed in order to activate the firing pin – the trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The Savage 12 Palma rifle is a beautiful gun and a tremendous tool for long range precision.  The rifle has a 30"" stainless barrel, an overall length of 49.75"", and it is chambered in .308.  The rifle has an adjustable comb, adjustable length of pull (LOP), and an adjustable cheek riser.  It also comes equipped with an adjustable Accutrigger that may be adjusted from 1.5 lbs. to 6 lbs.  This rifle also comes with a Seekins Precision 1 piece rail affixed to the top of the rifle.  I purchased this rifle new from Savage in November of 2015 for just over $2,100, but with few opportunities to shoot, much less do any shooting at a reasonable distance, I've decided to sell the rifle to someone who may have an opportunity to enjoy it.  I have shot the rifle on one occasion at the range and loved it but I do not get enough opportunities to shoot at any distance.  This is the only use the rifle has seen and it is in perfect condition.  The rifle comes in its box with the manual and any items that came with the rifle.  Please contact me if you'd like to take a look in person.I am primarily interested in selling though I will consider select trades.  Glock 19s (Gen 3 or Gen 4) are of particular interest to me while I've listed a few other items that I may also have an interest in trading for below.  The price for any trades or trades plush cash shall be $1,300.  Aside from those items listed below, you are welcome to inquire, but I am likely not intereseeGlock 19 Gen 3 or Gen 4Select Over/Under 12 Ga.

It recently came to my attention that this is no longer legal in NY, where I live, so it has to go. For those of you who aren't familiar with the Mech Tech CCU, it's a rifle upper that attaches to a pistol (in this case, the Glock 19 or 23) to form a carbine.

It has a 16"" chrome lined barrel that looks great--as do the bolt and all other parts-- and has the side rail for mounting optics; I don't believe that it saw a lot of use by the previous owner. All of the holes left by converting the rifle from stock configuration have been welded up, and the receiver and barrel assembly have received a fresh coat of paint. It comes as seen here, with the stock 10 round magazine, wooden buttstock, handguards and pistol grip. 
I'd like $800 for it, or $850 shipped, and may be interested in partial trades plus cash, including the following: Zastava m85pv, m85np, m90np or m92; a converted OR unconverted Saiga in .223, x39 or 5.45; VEPR converted OR unconverted in .223, x39 or 5.45; left-side folding trunnion and triangle/poly stock; yugo m85 parts kit.

It runs perfectly and is quite accurate. I will be selling just the CCU unit. The CCU unit is not a firearm, so it can be shipped directly. I paid $460 for this new.

Absolutely NO mods, this is completely stock. Comes with 5 factory magazines (3 flush, 2 extended). I don't even think all the mags have had ammo loaded in them. Also includes everything it came with from the factory - XDm case, cable lock still in the plastic, spent shell casing, mag pouch, speed loader, backstraps, a couple mag sleeve extensions, and all the factory papers.Price: was $575, now asking $560Need to keep this FTF in the Noblesville/Fishers area.

BUYER is solely responsible for being legally allowed to own and receive this rifle and/or pass the background check at a receiving FFL. Rifle product description is as follows:The CVA APEX is, according to CVA, the best break-action, multi-barrel interchangeable rifle system on the market today. Just by shouldering the APEX, the serious shooter will notice a vast superiority to its competitors in both balance and fit. But the real test comes with the shooting. And it is in the shooting that two very important features make the APEX really shine.First, every APEX barrel is made by Bergara Barrels™, which provide a level of accuracy performance that is unequaled by any muzzleloader/center-fire rifle on the market today – due to its premium, custom quality. These Bergara Barrels, all made of the highest quality 416 grade stainless steel, have quickly become recognized as some of the most accurate production barrels in the world. And while many of the world's most highly regarded center-fire manufacturers use Bergara barrels on their guns, only CVA offers them in a muzzleloader too. It is these Bergara barrels that enable CVA to guarantee our APEX series muzzleloading rifles to be the ""The Most Accurate Muzzleloader You've Ever Shot -- Or Your Money Back."" Second, APEX’s ambidextrous butt stock is designed specifically for scope shooting, with a height of comb that positions the shooter perfectly in line with the optics. The result is a rifle that shoulders and points as naturally as your favorite shotgun – just like it’s an extension of your body.As for versatility, the APEX can be quickly and easily set up with a wide range of Bergara Barrels in 15 different muzzleloading and center-fire calibers. Plus, every APEX features CVA’s trigger guard actuated breeching mechanism, which is extremely simple to operate. And its innovative trigger design provides an incredibly clean, crisp pull that is adjustable from approximately 3 to 4.75 pounds. Every APEX also includes a Quake® Claw® sling and a custom DuraSight® Z-2 Alloy™ rail mount.SPECIFICATIONS416 Stainless Steel, Fluted, BERGARA BARREL™ 27” in Muzzleloader, 25” in Center-Fire1:28” Twist for Muzzleloader, 1:9”-1:20” for Center-FireAmbidextrous Synthetic Stock with Rubber Grip Panels – Black or Realtree APG™ CamoCrushZone® Recoil PadDuraSight® Rail MountQRBP - Quick Release Breech PlugReversible Hammer SpurQuake® Claw® SlingAdjustable Trigger7.5 lbs.

Local pickup in Hoover.... Or contact to arrange shipping to verified FFL.  Brief History:“Made in West Germany” mark was strictly for German firearms made for export. This particular firearm production year was in the middle of major historic changes, rules, and regulations. The marking ""Made in Germany"" on the grip panel was in 1968. The additional marking ""Made in W. Germany"" on the slide followed a little bit later, probably 1970. After the war, Germany was forbidden from manufacturing any firearms, a ban that lasted until 1951, when the Cold War required the re-arming of Germany and the production of new weapons. Walther relocated his company to the city of Ulm in West Germany, and began manufacturing sidearms for the new West German Army. To raise money, Walther began licensing the rights to manufacture copies of the PPK to other companies, and in 1952, the first new PPKs were made in France by the Manurhin firearms company. Manuhrin continued to produce Walther PPKs under license until 1986. Walther resumed manufacturing its own PPKs again in Ulm in 1957. During the Cold War, the pistol got a new life. In 1968, the US passed the Gun Control Act, which set specific size and weight requirements for any pistol imported into the US. The Walther PPK did not fall within those requirements, so in response the Walther Company designed the slightly larger PPK/S model, which is basically a PP frame with a PPK barrel and slide. And because the Gun Control Act provisions did not apply to weapons manufactured within the US, Walther expanded its production to America in 1978, licensing its PPK design to the Interarms Company in Virginia.  ""PPK"" is an abbreviation for Polizeipistole Kriminalmodell (Police Pistol Detective Model), ""kriminal"" referring to the police detective (criminal) division. Adolf Hitler shot and killed himself with his PPK (a 7.65mm/.32 ACP) in the in Berlin. The Walther PPK pistol is famous as fictional secret agent James Bond's gun in many of the films and novels: Ian Fleming's choice of the Walther PPK directly influenced its popularity and its notoriety. Fleming had given Bond a .25 Beretta 418 pistol in early novels, but switched to the PPK in Dr. No"
