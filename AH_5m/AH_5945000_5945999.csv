It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened bobbed hammer. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. This thirty-four year old classic revolver is a great shooter. I put sixty-five problem-free rounds through it last night at the gun range before bringing it home and cleaning it up for its pictures. I have a couple more pictures available for the asking or if you want to have these pics let me know.    Local face-to-face cash sale only.

If you're like I was, you've probably never heard of Grand Power, imported from Slovakia by Century Arms, but this is the choice weapon for competitive shooting in Europe, and I understand why. So, if you have any level of interest, do your due diligence and research Grand Power before you contact me. Comes complete with case, two magazines, four different backs traps so you can custom fit it to your hand, owners manual and one additional front sight. I'm not a great shooter, but I was able to put 15 out of 15 in a three inch target, at 25 feet, the first time I stepped up to the firing line with this pistol. The barrel of the Grand Power rotates one quarter turn each time the gun is fired, keeping the barrel in a straight line with the slide, optimizing accuracy and aiding with the absorption of recoil; this gun also has an amazing trigger pull. This is a full sized semi-automatic pistol.Text 918-857-7zero three 9."
