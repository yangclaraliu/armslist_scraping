Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S Single Stack from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you're used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can be hard in the shockingly slim XD-S Single Stack - a pistol that packs so easily you'll forget it's there. The XD-S is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack don't stop there. Try it with an X-Tension magazine (7 rounds), and you'll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics - complete with two interchangeable backstraps - allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn't have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don't have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don't have to carry a gun to the store that you'd rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack in your hand today, and you'll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you'll find that it's Noticeably Unnoticeable.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.   Specifications: Upper Receiver: A4 Flat-Top, Forged Barrel Length: 14.5"" Barrel Contour: Government Barrel Material: 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel Muzzle Thread Pattern: 1/2""-28 Chrome Lined: No Barrel Finish: QPQ Melonite / Black Nitride Twist Rate: 1 in 7"" Chamber: 5.56x45mm NATO M4 Feed Ramps: Yes Bolt Carrier: 1-Piece w/Integral Piston Strike Face Muzzle Device: Pinned VDI Manimal Flash Hider Gas System Length: Mid, Short Stroke Piston Operated Gas Block Diameter: 0.750"" Handguard: Evolution Rail Sights: None, Single Rail Gas Block Weight: 4.507 lbs"

the only differences are that i changed the lower out for a Spartan lower/ not because one is better or worst i just wanted to engraved molon labe on my lower.

http://www.spikestactical.com/spartan-lower-c-104_241.html

The rifle also has some cheap flip up sights and a scorpion armaments reflex sight that has a pretty cool built on laser and pressure pad/ as well as having an ergo grip as you can see.

disclaimer- if you dont know about adams arms ar15/ they work on a piston system. that is what makes them so cool, they are supposed to have the durability of an ak47 with the accuracy of a typical ar15. 

here is a great review below

http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/03/foghor n/gun-review-adams-arms-tactical-evo-rifle/

my only knock on the gun is that they are choosey when it comes to magazine/ dont use crappy mags

I also have a Remington 700 sps 300 win mag sps 24""

If you dont know about this gun then idk what to tell you, probably the most famous long range rifle from our recent era, after the military starting using its action for their sniper rifles.

the scope on it is a variable 6 by 18 vortex crossfire 2

and it has a nifty cheek riser / ammo holder to come with

this is the newer bdl model, so it has the hinged ""magazine""

this gun has never been fired

this is a 300 win mag so be ready for the recoil

$800 FIRM for the upper and scope or better in trade.  This upper runs $575 right now before tax or shipping($640+/-).  The scope and rings sold for over $400 before any fees.
I can add a Rock River lower with RRA 2-stage trigger, Magpul PRS stock, Hogue grip and Ambi safety for $550.  This lower set-up runs over $600 before any fees.
Spike's complete lower $300.  Again, no hurry to get rif of my lowers right now.
Other items shown are:  DPMS std. black stock, I can swap on the Spike's lower, BCM B5 FDE add $40($60 new), Magpul MOE SL FDE add $40($60 new), Magpul MOE FDE, MOE K2 FDE and Blackhawk black grip add $20 for either.  The RRA OD Green A2 stock kit is for .308, $60.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific up front as it makes it a lot easier.  I don't mind questions at all(cash buyers no problem), but please don't string things along with 10-20 messages only to offer a crap trade in the end.  State the details up front if it's a trade, so I can tell you if I am interested or not.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  A few things I might use or use more of:  
Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts(no std. triggers wanted), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace"", Ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace or similar, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I would consider the CZ Scorpion or others.  Maybe a KRISS in either caliber.  I want something with a good trigger, so thinking a piston AR 9mm pistol will be easiest and best value, again, I want something compact.  
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $40, since it will have to be overnight to your FFL.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
