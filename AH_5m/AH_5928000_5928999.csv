Not loaded ammunition.
If you load for 357 Mag. then you may know about these bullets. I bought these along with a bunch of other 357 Mag. reloading supplies. Decided I did not have a need for such a heavy bullet in my 357s, if I need something heavy I'll use my 44 Mag.
These are great for hunting along with general target shooting. They are cast to 18 BHN hardness and can be used up to 1200 fps with little to no leading. Check the website for details www.missouribullet.com/details.php?prodId=119&category=5&secondary=10&keywords=
I think these would be great in a 357 Mag rifle. There are forum disscussion the these can be used in 35 Rem., 358 Win,. etc..
500 of these sell for $41.00 + $12-15.00 for shipping. Graf and Sons sell them for $47.95 + $7.99-9.99 shipping. This come to about 0.11 per bullet.
I will sell these for $30.00 for the 400+ bullets, or about 0.075 ea.
I would trade for a box of 500 Speer 358 Cal 158gr. Lead SWC-HP bullets (these are the soft lead bullets for 38 spec.).
I will also trade these bullet for 125-158 gr. 358 Cal. Lead SWC cast bullets.
Trades for 358 cal. 110-125-158 JHP bullets will be considered.
Please put contact information in reply.
Again I will sell out right for $35.00
Pick up will be in Gilbert evenings/weekend or Tempe during the work week.
