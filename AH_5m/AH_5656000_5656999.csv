It's the 18"" Stainless Steel variant, it comes with a Burris 2-7 long eye relief scout scope, a sling, a soft-case and 3 magazines. The 18"" barrel length is superior to the 16"" option because there is a significant increase in muzzle blast and reduction in velocity when losing those two inches. Stainless steel and a laminate stock also means that this is a truly rugged rifle. No need to worry about rust or warping the stock. The scout scope is attached using quick detach scope mounts, so if you're ever in a situation where the scope is damaged, but you still need to take a shot, you can remove the scope and use the fantastic ghost ring iron sights. Ruger designed the GSR to be adjustable to nearly any body type; this means that the rifle comes with spacers that can either increase, or decrease the length of pull (length from butt-pad to trigger). I am not interested in a trade. And all purchases will obviously be done through a licensed FFL, purchaser to pay the transfer fees."

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual users And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm. Key Features:  Non-radioactive luminescent three dots sights for fast target acquisition. Accessory night sights also available. V3 Double Action/Single Action model has spurred hammer and decocking lever. LEM variants have a no-snag bobbed hammer.

This is the rifle that won the Soviets the war against the German war machine! All numbers are matching, which is relatively rare for this weapon type since most were ""reconditioned"" with parts of other rifles. This example was kept original, down to the bayonet. No force matching.This rifle is a 1927 ""dragoon"", meaning the orginal wood stock has a little more lenth as well as the barrel. I had a plan to sporterize this weapon, but I lost interest sadly. The weapon has an ATI Monte Carlo stock installed, but also includes the orginal wood stock. I haven't even fired the weapon with the ATI stock installed. The wood stock has had many armory repairs, and is not in the best of shape. This makes it perfect for restoration! The barrel is shiny and the blueing is more than 90%. The bolt is smooth, but the trigger spring is a touch heavy, meaning that this weapon was not shot very much. The import stamp is along the left side of the receiver and is marked ""PW ARMS"".Along with the rifle, I will include approximately 280-320 rounds of Hungarian ammunition from 1973 with a small Cabela's plastic ammo can. The ammo will go with the rifle, there is no negotiation. The ATI stock, wood stock, cotton sling, bayonet, and ammo are included in the price of course!The market for these rifles has all but dried up and dealer price is around the $250-$350 range for a 1940s, WW2 example, making this 1927, interwar Hex a great deal! The ATI stock alone is worth $59.99, with the ammo around $70.Lastly, I am not interested in a trade of any kind. I am open to negotiation, but nothing ridiculous please. This"

These AR-15's were built to be law enforcement grade carbines sold to Dade County law enforcement. The rifle has a Spike's Tactical barrel and BCG. It also has a factory trigger job, creating a very crisp break and reset. The furniture is from the UTG Pro line used for law enforcement. The rifle was designed to compete with the Colt LE6920 and S&W M&P carbines. I then further upgraded the rifle with a free float hand guard, replaced the A2 front sight post with an optics ready gas block, Magpul B.A.D. lever, and UTG single point sling adapter (the castle nut is staked). As you can see from the picture, it is optics ready (bring your own sights). Maker: National Armory, Pompano Beach FL.Twist Rate: 1 in 7Caliber: 223/556Barrel Length: 16""Gas System: CarbineBarrel: Spike's Tactical M4 ProfileBCG: Spike's Tactical M16 Profile About the gun:This rifle is a workhorse, extremely accurate and well balanced. I have used it for bench rest marksmanship as well as field training. As with all my rifles, it has been well maintained and lubed. I can honestly say that in 4 years, it has not had a single FTF or FTE. This is a great AR-15 for someone who wants a good reliable all-purpose carbine without having to buy an entry level and upgrade OR spend the money for something like an S&W M&P or LE6920. I currently train with either SBRs or DMRs, so I don't have a need for a carbine anymore in this configuration. Like everyone else, I need to make room in my safe. I have the following investments in the rifle:* Base Rifle - $899 based off the current National Armory website* Magpul B.A.D. Lever - $25* UTG Buffer Tube Mount - $25* Freefloat Handguard - $75 (picked up at a gun show from local fabricator - lightweight)* Magpul Gen2 30 Round Magazine - $12* Rifle case, child lock, paperwork - includedI have roughly $1000 in this rifle. My asking price is fair and firm. It represents a 42% discount over buying all of this new. It is rare to find anything on Armslist at this discount, much less a professional grade AR-15 for under $600. It is priced to move. Cash only. No trades of any kind (cash +ammo, etc). If you want to purchase, we will meet at my local FFL in Apex, NC and go through a proper transfer. I will pay the $30 fee to transfer the rifle."

I hate to part with it, as it is a very good sight, and extremely easy to use. However, I broke my camera and need to pay for repairs. So I would also be open to trades for a working camera or partial trades. Condition: This has been used, but only at the range. As a result it has some scrapes on the metal body, but the lens and all operating parts are in perfect condition. The holographic crosshairs are crisp and very easy for an amateur to pick up and use, but precise enough for a seasoned sharpshooter. Here is the companies description of the site:EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.Specifications:   - Optics: Transmission holography, parallax-free   - Magnification: 1x   - Eye relief: Unlimited   - Waterproof: Submersible to 10 feet ----Key here in Hawaii, it will last, no worry about rain---   - Sealing: Fogproof internal optics   - Adjustment (per click): 0.5 MOA (1/2 inch @ 100 yards)   - Adjustment range: +/- 40 MOA travel   - Mount: 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rail   - Return to zero: Repeatable to 1 MOA after remounting   - Display window optical surfaces: Anti-glare coating   - Window dimensions: 1.2 by 0.85 inches   - Front window material: 1/8-inch solid glass   - Rear window material: Shatter-resistant laminate (3/16 inches thick)   - Field of view: 30 yards @ 100 yards at 4 inches eye relief   - Brightness adjustment range: 110,000:1 (brightest to lowest)   - Night vision compatibility: No   - Power source: Two 1.5-volt AA batteries (supports lithium, alkaline, or rechargeables)   - Battery life: 1,000 continuous hours (lithium) at nominal setting; 600 continuous hours (alkaline)   - Brightness settings: 20 with scrolling feature   - Auto battery check indicator: Flashing reticle upon startup   - Auto shutdown: At 8 hours; programmable to 4 hours   - Dimensions: 5.4 by 2.25 by 2 inches (W x H x D)   - Weight: 10.9 ounces"

This revolutionary Delayed Impingement Gas System puts the recoil system up front over the barrel where it naturally pushes the rifle back down on target instead of up into your shoulder.

It is an off roster handgun in California and can only be purchased through private party transfer. This handgun is outstanding and shoots like a dream! I have always cleaned it after firing and it has always been babied and kept in my safe so it is in excellent condition. This Glock would be a great concealed carry option especially with the extras I am including with it. I don't really want to sell it, but unfortunately I have to because I am in need of money to purchase a new motorcycle.Included with the purchase:- Everything that I had received with the purchase (handgun, 3 10-round original factory magazines w/ pinky extensions, Glock container w/ cable lock and manual)- 2 extra 10-round original factory magazines- Everyday Holsters Master Tuk Deluxe Horse Hide IWB Holster (Normally $80.00+)- IWB Glock 26 Kydex Holster & OWB Single Glock 26 Magazine Kydex Holster custom made by Ted_Cori from eBay ($75.00)So the total for everything is $949.00 which includes the Glock 26 Gen 4, 5 10-round original factory magazines (3 of which have the pinky extension), the Glock container including the cable lock and manual, the Everyday Holsters Master Tuk Deluxe Horse Hide IWB holster, and the custom made IWB Glock 26 & OWB Glock 26 Single Magazine Kydex holsters. I want to sell everything as a bundle, so I most likely will not sell anything separately. Price is firm, but I MAY be willing to entertain reasonable offers. Don't be upset if I decline any of your offers that are not anywhere near what I'm asking. So please do your research before shooting me a message with a lowball offer. Thanks for checking out my ad! Goodluck!Description as listed on Glock's website:The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994.

The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology.
