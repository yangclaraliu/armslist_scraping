Comes with 5 magazines. What you see is what you get! Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. Features:  Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Extended slide release Patented Lock-Out Safety device  Specifications:  Caliber: .40 S&W Overall Length: 7.68"" Overall Height: 5.31"" Overall Width: 1.26"" Barrel Length: 4.25"" Sight Radius: 6.22"" Weight without Magazine: 28.96 oz Weight with Empty Magazine: 1.82 lb Magazine Capacity: 10/13 Rounds Trigger System: Double Action / Single Action Trigger Pull (DA/SA): 51 N / 20 N Sights: Fixed"

Whether you shoot 9mm, .40 S&W, or .357 Sig, the GSF is up to the task of delivering rounds on target with more accuracy and power than a handgun, all in a package that is tighter and easier to control than a rifle-caliber firearm. Form and function play equal roles in our design, and the GSF not only runs like clockwork, it looks the part. With a simple yet distinctive aesthetic, the GSF lower immediately draws attention, but also fits right in among other tactical weapons."

This rifle took months and months of research to get all the parts I wanted before I ever put money into it. I spent well over $1300 to build this and am pretty firm on the $1150 price tag I have listed. I am not interested in trades since they will not help me get closer to my truck. Here is a list of the parts in this build:Anderson Manufacturing LowerBushmaster LPKHexmag Tactical GripB5 Systems Enhanced SOPMOD StockCombat Shooters Gladius Ambidextrous Charging HandleCombat Shooters UpperCenturion Arms Bolt Carrier GroupDel-Ton 14.5"" Pre Ban Carbine BarrelMonstrum Tactical Drop in HandguardsMonstrum Tactical Vertical Grip2x Hexmag Magazines with grip tapeUncle Mike's Tactical Rifle CaseNCStar VISM Eco Battle Scope 4x34 with green laser, infrared light, and illuminated reticle (with case)I will also throw in any parts I didn't use, but came with other packages of parts.There are other little things here and there, but those are the main components. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Thanks for looking!"

Probably the most unique is the Sauer and Sohn 38H. This one was made late in the war 1944/45. Since these were never exported to the US this is more than likely a trophy or ""bring back"" of a US soldier. I have no papers to prove that though.Like the modern day Sig-Sauers this gun has the same style of decocker. What is most uniqe about this old gun is that the same lever that decocks the hammer, when depressed again will cock or re-cock the hammer. This feature still works and the gun shoots fine. It has an original Sauer magazine but the grips are reproductions. The original grips were very brittle and are very rare. It had a set of home made wooden grips on it when I bought it. I'll include them if you want them.Not interested in any trades, cash only !!  Reasonable offers will be entertained. All laws will be followed.

Scoped with quality 1x9 variable power optic and steel blued weaver rings. Fired 37 rounds of basic hunting loads into 1.5 inch group at 100 yards and can likely do better with higher end ammo and better eyes on the shooters part. Its a lovely rifle and needs a new home to help me cover bills for family. 650 or best offer which is below book and street for just the Rifle. You get it sighted in with a scope. Feel free to ask any questions but serious inquiries only.
