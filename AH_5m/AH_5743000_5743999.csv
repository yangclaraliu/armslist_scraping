It includes 3 gen 3 Pmags, Magpul flip up sights, 100 rounds of Federal green tip and a new piston upper made by Adams Arms. The reason I have included the upper is because when a piston is added to an AR-15, the bolt tends to rub the upper, it doesnt effect anything, just looks ugly when the paint wears off. The Adams Arms piston upper is wider to solve that problem. You can install it, or save it for later. I have put about 200-300 rounds through this rifle. If you would like specs on the Core-15 piston rifle, they sell it at Buds online. If interested, we will need to do an FFL for this rifle. It is $30 if done at Norpoint. I am asking $750, which is fair considering the rifle, not including the Pmags, Magpul flip up sights, upgraded upper receiver and ammo sells for around $700. No trades. Thanks for looking. Josh REDACTED"

I'm not interested in any other caliber. I want a fixed stock or possibly a side folder (no wire stocks or underfolders). I have cash and some trade items on top if we go in excess of my cash budget. I'm not looking to be gouged either, if I want that I'll turn to Gunbroker. I'm willing to pay a fair price. $1200 for a used AK, that sold new for $1000 is not what I consider a fair price. Number one one on the list is an Arsenal SLR 107FR. I'm not looking for anything too customized, I prefer a more classic style AK. The 107 is about as ""wild"" as I'd like to go. Thank you."

Originals are typically a couple thousand dollars, back in their day they cost $14 (todays equivilant of $500 or so) the Colt M1860s were standard issue until 1871 if I remember right, the M1871 being a centerfire gun. Many centerfire conversions are out there for the 1860 Army, and I probrobly would have done one if I had the tooling, this gun holds 6 shots, but people typically loaded 5 for safety reasons, this gun hasn't been shot much, since it needs a pin replaced, and I havn't gotten around to it yet. The wood is beautiful, and the color case hardening and bluing are beautiful too. It's stored in a climate controlled safe, and I think you're probrobly done hearing my ramblings, if you're interested, just contract me, this is a non ffl item. These guns are about $200-220 used, this one also comes with $150 or so worth of extras, so I'd say 300 is pretty fair, like I said, if you're interested, just contact me."

This gun comes with 2 barrels (9mm & 22 TCM). This is the gun you have been waiting for. It shoots a special round which is a shortened 5.56NATO/.223 round and is currently the world’s fastest production round @ 2100 FPS through a 5"" barrel! This is 400 FPS faster than the FN 5.7!!!! Famous for mastering the development of the 1911 platform for over 30 years, we've advanced the scope of our research and engineering team with the commercial launch of the meteoric 22 TCM cartridge in the 1911 format. Delivering over 2000 fps in a handgun while offering both single stack and high capacity options, the TCM series introduces the most potent and versatile 1911 in the market today. It's known for light recoil without sacrifice in muzzle energy and penetrating impact abilities. Also built in mid-size, full size and high capacity options with both Standard and Tactical configurations. Each TCM series handgun includes a drop-in 9mm barrel adding another proven ammunition option in one firearm. Once you rule the fire breathing dragon, you'll never want to put it down. When a new caliber comes along, it can be tough to adopt if you're set in your ways. And while your go-to might have done right by you for decades, it sometimes pays to be open-minded to a little enhancement. Case in point, the 22TCM line of pistols - it takes the best of both worlds and positions itself as a viable defense option for any experienced shooter. ""We're very excited to offer the latest generation of .22 TCM pistols to the American public"", said Martin Tuason, President and CEO of Armscor / Rock Island Armory. ""It's been our goal all along to give shooters the ability to discover the advantages of this new cartridge and we're confident shooting enthusiasts will recognize the value behind the conversion kits."" This latest move follows Armscor’s recent ramp up of US based .22 TCM ammo production to accommodate for consumer demand. About the TCM series: The TCM series was inspired by the need for more firepower in lower caliber firearms and ammo. The series was designed and developed by Armscor / Rock Island Armory executives - President, Martin Tuason and Master Firearm Engineer Fred Craig. TCM stands for Tuason-Craig-Magnum. The .22 TCM round has been called the “Flame Thrower” by one prominent reviewer and has been embraced by hunters, self-defense and shooting enthusiasts. The overwhelming demand for the bullet’s industry-leading high velocity and stopping power has prompted the company to expand its US production facilities. Armscor USA .22TCM centerfire bullet features:   Velocity – 2,000 feet per second  40 grain jacketed hollow point Maximum expansion  Frame front strap serration. Full length dust cover with picatinny rail. Slide double wide serration, flat top. Bushing type and clark cut type barrel. Full length guide rod. Plastic checkered mainspring housing.
