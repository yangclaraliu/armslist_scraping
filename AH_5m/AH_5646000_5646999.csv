As you can see, the firearm comes comes with a Crismon Trace laser, one standard magazine, three premium extended magazines, two new replacement recoil and firing pin springs, and holster. Note the firearm does not fit inside the holster because of the addition of the Crismon Trace laser. The gun is in excellent condiction with minimal expected wear from having very few rounds put through the gun.  Everything works. You are basically getting an ""almost"" brand new gun. The only reason I am selling is because I bought a Sig Sauer P938 in 9mm, which is basically the same as this one but in a larger caliber.  I absolutely love this gun, but I do not need two backups. I will pay to insure and ship in the continental United States only. I will use my local FFL to deliver to your local FFL. You will need to cover your local FFL fees.Since this is the first time I have sold a firearm on this website, I will let you know I am an attorney in Arizona.

I'd prefer the trade be a XDm or a Glock but open to ideas. It comes with (3) 15 round mags along with a 30 round mag all from beretta. Three holsters (Blackhawk, beretta, and versacarry) and the box it came in. If you want to trade me a larger caliber handgun I'll also trade 500 rounds of 9mm for same amount of rounds with whatever caliber you have. Love the gun so not in a rush to trade or sell.

I bought this on a whim a few months back and it really doesn't fit my current collecting needs (see my trade section for what I am into at the moment). That being said it shoots great and is quite a bit of fun to plink around with. It ate up some 9x18mm hollowpoints I had with no problem so this could make a neat little self-defense or bedside gun if you are so inclined.The pistol will come with two magazines, two sets of grips, a military style holster and a neoprene IWB holster that fits it. $350 is a little less than I paid for it a few months ago, so with the extra grips I bought this is a pretty good deal. I will need to see a Georgia ID or military orders to make the sale legit. Please be willing to sign a bill of sale as well, just for the sake of record keeping. I prefer to do transactions in and around Columbus, but I'm willing to drive a little bit for the right deal or trade. Please contact me via text message at 610-three four nine- 2750 or email.

This is probably cosmetically the nicest Soviet Mosin I have ever seen (and I own quite a few) but it doesn't fit in my current collecting focus and I want to free up some funds for other purchases. The 91/59 has a somewhat murky history, but what most people can agree on is that it they were shortened sometime after WW2 for use by police or internal security forces (the ""we will make you talk comrade"" variety) by Russia or one of the Soviet buffer states. What I can tell you for sure is that this rifle is SUPER nice. It has a nice deep rich blue and an incredible stock that is free of the usual Soviet flaky shellac. I'm not sure why the commies took such care on these carbines, but they actually did a heck of a good job. Only flaw in the wood are some compression dents on the left side below the reciever (it looks like from a rifle bolt being pressed against it while in a transport crate). While I personally prefer to keep it in original condition this would make a neat sporter rifle if you are so inclined due the reduced length. If you are going to go that route let me know and I can cut you a deal where I'll keep the stock and hardware you don't need and sell you the barreled action for a reduced price. Please text me at 610 - three four nine - 2750 or email me through Armslist. I prefer to do a face to face in or around Lawton, but I'm willing to drive a little bit for the right deal."

It's the same thing as a Mossberg 500. Has a screw in full choke in it. The good, it shoots everytime you squeeze the trigger. The bad is the safety broke but still works. It just slides too easy and will slide back into the safe position just by lifting the muzzle up. You can get a new safety for a Mossberg 500 off Ebay for $10. Also the gun is picky when it comes to ejecting certain shells. Certain shells it cycles perfect while others it won't throw the shells out. It may just need a super thorough cleaning. I do clean and oil after shooting it but I haven't used it in a while. It's an otherwise reliable gun and I've had it for about 15 years. It has been painted but could use a fresh painting or just use it like it is. Must have a valid NC drivers license and can legally have a gun. Thanks for looking. I have a few more pics I can text upon request. Jamie. REDACTED7-10-16 update: Replaced the safety with a new one. Safety works great now."

I used brake cleaner to get most of it off but I didn't do an absolute perfect job, so there's still a bit of tan paint in the cracks/grooves/lettering but it's just looks and a fine toothbrush can probably clean it the rest of the way up.

ITEM IS NEW IN BOX FROM WAREHOUSE.MatteFiredot Duplex Illuminated ReticleTakes the legendary Leupold-designed Duplex reticle and adds an extra-bright centerpoint dot. Ideal for quick target acquisition and the broadest range of game applications.Quantum Optical SystemLeupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk Leupold's when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.Extended Battery Life30mm MaintubeTactile Leupold Selector6061-T6 Aircraft Quality AluminumSpecificationsLinear Field of View (ft/100 yd): Low 22 ft., High 10.4 ft.Eye Relief (in): Low 6.7 inches, High 3.5 inchesweight (oz): 16.5 oz.Objective Clear Aperture (in): 2.0 inchesElevation Adjustment Range: 75 MOAWindage Adjustment Range: 75 MOA"
