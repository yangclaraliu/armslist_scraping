This is one of the limited run #778 of 2500 Glock 17's.  It utilizes the very grippy RTF2 frame and comes with the two mags.  Everything pictured.  It also has had an upgraded ghost trigger/spring pack installed.  Nice trigger.
It really is a nice and unique piece for the Glock fan.
Looking to trade for something or sell.  I'd take cash of $750 considering it's in excellent condition.  I'd say ""unfired"" because it appears to have only been test fired, but I'm not the original owner so I can't say with certainty.
Trade wise, I'm expecting to get a solid $750-800 in value.  Cash I can be a bit more flexible.  I am wanting a CZ SP01.  Preferrably with trigger work.  I'd trade even for one in like new condition.  A second pistol choice is a sig that has an SRT and e2 grips.  I'd consider an M&P Pro PC.  9mm's only.

Its been sitting on my shelf for a year now and i am the second owner. Neither i nor the first owner ever used it and it basically sits factory new or mint condition. I have no desire to sight my ak in any longer. For those of you who dont know, this is the russian eotech equivalent. The box has 3 scratches but it has kept the contents in perfect condition. THIS IS NO FAKE, the owners manual has the authentication signature on the back of it.This is an early model so it does not have a sunshade nore does it need one with the level of brightness you can select.  I have other projects/needs and this red dot will never see the range. I will entertain long gun trades or cash offers only. Now lowballs. WILL SEND PICS OF RETICLES UPON REQUEST These sights are going for 400 on atlantic firearms plus shipping."

Research shows there was probably much less than 500 of the .45 made. But that's unclear. HK had a limited run of colored framed pistols in 2004 and only made 500 of each variant. You're looking at a Desert Tan USP Compact .40 with night sights, LNIB unfired. Also a USP 45 ""CUSTOM COMBAT"" variant, factory fiber optic Novak sights. LNIB. Possibly unfired. Slight sign of wear on barrel hood. This is really the most obvious and first place that shows wear on USP's. The miniscule amount on this one may only be from fondling /racking the slide back. You never see these pistols for sale. Once in a blue moon one pops up, but never in the condition these are in. I also have an HK logo UTL pistol light that is also rare and no longer in production. This one has only been taken out of the box for the purpose of displaying it on my pistol. All of these items were bought buy me to be safe queens and to be admired, never fired. If you're an HK fan you probably know you'll never see these for sell again, especially in this condition. HK will never release a colored framed USP again(fans have been asking them to for years and tried organizing group buys, it just won't happen) P.S. Sorry 9mm fans, HK never released any color framed USPs in 9mm.. Only 40 and 45.I want $900 for the USP Compact .40, $1500 for the USP .45 Custom Combat, And $200 for the light.

Comes with the ergonomic factory grip installed (not the standard ak grip, 2 tapco 30rd mags (one is stippled), a quad rail (not installed), 2 sets of black Magpul snap together rail covers (so that's 8 covers) trigger, hammer, and bolt carrier contact surfaces have been polished (has tapco G2 fire control group factory installed), safety selector has been made easier to use (but movement of selector still has to be deliberate), and a new recoil spring (not installed). Say at what you will about century, but the only issue that I've had with this rifle was due to ammo, I purchased a new recoil spring thinking that was the problem, that didn't fix it so I put the original spring back in, changed ammo, and it functioned flawless again. Getting rid of this to fund a new project gun, otherwise I would keep it, just so happens that this is the gun I shoot the least, so it's the one to go."

I am the 2nd owner of this gun and have never fired it. The original owner only shot a box of shells through it and that was it. Leaving this gun like new and not even broken in yet. The almost non existent turn line proves that.

Browning designed M1911. The Black Label 1911-380 is 85 percent the size of a Model 1911 in .45 ACP, making it a more compact pistol for concealed carry, yet the grip is long and wide enough to allow much greater shooting control than is offered by smaller .380 ACP pistols. Similar to a full-size 1911, the Browning 1911-380 operates with a locked-breech recoil-operated system, which uses a much-lighter recoil spring than blowback-operated 380 pistols, making manual operation of the slide easy. Disassembly of the 1911-380 is also similar to a full-size 1911. The Black Label 1911-380 is constructed with a composite mainframe, with separate grip panels, and a matte black finished steel slide. The grip features a flared beavertail grip safety with a checkered and raised memory bump. The flat mainspring housing has a non-aggressive textured pattern to aid in providing a sure grip. The extended ambidextrous thumb safety is easy to reach and intuitive to operate with either hand. Low-profile combat sights minimize the risk of snagging when drawing the pistol and provide rapid sight acquisition. The Browning Black Label 1911-380 Semi-Auto Pistol is a thin, compact concealed carry pistol, just large enough to be user friendly and easy to hit targets with. Comes with 1 8-round, heat-treated steel magazine and a black ABS gun case.

Overall it is in Good to Very good condition. There is obvious Honest wear and some of the bluing is getting thin. This is a 22 over 20 ga. Meaning that the upper barrel will shoot .22Lr and the Lower barrel will shoot 20 ga up to 3 inch shells. You just set the hammer to fire either the upper or the lower. It will not shoot both barrels at the same time. I have 5 of this style gun. We use ours for Squirrel and Rabbit hunting. It's a very unique and handy to have these calibers while hunting small game. Really nice looking tiger pattern wood. Almost perfect wood. Shotgun barrel (lower) barrel show virtually Zero wear. The .22 LR barrel (Upper) has a spot that has some signs of darkening although the rifling looks sharp.I will consider almost any firearm in trade. I prefer long arms with Wood furniture. I am not really into tactical stuff.  Please reply to Matt nine8 nine six4 zero 4 one three 3.

This gun is absolutely brand new unfired, not a single round through it. The gun has everything that came from the factory (mags, box, papers, lock etc). This gun is absolutely brand spanking new so obviously there isn't any single scratch/mark/wear on there what so ever, never even loaded. Taking a loss and selling it for $500, paid over $700 for it since this gun is brand new. this is the best price out there I've seen for a brand new HK P30sk. It wont last at this price so act fast if you want it. 

Text me at REDACTED, located in Gainesville. I have classes in the morning so I'll be free after 3 p.m. everyday. Thanks for your time and interest. If the listing is up then it is still available, reason for selling is to pay for upgrades on my truck.
