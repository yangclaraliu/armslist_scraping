Has Houge Walnut grips installed. Bore is excellent. Gun is not perfect, if it was it would be $1200.00++++. I am the second owner of this gun. Gun has some surface rust with minor pitting that can easily be addressed by qualified re finishers. The previous owner’s grandson attempted to remove some of the surface issues on the top of the slide at the muzzle. The factory bluing is thin/gone at this area and had some bluing reapplied. It doesn’t look great, but it doesn’t look terrible either. A quality rebluing would return this gun to its original glory, or you can add it to your collection as is and have a fantastic ring hammer shooter. I have priced it to be attractive in either scenario.  I have tried to describe and show the gun’s condition as accurately as possible.

What makes this unique is that it is a piston operated system, which is generally under-pressured for piston operated firearms. So why a piston system? You get much cleaner and cooler operation because no hot, carbon infused gas is being blown back into the receiver to cycle the action, making it a fantastic choice for the suppressor optimized 300 BLK cartridge. Suppressed rifles on a DI system are infamous for overpressure and excessive gas blowback, and a piston system will solve those worries. So far, I have run the pistol unsuppressed. 150 grain American Eagle works flawlessly and even locks back the action, and I have had moderate success with 120 grain Remington loads. I have yet to try this system with a suppressor, and it does not cycle reliable using subsonic loads and no suppressor, but I am sure you will be able to make it work with subsonic loads as long as you are using a barrel extension or a suppressor to give it the extra pressure it needs to cycle. If interested or if you have any questions, feel free to send me a text or an e-mail at REDACTED or REDACTED_________________________________________________Much research, and money, has been spent getting this build into working condition. Well over $1600 has been spent on this build, but I am selling it for only $900 because I am trying to cut my losses after getting this system to run.

The Plano hard case is extremely strong and has 2 rolling wheels to help get around. The 24"" bull barrel is very heavy and keeps the rifle very stable for those long distance shots. The scope is a Leupold Mark 4 knockoff but a very high quality one. Never any issues or cloudy on high power setting. It is very easily adjustable. The 60mm objective lens really lets the light in and is very clear. The hard case is the strongest case I have ever found in my 40 years of shooting. That is why they are so expensive.

The feature-packed Buck Mark URX starts with a machined 7075 aluminum alloy semi-automatic pistol frame, with ambidextrous overmolded soft nitrile Ultragrip RX® grip panels, with finger grooves that help place the hand in the same position on the grip every shot, resulting in an instinctual hold that improves accuracy; a textured surface provides a secure hold in any type of shooting environment. A tapered, bull barrel balances the pistol's weight perfectly, while the Pro-Target™ adjustable rear sight and a TRUGLO/Marble Arms fiber optic front sight allow you to dial in for precision shooting at small targets. A non-reflective matte finish on the barrel and receiver won't spook game and issues an overall appearance of seriousness. The Browning Buck Mark Practical URX Semi-Auto Rimfire Pistol operates on the Buck Mark's simple, straight blowback action that has been proven over time to be ultra-reliable. The Buck Mark uses a 10-round magazine with a durable heat-treated body, and coil springs that ensures consistent pressure on the shell follower at the proper angle. The magazine release is conveniently positioned next to the trigger guard where it is easily reached.

This rifle is a great shooter, at least for as long as your shoulder can take. These rifles are getting more difficult to find by the day, so don't miss this chance to own one! Message me with any questions and I will be more than happy to answer.Also, the marks on the side of the front sight base are from a scope mount that used the pinholes for mount. Also, as a result of that, the release pin at the top from of the sight has been replaced with a nut and bolt, but does still fully flip the sight to reveal the leaf spring. The stock probably needs the refinishing job that I never got around to. Other than that, this rifle is flawless! Bluing is good and I've always filled any scratch with cold blue immediately after cleaning.I do not have bayonet, sling, oils bottles, etc. It is rifle and ammo only.More pictures available upon requestWill also listen to offers.

The hammer and trigger are stamped ""M601"". There are three proof marks on the top of the chamber: A crown, a pair of crossed rifles, and a third one I cannot make out.
This flare gun is in excellent shape, fully functional and good cosmetics. There is a repaired chip on the butt of the grips.
The barrel has a small nubbin on the left hand side as if it wants a barrel extender or line attachment.
Here is what I learned about this model: It is a No. 2 Mk 5 model. The No1 Mk 5 is similar but has a longer flared barrel. The caliber is 1"". The number M601 is a war time (WW2) British manufactures code.
M601 is made by the I.L. Berridge & Co of Leicester, England. They were commercial knitting machine manufactures, they are no longer in business. 
The flare tins have both been opened. One is full with three flares. One only has two flares. All appear in excellent condition, but I cannot vouch for their function.Asking $250 shipped."

If you add all the accessories, ammo, mags and the gun up, you’re in to it about 1600 dollars.  My asking price is 1300 for all of it.  I don’t really want to split things up, especially the accessories because some of the factory parts are gone and I’m not going to put the time in to trying to source new ones. 
I don’t do cash and carry.  If you buy this, you MUST meet me at a local FFL to do the deal.  I don’t need to sell this gun, I just don’t shoot it as much as I thought I would.  I am firm on the price.  There is a little wiggle room, but not much. As for trades, about the only trade I would consider would be a Sig P226, an FNX 45 Tactical in FDE or something higher end like that.  
Thanks."
