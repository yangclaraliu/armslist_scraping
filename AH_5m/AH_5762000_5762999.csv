I am replacing the gun with a 40 that's the only reason I am selling it. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I fired about 25 rounds through it, so it is not even broken in yet. Capacity is 7+1.
I purchased a new Magpul FDE Forend & Buttstock for it as well as forward and rear sling attachment points. I also purchased a Mesa Tactical 6-shot, Sureshell billet aluminum Shotshell carrier. These are brand new parts that were never used. As a service to the buyer, I installed all of them onto the shotgun to save the purchaser several hours of install time. All parts were purchased locally to support my local firearms dealers.
Total invested into the shotgun, Magpul, & Mesa Tactical parts, tax on the gun & parts, & background check is $780."

Trade offers will be ignored as well. Not being harsh, just saving us both time up front. I can meet serious buyers in the South Charlotte area to check it out.
