The k31 is prized for it's accuracy and ease of use thanks to the straight pull bolt action. This is my personal firearm that I am putting up. I have enjoyed owning it and have cared for it immensely but recent changes in my life now lead to your benefit.I only took it out a few times to plink with it and each time it was cleaned top and bottom. All the serials match. The wood is in remarkably good condition but like a good majority of these guns it does have dings. However, there are no cracks. The metal retains a large majority of it's bluing and the stampings are quite clear. The bore is bright and she shoots true. 
Included in the auction is 8 rounds of the beloved 7.5 swiss ammunition to get you started. If you need more info or pictures, by all means let me know.We will agree on terms of a meet up, I know a couple gun stores in my area that will make everything go over smoothly."

Everything about this shotgun is almost identical to the mauser rifle except beefed up.
This is a single shot shotgun, the magazine exists only because the extractor is controlled feed and can only chamber rounds from the magazine.
I got it in a lot and it was missing the stock..shouldn’t be hard to find a k98 stock to enlarge for the bigger barrel.  Although I would deem this as a wall hanger or parts gun.  This shotgun is not meant for today’s high velocity loads! 
Barrel is rough, some larger pitting, receiver is good, just needs a good cleaning. Matching serials on bolt and action parts.

Don’t know much about its history but the receiver and barrel looks to be solid with no major damage. Based on the markings, my best guess is that it was manufactured in the 1916 to 1919 era and it has the visible character to prove it. These were dubbed as the “Visible Loaders” due to the visible loading breech as you pumped the slide.
The barrel seems to be clear of obstructions and it has a smooth bore. Rear stock is nice, front hand pump grip has a crack that could be easily glued.
Would make a fun resto assembly project or mantle piece.
