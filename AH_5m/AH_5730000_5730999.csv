Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

These pistols were announced early in 1990s and are sold worldwide for civilian market.All Firestars are compact, steel-framed semi-automatic pistols. Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy. 9mm Firestar M-43 is a hammer fired, single action pistol with frame mounted, ambidextrous safety lever. .40sw M-40 and .45acp M-45, unlike their 9mm brother, are double action pistols with similar frame mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry (hammer is cocked and safey is applied). All Firestars featured automated firing pin safey and magazine disconnect safety. Single column magazine holds 7 rounds in 9mm M-43 pistols or 6 rounds in .40sw M-40 and .45acp M-45 pistols. Also, extended 8 rounds capacity magazines available for 9mm M-43 guns.Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their respective calibers, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the guns."
