The bolt was sent to a smith in AZ for a tactical knob and I purchased a Remington PSS police rifle stock (HS Precision) to replace the Hogue it came with. I researced each bit heavily. I finally put it all together and fired exactly 60 rounds of Federal Gold Medal Match through it and was getting solid 1 MOA groups. This was my first try at precision shooting and I'm not great. The gun is better. I stripped it down to return to Remington for the recall in 2014 and never reassembled it. I sold the Falcon Menace scope I had then and got another in the interim. This one has never been mounted. Great scope. Shooters love them.All in all I think this is a great kit.I have appx $1,700 in the package. I will take $1,200.

This Glock has a brand new (a month old) set of Truglo TFX sights, a SSVI Tyr Trigger, and a Glock factory competition extended slide lock. It also comes with 7 mags, and a holster. I'll list everything in detail below with exactly how much I paid for it. Comes with everything from the factory EXCEPT I'm missing the large backstrap without the beavertail.Package includes:Glock 19, Gen 4 ($550)Truglo TFX Fiber Optic/Tritium steel night sights. Awesome design, ultra bright in the day and night. Honestly the best sights I've used on a handgun, and I've used them all.($129)SSVI Tyr Trigger- Trigger sits differently in the trigger guard, which affects the placement of your finger, and gains better leverage. It is significantly cleaner, smoother and more predictable than the factory Glock trigger, and has a very short reset($160)Glock Factory Extended Slide Lock ($25)Factory trigger, factory STEEL Glock sights, factory slide lock. Can install factory parts for you quickly and/or show you how to do it in under 90 seconds.3 Factory Glock 15 round magazines.3 Magpul PMag 17 round mags ($60)31 round ETS magazine (Very high quality mag) ($25)Safariland ALS duty holster (Paddle) ($60)Glock Tool ($20)3 Backstraps. Missing the large one without the beaver tailThe above prices listed are what I paid for everything which is ($1029), that doesn't include shipping and the fee to install the sights. I'm sitting at about ($1100) into this gun, which I know I won't even come close to getting out of it when I sell/trade it, and I'm fine with that. I wanted a great defense/carry package, it served its purpose but now I'm looking to move on to something else.I'm asking $800 for this package, although I am MAINLY looking to trade for a HK P2000 9mm w/extras or cash. The P2000 has had a recent price drop, making them available for $600-$650 NEW online in most places (CDNN, Buds, etc.) So, if I can't find any good trade deals I'll just sell the Glock for cash and purchase a brand new HK. I am in absolutely no rush to sell/trade this, so please don't try and lowball me. I've been doing this long enough to know what a good deal looks like.Best way to contact me would be by texting REDACTED at any time.

Belgium made. Leupold mount and rings. Nikon 3-9 x 40 Prostaff scope. Price is $750 no trade at the moment.
 
This has been my go to hunting rifle for the past 4 years that I have owned it only reason I am selling is that I recently purchased a BAR in 300 mag. Stock is in overall good condition maybe a slight ding or scratch but nothing serious. The bluing is gone on the sides of the receiver, a place or two on the barrel and around the muzzle. It is kept wiped down good so no rust. I do have the flip down rear site and pin for it. I removed it to install the scope as low as possible. Gun is sited in for 165 gr reloads and is very accurate. No idea on round count as I bought the gun second hand.
 
This rifle is far from a safe queen but if you are looking for a accurate hunting rifle that cycles reliable and hits its mark this gun is for you.
 
Located in Southwest MS but can travel for serious buyer.

Gun is a consistent sub - MOA shooter.  Round count is @300.      
Gun has 21"" barrel with recessed crown.  I had barrel cut to 21"" with recessed crown instead of traditional 20"" target crown on LTR.  I wanted to leave ""meat"" on the barrel in case I wanted to re-cut to target crown or have it threaded for a can.  Work done by a real gunsmith in Minnesota.  Exceptionally nice work.I will sell gun in any number of configurations-

Barrelled action w/ bolt and trigger group - $700
