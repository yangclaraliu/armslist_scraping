Comes with two magazines, extra Pearce grip, and cleaning/takedown tool. Has fewer parts than any other double/single action pistol made and strips down easily. Really an ingenious design. Handles hot loads from the likes of Underwood Ammo and Buffalo Bore as this pistol was designed and built for the 9mm Mak round only this model has the .380 barrel. Not finicky about ammo, it eats anything including cheap reloads that choke my other guns. Price is $260 firm or $280 firm with tuckable iwb holster and one box fmj ammo.

It is a 1960s-era 22L rifle in flawless condition with authentic walnut wood polished and unstained. The sturdy, steel scope is a weaver, and is the original scope that was sold with the rifle. This is an extremely valuable piece from a long forgotten era, and one that I with great sorrow must part with. It is a clip-fed semi automatic .22 caliber, harkening back to an age when Winchester made their rifles with pride and only the best would do. As said above, the rifle is in flawless condition, comes with a neat carrying case, and is priced considerably below market. It is pretty difficult to find a model 77 for sale with the originial weaver scope; on Gunbroker one recently sold for nearly $500 and did not even come with the original Weaver scope.If you are interested, shoot me an email and I'll get back with you as soon as possible!Sorry, no tradesDue to recent controversies, no shipping"

The most popular of these would be the model 642 Airweight featuring a aluminum frame and stainless steel barrel and cylinder rated for +P 38 special rounds, which run from $350-$425. Amazing gun, Hammerless to prevent snag, and perfect for firing in a pocket without worrying about a slide catching on anything (semi-auto) that would cause malfunction, and a hammerless design to ensure you round goes off without any hammer dropping blockages. This model Airlite in particular contains a scandium built frame, for those who don't know is a extremely rare element found primarily in mines of Russia (which Smith and Wesson has mining rights on), used for crafting MIG fighter jet alloys and metal casings on air strike missiles. A titanium cylinder, which is as resilient as stainless steel and a fraction of the weight, topped off off in a nice little pocket cannon package. These scandium/titanium snub noses originally retailed at over $1000 dollars but over time have dropped down to a semi affordable price and are extremely rare to find from private sellers due to its perfection for concealed carry satifsfaction, in reliability, stopping power, and on person comfort. For more high detailed pictures and a faster response text (918) 931-602six."

Handpicked from a large stock of rifles back in 2008. Stock is original and in great condition, clean shiny bore, and bluing looks perfect. The bolt is very smooth, and the gun has ""outshot"" me every time in terms of accuracy. Gun is in mint condition without any previous corrosion. It has been cleaned thouroughly after every use (since Mosin Nagant ammo is corrosive and I'm a little OCD about that stuff). It is rare to find a Mosin Nagant with a barrel/bore of this quality, and the only reason I am selling it is because I bought an AR-15 and shoot primarily with that now. 

Over $600 spent when factoring in the original purchase price, scope, gunsmithing to install scope, included ammo, and case, accessories, etc. Selling for $400 with 200 rounds of ammo included, no low ball offers please. Text me if you would like more photos, or if you have any questions at REDACTED-Mike"
