$1,080 in cash or a little better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

The gun is in great condition, as the pictures show. The pictures make the gun look stainless or silver, but it isn't; The gun is wearing its original 80-year-old factory blued finish. I am the second owner of this gun after 80 years, and I have never shot it, and the previous owner shot it very, very little. I am posting this ad to check interest in the gun, as I have only recently considered selling it. I am open to realistic offers, but low-ball offers will be ignored. Finally, NO, I do not want to trade for your bass boat, motorcycle, hang glider, Hi-Point, or Ruger 10/22. Very few trades will be considered, but would include genuine Rolex watches, quality firearms that I am interested in, or 100% legal tender. I have taken much better pictures of the gun, which clearly show the guns excellent overall condition.Price is OBO.Thanks for your interest!"

Feel free to ask any questions. Retail on these grips is $399. Kimber no longer sells them on their site and you cannot buy this model from Crimson Trace. Will consider reasonable offers. 
 
Crimson Trace Master Series® Lasergrips with durable G10 material and exclusive slash/ checkered pattern to aid in sure grip without sharp points that snag. 
 
As seen on Kimber Master Carry pistols. 
 
Activated by a pressure pad just below the trigger guard, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, an important aid in training. Also features manual on/off switch on grip. Reading the dot immediately shows the advantage of proper grip and trigger control, which can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter. 
 
Installation is simple and the laser is adjustable for windage and elevation. 
 
Fits Kimber Full Size and Pro and Ultra+ models with round heel frames. Also fits other manufacturer round heel clones."

I traded for this 4 months ago and have only put 120 rounds through it. The person who traded it to me built the pistol, put a ""few hundred rounds through it"" and apparently was more interested in an AR pistol. It's clean, taken care of, and put together well. I'm surprised how accurate this thing is with the red dot. I like the pistol. It is cool and works surprisingly well judging from the little I've shot it. Unfortunately I don’t have the time/money to take it to the range, and am selling because the right amount of money would be put to better use than the pistol.
The original owner said he had $1500 invested in the gun itself. His ad is listed below. It will come win a hard case with the 6 magazines listed in his ad. I do NOT have the TruGlow light. He kept it as part of our trade.
Price is negotiable just make me an offer or get ahold of me if you have any questions or want more photos. Listing for same price as original ad because I can't find any of the HG2137-N's in stock.  ORIGINAL AD:
 For sale is a Mini Draco with 7.5 inch chrome lined, cold hammer forged barrel. The gun is a 2015 with a few hundred rounds through it, and everything is tight and straight. This comes with everything in the picture (list below). This is sold as a pistol with an arm brace attached. There is fifteen hundred in the gun alone along with three hundred dollars worth of just puchased ammo. I am open to trades of a 16"" ar or an ar-pistol. Armslist will only allow for one pic, but I can send more upon request.   Extras are as follows:  -Century Arms Arm Brace -Texas Weapon Systems Dog Leg Rail -Primary Arms Micro Dot -Midwest Industries Fore Grip w/ micro dot mount and picatinny mount (modified) -Dead Ringer Ghost Ring Sights -MagPul Angled Fore Grip -AWC Finger Mould Pistol Grip-TruGlow Tru-point 200 lumen light/laser with quick detach and pressure switch-4 MagPul mags, 1 Tapco mag, and 1 steel mag -G2 Single Hook Trigger Group -A2 Flash Hidder"

I bought this for a project that went another direction and paid $245. for it plus shipping and waited 4 weeks to get it from Germany. From the Nill website: Surface: Rhomlas (black) oiled Size: Standard Hand: B Material: Walnut Group: A Frametype: SIG 550 Model: SG 550 / 551 / 552 / 553 / Stgw 90 / 90 PE Please note that due to the changed frame contour our grips will only fit SIG versions of the original 550 / 551 / 552 / 553 / 90 PE Series but NOT at the 556 specimen. This comfortable grip was developed with the discerning marksman in mind. The ergonomic form of the grip gives the shooting hand a much improved overall degree of gun control. In gripping, the grip pressure is transposed evenly across the whole hand thus leaving the trigger finger relaxed for the next shot. The grip shelf by the model Sniper is adjustable and provides extra support to promote an even and unhurried trigger pull thereby increasing the precision of each shot. These fine grips are in oiled Walnut with the special Rhomlas® treatment for an optimal grip surface."

QUOTE FROM FACTORY WEBSITE: “Chosen as the best new shotgun by a panel of experts at Outdoor Life Magazine, the Magnus Light is truly an extraordinary shotgun. It weighs an astounding six pounds in twelve gauge and barely over five pounds in 20, 28, and .410 gauges. Every detail is carefully considered to reduce weight and maintain balance. The frame and fore-end iron are machined from a solid forging of the best aircraft grade aluminum alloy. Durability is insured through the use of hardened steel at all high-wear points. To make the gun as light as possible and maintain perfect balance, we hollow the stock and craft the fore-end hardware from the same alloy as the receiver. If you hunt demanding terrain or just appreciate a light, responsive bird gun, the Magnus Light is the shotgun of choice. Every Caesar Guerini field gun comes with a velvet lined lockable hard case and five precision patterned flush chokes (CYL, IC, M, IM, F). A plastic choke case is also included”. This sweet little 28 gauge is in excellent condition, the metal finish is flawless."
