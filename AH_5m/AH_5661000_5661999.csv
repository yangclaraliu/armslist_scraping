Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.   The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on current models are 18"" long; a longer barrel length of 24"" available as the hunter variant.. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style flash hider.  All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side.

Buy It Now!!The Beretta 87 Target is a practical-shooting competition pistol that is ready to go out of the box. All a competitor would have to do (if desired) is to mount the optics of his choice, which can be done quickly and easily thanks to the built-in Weaver-style rail. The 87 Target can be also used as a great training pistol, since its controls are quite similar in locatio and feel to those of Beretta’s famed 92 Series.As Beretta’s flagship target pistol, the 87 Target has to satisfy some very stringent accuracy requirements. It is capable of producing cloverleafs at distances of 30 yards and more, while the trigger, breaking at a crisp 3lbs, greatly helps minimize muscular interference while shooting it. The grips are ergonomically sized for the hand of the average shooter, but they are easily replaceable with something beefier or slimmer to fit other sizes.The 6” (150 mm) gives you a long, 7.5” sight radius to optimize alignment and therefore accuracy when shooting without optics. Also, the sights are user-adjustable for both windage and elevation, so that different target loads may be confidently tried while always staying on target. The front sight may be easily replaced with a thinner blade. Magazine change is designed to be quick and intuitive and to cut down on time. The magazine well is beveled for easy no-see insertion, while magazines have a sturdy rubber pad so that they can be safely dropped during competition without any damage.At 41 ounces, the 87 Target is designed to feel steady in your hand while shooting. Also, the bottom corners of the pistol are squared; it remains upright when when set down on a flat surface, ready to be quickly gripped, magazine loaded an raised to the target (.22LR Practical Shooting). Overall, the Beretta 87 Target is an ideal rimfire competition pistol giving shooters serious about their improvement a great value out of the box.Caliber: .22 LRBarrel length (in): 5.9Magazine: 10Action: SingleOverall height (in): 5.3Overall length (in): 8.8Overall width (in): 1.1Sight radius (in): 7.3Weight unloaded (oz): 29.4 Hurry it;s going for a cool price.........

Welles served under President Lincoln, distinguished himself as a political leader nationally, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party. Secretary Welles was also instrumental in the creation of the Navy’s Medal of Honor.Using original photos and hand drawings of the Gideon Welles Serial Number 9 as reference, the master plate used in the creation of the new Silver Eagle pattern was hand cut for production with full coverage on both sides of the receiver cover.The Silver Eagle pattern, like the Henry Rifle itself, is one piece of American history without rival. This model is built on the award winning Henry Golden Boy platform. The rifle features a traditional 20 inch octagonal barrel outfitted with buckhorn sights; a gunsmithing masterpiece that closely mirrors its legendary predecessors, the original Henrys when they were patented in 1860.

I would say new in box, but it never came in a box. The cheapest you can find these new (like mine) is over $400. Asking $300.No waist pad, took it off and can't find it.To see better photos visit the Eberlestock website: http://www.eberlestock.com/F4%20Terminator.htm The Eberlstock video does the best job explaining this pack and all the many features: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG0Vic8CS-Y It has a unique articulating rear interior wall that allows a weapon to be carried near the wearer's back. When not carrying a weapon, the wall is pressed against the frame to maximize conventional interior load space. This pack also has a built-in rain cover that covers the entire pack. ""Eberlestock F4M Terminator Pack is a high-capacity, versatile tactical backpack that's equally effective with or without a weapon. The Terminator can effortlessly bear all of your equipment like a cyborg, and there's an entire network of PALS webbing for the addition of extra pouches. This Eberlestock pack has been optimized with snipers and scouts in mind, and to that end the Eberlestock Terminator Front Loading Pack includes an innovative method of carrying any man-portable weapon, including high-powered sniper rifles with large rifle scopes. While its sister pack, the Eberlestock G4 Operator, has an external scabbard, the Terminator allows you to carry your weapon in concealed fashion, on the interior. That's because the Eberlestock Terminator has an articulating rear interior wall that creates a hollow ""tunnel"" throughout the entire back of the pack. The tunnel is wide enough to fit any Eberlestock gun case or scabbard into the load case, where nothing but the tip of the scabbard peeks from the bottom of the pack. With rifles over 60"" long, the stock will stick out over the top pouch of the pack and can be covered with an Eberlestock Butt Cover. The orientation of the weapon slot allows you to carry your rifle closer to your back, improving the load distribution of the pack. When you're not carrying a weapon, the equipment in your pack will push the articulating wall back toward the frame, allowing you to make full use of all the Eberlestock Terminator Sniper Backpack's interior space. Speaking of space, the Eberlestock F4 Terminator has enough pouches and additional storage potential to hold all your equipment, accessories, and weapons and still have room for more. The Terminator is a front-loading pack; the front door opens entirely, allowing you to organize the contents of your pack like you would a drawer. Tuck pouches line the interior of the pack, and transparent mesh pockets along the interior side walls allow you to see all your equipment at once. Eberlestock has even included a radio compartment in the back of the Eberlestock F4 Terminator Backpack. On the exterior, the Terminator has two large, two liter pouches on the front door, plus two long side pouches for tripods, spotting scopes, hydration systems, or other long and slender accessories. The Eberlestock Terminator Full Format Pack also includes a fanny top pack which contains three storage compartments (one for a hydration system) and can compress the top load of your pack via the compression straps. The fanny top is removable and can be carried across your chest as a courier bag or around your waist as a fanny pack, allowing you to take a lightweight survival and first aid kit into areas where your pack can't or shouldn't go. If you need extra storage, you can easily attach Eberlestock pouches to virtually any part of the pack since it's riddled with PALS webbing. The two front door pouches, the side pouches, the fanny top pack, and even the weight belt are pouch-ready with multiple rows of Padlock webbing."" Volume: 4100 c.i.

This is not a factory refurbished rifle or a clone. I purchased this rifle in 2002 from a SWAT Sniper instructor. This was his personal weapon and was used primarily as a classroom demonstrator. There is NO damage or scuffing anywhere on the gun. Shortly after I purchased the rifle, I used it in a 1000 yard match at Fort Knox, KY. I had never shot a 1000 yard match or even this rifle. A friend had zeroed it at 100 yards and I relied solely on the bullet drop compensator in the Leupold Mark 4 M3 10x scope and my own skills to do the rest. I shot a very respectable 351 out of possible 400. I was pleased with the results, cleaned the rifle and put it away. It has not been shot since. I sincerely believe that less than 300 rounds have been fired through this rifle. This ready-to-go package comes with the as-new M24 rifle; Leupold Mark 4 M3 10x scope with extended sunshield; Palma sights; T-Handle Torque wrench; extra set of new steel scope rings; Harris bi-pod; Hardigg-style hard case; Original Remington box serial numbered to the rifle. If you need additional pictures or have any questions, please let me know. This is not cheap but how many original M24s in 300 Win Mag have you seen? While cash is king, I may entertain possible trades. Insured shipping to your dealer and my transfer costs will be added to the final price. I charge only what I will be charged.  Based on your proximity to my location, a legal face-to-face transfer MAY be possible."

The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from high-quality aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.
