This is one those.. bought for deer hunting, but I prefer my bolt actions. Bought this new in late 2014 and maybe fired 80 rounds at the range. Has the ammo sleeve on the stock and has a nice limbsaver recoil pad. Works wonders for the shoulder. Purchased a ""peep sight"" from Skinner Sights, but never got around to installing. Included in the final sale. You can install or sell on eBay - a new set of those run about 90 bucks. I'd rather have another bolt action that I can use for plinking."

It has been cleaned each outing and maintained with the utmost attention to detail. I was only using it for precision shooting in a SPR format for about 3 range trips. Never ran hard. I purchased it off the EE here a while back. It did not come with the factory case or magazine but I do have the mag block and manual etc.When I purchased it I sent it off to Marvin Pitts to dimple the barrel in front of and behind the gas block as well as to install an AAC 51T muzzle device. This work was just under $400 and a long wait time.There may be a few tiny nicks or faint marks on it from bumps in the safe but it is 98-99%.I am not interested in any other trades besides a SCAR 17 FDE. Thanks! I will be adding cash.I am at $2200. I am NOT in a rush to sell and therefore won't be taking any offers.

There were only 25 or 50 of these made as a special run for Rimfire Central in 2003 or 2004 (my memory isn't what it used to be). Has a Rimfire Technologies charging handle/spring. The scope is a Mueller APV (4.5-14x40) with AO. Trigger was reworked by gunsmith. Breaks crisp and light. This gun is accurate and fun to shoot. It looks great and never fails to get compliments/questions anytime I bring it to the range. I have fired maybe 2,000-2,500 rds through it. Very awesome gun. Need to find a new home for it. Have had a few other issues pop up that need taken care of. I hate to sell it. Will also include a bx25 magazine and a like new ruger 10/22 carry soft case. $400"
