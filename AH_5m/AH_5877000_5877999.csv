We work on Winchester, Remington, Mossberg, Kimber, Glock, FN, Savage, S&W, Marlin, and many more.  -Ultra Sonic Cleaning-Liquid ultrasonic gun cleaning is a safe and highly effective way to professionally clean guns of all types and in all conditions.  Firearm malfunctions are often the result of a dirty and fouled firearm with old oil that hardens, and slows the timing of the action.  An ultrasonic cleaning can bring back full operation of your firearm. Deep South Defense industrial-sized ultrasonic cleaning machine uses water-based degreaser in an eight-gallon tank, combined with heat and dual-frequency ultrasonic waves transferring through the water.  Ultrasonic cleaning uses the water as a vehicle to reach into the areas and parts that are typically hard-to-reach during manual cleaning.  A filtering system for the cleaning tank removes the debris and build-up from the gun cleaning.  This keeps the cleaning system working in a highly-efficient manner for the best results.After the full ultrasonic cleaning, all of the gun parts are thoroughly rinsed in clean water, and then immersed into another eight-gallon tank to receive a protective light oil treatment.  Finally, the gun is carefully reassembled, and delivered to the customer in like-new condition.Ultrasonic cleaning works great for cleaning pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, AR platforms, AK platforms, and other semi auto rifles, and even suppressors/silencers.  If it can fit in the baskets, then it can be cleaned. Rabbit, Bear, and Duck Hunters generally are the roughest on their firearms and will enjoy our Sonic Clean Service (Service starts at $40)-Dura Coating & Parakerizing available.

638,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5877638,For Sale:  Sig Sauer Echo1 Thermal sight,"Springdale, Fayetteville, Arkansas","$ 2,250","Listed On: Saturday, November 12, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The ECHO1™ Digital Thermal Imaging Reflex Sight from SIG SAUER® is the most innovative direct view thermal sight in the world. Based on the newest generation of thermal imaging sensors, the digital sight provides for day or night time predator and hog hunting, while functioning similar to a conventional reflex sight using both eyes open for fast and intuitive target acquisition with greatly improved situational awareness. The sight is also perfect for home defense, law enforcement, military, and search and rescue situations. Technology     LockDownTM Zero System The LockDown Zero System is a stop-locking turret that allows a rapid return to Zero. After dialing up elevation for a shot at extended range, the LockDown Zero System eliminates worry over how far to turn the elevation dial to return adjustment to zero. Turret not only stops at zero, it locks at zero.       SBTTM Perfectly matched to the ballistics of your shooting system, the SIG Ballistic Turret (SBT) is a custom laser-etched elevation dial for your SIG SAUER® Electro-Optics riflescope. Using inputs including bullet specifications, ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity, elevation, and other environmental factors, the SBT system allows for the correct bullet drop compensation and pinpoint accuracy at any range. SBT dials are available on most TANGO and WHISKEY model scopes.        Stealth IDTM Electro-Optics industrial design inspired by our legendary firearms; deflection armor trapezoidal surfacing breaks up the shape and visibility of the optic along with pistol slide serrations and grip checkering to add function to the form of all SIG SAUER electro-optics.       MegaViewTM Revolutionary optical design provides massive Field Of View (FOV), allowing faster target acquisition, and an enhanced awareness of objects in the shooter’s periphery.       HellFireTM Reticle Electronically illuminated reticle system utilizes advanced fiberoptic technology to vary the light intensity of the central aiming point from IR (InfraRed) dim to HellFire bright for daylight illumination, resulting in a bright, defined aiming point for precision shot placement in any condition.       ALTTM Precision molded aspheric lens technology virtually eliminates aberration, reduces weight, and helps to focus the projected image through the lenses for superior low distortion optical performance.       SpectraCoatTM Highly efficient, ultra-wide broadband, anti-reflection lens coatings reduce surface reflections to extremely low levels across the entire visible spectrum providing superior light transmission.       LensArmorTM Abrasion-resistant lens coatings for extreme durability ensure the lenses on your scope will stay sharp, bright, and clear.       HDXTM Advanced optical systems comprising both High Definition (ED) and High Transmittance (HT) glass for ultra-high resolution, optical performance and light transmission.       Hellfire LevelplexTM Autolevel ReticleTM         LenShieldTM Proprietary Mil-Spec oleophobic coating that sheds water, oil, and gunk to ensure a clean sight image at all times.       MOTACTM Activated through motion sensing technology, MOTAC immediately powers up illumination when it senses motion and powers down when it does not in order to extend battery life.       SOSTM Proprietary SOS™ SIG Optic Stabilizer system is gyroscopically stabilized to cancel out unwanted shaking and vibrations that can blur an image, especially at higher spotting scope magnification levels.       TruholdTM Lockless zeroing system utilizes twin adjustment springs designed and torture tested to endure handgun recoil and return to zero shot after shot.       AMRTM Ranging technology uses an on-board inclinometer that reads incline/decline angle and modifies the effective ballistic shooting range to the target. AMR is the equivalent horizontal range and integrates perfectly when used in combination with SIG Ballistic Turret Dials.       LightWave DSPTM Lightwave DSP (Digital Signal Processing) engine leverages HyperScan– an advanced power management technique that provides the fastest refresh rate in scan mode (4 times per second) even at distances over a mile. Our DSP engine uses the latest generation Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) running sophisticated signal processing algorithms to reduce false positives while finding weak or distant targets.       LumaticTM The most advanced display on the market. Our OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display has the largest dynamic range providing for high brightness in bright sunlight or snow conditions, yet will dim down to near nightvision levels at dusk and dawn. No other display offers this adaptive ability to prevent your pupil from constricting in low-light causing you to no longer be able to see your target.

However, since sending this unit back to the factory for all of the updated/upgraded parts, it has functioned flawlessly and is a joy to shoot. Review shooting is done, so it needs a new home. It is very lightly used and looks practically new. Comes with box with anything that was in the box from the factory. This is my favorite bullpup shotgun of all on the market because it is functional, proven and practical. I would take this one over a KSG since it runs so well. I won't even consider a DP-12 since, to be honest, the whole concept of 2 barrels is gimmicky and lacks practical application, while the manual of arms (cock once, shoot twice) is bizarre and impractical. The UTS-15 has 2 magazine tubes, which is far more beneficial. Who wouldn't want 14+1 rounds, with the ability to feed from one tube or the other, or automatic alternating? The UTS-15's manual of arms and features are made for defense, not to look ""tacticool"".
From Wikipedia:""The UTAS UTS-15 is a bullpup 12 gauge pump-action shotgun with two 7-round magazine tubes that can feed in an alternating or selecting pattern. The UTS-15 has a 28.3” overall length with an 18.5” barrel, chambered for 2½”, 2¾”, and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer, the UTS-15 weighs 6.9 lbs. Additionally, there is a top mounted picatinny rail for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes.""
Don't waste your time with low-ball or trade offers. Unless a trade is very heavily in my favor, then I won't even consider it.Strongly prefer a face to face sale in Burlington, NC. I am willing to ship to your FFL at your expense ONLY if payment is made with a USPS money order.  I had a rather convincing prospective buyer try to sucker me on a remote deal with payment by some othe means. Not dealing with that crap again."
