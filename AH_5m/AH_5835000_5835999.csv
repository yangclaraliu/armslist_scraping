It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide.

This particular gun was made in 1973, according to serial number range. It has the desirable four-inch barrel and is in the scarce, original S&W Presentation Case with the cleaning rod and sight-adjustment tool (aka “screwdriver”). The blue felt in the box is in tact, probably due to the gun being layered in the original S&W wrapping paper. It has the original Model No. 57 Instruction Sheet too. The 41 Magum is one of S&Ws most accurate, powerful, and flat-shooting calibers and has a loyal following for good reason. Pinned and recessed S&W Magnums from this era have been on an uphill trend, value wise, and continue to outperform my bank's so-called ""interest"" on my savings.
There is no indication that this gun has been fired or used since leaving the factory (where they are test fired). If someone did shoot it, they cleaned it up nicely and put it away. Excellent investment/collector-grade gun. FTF deals in the local area only, please."

I am the 2nd owner of this gun - 1st  owner was going to convert it to an SBR.  When I purchased it,  I did not complete the conversion, because I did not want to register it as an SBR  (or pay the subsequent taxes).  Having said that, it is pre-drilled and could be changed to an SBR easily.  I've put about 800 rounds through it and never had an issue - classic Kalashnikov reliability.  Because this gun is classified as a pistol, you must be 21 years of age and have a valid GA drivers license/ voter registration card or CCP. ...and, yes, this gun is perfectly legal and can be registered as a pistol in the state of Georgia.

My father bought it from a local Honda dealer in 99, and it has been barn kept and sparingly used. The TRX300 doesn't have an odometer or hour meter; I would estimate the ATV to have less than 300 miles on it, and no more than 20 hours of run time. He has a tractor and a farm truck, so he only used the ATV during hunting season, and to occasionally run from his house to mine (about a 1/4 mile through the woods). The reason for selling is because he has bought a John Deere Gator, to use in its place.It has the original plastic (no breaks or damage, some minor scratches), original tires; everything is original. Oil has been changed yearly using Honda oil and filter (it has a fresh oil change, and a new battery), and everything works like new. It isn't showroom new, but it is in amazing condition, especially for the age. It starts easy and runs perfect, brakes are great and it runs through all gears great. Auto clutch is as strong as the day the ATV was purchased. You would be hard pressed to find another TRX300 in this shape and mechanical condition.$3500. If you are serious about purchasing, I am willing to take it to the Honda dealership and check it over, and you can contact them for their assessment. You won't be disappointed- this is a great condition 4WD TRX300, one of the best that Honda ever made."

These guns have absolutely zero recoil when shooting and are perfect for beginner shooters or even someone that wants to hone their skills, not to mention in today's world fairly cheap to shoot. Also an excellent gun to qualify/test with for concealed carry licenses. I have added and or subtracted a few things to make this gun even better. I have my other ones built the same so decided to do the following...1. Deleted the magazine safety (gun will now fire as a ""normal"" 1911 should) so chambered round can be discharged WITHOUT the magazine being loaded in gun2. Aftermarket Recoil Buffer Pad3.
