Â FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger. Â Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus. Â Â 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger. Â A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.

Â Â Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns. Â Trades: Â 
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails. Â FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger. Â Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus. Â Â 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger. Â A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold. Â Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.

This is the Trooper version with a 6in vent ribbed barrel. This gun was developed as a less expensive version of the famous Python series of revolvers. At first glance this gun looks identical to a python. The gun still has Colt's famous Royal bluing and nice wood grips. The MKV's have a half lug barrel, and cast trigger/hammer. The gun has a smooth trigger, but its not as clean as the Classic Python action. The MKV is the best variation of the Trooper series of revolvers, and the most desirable. This gun is in great condition. The grips are a nice light walnut with deep checkering and the classic gold Colt Medellin. The grips are in good condition. There are some light impressions, but no chips or cracks. The checkering is still deep and sharp. The bluing looks great. The gun was done in Colt's famous Royal Blue. This bluing has a high polished, mirror like finish. There is some very light wear at the muzzle, but overall looks good. There is some blue wear on the front face of the cylinder. Overall the gun still looks good. The gun is fitted with wide target hammer and trigger. The gun also features a fully adjustable rear sight. This is the perfect addition to any collection, or an excellent shooter. Don't miss out on this great revolver. Low Start, No Reserve. Buyer pays shipping, 2% CC fee.

This is the tank crew version with the side folding metal stock. Â I've had this gun for about 5 years and it has mostly sat in my safe for that time, so the bore and barrel are perfect. I exclusively use CLP - if it is good enough for law enforcement it is good enough for me. I originally bought it for a compact truck gun, but I didnt like the idea of it possibly being stolen, so the safe has been its home.The rifle came from the factory built on a FEG Hungarian receiver, with a Tapco trigger that is smooth as silk, and two Tapco magazines.There are a couple of things I have done to make it more comfortable. First was the foreend. If you are familiar, the factry forearm is steel, which gets very hot if you run an extended magazine load thru the gun. The Hungarians solved this by putting a forward grip on the gun, but I replaced the factory forearm with a UTG quad rail system which not only isolates from heat but allows you to mount whatever optics or tactical equipment you want. I replaced the original forward grip with a variable-angle grip which can sit at any position that is comfortable.The original folding stock does not proved any cheek weld, so I got a cheek riser from AMD-65 tech which works perfectly. Also I installed an add-on butt pad which extends the stock slightly to provide a better length of pull.The original iron sights are still on the rifle, but I installed a Sightmark QD Ultra Shot reflex red dot optic, with a quick release Weaver mount This optic has has an ultra wide field of view, and multi-reticle variable brightness. It is a perfect optic for this gun - accurate with quick acquisitin.Â I also have around 200 rounds of ammo that I wont need if I sell the gun. This is not a CAI rifle. I am told that all available supply of teh AMD-65 is going to the Afghan police and these guns are only rarely available in the US. If you are intersted in a tough, accurate, and reliable compact weapon this is the gun for you.No low-ballers, please. I'm in no rush to sell. Also I travel quite a bit for work, so it may be a few days before I can answer an email.I'm in N. Florida and would prefer a FTF transaction with a FL CW permit. If you are out of state, I will want proof that you are legal to own this gun in your state."

The Automag III is also called the âflame throwerâ for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!Â  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense â it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!Â  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!Â  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harryâs day, buy this hand-cannon.
Â 
My selling price of $1,400 is firm.Â  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than a used Automag!Â  But donât take my word for it, see a typical selling price of a used Automag for yourself, go to: https://www.gunsamerica.com/910511780/AMT-IAI-Auto-Mag-III-30-carbine-6-1-2-barrel-original-box-copy-of-manual-1-mag-Millett-adj-site-rar.htm
