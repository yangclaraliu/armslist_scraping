Sunday, September 25th Saturday, October 1st Saturday, October 15th Sunday, October 23rd All classes are from 9-5:30 and cost just $60. We provide everything including use of guns, ammo, range fees, student books you can keep, ear and eye protection. All you need is a photo id!  I have received a ton of questions regarding SB656 and I'm in the process of putting together a free Q&A at the store here in the near future. I will also be posting updates on FB over the coming days and weeks. First, the ""constitutional carry"" part of the bill does not go into effect until January 2017. Whether you plan on pursuing your permit or not I absolutely recommend you take a concealed carry training course. The certificate does not expire so you can get the training and later if you decide to apply for a permit you are good to go. Here are just some of the benefits to getting a permit *Reciprocity with other states-you will need a permit to carry out of state *Where you can carry-there are 17 prohibited places you cannot carry in Missouri. Most of these can just ask you to leave if you have a permit. Without a permit, carrying concealed in these places will be a Class B Misdemeanor *Cover your ***- The first thing a prosecutor will look at if you are involved in a defensive gun use is if you had a permit and if you had any formal training * YOU NEED TO LEARN THE LAW- where you can carry, when you can use deadly force, interacting with law enforcement, etc. This information can be hard to find and even harder to understand.  *More training never hurt anyone. I have qualified over 2k people for concealed carry alone and without fail the blowhards who act like they can't learn anything are always the ones who barely pass the live fire qualification. The most successful people in any sport are those who are open to learning and always training to be better.  This bill still needs to have the final touches on it and I will update the page as more changes become available and we have a better understanding of the bill. Do not rely on local news to accurately report this bill. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ANYONE CAN CONCEAL CARRY ANYWHERE THEY WANT!!! So for those of you who are already carrying please try to educate your friends and family. It is up to each and everyone of us to keep the bad apples from running the bunch with this deal. If they need training please refer them to a qualified instructor who will steer them in the right direction. As always, stay alert, be safe and TRAIN TRAIN TRAIN."

*I will have enough courtesy to take the post down after its been sold*
If the post is still up, the gun is still available
I'll throw in the 2 boxes of 20 cartridges (total of 40 bullets). Haven't had the time to order the free cleaning rod. Apology letter stated they were currently out of stock & it was just a matter of requesting it. But if you want it, I can have them ship to your address. Just tell em I moved.
 
*If I don't reply it is because you asked a question that I've already answered below. 
 
I'd like to address why I'm selling, and rumors surrounding I.O. In
First off: men lie, women lie, numbers don't.
 
Budsgunshop is the most reliable online gun retailer. They wouldn't ruin their reputation, retailing low-quality product. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw how low-priced the gun was. Ak47s typically go anywhere from $1,000-$10,000. Tried to research. Ran across a plethora of OLD (before they were manufactured in Florida) forums bad-mouthing I.O. Inc.
 
I personally find it unamerican. I'll even go as far as saying it's antiamerican. Because most of the rants putting down i.o. Inc ended up glorifying European (Bulgarian, romanian, polish etc) makers.
At the end of the day, it's a ak47. Only difference is I.O. Inc is full of patriotism. All-American.
 
Below is the video that sold me. He debunks the big myth that the I.O. version isnt incompatible with other magazines
 
""Functions flawlessly""
""High quality product""
""Best bang for the buck in the AK market"".

The X-Bolt Long Range Hunter is designed to capitalize on velocity and range in a lighter weight platform. Whether you're hunting pronghorn in the high desert or taking a monster bull elk across a rocky canyon - shoot with confidence.
A few differences - The medium sporter contour barrel with eight flutes reduce weight and increase cooling between shots. The Realtree Max-1 camouflage pattern blends into a wide variety of environments. Everything else -- 60-degree bolt, detachable magazine, adjustable trigger -- combine to make this one of the highest performing production rifles in the world. Not everyone needs a Long Range Hunter. And not everyone needs a rifle with Realtree Max-1. But if you are still reading this you know that you are one of the chosen.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed.

They not only sent me a brand-new gun of my choosing, they installed factory Glock MH3 night sights for me as a surprise upgrade (case shows GNS on the label.).This Glock has only been fired at a gun range and was never carried or holstered. It is in excellent condition, having only two boxes of fifty round factory ammunition through it. Not a single failure to feed or fire and the shots downrange were right on target. Once I was satisfied with its performance, I cleaned, lightly lubed the recommended areas inside the gun, and applied a fine coat of protection to the exterior of the gun before safely storing it in a protective gun-friendly environment.This Glock has a great feel to it, is extremely accurate, and would make an exceptional carry and conceal or home protection pistol. This Gen 4 Glock 26 comes with factory installed night sights, three 10-round magazines, Glock protective case, modular back straps, lock, brush, tools, and paperwork.The Glock 26 Gen4 9mm pistol introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""baby Glock""—the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.Local face-to-face cash sale only.
