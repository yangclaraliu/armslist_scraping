Original case and all accessories (takedown tool, two magazines, molded holster and mag pouch, barrel brush) are also included.  Asking $1050 cash - FIRM - and no trades, please.  And yes, I really do mean no trades, which means please don't ask!  Unfortunately, I do not want to be the first to get hung up with I-594, so as per Washington state law, I'm requesting a pistol transfer at either the Marksman Pistol Range in Puyallup, or the store of your choice if it's in reasonable driving distance from Pierce County.  I will pay for the transfer and cover it.  If you are unable to meet any of these requirements, then I thank you for your time.Please text me at REDACTED if you are interested.  No phone calls, please, and be ready to meet within the next day or two if you're truly interested.  Thank you for your interest!"

Holding 39 rounds of 9mm ammo, this is a potent package. Back strap of magazine marked at the 25-round mark with a small sight window...
 
Unsure of manufacturer, but has many of the same features of the Tony Shearer Company (Virgina) mags I have sold previously... HOWEVER, this mag is 9 inches long -versus the 8 inch long mags holding 36 rounds.
 
While the body style is very similar to several 'evil' black pistols and smg's... and may even fit the mag wells, it won't have the proper lockup and function. Similar guns it may fit BUT NOT WORK: TEC-9; AP-9; UZI; M11/Nine. Pics show position of rounds as seated at the feed lips showing dual feed configuration (not single feed), and is as designed for the M10/9mm Open Bolt semi-autos and submachineguns made by Ingram, MAC, RPB & Powder Springs.
 
Used and in good, functional condition. Photo shows the actual 39 cartridges that fit into this magazine.... but NOT included in auction -just used to show they fit.
 
***Not usually found for less than $200!! Grab this deal now!***
 
As an added bonus- magazine will be fully disassembled and cleaned... reassembled and ready to go!
 
I will accept USPS (Postal) money orders by mail or discreet PayPal (+ 4% PayPal fee) and will contact the winning bidder with the details to complete the transaction.
 
As a precondition of participating in this auction, Buyer agrees to release Seller from all liability, whether criminal or civil, arising from the purchase, ownership, possession, use or misuse of this item. Always wear eye and ear protection when shooting firearms. Treat every firearm as if it is loaded. Safety is no accident and is a responsibility of gun ownership.
Please know your local laws concerning ownership of high capacity magazines and bid appropriately. I will sell & ship to the lower 48 only (all except CA or NY).
 
Please ask any questions that you may have. Only a FEW of these PRE-BAN mags left! Thanks for looking!

While the body style is very similar to several 'evil' black pistols and smg's... and may even fit the mag wells, it won't have the proper lockup and function. Similar guns it may fit BUT NOT WORK: TEC-9; AP-9; UZI; M11/Nine. Pics show position of rounds as seated at the feed lips showing dual feed configuration (not single feed), and is as designed for the M10/9mm Open Bolt semi-autos and submachineguns made by Ingram, MAC, RPB & Powder Springs.
 
Used and in good, functional condition. Photo shows the actual 39 cartridges that fit into this magazine.... but NOT included in auction -just used to show they fit.
 
***Not usually found for less than $200!! Grab this deal now!***** ATTN: KEYBOARD COMMANDOS... THIS IS NOT A SCAM, nor SPAM -DO NOT FLAG! **
 
As an added bonus- magazine will be fully disassembled and cleaned... reassembled and ready to go!
 
I will accept USPS (Postal) money orders by mail or discreet PayPal (+ 4% PayPal fee) and will contact the winning bidder with the details to complete the transaction.

Bottom AR has an Aero Precision upper with 16” stainless steel, match grade .223 Wylde 1:8 twist barrel, nickel boron Aim BCG and slim design forearm. Lower receiver is an Anderson with Palmetto State enhanced LPK and JP Enterprises Enhanced Reliability springs. Trigger is very crisp and breaks at 5 lbs. Magpul MOE+ soft rubber grip and Magpul ACS-L 6 position stock. Asking $850.
If you are not familiar with the 223 Wylde, google to read up on it, but the .223 Wylde chamber throat tolerances are tighter than the 5.56 allowing the shooter to fire SAMI .223 match grade ammo for enhanced accuracy OR the standard 5.56 round giving the shooter the best of both worlds: accuracy or cheaper ammo.
Both ARs have had 3 rounds through them to check functionality.
Both rifles would retail over a $1000+ each if bought on the market and you will have the benefit of these not being registered.

651,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5598651,For Sale:  Indoor X-Ring Centrifugal bullet trap,"Millard area, Omaha, Nebraska",$ 300,"Listed On: Saturday, July 16, 2016",Targets,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling an unusual indoor bullet trap that was manufactured by X-Ring in the 1950’s or earlier.  See the attached photographs.  The trap is all steel.  The side plates were advertised as high-carbon steel.  They are welded together in the corners, which are then partially reinforced by steel angles. 
The front opening is 18” x 18”.  The sides of the trap all taper down at an 18 degree angle to a cast steel “scroll” or “snail”.  The scroll guides the bullet around in a circle until the spent bullet drops into the removable steel cup in the center of the scroll. 
The centerline height of the opening can be adjusted between 24” to 48” above the ground with an antique wrench that it included.  The trap itself can be slid up and down on the heavy steel tripod that is part of the complete unit.  The trap is reportedly good for up to 38 Special lead bullet cartridges.  I have only tried it with .22LR cartridges myself.  From what I have read, it is not suitable for Magnums, FMJ bullets, or most rifle cartridges.  Pretty much any CAS loads should be OK, though.
The trap is in good to very-good condition.  There are small amounts of surface rust here and there where the bullets have impacted.  There is no deep rust and it can be re-painted easily.
This is being sold for LOCAL PICKUP ONLY.  It is located in Omaha, NE.  The assembly weighs approx. 90 – 100 lbs.  I will help load it into the buyers pickup or SUV.  Contact Harry Owen to arrange a time to see it.  The price is $300."

This sight goes from a 1X to 4X zoom by the swipe of a lever. Adjust reticle from thick to fine for close range to long range shooting. This optical is top of the line and used by the most elite military tactical teams. The glass is crystal clear and can take a beating! This retails for over 2,200$ More info from online....The ELCAN SpecterDR Tactical Rifle Scope represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. The SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MOA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has an extremely large field of view. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. The SpecterDR has half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR from ELCAN offers the best single solution for both CQB and long range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

Marked Châtellerault. This rifle is dated 1916 and is marked with the ""N"" on the receiver. Stock, barrel (receivers were not dated), and trigger guard match. Lock-up is tight and I have personally fired this weapon at 100 yard range and determined it is just as the little carbine is known to be --  sturdy and reliable! Fun to shoot, but kicks like a mule!Here is a link to comments on my rifle. One estimate of value was 300 Euros ($315).http://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?389846-New-Addition-Berthier-M-16These guns are not too often found in America. Small cut located at bottom of stock is not someone's attempt at making a sporter, but is the site of a French-done wood repair that must have fallen out over the years. This is very common. Also, slot in bottom of stock is not missing sling swivel by accident, but was removed by the French for the Artillery carbine and just never sealed up. Overall, rifle has that nice battle-damaged appearance while still offering a completely strong and serviceable rifle. A piece of history straight from WWI! Comes with 4 original 5-shot Mannlicher clips and 16 rounds of 8mm Lebel ammo (all I have leftover). Can also include 39 8mm lebel brass casings if you reload. This is a wonderful rifle, and I am only selling/ trading in the pursuit of another couple Milsurps I'm interested in. Thanks for your time and shoot me an email!P.S.
