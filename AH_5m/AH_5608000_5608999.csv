Dependable. Safe. The best pistols for carry. The Tacoma, Washington Police Department recently completed a testing program to determine what pistol their officers would carry. The test involved nine brands, 39 models and three calibers of semi-automatic pistols. Kimber won, and officers now have the option of selecting a Kimber Pro Carry II or Pro Carry HD II for duty. The test results are staggering. Other than Kimber, pistols had a failure rate as high as 22%. Kimber had the lowest failure rate Tacoma PD has recorded in over 20 years of testing for any type of firearm – less than one half of one percent! They also determined that the Kimber was safer than other test pistols when the safety was in the “on” position.Compact and Pro Carry pistols are similar to Custom models. Their 4-inch bushingless bull barrel makes them easier to conceal and reduces weight. Keeping barrel weight forward also reduces recoil, allowing faster recovery from shot to shot. Each one has dovetail-mounted low profile fixed sights with rounded edges to prevent snagging, and some models have Meprolight Tritium three dot (green) night sights. The Compact Stainless II features a stainless steel slide and frame. The frame itself is .400 inch shorter than the full length Pro Carry but still holds 7 rounds. Pro Carry models are available with either stainless steel or aluminum frames. Kimber aluminum frames are machined from solid blocks of 7075-T7, the hardest and strongest available. Moreover, these frames are run on the same machines and hold the same tight tolerances as steel frames. Tested to 20,000 rounds with no meaningful wear, the weight savings they offer does not come at a compromise. This Firearm is used but in exelent condition (98%) No signs of wear."

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85″, a height of 4.61″, and the same slim 1.27″ grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50″ barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Very simple to install, literally drop in speaks for itself lol. It is BRAND NEW, never used or even opened. Still in the package. Paid 229$ for it, selling it for 170$$. Which is a great price. The ONLY reason im selling it is because i ended getting the single stage, with the skeletonized flat faced trigger, which is more of what i needed. The CMC triggers are very high quality and any reviews should clear up any doubts anyone might habe about a drop in style trigger. ALL my drop in triggers have never failed me , extremely reliable. I can install the trigger for you if you habe any doubts ab doing it yourself. It takes a few minutes to complete. Again im asking 170$ which is great!

Mild rusting of barrel on outside. 6 shot capacity.The Security Six family of double action revolvers was introduced by Sturm, Ruger & Company in 1971 and marketed to law enforcement agencies, the military, and civilian self-defensive markets. Due to the importance of the gun’s reliability when fielded in such arenas, the “Six Series” revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts to ensure durability and dependability.
The Security Six and its three basic variants were more or less identical in basic design, with the major differences between them being; the caliber, barrel length, and finishes offered. The main line of the Series Six, the Security Six, was available with three barrel lengths; 2.75, 4, or 6 inches. This fired either the .357 Magnum or .38 Special rounds and typically was manufactured with adjustable sights. The “Service Six”, also known as the “Police Service Six”, came with fixed sights, a square butt frame and were mostly cambered for the .357 Magnum; however, some police departments fielded models with .38 Special or 9mm Luger calibers. The “Speed Six” variant of the Six Series was offered in either a 4 or 6 inch barrel and differed from the other models by having a compact, round-butt grip frame and was offered in the .38 S&W caliber, popular in British Commonwealth counties. From its introduction until production ceased in 1988, Ruger produced over 1.5 million of the Six Series pistols and enjoyed profitable sales due to the pistols basic features, solid construction, and competitive pricing."
