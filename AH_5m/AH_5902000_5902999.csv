Coming from the famed plant in Germany, it's proving to be just as accurate. Even if you're not a field target enthusiast, you'll enjoy shooting this rifle! It's great for metallic silhouettes, plinking, shooting spinners and paper targets, and accurate enough to do some serious hunting. If you're hunting game and eliminating pests, .20 or .22 caliber should be your choice. The quality of the polishing and bluing on the steel action, barrel and underlever exceeds what you'd normally find on comparably priced firearms. The blue laminated stock has a raised RH cheekpiece on the Monte Carlo buttstock. The stock is capped with a soft rubber recoil pad to give you ultimate control. Includes 1"" scope rings, medium profile, vertical scope stop in one ring, 2 screws per base & 4 screws per ring cap.The gold Rekord trigger, which is praised by shooters and admired by competitors, adjusts to your needs. The 11mm grooves in the receiver make it easy to mount a scope (it does not come with open sights). If you like the simplicity and ease of shooting a spring-piston gun, then give the HW97K serious consideration.Cash Only, not interested in trades."

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

All USPs feature a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

The Model 770 shares many of the hallmark features of the Model 700, including rugged dependability, a crisp, single-stage trigger, ultra-fast lock time, and the same ""three-rings-of-steel"" design for superior action strength. Some of the upgrades the Model 770 received are: an advanced stock with a more ergonomic shape, an ultra-smooth, easier-to-cam bolt, a durable new magazine latch, and a solid steel receiver for smooth bolt operation and long-term reliability. Three locking lugs lock the bolt directly into the barrel for unprecedented action strength.

At the core of the M77 Hawkeye is an ultra-reliable action based on the Mauser 98—considered one of the strongest and most dependable firearm designs for over 100 years. The M77 Hawkeye action utilizes a controlled feed mechanism with a large claw extractor that takes a solid hold on the cartridge's rim as it is being fed into the chamber. The controlled round feeding, plus a sturdy fixed blade ejector and a 1-piece stainless steel bolt make the M77 Hawkeye a top choice for serious big game hunting anywhere in the world. Integral scope mounts are machined directly on the steel receiver to accept Ruger scope rings (included), eliminating any chance of screwed-on bases coming loose in the field. A steel trigger guard protects the trigger in the case of a fall, and a hinged, all-steel floorplate allows hunters to unload the rifle safely without cycling cartridges through the chamber. The floorplate latch fits flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidently dumping cartridges at an inconvenient moment. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye features the LC6™ trigger that comes from the factory smooth and crisp with an optimized pull weight for hunting. A 3-position safety allows the shooter to load or unload the rifle with the safety engaged in the middle position. In the rearward position, the bolt is locked where it is extremely unlikely to get bumped or knock off safe, making it an ideal safety for hunters who have to navigate rugged terrain. The safety is rapidly accessible with the either the shooter's thumb or forefinger, and can also be grasped between the thumb and forefinger and moved stealthily to the fire position when game is close. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye Bolt-Action Rifle comes with an ergonomic, finely contoured, walnut stock with cut checkering and an elegant oiled finish. A rubber butt pad softens felt recoil and keeps the butt-stock from slipping on the shooter's shoulder. Sling swivel studs provide for the quick attachment of a hunting sling. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye is a rugged, reliable hunting rifle that will give generations of hard use.

I'm a pretty avid shooter, and the 320 easily has the nicest factory striker fired trigger I've ever shot. These models have interchangeable grips in case you have a really big or small hand. Check out Sig's website for all the specs on it, it's a great pistol.I only have 100 rounds through it, so it's almost new. I'm only getting rid of it because I need to trim down my collection. I don't have any other .40 cal pistols, so for sake of ammo simplicity I decided this one is up for adoption.I'd prefer to sell, but am open to trades. I'm open to semi-auto pistols, semi-auto .223/5.56 rifles, and bolt action hunting rifles with a .270WM or higher caliber and no wood stocks. I'm okay with cash one way or the other if the trade warrants it.Buyer will need to have a valid/current DL, and either provide current CCW/police ID/military ID or be open to me checking their CCAP and what not.

The grips may be horn based on faded color.Note: A collector pointed out that the proofmarks are Prussian and the gun may actually date to the German occupation of Belgium during WWI 1914-1918. German Imperial Eagle proofmarks on right side of frame and slide. No Belgian Liege proofs.  Made during German occupation of Belgian factory. The serial number is in the 100,000 - 200,000 range of Prussian German pistols.This nearly 100 year old pistol was the smallest .32 ACP (and .380 ACP) until the advent of the Keltec composite polymer/aluminum frame concealed carry guns in the early 1990s.Manufactured by Anciens Etablissements Pieper, Herstal, Belgium, the Bayard Model 1908 was introduced in .32 ACP in 1910, .380 caliber in 1911 and .25 ACP in 1912. All three calibers are hammer-fired straight-blow back pistols of identical design and similar size, except for the barrel, breech and magazines. All are referred to as the Model 1908.Like many other guns introduced in the first decade of the 20th century, the Bayard 1908 follows the Browning FN 1900 design (the first commercially successful semi-auto handgun) with the barrel positioned below the recoil spring mechanism. However, the 1908 also added some elements from the Browning 1903 hammer fired design. While Browning (FN & Colt) had moved on to simpler, more elegant and reliable designs that were less labor intensive to produce, Anciens Etablissements Pieper continued to manufacture the Bayard 1908 well into the 1930s.The Model 1908 has a unique take down mechanism. The removable front sight retains the recoil spring. Disassembly is accomplished by pushing backwards on the front sight, then rotating it up and back to remove the sight and recoil spring. The slide can the be pulled to the rear and upwards, off the receiver.Sixty years after the introduction of the Bayard 1908, Smith & Wesson resurrected this design with the S&W Model 61. The .22LR S&W Model 61 emulated many aspects of the Browning 1900 & Bayard 1908 designs, notably the recoil spring above the barrel and the front sight take down mechanism. The S&W Model 61 was less successful than the Bayard 1908 and was only produced for 4 years from 1970-1973.Pre-owned, used, vintage, curio and relic, and antique firearms or other weapons are sold as-is with no warranty, expressed or implied.The ammo, quarter and keys to the Corvette are only for scale and not included in the sale.I’m selling this pistol and other parts of my collection to pay for some recent rifle and reloading purchases.Requires FFL transfer to ship. I will ship out of Texas, but require FFL to FFL. Shipping FFL to FFL is $20 US Priority Mail. Shipping is cheapest if I use my FFL dealer. He can ship via USPS, but MUST ship to another FFL. You will need to send (or have your dealer send) a copy of the FFL along with payment. Payment can be USPS Money Order, or any other type of certified check or money order. $20 will mostly cover my costs for USPS Priority and FFL transfer fee - add $5 if you want the shipment insured. Once USPS tracking indicates the it has shipped, the gun is yours, so consider insurance carefully.If you live nearby, I will consider local pick-up. You will need to show a valid TX drivers license. CHL is preferred."

How often can you find an original Colt Single Action Revolver that's not too beat up for less than this? Own a piece of history.I'm looking for $1500, which is a very reasonable price for a 1903 Bisley, even in worse condition than this one. The grips are original and you could break this down and sell the parts for more than $1500. I can provide more pictures upon request. Thanks for looking."
