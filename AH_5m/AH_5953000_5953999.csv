This version is set up to accept Glock 19 mags, so itll take G19, G17, and Glock Happy Sticks.This gun is a tack driver and I've added a few things to make it even better. I've had the barrel Cerakoted in black to better withstand the beautiful weather here in western Washington. Approximately 200 rounds down the pipe, but honestly that estimate is probably a little high.I added the Red Lion Precision indexing rail, front sight, two picatinny rail portions, and muzzle comp. I've also added the Tandemkross Eagle Eye Gen 1 rear sight, Keltec PLR rear sling attachment point/loop, a TACTICOOL PRODUCTS buffer tube wrap and operating handle cover, a Hogue grip wrap, and Magpul AFG and rail sling attachment point. YES, It'll still fold thanks to that Red Lion indexing rail!You're welcome to do the research and math, I've added well over $350 worth of awesome to this already awesome gun, so my asking price is $700 FOR THE GUN AND THE AFOREMENTIONED ACCESSORIES ONLY! I do not wish to part it out and the Trijicon and Surefire gear are not included in that price, but are available for sale. (We can talk particulars on those if interested in the set-up as you see it.)I'm willing to drive a REASONABLE distance to meet with a buyer at an FFL of your choice as buyer will cover transfer fee. If Buyer is willing to travel, we will meet at one of my local FFL's and I will cover transfer fee. Let me know if you want more pics or other info. Thanks for looking!"

Has the Grips with the Gold Colt inlays. Extremely beautiful Revolver and a dream to shoot, but I didn't shoot it much because it was my nicest piece. The original owner unfortunately had the top of the Barrel tapped for a Rail (included with screws) which obviously will affect the collectors value to some degree. I had a very reputable Gunsmith in Fairport Harbor quote me $120 to restore the Barrel to original condition and he was very confident he could get it looking like new. Fit and finish is gorgeous and these classic Revolvers are between the size of a S&W K and L frame while being stronger than a K-frame and much more comfortable and balanced than an N-frame. This is easily the nicest and most balanced Revolver I've ever owned and I need the cash and can't afford to keep something I don't want to put wear on. I have many more quality Pictures to email so if interested please let me know,I'm looking for offers so please email me with what you've got."

I have put about 200 rounds through the rifle, these have a phenomenal barrel life of 16,000 rounds so you will still have 15,800 rounds to go. Overall condition is 98-99% due to small scratches on the upper receiver due to installing and removing the non reciprocating charging handle. See the pictures for reference. The Rifle has several significant upgrades and comes with the original box, owners manual, a few of the original extra parts like the original flash hider. Gun includes ""14"" 20 round magazines ($500 value), most of which are still in the box. The upgrades I installed on this SCAR are the Geissele Super SCAR trigger, which is incredibly light and crisp. The original style FN 3 prong flash hider. The GG&G non reciprocating charging handle (No longer in production and no longer available from GG&G) which resolves the biggest complaint of the SCAR design, i.e. the reciprocating charging handle smacking your fingers. MLOK side and bottom Rail Pannels and a Magpul Pistol Grip. Basically anything that you can addon to improve the SCAR has been done. Overall the package represents a $4,000 rifle. I ship USPS 1-3 day priority with a tracking number supplied within 48 hours of the payment clearing. PLEASE NOTE, your FFL MUST be willing to receive shipments from non FFL holders, NO exceptions. I respond to all questions so if there is something you want to know about this one, please ask...No trades on this rifle."

It is the very desirable 20gauge/.223! It was my Father'sTurkey gun for many years. When he started hunting Turkeys in Florida he found himself seeing hogs when no turkeys showed up so he bough this gun to do both without having to carry two guns. It has not been used in many years since my father and I have both bought Drillings. It has been well cared for stored in the safe and cleaned regularly. It has a Tasco 4x32 scope. If you know anything about these guns they were discontinued several years ago after many years of production. They have been brought back just recently but only in .410\.22. Gun was originally 20ga./222 but we had it professionaly rechambered in the 1970's since Florida had a minum caliber of .223 to hunt deer. There are many websites that are didicated to this model. It also has a nice leather sling. One very small chip where the butt plate meets the stock, the size of your pinky nail, almost un-noticeable. A few wear marks but but in excellent condition. Must be a CWP holder and sign bill of sale. Make me an offer."
