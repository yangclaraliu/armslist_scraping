Pico comes with excellent white-dot sights, which are quick to acquire and bright enough for many low-light situations. The dovetailed quick-change sights adjust easily and can be replaced with tritium night sights. Lightweight, durable, and easy to draw from concealment, the Beretta Pico has all the reliability and quality Beretta is famous for."

Its a cased single gun made by Uberti but not marked with any Italian names or even proof marks, it has them marked under the ejector rod housing. It has ""Shootist Edition"" Engraved on top of the 4 3/4's inch barrel, its marked 1 of 1,000 on the left side of the frame, and its engraved Phil Spangenberger on the back strap. Its got beautiful Nickle finish on the metal and the grips are nice looking 1 piece wood, correct for a black powder frame era gun which this is a replica of. It has the correct ""Bullseye"" ejector rod and of course the screw retainer for the cylinder base pin.In the presentation case are 33-45 Colt caliber cartridges, made by Winchester and an antique looking picture of Phil holding one of these guns, its autographed and dated 1987. There is also a poker card that's been shot 3 times and its autographed by Phil as well and dated 6/15/1987. Phil told me there was supposed to be 1000 sets of the single gun made up but the guy in charge had his wife pass away from cancer at the time of this and was so distraught that they quit the project. Phil also talked of sets with 2 guns that were engraved and with genuine pearl grips,he has a set of those, he stated they were beautiful, numbered 2 & 3 I think, sounds like quite a set, these engraved sets were originally slated for 100 sets to be made but they probably only made 20 or so. Mine is a cased single gun from the standard non engraved series and its serial numbered PS0039, so the 39th gun made, the compartment-ed case is what looks like oak wood with green billiard cloth lining. On top of the case is one of Phils favorite saying engraved on a brass plaque that states ""Always be sure to aim, and always aim to be sure"" gotta like all of this, a quality package to be sure. This gun is in excellent to new condition and the case is excellent plus. The picture and card are excellent and there is also a gold seal with the name of ""Texas Gunfighters"" and the date of 1987. Phil was very kind and sent me a copy of the article in Guns & Ammo magazine from 1988 and I have added a copy of that with this set. Phil's partner in the ""Texas Gunslingers was also very kind and sent me a nice letter that I will include a copy of too. If interested I will send a letter from me stating all of this. I think this will all be a collectors item someday, as far as i'm concerned it's a collectors item right now and I'm OK"

It is a possibility that this rifle was carried by a Soldier or Marine during WWII, but since the Army were able to use the M1s and the Marines were still using the 1903 until later in the war this could have been one of those rifles. It is also likely that this rifle passed through several hands of recruits in training between WWI and WWII. Either way, this rifle is a relic and should be treated as such. All parts are original with Springfield Armory stamped on the barrel and ""10-29"" nomenclature listed under the SA bursting bomb.
