This LRP-07 features several unique cosmetic touches to set it apart any other. The hallmark paint scheme of the bomber is captured by a special two-tone Cerakote treatment coupled with OD Green Magpul furniture and the black accents in the trigger, safety, charging handle slider and mag release. The Magpul MOE stock features a printed homage to the B-17 tail markings, while the blasted, stainless barrel has received a blackening of Cerakote overspray at its end to evoke the distinctive oils smoke stains of the aircraft's radial engines. Finally, the sides of the magazine well have been fitted with plates displaying both the period Army Air Force logo and specially commissioned nose art of our own Bomber Girl, the Billet Beauty herself.

The gas system is not automatically unblocked when the sight is folded, however, and must be manually opened to again allow semi-automatic operation.[15] Barrel was not chrome-lined.

I bought it when the D3 first came out looking for a good convertible 2 point to 1 point sling and once I attached it to the rifle I just decided I prefer my Magpul sling or WOTG sling. Never used while shooting, only attached to the rifle a few times. Rifle, nor anything attached to it is for sale. Asking 60, would like to sell locally if possible. Message me for details! Thanks"

The seller informed me that he had put 100 to 200 rounds through it and then purchased an after-market slide and barrel. That's why this was being sold. I then purchased all new internals for the slide from Glock and ran about 50 rounds through it with no problems. It worked flawlessly.

I'm not looking to trade all this to have to go out and get a holster after that. I will consider trades for the above setup if you bring another handgun to the table of equal value to the accessories I lined out (LCP, etc.) or $$$.Thanks for looking. If the deal is good we can split the transfer fee. I'm north end area."
