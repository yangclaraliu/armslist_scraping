The Combo pump shotgun comes with 1 vent-ribbed, smoothbore, ported barrel that accepts Accu-Set choke tubes and 1 fully rifled and ported barrel with rifle sights. Twin beads on the ribbed barrel provide quick sight acquisition. The 3"" chamber functions with both 3"" and 2-3/4"" shells to enhance the 500's versatility for shooting a variety of loads. Dual action bars prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action, and a single, large locking lug locks the bolt into the barrel extension, ensuring a solid steel bolt-to-barrel connection. Dual extractors take a solid hold on the shell's rim for reliable extraction. The aluminum alloy receiver keeps weight down and resists corrosion. Hunters can reach the tang quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous. The Mossberg 500 disassembles into sub-components for cleaning and maintenance by unscrewing the magazine cap (which stays on the barrel); the trigger assembly drops out easily with the removal of only 1 pin. For years, military, law enforcement, and hardcore hunters have chosen Mossberg pump shotguns for their simplistic design and reliability. The 500 Pump-Action Shotgun Combo has a hardwood buttstock and forearm and blued barrels."

There is very little information published on the 1882 or 1883 models but apparently they look the same with the exception of the hammers. Production estimates are about 7500 manufatured, rather rare. It is chambered in 12 gauge & has 30” non-Damascus barrels, choked full & full. It looks to be all original & the serial number 11,798 is found on the receiver, barrels, forearm wood & metal, we have not had it apart further. The only stamping on the exterior is E. REMINGTON & SONS ILLION. N.Y found of the barrel rib. Top lever break action, the receiver, side plates & hammers are case colored, has flash fences, checkered hammer spurs & the barrels are blued. The stocks are straight grained walnut; checkered, round knob pistol grip, widow peaked steel butt plate & the forend has an ebony tip. The shotgun weighs 8 ½ pounds, is 46” long, the LOP is 13 1/8” & 14”, drop @ comb is 2 3/8” & the drop @ heel is 3 1/8”. Mechanically sound, smooth action that opens & closes effortlessly with a tight lock up, hammers cock properly & fall with a nice trigger pull, the extractors work, it is fully functional, I wouldn’t hesitate to fire with the proper ammo. The bore shines brightly with very minor corrosion or imperfections. The end of the left muzzle has a ding which could be easily repaired. There is still a lot of bluing remaining on the barrel turning Patina where the bluing has thinned. No rust issues, just minor handling marks & a few pin-head pits. Some case coloring is visible, more in the protected areas. The stocks are solid with no cracks or repairs, just minor handling marks & a chip of wood missing above the side-plate on the left hand side. It goes unnoticed for the most part, is not a structural concern & no repair is needed. The fluting is still sharp & the checkering is relatively sharp. The condition of this shotgun is quite incredible considering it has been around for over 130 years. Great looking antique production Remington Model 1882 in working order, there can’t be many around any nicer."

397,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5627397,For Sale:  UltiMAK AK Scout Mount  Model M2-B,"ORLANDO, Orlando, Florida",$ 80,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 6, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"New, never fired. Loosely mounted to my rifle, but my vortex optic was too tall. Get it cheaper than retail, no tax, no shipping, no wait. The M2-B has a Picatinny style rail positioned well below the iron sight axis, making this the lowest optic mount available for the AK. With a tubular sight mounted low, you will be able to use your optic without a comb riser and still use your regular hold. The system allows for co witnessing (the ability to use your iron sights right through a 1x sight as a back-up sighting system) when used with a tubular reflex sight. This heavy duty mount replaces the original steel gas tube and upper handguard, so it adds less than one ounce to the weight of the rifle, making it by far the lightest optic mount installation in the world. The forward positioning of the optic gives you faster, easier and more natural targeting while maintaining your full field of view. Multiple target or moving target engagements, with both eyes open, become second nature."

According to Walt Snyder’s book, “The Ithaca Gun Company- From the Beginning”, there were only 560 Grade 4 NID guns made in all gauges, 24 of them .410 and 28ga. guns, leaving 536 to account for 12ga., 16ga., and 20ga. guns. Over 1/2 of the remainder were 12ga. guns, leaving 268 guns in 16 and 20 gauge. The NID series began in the mid 1920’s and ran through 1949. The 20ga. guns became far more popular than the 16ga. guns by the 30’s and 40’s. MY EDUCATED GUESS PUTS THE ITHACA NID GRADE 4 16GA. PRODUCTION AT UNDER 100 GUNS. That is rare indeed! Now realize that this gun has a super rare factory ventilated rib, single selective trigger, and factory installed pad and you have one of about 10 ever made. This gun, serial number 448984 built in 1928, remains in crisp FACTORY MINT CONDITION. Usually when you see a vent rib on a vintage American side by side it is on a long barreled trap style gun. Finding one on the original 26"" barrels with the splinter forend is likely one-of-a-kind. The barrels, receiver, trigger guard and forend metal are all factory original with 99.5% vivid finishes remaining. The barrel flats and breech face retain all of the factory jewelling, with perfect mirror bores choked CYL/F (.005/.024 restrictions from the factory), 2 9/16"" chambers, everything near new. The receiver retains 99% vivid factory colors, engraving is crisp as new, the Miller style Single Selective trigger is crisp with both triggers breaking clean at 3.5lbs. pull. The wood is factory original wood that had the crackled finish we sometimes see on Ithaca graded guns of age. Not from use but strictly from storage and drying. We restored the finish to factory specification as new. The original factory sunburst pad is still with the gun. The gun comes with a factory letter from Walt Snyder documenting the gun as she is today. When it comes to investment quality firearms most are acutely aware that factory original condition, rarity, and desirable features are the most weighty items when determining value and desirability. The graded Ithaca NID guns are the best value in the market place and the guns poised to increase in value more than any other maker's gun. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a rare, special order, factory mint conditioned Ithaca NID 16ga. Don't miss out!

My AR is the much more desireable 5.56/.223 capable multi-caliber variant based off a PSA Aluminum forged upper and a GWACS polymer lower with a PSA metal trigger group. If you research AR-15's you'll find Palmetto State Armory (PSA) makes one of the most sought after high quality Uppers and stock trigger group kits. And the GWACS polymer lowers are the best polymer weight saving lowers available today. Time tested, rugged and reliable. You can find YouTube videos of testing the strength by running trucks over the GWACS equipped weapons and surviving better than a forged lower. Do a YouTube search of ""Rob Pincus GWACS"" and you'll see that he even owns one. You will see that the rifle comes with a fixed rifle stock which fits most shooters very well. GWACS integrates the rifle stock within their manufacturing process to provide more rigidity to the polymer lower than any other polymer manufacturer. Yet the lower is equipped with a Mil-Spec length Buffer Tube and spring that is interchangeable with commonly available replacements to customize the operation of the weapon to your own needs. Besides, it is a lot more comfortable to rest your cheek against a full rifle stock to steady for that long shot, than one of those collapsible stocks. The only additions made to the PSA Upper, which came with a 16 inch 1 in 7 twist barrel within a black phosphate coated upper, is to add a tactical charging handle for three gun competition, and the removable carry handle/rear sight to the Picatinny rail. If you want to mount your choice of optics simply remove the carry handle. But the fixed front sight and the fully adjustable for windage and elevation rear sights are currently adjusted to ""tack driver"" accuracy. The rifle comes with four 30 round metal military surplus magazines and one three magazine canvas carry pouch. If a straight trade, or something close to that, sounds interesting to you drop me a note to WileECoyoteSr at gmail dot com .CAUTION: If you do NOT have the legal right to own/possess a gun due to a past felony conviction or a current accusation/investigation or restraining order or other ongoing violence investigation you would be committing a felony crime to even touch the weapon I am offering in this trade. I will photograph your driver's license for my personal records as you swear to me that you have the legal right to own a weapon."

Being a direct blowback design, these lessor cartridges still have considerable recoil, so in my opinion the smaller chambering of the AP-MBP makes this gun more enjoyable to shoot. This gun was used in Hungary during the communist era as a government issued firearm. My understanding is that they were issued by the Hungarian Police from 1950 to 1957. 7.65mm Browning, also known as .32 ACP and .32 auto, is often considered an anemic chambering by Americans, but in Europe it has commonly been accepted as a military and police cartridge.
The FEG AP is very similar to the German Walther PP but the design has been slightly modified by FEG. It features an aluminum frame. It holds an 8 round magazine of 7.65mm Browning. It has a safety decocker lever and is a traditional double action firearm. The double action pull is very long and heavy. The gun weighs in at approximately 20 ouncesGood clean Bore, Straw finish."

If you can only afford to get 1000 or 2000 rounds, I'll sell them to you for $500 or $1000, respectively. For 500 rounds, I'll sell them for $260. Any lower amounts of ammo will be sold for $0.55 a round. I'll update this post to let folks know how many rounds I have left after each split transaction.

If interested, please send me your contact info, and I'll call/text you as soon as possible so we can make arrangements.  NOTE: The picture I have for this is a bit old. I've used it before for the 147 grain rounds of this very same ammo but didn't want to bother taking photos again since they bullets and boxes look exactly the same.

Has hammer mounted firing pin. Also has a pretty good trigger for what it is, DA is ok but single action is what I would classify as a ""hair pin"" trigger.It is a great shooter, very accurate. Timing is on and lock-up is a tight as can be expected.

This Drilling looks to have been carried but not shot that often as the shotgun bores are mirror bright and the rifle bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. This is the Waldschutz model which was an upgraded version of the Semper drilling with shorter barrels coming in at 22 inches or 55 CM. It also featured dual rifles sights on the rib instead of one single rifle sight one being automatic when the Rifle switch is activated as well as a manual flip up sight. The length of pull is a little over 15"" and overall the gun handles very well. The condition remains very good for its age with almost all bluing remaining on the barrels and partial case coloring on the receiver. There is a small dent in the right shotgun barrel but It affects nothing during shooting. I took it to a gunsmith and he said it could be popped out for $50 but he didn't have a 16 gauge plug to run through it to pop it out so if it bothered you that much it could be easily fixed. The wood had several dents and dings but still presents well. The trigger guard is made of horn which was a $100 option on these guns and suprisingly the total for this gun back in 1931 totaled over $1200 US dollars. I found an old price list from Kreighoff and it listed this model at 270 Reisch Marks which with the conversion rate of the time would have cost $1171 plus the extra $50 for the Buffalo Horn trigger guard puts you over $1200. I have this Drilling priced very reasonably for the condition and model which isn't very often seen and its priced resonably close to its original price when purchased new 85 years ago. you wont find another Kreighoff Drilling in this condition for this price anywhere.
