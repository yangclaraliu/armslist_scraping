Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M4. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position.
Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.  * Mounts on durable Entry-Length Receiver Extension tube (included) to accommodate the common M4 carbine buffer and spring* * 7-Position LOP adjustability with customizable preset system for fast access to preferred length * Adjustment lever requires only gross motor movement to operate yet the entire stock remains streamlined and anti-snag * Solid ""fixed stock"" lockup and consistent cheek weld in all positions * Enhanced lock mechanism w/ internal impact buffer increases drop strength and shock resistance * Multi-shell construction provides solid foundation and shields critical operating parts from penetration damage * Sloping cheek weld combines a slim profile with user comfort * Stout construction provides counterbalance weight for improved weapon balance and handling * Storage compartment in tail of stock is removable and the door is reversible for user preference * Removable 0.30"" Rubber Butt-Pad offers an anti-slip surface and increased impact protection * Sling Mounts    - Front/Rear - Reversible QD swivel sling mounts fit up to 1.5"" push-button swivels (swivel not included)    - Bottom - 1.25"" sling loop

This Model is the ""45 cal Model 1955"" as marked on Right Side of Barrel. This is the 6 1/2 inch, Pinned Barrel Model. This the Full Target Model with Partridge Front Sight and Target Rear Sights. This Revolver was manufactured in 1979 according to the Serial Number starting with the N prefix and has a 3 - Screw Sideplate. The Revolver is about 95% but is not perfect. Please look closely at the photos I have included to see the Blemishes that is does have. At some point in time, someone left it lying on it's right side and allowed surface rust to accumulate. It does have some minor surface blemishes of the areas I tried my best to show you. It is not Terrible and does not affect the performance of the revolver but it is there. It also comes with 2 sets of Grips. The Original Stock Grips are included. The Original Grips do have some surface damage as at some point in time someone had it in one of Smith's Wooden Presentation Cases and the Blue Felt , that always deteriorated, embedded itself in the wood grain. It does come with a set of the Goncalo Grips which today sell for about $80 to $100 Bucks. The Original Box is clean and in excellent condition overall as the revolver is as well. Has the original cleaning kit and screwdriver as well. If you have any more questions please feel free to contact me. It is In Stock and Ready to Ship. Thanks for stopping by and Have a Blessed Day! Certified Check or Money Order Preferred, Thanks"

You are free to break it down to the stock and inspect it thoroughly, dry fire etc or I can do it for you and show you how the outstanding gas piston design works. The SKS platform was designed to use inexpensive steel cased ammuntion which is another great aspect for target plinking and cost containment. I'm sorry, but there is no shipping and this will be for pick up at my home in Tampa or on weekends when I'm typically down in the Cape area fishing.  Cash only.  I do thank you for the enormous interest from abroad, but there are no circumstances where I will ship this rifle no matter the scenario.  Thanks"

The Crossfire features dual amplified speakers to deliver incredible volume. A front horn speaker handles coyote vocalizations and common distress sounds with ease. The rear cone speaker handles low frequency sounds such as bear growls, owl sounds, and even mountain lion calls. When combined, these two speakers deliver a crisp, clear, quality and realistic sound. The CROSSFIRE features two external speaker jacks, a charge jack, and auxiliary jack. Comes with the TX-505 remote.The TX-505 has an extra-large display screen, numeric keypad, FOXBANG technology, FOXFADE, and the capability of storing and playing up to 10 custom presets and sequences. FOXCAST allows you to pre-program up to 10 sequences where you can program the sounds, volume levels, durations and passages of silence for hands free operation throughout the entire stand. FOXFADE allows you to control the volume independently of two sounds playing at the same time. Use the A/V (Auto Volume) feature to allow the volume of a sound to slowly ramp up and then modulate up and down, leaving your hands free from making manual volume changes. The CROSSFIRE is backed by a 5 year limited warranty and FOXPRO's unmatched customer support and is proudly made in the USA. Direct Link Click HereFeatures:  FOXBANG™ Automatically maps your caller to a predetermined setting after discharging your firearm. (See instruction manual for FOXBANG options.) Dual Amplified Speakers. Individually amplified horn (front) and cone (rear) speaker combination provides loud, crystal-clear audio and great frequency response. 16 Channels of Remote Operation. Operate up to 16 different units from a single remote. Remote/Manual Operation. Use the Crossfire with the remote or choose to operate it manually from the controls located on the front. Red Backlit LCD Display Low Battery Indicator Numeric Keypad Sound Entry. Don't like scrolling through your sounds? Directly enter the number of the sound you wish to play on the numeric keypad for direct access. For those that prefer the scrolling, the rotary selector knob allows you to scroll through sounds without the need for memorizing your sound list. 10 Custom Sound Presets. Store up to 10 custom sound presets with individual volume levels. Two quick access preset buttons are located on the side of the Crossfire remote. FOXCAST™ Design up to 10 entire stands including the individual sounds, volume levels, durations, and passages of silence. When selected, a custom sequence will go through the steps you defined and complete your entire calling sequence without requiring any need for using the remote control. FOXFADE™ Manipulate the volume level of the L/R channels on a stereo audio file. For example, if you are playing a sound that has a rabbit on the left audio channel and a coyote on the right audio channel you can use FOXFADE to gain independent control of volume of both sounds within the stereo audio file (i.e. decrease the volume of the rabbit--or silence it completely--while the volume of the coyote remains the same or vice versa.) In mono operation, FOXFADE will act as a mixer moving sounds from the front speaker to rear speaker."

It does have one mark at the end of the barrel and that is why I have cut price in half.This mark will not impact the barrel and you can't hardly see it, butI want to be truthful to the buyer.
DO NOT BUY THIS BARREL if, then following is true about your Remington Model 870 20 guage.Remington made the change from full size 20 ga guns to light weight scaled receivers in the mid 70's.Standard weight 20 ga receivers are identified with serial numbers ending with the suffix ""X"" or ""N"".A quarter will fit through the support ring on the full size guns, but not on the light weight frames.So if a quarter will fit through the support ring of the barrel, then DO NOT BUY THIS BARREL.

Don't confuse this for a Bodyguard 38, that gun is 1/2 plastic. This one is all metal, alloy frame, steel cylinder, NO PLASTIC, but only weighs 15oz.Less than a year old, and only 200-250 rounds through it. I'm selling it to finance a new .357 snubbie. It's all black, with original grips, double action only and has gutter sights. It does have some minor wear from use, mostly around the cylinder where the index lock rides. This is normal for blued/finished revolvers. It doesnt show any holster wear because I mostly pocket carry it. It's AWESOME for pocket carry because it's so light you almost forget it's there, and should the SHTF, you dont have to pull it out to fire it, you can aim and fire it through a pant, jacket, or cargo pocket. (it's great for preserving the element of surprise in an up close encounter) It comes with the original box, an Alien Gear IWB holster(not shown, but is included), and one full box of 129gr Federal Hydra Shok+p self defense ammo. It has been upgraded with an Apex Tactical trigger but will come with original parts in a bag. The trigger upgrade lowers the pull from 13-14 pounds to around 9-10 which makes for a much smoother and more accurate shot. Shoot me an email if you want more pics and details.Thanks and have a nice day."

Creating a hard-use tactical rifle by combining the principles of modularity, simplicity, and reliability was what Beretta set out to accomplish. Beretta made short work of this concept and thus, the ARX100 was born. Fully ambidextrous controls, replaceable barrels, and countless accessories, make the ARX100 a perfect fit for multi-mission roles. Now you can earn a piece of innovation without breaking your wallet. The Beretta ARX160 in.22 L.R. is a faithful replica of the battle tested ARX160 serving with the Italian Military. The weight, balance, look, feel and most of the controls placement and operation are just like the 5.56mmx45 NATO rifle. It is the perfect platform for training purposes and also makes a fun, reliable target rifle.Specifications and Features:Ambidextrous, two position safety leverEasy access to the bolt and trigger system like .223 riflePictanny Rails following MIL STD 1913 in aluminium and polymerAmbidextrous magazine releaseCharging handle convertible from right to left when dissasembledTelescopic and foldable stockAdjustable polymer Flip Up sights18"" barrel system-rifle variant20 rounds STANAG type magazine"

I am sellling my PPQ 45. I've had this gun for around 10 months now and honestly I just never shoot it. When I first got it I put around 250 to 300 rounds through it and since then I've shot one box. So needless to say I am ready to just get something else. It comes with 2 12 round magazines, the box, paperwork, backstrap and replaceable magazine button. The gun is like new and I feel I could sell it as such as it's not even fully broken in yet. I am looking for 550 OBO but I am NOT interested in trades of any kind. If you have any other questions or are interested please email me, call or text @ eight43-501-three101. Please only serious inquiries and thanks to all for checking it out."
