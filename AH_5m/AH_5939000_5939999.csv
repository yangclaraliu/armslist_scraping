I am only looking for a larger homedefense gun, also only looking to trade for the right gun. The images may not provide a completely accurate depiction of this guns condition, as it does show some age and is missing the front bead. However this gun has been well maintained, works flawlessly and is extremely accurate. These are known to be collectable firearms and some in perfect condition are fetching around $300.00. I would say this gun is in fair condition and worth in the neighborhood of $150.00 to $175.00 to a collector or enthusiast. Its heaveir than many fully loaded multiple shot 12 gauges made these days. I have read the original manuals for this gun online stating this gun will shoot smooth slugs, but have not tested that ammunition in it. If I cannot find the right trade I may bring it to a gun shop with extra cash next Friday to see what is available, or trade with cash for a better firearm on Friday Sept. 30th when I get paid. I am seeking ideally a good 20 gauge pump or double barrel. I would consider possibly any old decent revolvers in good working condition also. If nothing else I will be keeping this gun and buying better rounds for it as I do very much like it, and it is a family airloom. Anyone with a decent offer or who just wants to talk guns text me at 2five6 7seven7 nine5nine6."
