Also included second set of Dan Wesson grips 1911 VZ OFFICER ECO BLACK GREY AND GREEN.Bought it and the wife was pissed. My loss is your gain at $1360 firm no trades no travel. You need to come to Fort Wayne to get this deal. PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONPresenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed"

I'm the original owner of this Springfield XDM with 5.25"" barrel. It has been customized by Springer Precision in Bend, OR with most of the work being done by Scott himself. Upgrades include Trijicon night sights, factory clean up service and polish of non trigger parts such as the feed ramp to improve functioning and even wear, Marine Grip texture finish, Sniper Blue cerakote over the original stainless steel slide and small parts, extender slide release, solid guide rod with 16 lbs Wolff 1911 spring modified to fit, extended mag release, combat / carry trigger work ( I believe it is set to 4.5 lbs, very crisp release ). Due to the Marine Grip stippling, the backstrap can no longer be changed and the additional backstraps are not included. The stippling was done with the smallest backstrap on it. There is wear on the front of the muzzle from use with the holster as well as minor wear on the take down lever and slide release. The quick takedown components were professionally removed by Scott so that it breaks down like an XD. Includes 3 19rd mags.Also includes a DM Bullard Dual Carry holster in saddle brown, an SKB pistol case, and the original XD gear and XDM case. Please be sure this is legal in your area, for example this is not on the California approved list of firearms. FFL background check is required. Additional pictures available upon request.Asking $600/ motivated"

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.SPECIFICATIONS"

The pistol has the classic threaded barrel (it supresses very well, if you are into that kind of thing), and it comes with the original magazine. It shows a little cosmetic wear, but functions really well with that original magazine. I have not had a chance to test it with the new Ruger hi cap 10/22 mags, but it worked just fine with the 10 round ones, too. Fortunately, this one seems to not have the exraction problems that plague this model from time to time. I have seen these go for as high as $600 for like-new, though some optimist on gunbroker thinks he can get $750 for his. Trust me, I am no optimist when it comes to this little ugly duckling. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! I live in Fort Atkinson, but may be willing to meet elsewhere if my schedule allows."

Scope turrets are 2cm/100m clicks to simplify math. This rifle and scope are perfectly capable of 100yd shots. I was able to make ragged holes with it at 100 yd in unsupported prone and not much bigger than a penny at 200. With a proper rest would easily hold tight groups at longer ranges. High quality steel 10 or 20rd mags are available from csspecs and I have not had any issues cycling in these mags or otherwise. You can reload for this rifle with a lot less powder if you would like because it has a 3 position adjustable gas port. I like to do so because full house 308 Is overkill for whitetails. The stock is ugly but great for offhand positions and the 20 rd mags mage a great foregrip. The stock forearm kinda sucks not gonna lie but there are aftermarket options. Like I said I just grab the mag if I don't have The rifle rested and it's great. The trigger is so much nicer than the stock trigger. Barrel is non chrome lined but built to last like everything built at Zastava is. Built on a heavier duty RPK receiver With a long RPK piston that really cuts down recoil. Weld on the muzzle but can still be cut and extent installed to accept a variety of standard AK thread brakes or loctite will be fine as long as you're not putting a bunch of rounds through at one time. I live on the west side of the state so I will take $100 off if you pick it up. This is a really good price on a semi auto .308, better than a gay-r10 Any day, much better price than an m1A and more reliable too. Throw a handful of sand in your m1A see what happens. An RPK can stand up to some shit.  This rifle also has a bolt hold open safety lever and improved dust cover latch. Any questions call Anthony at REDACTED."

In excellent shape. Comes with original box and 130 rounds of ammo plus another 186 spent cases.
Beautiful revolver.
Brand new they are running $899.
I'm asking $600 with the ammo.
Also selling a 1895G Marlin (JM stamped) in 45/70 in excellent shape with 38 rounds of ammo. Ported barrel. You can have the gun case too. Asking $600.
But if you buy them both I'll let them go for $1,000. including ammo (which would cost you over $150 at a store just for the ammo).
A few have tried to get me lower on this and it’s ticking me off. Now I understand trying to get a lower price, but my price is already very very fair. Let’s be clear: Ammo is not used. It doesn’t wear out. So I could charge store prices for the ammo on top of the price of the guns.
If you buy both guns I’m basically throwing in $150 worth of ammo for free and you are only paying $500 for each gun. Go find that deal at any gun store. You flat out won’t.
Do the math: If you think I’m charging for the ammo in that $1,000 price it works out like this: $1,000 minus 150 equals $850 for TWO guns in excellent shape. That’s one gun for $400 and the other for $450. You will not find that deal anywhere else online. I know, I’ve looked. And the JM stamped Marlin is getting rarer to find. I had one person tell me they sold their Marlin for $900.
I could charge more but I’m trying to give you an awesome deal right from the start on both guns. Even if you don’t want the Ruger you would get the Marlin for less buying both and then sell the Ruger yourself or trade it for something else you want. Buying both guns and ammo for $1000 is an awesome deal. I’m not asking you to pay what I originally paid for the guns.
No trades. I don’t want your guns, toys, old dog or used Aunt Betty’s party hat from 1950. My bad for not putting this in the ad to begin with, so sorry for the confusion.
Cash only, in person.
I could care less if you’ve a FLL in some other state. I’m not dealing with that and I don’t have time for it. I won’t do cashier’s checks, personal checks, money orders or deal with third parties. This isn’t my first trip to the rodeo. I won’t waste your time so don’t waste mine. I’ll have a bill of sale ready with gun details, serial numbers and agreed upon price. We sign and date both and we each get a copy. I’m a straight shooter and I expect no less from others.

Ported barrel. You can have the gun case too. Asking $600.
Also selling a Ruger Bisley New Model Blackhawk 7.5"" barrel .45 Colt
In excellent shape. Comes with original box and 130 rounds of ammo plus another 186 spent cases.
Beautiful revolver.
Brand new they are running $899.
I'm asking $600 with the ammo. Almost all the used Rugers of the same quality I saw were $595.
But if you buy them both I'll let them go for $1,000. including ammo (which would cost you about $150 at a store just for the ammo).
A few have tried to get me lower on this and it’s ticking me off. Now I understand trying to get a lower price, but my price is already very very fair. Let’s be clear: Ammo is not used. It doesn’t wear out. So I could charge store prices for the ammo on top of the price of the guns.
If you buy both guns I’m basically throwing in $150 worth of ammo for free and you are only paying $500 for each gun. Go find that deal at any gun store. You flat out won’t.
Do the math: If you think I’m charging for the ammo in that $1,000 price it works out like this: $1,000 minus 150 equals $850 for TWO guns in excellent shape. That’s one gun for $400 and the other for $450. You will not find that deal anywhere else online. I know, I’ve looked. And the JM stamped Marlin is getting rarer to find. I had one person tell me they sold their Marlin for $900.
I could charge more but I’m trying to give you an awesome deal right from the start on both guns. Even if you don’t want the Ruger you would get the Marlin for less buying both and then sell the Ruger yourself or trade it for something else you want. Buying both guns and ammo for $1000 is an awesome deal. I’m not asking you to pay what I originally paid for the guns.
No trades. I don’t want your guns, toys, old dog or used Aunt Betty’s party hat from 1950. My bad for not putting this in the ad to begin with, so sorry for the confusion.
Cash only, in person.
I could care less if you’ve a FLL in some other state. I’m not dealing with that and I don’t have time for it. I won’t do cashier’s checks, personal checks, money orders or deal with third parties. This isn’t my first trip to the rodeo. I won’t waste your time so don’t waste mine. I’ll have a bill of sale ready with gun details, serial numbers and agreed upon price. We sign and date both and we each get a copy. I’m a straight shooter and I expect no less from others.
