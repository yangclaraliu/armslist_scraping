Just the FFL transfer fee.1. Ruger LCR .38+P - $399: You will get the pistol, the box/manual, just the black OEM grips and a box of 50 FMJ rounds to get you started. A new in the store LCR will still cost you $450-$500 w/out ammo.As you can see by the pic, I've also have the Hogue wood-look grip for this gun, 550 rounds of total JHP & FMJ ammo (400 rounds is JHP), a Fobus paddle holster, two speedloader pouches, 6 Five Star aluminum speed loaders and the aluminum speed loader bench block. I paid another $710 for all this ammo and accessories. That's $1210 I paid for the LCR and everything.I will take $800 for the LCR pistol and ALL the LCR ammo and accessories.2. S&W M&P Shield 9mm w/ thumb safety - $325: This pistol is brand new, never shot and never carried. No box but will get the manual. Comes with the two magazines as new.3. Cimarron/Pietta Frontier SAA .45 Colt six shooter - $499: This is brand new, never fired, never carried and comes with the manual. The beautiful scroll work and bluing on this gun is high end and I paid $625 for this new with tax.So now the trades. I'm pretty much only looking for Glock 43, 26 or 19. I'll trade the entire LCR package ($1200 trade value) for a G43+G26 or G19. So two guns for the entire LCR package. Otherwise, I'll trade the LCR in the first config I listed straight across for any of the Glocks listed. I'll trade the Shield 9 + $100 cash from me for any of the Glocks listed. I'll trade the six sooter for any of the Glocks listed plus $100 on your end or some extra mags and such.I will consider other trades but keep in mind that unless it is some special firearm, I'd be looking to turn it around to sell since It's mainly cash I need right now. So any hard to turnaround firearms such as obscure or unpopular calibers or models won't be considered, sorry. Thanks!"

Legally speaking this is a handgun. I have a copy of BATF's letter to Thordsen Customs explicitly stating that the use of their buffer tube cover kit in combination with a Mission First Tactical E-Volv does not constitute the construction of an SBR.

This police package comes to us from an estate sale.
The revolver is a Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.
The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. The grips closely resemble custom-made dark walnut Bull's-eye target thumb rest grips. There is some wear in a couple of areas, primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster.
My experience with Model 10-5 revolvers is that they are really fine shooters with nice triggers. I took this one out to the gun range tonight thinking I would shoot the handful of loose .38 caliber I had in a range bag just to make sure it fired okay. That was just a tease, as I ended up shooting that handful and a box of 50 Remington factory ammunition. It is a really good shooting gun with a nice trigger and the custom grips made for a really comfortable hold and lack of felt recoil.
The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets.
The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.
This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.Contact me for additional pictures.
