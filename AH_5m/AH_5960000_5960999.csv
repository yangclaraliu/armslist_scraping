There are stores in town who have them on deck and ready to go though. Honestly the few times I have shot this thing I loved it and it has been my carry gun daily since. There are tons of accessories available online for it like a laser sight, extended clips and anything else you could think of for cheap. Only reason I am selling it is because I have to pay the rest of my school tuition by the 21st and I am selling all I have to do so. If you were to buy it and decide a month later you don't want it, I would buy it back from you in a heartbeat.  I have about $450 into this whole set up and that doesn't include the time i’ve spent taking care of it and cleaning it along with other small fees and stuff you pay when buying a gun online. The nice thing about this set up is, its cleaned and ready to go and you dont have to buy a single thing for it. I would be willing to let it all go this weekend for $400 firm only until tuesday. That’s the biggest loss I am willing to take on it and if I can't get that I will have to find a way to keep it myself. I can't do any trades because of my current situation unfortunately but priorities come first to me. If you would like better pictures, close ups or anything like that just email me. I cant post many on here and there is too much to fit. Must have ID and be willing to sign bill of sale. Shoot me an email with any contact info because I have been recieving too much spam lately.

I bought it from Gander Mountain this past March. Unfortunately, I am only selling due to business expenses. It is brand new in box (bnib). Never been fired.
I decided I wanted to buy an AR to keep completely stock, just with iron sites, since recently manufacturers are offering quality rifles in the $600-$700 price range. Before, selecting the Eagle AR-15 I did not know a lot about it. Armalite really only concentrates on producing high quality AR platforms, where the other large manufacturers sell a full range of firearms and can promote their products and advertise in a much larger capacity.
After this AR was recommended by a local gun shop, I did a lot of research, read comparisons & reviews, and handled other rifles in this price range from S&W, Ruger, Anderson, and Colt. I decided to buy the Eagle because out of all of them it felt the most solid, is fully equipped, highly rated, and has very good specs. Also, it is chambered in .223 / 5.56 Wylde which is gaining popularity.
Selling for $620 which includes (2) new 30rd Magpul PMags (1) Gen 2, (1) Gen 3. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Mike"

This is a large frame (original Vaquero), not the current ""New Vaquero"" model. The large frame originals are capable of ""Ruger only"" loads. It's the blued model with Ruger's faux case hardened frame. The revolver exhibits a slight turn line on the cylinder from handling but has not been fired outside of the Ruger factory. The model number is 00511 and the catalog number is BNVBH-453. Now the backstory on the rare part....Ruger transitioned from the original Vaquero to the new Vaquero late 2004 early 2005 timeframe and stopped making the originals. Thus gun was made in April of 2010 (based on the spent shell casing that came with it from the factory), 5 years after the end of production and 5 years after Ruger stopped the faux case hardening on their blued single actions. Furthermore, the notorious Ruger warning label on the barrel was much smaller and on the underside of the barrel. Prior examples were larger and on the side of the barrel. After acquiring, I called Ruger to verify the manufacter date. Between that and the model/catalog number (which were unique to this particular gun), I was able to find out through a few searches this was one of Ruger's parts clean up releases that were only sold through Davidson's, and that there were likely less than 200 or so made. The late production alone makes it a Ruger collector's object of desire, but the barrel warning label variation puts it over the top. If interested, feel free to reply with your number. I'd be happy to text additional pictures, including the factory label showing model/catalog as well as the dated spent casing. Price is $700"

It is a SIG Stepped Barrel, with the ""Christmas Tree"" mark from the barrel being shortened at the throat. This is also visible with the Swiss Barrel company's emblem being partially obscured where the receiver meets the barrel. This rifle was originally a 1917 Russian M91, with the date confirmed under the tang and the Imperial Eagle still visible on the hex receiver. Research into the Finnish serial numbers indicates this rifle was assigned to the Pirkka Hame district. Barrel bands are early Russian, with captured screws. A Russian cartouche on the buttstock is still faintly visible. The sling hangers are Finnish. None of the numbers match, typical with most Finnish captured rifles. I have function-checked and dry-fired the rifle without issue. The bore is clean and in very good shape. This was going to go on gunbroker but my computer and JAVA don't get along. The high asking price is due to the fact a very similar rifle sold for over $1800 on that website last year.  If you have a serious interest in the rifle, we'll talk about the price and I'll send over several more photos. I must sell this rifle as is, due to the high risk it may come back missing parts or altered. I will give preference to C&R FFL holders (I am one) and will ship with extreme caution taken via insurance and packaging."

I will include the link from Smith to provide more information below. The revolver overall is in good condition it does show signs of holster wear on the cylinder and there is a small mark on the right side. The grips also do have a small chip on them. Please see the pictures below I tried to highlight all the small imperfections. The trigger is excellent and it has everything from the factory. It appears to be manufactured on 2/1/2008. I like the revolver very much I just do not have much time to shoot anymore. I purchased it to shoot and only fired about 12 rounds through it in the past year I have had it. The serial on the box matches the gun I just mark them out in the photo for my protection.Text REDACTED

Glock MAP $449.00 for more information on MAP pricing please call.   With the success of the GLOCK 26 and ever changing trends in the concealed carry pistol market, GLOCK redesigned their subcompact 9mm almost entirely to bring the GLOCK 43 to market. GLOCK's new slimline pistol has taken the single stack 9mm segment by storm, outselling even the most popular contender. The new GLOCK 43 has transformed how shooters thought of single stack carry guns, no longer were they uncomfortable and hard to shoot. Now concealed carriers have the ability to practice with their carry gun without discomfort and an unpleasant shooting experience that some other single stack 9mm pistols offer. Shooters are flocking to the GLOCK 43 thanks to new and refined features like a finger groove-less grip perfect for all hand sizes and a reversible magazine catch coupled with the all too familiar GLOCK feel. Recoil is kept in check with a dual spring recoil system and the ever-present Safe-Action system ensures that the trigger feels just like the GLOCK 43's bigger brother. Thanks to the new one-inch wide design, the GLOCK 43 will disappear under clothing like it isn't even there.
