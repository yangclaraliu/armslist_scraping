Straight shooting Mosin.This rifle is a perfect platform to make a project.

Monte Carlo gun stock converts Mosin Nagant gun into a modern-looking hunting rifle. Chemical-resistant Scorpion recoil pad absorbs impact for pain-free shooting and improves target reacquisition by minimizing muzzle lift. DuPont Extreme Temperature Glass-reinforced Polymer and raised 3M Soft Touch cheek rest pad for improved shooting comfort.

Blued steel components. Rifle style forearm. Grade II/III walnut. Like no other. Do you like the look of a pistol grip stock on a classic rifle like the ’73? Read on if you do. Because there is no doubt that there is something entirely cool about a pistol grip stock that has been combined with an octagon barrel. It has the look more of a dedicated rifleman than a working cowboy. You may love this rifle for other reasons, but the fact remains that a ’73 like this is purely a classic. But we have taken it a step beyond with a walnut stock with fine Grade II/III walnut that simply gives it the look of the special limited rifles produced by Winchester in the mid-1800’s that became the legend of stories and movies. Timeless styling. The classic rifle-style forearm offers a timeless look and feel. It features a polished blued steel receiver, lever, crescent buttplate and forearm cap. And then the crescent buttplate is the final touch — slipping right into your shoulder for a more solid hold from any shooting position. Set your sights. The rear tang is drilled and tapped for scope mount. Features a semi-buckhorn rear sight and a Marble’s gold bead front sight.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $1225.

This rifle is in superb mechanical shape. In fact, I just test fired it again in my back yard, and rang the steel at 50 yards with no problem whatsoever. Way too much fun. The takedown feature also seems useful if you are the backpacking type. If you don't know much about this model, there are plenty of websites that sing its praises. All I can add to them is that it feels very well made. I love my marlin 60s and Ruger 10/22s, but this rifle feels like it is in an entirely different class. It is like when I traded in my old Infiniti for a Corolla. The Corolla is practical and works well, but it just doesn't drive the same. Anyway, this rifle, as evidenced by the pictures, has some cosmetic wear. It was stored in a basement for years, and there are some rust spots that have been cleaned up. Fortunately, the bore is great, and the internals seem to have escaped the moisture without a scratch. I tried to take decent pictures, but Armslist lowers the quality. If you would like more pictures, just let me know! If you are looking for a shooter version of an american classic, and don't want to damage that shiny, $1200 version you have been looking at, check this little rifle out."

Known variously as the “Tommy Gun,” “Chicago Typewriter” and “Trench Broom,” along with hip flasks and raccoon coats this iconic SMG came to personify the Roaring ’20s. But it didn’t stop there. The Thompson went on to help win World War II, evolve into a highly prized collector’s item and, in the guise of a semi-auto now purveyed by Auto-Ordndance, a semi-auto for the general public. This is one of the most fascinating firearms in history. It would be doing it a gross injustice not to give some of its background before we look at the current offerings."
