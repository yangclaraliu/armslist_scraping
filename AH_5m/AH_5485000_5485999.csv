I have $1600 in the rifle and I'm only asking $1000 for it and it comes with a scope, bipod, and $2500 rounds of boat tail ammo. The scope is very nice and extremely clear. It's a 4-16x50mm mil-dot reticle long range scope. The rifle started out as an unfired Mosin, but everything has been fully customized so, it's not one anymore. All the parts that I had put on the rifle were made in the USA! Here is a little about the rifle. To start off, the rifle has a new Archangel stock, bipod, and scope. The rifle only has 100 rds through it, it's not even broke in. The rifle has a Rock Solid Indestries MI-24c picatinny rail that was professionally mounted and drilled into the receiver. The barrel was cut down to eliminate any vibrations and it's free floating. The barrel has been crowned and also threaded for a 5/8 flash hider or a suppressor. The barrel is chrome lined. It comes with a AAC 300 blackout flash hider with a T10 ratchet mount for a simple twist and lock silencer. The rifle has a Timney adjustable trigger, I have it set for a 1 pound pull. The bolt has been bent, threaded, welded, and then polished. It comes with a Gold handle on it. It has a Rock Solid Industries stainless steel firing pin and spring for a faster trigger reset. This rifle was bulit to shoot a 1000yds or more. It's a tac driver and very powerful. It shoots great and looks amazing. It fires the 7.62x54R round which is pretty large. It's cheap and fun to shoot, about 21 cents per round. I could list a lot more, but it's a rifle you just need to take a look at. Only asking $1000 for it. I'm selling because I don't have time to shoot it anymore and it's a safe queen. Please call or text me at, REDACTED, thanks!"
