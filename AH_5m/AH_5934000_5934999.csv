I purchased it from RGuns back in 2011, cleaned off the cosmoline, and it’s been stored in the gun cabinet (bolt open but de-cocked; garrison style) ever since. I never fired it and only took it out every spring to renew the gun oil as I do with all my “safe queens.” The optics are clear and the bore is very good if not excellent. The scope serial number is stamped on the left of the barrel shank and begins with (43) indicating 1943 manufacture. Some hieroglyphic precedes the serial number on the scope, I don’t know what it means. The actual serial number of the rifle has an alpha-prefix of (BT). The rifle is all matching (receiver, butt-plate, magazine floor-plate, bolt). The RGUNS mark is on the top of the barrel shank right above where the bolt meets the receiver. This is really all the information I have, i.e. there are no (MO) marks, Finnish marks, or any other marks from any non-Soviet countries. It’s just a plain-Jane 1943 PU. These are the only pictures available. The RGuns PU rifles were well researched by the collector community and regarded as genuine (i.e. non-bubba fakes). There’s LOTS of discussion on these rifles on the regular collector forums online.
 
The rifle comes with the original company receipt (with serial number), sling and bayonet, and the hard case that it come from RGuns in. The sale price is the receipt price (from back in 2011) plus the transfer I paid ($860 total). The price is FIRM. The only trade I'll consider is for a new or gently used Tavor SAR-18, otherwise cash only. Local sales only, thanks for looking."

If you decide to purchase the firearm, we can arrange to meet there and you will pay me for the rifle and then make payment arrangements with him for the transfer.Send an email thru Armslist and I will respond as soon as I can. I do not put listings on hold while you wait for a payday, wife’s permission or rich aunt to die. I will not ship firearms because of a couple of deadbeats who agreed to purchase firearms and then never supplied payment and a FFL to ship to. Please, no offers for trades as I prefer cash.

Even if you aren't interested in buying it, the pictures are worth looking at and that is free ;-)Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has wood grips with serial numbers that match the square butt frame.This thirty-six year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. It had 25 rounds fired through it by the previous owner, so it was not new in the box but oh so close. That gave me license to take it out this morning to the gun range to put 15 more rounds through it as I was firing my other .38 Special revolver.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures. Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

Incorporated into the new Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum. The ComforTech stock cushions the blow when an afternoon's ammo isn't measured in boxes, but by the case. The ComforTech system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, making the Cordoba possibly the fastest field gun ever built. Custom case & all paperwork included. Look it up on line for additional info, pictures & cost.(BENELLI CORDOBA COMFORT TECH 20 GA)."
