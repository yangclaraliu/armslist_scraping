Also comes with factory cleaning kit and a 10rd mag and 25rd mag. From the factory: The semi-auto hunting rifles  VEPR SUPER rifles are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F).    VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market  The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and either a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver or fixing bases for a top scope mount.

Listing my Glock 32 Gen 4 in .357 Sig. Gun was a recent purchase from Gun Broker and is in great shape...I'd say less than 200 rnds total. It had remains of the copper storage grease when I recieved it and I've fired a box of HST and Gold Dot since and it was flawless (>200 rnds). The prior owner had chosen to appoint the gun with talon grip, religious slide cover and grip plug (easily changable), along with 2 10 round magazines with Biohazard and Punisher logos (stock baseplates included). Gun has a 3 dot arrangement Truglo TFOs that are bright and strong. 
Thank you,

It also has a slimming effect, which the Maxus doesn't need as it is a well balanced work of technological art. The Maxus comes in an array of gorgeous hardwoods, satin nickel finish stocks, and cutting edge camo patterns, but we know a lot of hard core men (and women!) prefer a no-nonsense look. The black finish may look Spartan, but the Dura-Touch Armor Coating feels warm and ""grippy"" to the touch. A more serious and utilitarian look. The look of the Maxus Stalker matches the reliable function and fine engineering it wears on the inside. The PowerDrive gas system cycles a wide range of target, slug, and game loads, reducing measured and felt recoil to allow for greater comfort and quicker follow up shots. The SpeedLock forearm allows for quick access to change the magazine capacity, clean the gas piston system, or add/remove a sling. Lightning Trigger. It boasts a faster trigger lock time than any other autoloader trigger in its class, resulting in more pellets on target. Combined with Browning's Total Barrel Dynamics, the Maxus is capable of unparalleled accuracy.

NOTE: This model comes with 10-ROUND MAGAZINES for those states that can’t have the 15-rounders! Glock Perfection. The Glock 19 Gen4 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry or as a duty weapon. It is a mid size, 9mm, polymer frame handgun that uses a locked breach system referred to as “Safe Action”. This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger. Because it does not have a hammer, the spring loaded striker (firing pin) is technically blocked off, partially retracted and not in geometric alignment with a chambered cartridge. It is only by squeezing the trigger, which fully retracts and then releases the striker, that makes the pistol then capable of firing. The absence of a hammer also provides a sleeker profile that reduces both size and weight, while optimizing a smoother draw from concealment. The Glock 19 has the advantage of not having a manual safety, thus eliminating the need to consciously think about deactivating such a device during a deadly encounter. This is the ultimate point and shoot pistol. With 50% fewer components than conventional handguns of the same caliber, it means there are fewer parts to break, and you can literally disassemble and then reassemble the gun within seconds. The frame is made out of a synthetic polymer that is actually stronger than steel, yet 86% lighter and virtually indestructible. It can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 F to 158 F and still continue firing. An integral accessory rail provides the added benefit of quickly attaching lasers and / or lights for low visibility applications. The ergonomic grip angle is designed to allow the shooter to rapidly deploy the pistol under stress fire conditions. This series is referred to as “Gen4″ and has several noticeable upgrades over its Gen3 predecessors. A slightly smaller frame circumference, combined with interchangeable backstraps have been engineered to accommodate a variety of hand sizes. The rough texture grip allows for a more aggressive hold on the gun, especially in situations where maximum traction and weapons retention could make the difference between life or death. An enlarged reversible Gen4 magazine release makes it easier to perform reloads. A heavy duty recoil spring slightly reduces kick and also extends pistol life. Glock supplies a third magazine with Gen4 pistols that offers added firepower. The Glock 19 Gen4 features an outstanding ergonomic design, where a highly efficient bore axis-to-weight distribution ratio ensures controlled shots, even under rapid fire conditions. In addition, the dark earth polymer frame also provides much softer felt recoil than most conventional metal frame handguns. The pistol weighs in at a little over 21- ounces and has a DAO trigger pull of roughly 5.5 pounds. The metal components have been finished with a unique surface treatment called Tenifer that is extremely corrosion and wear resistant. In case you are unfamiliar with Tenifer, it’s Glock’s trade name for the ferric nitrocarburized case hardening process that diffuses nitrogen and carbon directly into the surface metal, thereby elevating the Rockwell hardness to somewhere between a file and a diamond. Three full capacity 15- round magazines are provided with Glock 19 Gen4 pistols. A set of white outline sights sit on top of the slide, are highly visible, easy to use and track reasonably well. The 4.02” hexagonal hammer forged barrel of the Glock 19 Gen4 increase muzzle velocity and provide greater accuracy than conventional rifled barrels.

The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum.
