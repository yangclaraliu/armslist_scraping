Looks like it has barely been shot at all with great wood and perfect bore.
Only minor issue is the prior owner shot it with the action screws not fully tightened and it put a minor crack in the wood behind the action and pushed the action lug back a touch. Not a structural problem... just keeps the rifle from being perfect. Since it isn't perfect I'm only asking $279.*I sold the bayonet in the pictures a while ago. This sale is just for the rifle.

The U.S. Military's choice of Model 500 and 590 pump shotguns for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 500 design incorporates dual extractors that take a solid grip on the cartridge's rim, dual action bars to ensure reliable cycling of the action without binding or twisting, and an anti-jam shell elevator. The bolt locks into a barrel extension by means of a top lug providing a solid steel-to-steel lock up, while the streamline aluminum receiver keeps gun's weight down and well balanced. The ambidextrous, top-mounted safety is highly visible, and convenient to reach without moving the shooter's trigger finger. The Model 500's simplistic design makes fieldstripping easy by tapping out a single pin. The Mossberg 500 Pump-Action Shotgun with black synthetic butt-stock and forearm makes the perfect all-purpose shotgun that serves for waterfowl hunting, upland birds, deer, home defense, and informal sporting clays. The synthetic stock model comes with a vent-ribbed barrel with a matte blued finish, twin bead sights, sling swivel studs, and uses Accu-Set screw-in choke tubes. Interchangeable barrels and an infinite selection of aftermarket accessories enhance the Model 500's versatility by allowing user to customize it for specific purposes.

The sellers won't meet in person and usually want the rifle shipped to some other address (My favorite is ""I'm buying this for my dad. I'll pay for it, but can you ship it to him?). This is NOT one of those ads. My strong preference is for a face to face, cash sale. Because of the number of scamers that have responded to this ad I will only ship this rifle if it is paid for with a USPS money order. And I will only ship it to a valid FFL (01 or 03 C&R)... not some other address.
Not thrilled to sell this. However, I run gear-report.com and just bought a surplus Humvee as a field vehicle for the website... but I had not budgeted for it. So, I have to liquidate a few assets to cover the cost. If you go to my site and use the search bar at the top right to search for ""Garand"" you will find an articles and video about this VFW Garand and the other Garand I have for sale.

I am willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense ONLY if payment is made with a USPS money order.  I had a rather convincing prospective buyer try to sucker me on a remote deal with payment by some othe means.

I also have a CZ OEM shorter takedown pin/slide release installed on it. Strictly cosmetic wear and does not effect the functionality in any way at all. Iv put about 800 rounds through it with zero malfunctions. If you arent familiar with the NATO testing process check it out, this gun went thought and exeeded NATO testing. Its a great gun, i have this and a PCR and dont need both and have decided to part with the P-01. This does have the cajun gun works spring kit (installed) witch reduces the DA trigger pull about 40 precent (awesone upgrade) and i have the stock springs as well. Really a great gun by an outstanding gun manufacturer. 500 firm. The only reason i am letting it go for this price is because of the cosmetic wear. These retail for 630.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380 ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-sized SIGLite Night Sights means the P938 handles like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release, and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The SAS model features an anti-snag treatment on the frame and slide and custom Goncalo hardwood grips.Included are:  >  Factory case and contents (holster, one standard 6 round magazine, one extended 7 round magazine).  >  Two additional extended 7 round magazines ($40 each on any website)  >  Extra set of wooden Celtic cross grips (not installed)All ""good guy"" paperwork is required - you show me your concealed carry permit, or pistol purchase permit or there's no deal.  Period.  No exceptions."
