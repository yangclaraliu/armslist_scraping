Pusca Semiautomata cu Luneta, ""semi-automatic rifle with scope"") is a Romanian military designated marksman rifle. It is also called PSL-54C, Romak III, FPK, FPK Dragunov and SSG-97 (""scharfschutzengewehr"" - 1997).  PSL rifles are made at the Fabrica de Arme Cugir SA Cugir arsenal in Cugir, Romania. Their primary purpose is to be used by a designated marksman and is used to extend the range of the average soldier beyond the capabilities of their issued AKM carbines. It is built around a stamped steel receiver similar to the RPK light machine gun's receiver. The PSL's operation is the same short stroke action of the Kalashnikov family of weapons. Its appearance is similar to the Dragunov Sniper Rifle though the Dragunov uses a different action altogether. The PSL is chambered for the same venerable M1908/30 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of the Dragunov in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian magazines. The magazines, though they look similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification.  The PSL is typically issued with a version of the PSO-1 telescopic weapon sight, this version lacking the battery compartment and IR detection screen. The reticle is illuminated by mildly radioactive Tritium rather than the lamp of the Russian PSO-1. The optical sight is of 4X magnification and the lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian PSO-1 scope.  The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the locking lever open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy use of the iron sights and storage and protection of the scope when in transit or at other times when it is not needed.  PSL rifles have some notable features, the skeleton stock is somewhat similar to the Dragunov's but included an interesting corrugated and spring loaded stamped steel buttplate. When the rifle is fired this helps reduce the felt recoil to a degree.  The PSL's scope is made by the I.O.R. firm in Bucharest. I.O.R. Valdada is a Romanian company which has been making optics since 1936. They currently use German made Schott glass coated with the Carl Zeiss T-3 system to eliminate glare and maximize light transmission. It is unknown what glass and coatings they used at the time they produced the PSL's scope, however I.O.R. had a long association with western European optics manufacturers and maintained these despite being caught within the Iron Curtain. In 1967 I.O.R. collaborated with various German manufacturers and in 1975 an association was established with Carl Zeiss which led to even more expansion and modernization. Initial versions of this scope were more or less identical to the Russian PSO-1 with battery powered lamp reticle illumination. Shortly afterward the scope was revised to eliminate the electrical illumination and replace it with a radioactive based glowing light source, thus simplifying the maintenance and construction of the scope. The scopes found today typically show no illumination because the lifespan of the tritium has expired. Mosin Nagant 91/30 sniper its a simple mosian nagant in good condition with a PU optic only upgrades are a rubber butt plate, comes with bayonet two ammo pouches, clean tools this set is to be sold together asking 3500 firm also includes (2) 440 rd tins (7) psl 10rd magazines and (2) 20 wolf SP and a handfull of lose ammo Lee reloading dies and 100 pieaces of unfired brass"

My intention was to use this for night coyote hunts, however that has not happened as planned. The gun is set up currently with an Olight M21 Warrior light (green filter) in a Magpul offset mount, Burris PEPR 1"" scope mount and Bushnell 3-9x40 Banner scope, GG&G picatinny bipod swivel mount. I've added ATI picatinny rails at 6 and 9 o'clock for the light and a bipod. I have approximately 150 rounds of CCI and Winchester .22 WMR ammunition available as well.All factory paperwork and box will go with the purchase. If you would like to buy the entire package I would ask $575, the price for the gun only is $440 If you would like just the scope and mount with the gun, I'll do $500.Trades for a short action bolt rifle (Savage, Remington, Ruger etc) considered. Thank you."

Rifle was built by David White of D&T Custom Gunworks, starting with a Model 700 Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation in 7mm Remington Ultra Mag.   It is sub-MOA, featuring an HS Precision stock with aluminum bedding block + free-floated 24"" barrel. Muzzle brake reduces recoil to very manageable .243 Win or less range. It is remarkable.   Aftermarket custom-grade trigger breaks at an extremely crisp 1 1/2- 2 pounds. I may be over-estimating that. It is light, because that's the way I like it, but it's user-adjustable, so you'll get along just fine.   It is equipped with a virtually new Bushnell Elite 6500 2.5-16X 42mm riflescope that is one of the brightest on the market. This particular model features the standard Multi-X reticle.    I simply have too many deer rifles of similar build and ballistic capabilities, and this one hasn't been used in a few years. The bore has been meticulously cared for.  I have $1100 in upgrades to the factory rifle alone, not counting the optics. I am asking $1200 because I know it requires a specialized buyer, and I'd like to turn the cash into a new bow. Call or text John @ REDACTEDThanks for looking."

This is a 1911 design firearm, single action with grip and external safety. The barrel length is 5” heavy bull. The sights both front and rear are fixed. The slide is polished blue and the frame is matte blue finish. The safety is a single sided safety, for right hand shooters. The firearm weighs in at about 42 oz. The recoil spring is a very heavy 25lbs to operate the powerful 10 MM. The slide is forged steel. The aggressive cocking serrations on the slide, allow the shooter a better more improved grip when actuating the slide and again is needed because of the 25lb recoil spring. The wood Cocobolo grips give the firearm a classic look and the angle transition corners have been rounded for comfort and control. This firearm is in great shape. It has been carried and shot some. There are some handling and holster marks here and there, I have tried to bring attention to these areas in the pictures provided. Both the slide and the frame have some minor marks. The grips have a couple of marks also, as shown in the pictures provided. The firearm is very sound and very tight. The slide to frame fit is great and the bore and chamber are in great shape. I see no issues or problems with this firearm, everything looks good. No factory box or manual. Hard case provided. One 8 round magazine is provided. This firearm would grade 85% plus according to the NRA grading system. Please make sure that this firearm is legal in your state, if you are not sure please check with your local FFL dealer. We do ship to California, but there may be delays due to the assignment of a CADOJ number before the firearm may enter into the state.

Unfortunately she finds it a bit big and heavy, so sadly now I need to sell it and find her something lighter. It is practically brand new as only about 100 rounds shot through it. It is a 357 magnum and naturally also capable of firing 38 special rounds. Everything operating smoothly, and cosmetically it is a beautiful gun, clean and lubed up with absolutely no scratches or imperfections. As a matter of fact, it is better than when I first got it, due to some improvements that I have made on it. One of it is the front sight. Originally it came with a stick on red tape that was semi loose, so I took it off and painted the sight (red) and applied protective clear coat on it. Another, bigger improvement is that I've removed the original ""Ribber"" grips and installed the much better ""Pachmayr Diamond Pro grips"". Not really thinking of trading, but a good .45 semi auto (not 1911 type) or 3"" LCRX 38 special revolver may spark my interest. Please consider the almost brand new condition and the previously mentioned improvements that were done on the gun. I have also just reduced my asking price, so don't let this great deal pass you by at $475/obo. Face to face and cash only please. Legal to purchase with ID required.
