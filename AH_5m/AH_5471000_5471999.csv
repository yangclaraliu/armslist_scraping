It came from Germany wrapped with warnings in German that I couldn't read. The grip is an HK-91 grip ordered from HK Parts. I then had the gun professionally Cerakote'd by Palmer Ordnance in Seabeck, WA. Finally I added a Nightforce SHV scope (3-10x 42mm .250MOA). This gun is a beauty and shoots great. I still have all the original jungle green furniture, which will be included. Also included are 6 magazines, 5 steel and 1 aluminum, all surplus G3 magazines. I have the original box for the scope and the hard case that the gun was shipped in. I put a lot of money into this project building a very nice shooter. The scope alone runs about $900.  Unfortunately I am selling to fund other gun projects. Asking $2000."

It has never been fired except for test firing at factory. I reconfigured it from the factory ""Sporter"" with (ugly) plastic furniture to the military configuration with wood furniture. I rebuilt the rear of the receiver which is cut at an angle from the factory for the plastic thumbhole stock. This required a new rear trunnion from an M70 type AK, and welding in a new piece to the sheet metal receiver to restore the angled cut to square. This forms the correct socket for the wood stock.I used a new US made walnut stock set, not a surplus stock set.  Also included: Tapco G2 trigger, upgraded hammer and trigger pin plate (improvement over the stock wire type), Limbsaver butt pad, CNC Warrior flash hider/muzzle brake, Vickers sling, RS AK-307 modular side mount and scope rails.  I'm not including a scope with it but it does have the mounts and I can add a set of Burris tactical 30mm rings. All together I have about $1500 in this rifle (NOT including a scope). I am including the original 10 round magazine, and two CO legal 15 round (pinned 20 round) magazines made for the Zastava M77 from CSSpecs. Firm on the price considering the extensive upgrades and it's never been fired. 922r compliant with all the US-made components.Buyer pays background check at FFL of your choice.

With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well. CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced."

Everything except the serial number was buffed off the rear of the receiver. On a good day you can still see Winchester very faintly above the serial number. The wood is mint with arsenal stamps. It has a new gas cylinder on it. Email me for pictures. The rifle could be re parkerized but it will still not be collectable because of the heavy buffing on the rear receiver above the SN. It's in excellent mechanical shape. I'm moving and need to get rid of my excess stuff. I've had this rifle all my life. My father gave it to me in the 1950's. Will have to go through dealer for transfer. Buyer pays the $35 transfer fee.  NE Fresno

They started manifacturing these in 1912 and ceased production in 1964. But don't let the age fool you. This gun was made during the prime of the united states glory days and they truely don't make them like this anymore. By far the most dependable shotgun i have ever owned, it has never once jamed, misfired or given a single problem whats so ever.Features:Still has 90% of its blueingBreak down model (my favorite feature, cause easy to twist apart and throw back in your hunting bag)shoots 2 3/4 shellsHolds 6 +1 shells26 inch barrel with bead sightBeautiful oak pump action and walnut stockJeweled bolt (which is amazing its still there given its age)The firing pin is super strong and still strikes hard, again surprisingly well for its age.INcluded:Really nice LL bean camo caseAbout 25 or so target shells."

The plans were sent from the FN factory to Britain when it became clear the Belgian plant would fall into German hands, enabling the Inglis factory to be tooled up for Hi-Power production for Allied use. Inglis produced two versions of the Hi-Power, one with an adjustable rear sight and detachable shoulder stock (primarily for a Nationalist Chinese contract) and one with a fixed rear sight. Production began in late 1944 and they were on issue by the March 1945 Operation Varsity airborne crossing of the Rhine into Germany. The pistol was popular with the British airborne forces as well as covert operations and commando groups such as the Special Operations Executive (SOE), the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the British Special Air Services (SAS) Regiment. Inglis High-Powers made for Commonwealth forces have the British designation 'Mk 1', or 'Mk 1*' and the manufacturer's details on the left of the slide. They were known in British and Commonwealth service as the 'Pistol No 2 Mk 1', or 'Pistol No 2 Mk 1*' where applicable. Serial numbers were 6 characters, the second being the letter 'T', e.g. 1T2345. Serial numbers on pistols for the Chinese contract instead used the letters 'CH', but otherwise followed the same format. When the Chinese contract was cancelled, all undelivered Chinese-style pistols were accepted by the Canadian military with designations of 'Pistol No 1 Mk 1' and 'Pistol No 1 Mk 1*'."
