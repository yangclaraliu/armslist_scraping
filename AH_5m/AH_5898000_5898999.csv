Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. CALL JOHN @ REDACTED"

It has a 2008 90 hp mercury 2 stroke engine with a brand new 3 blade stainless prop. It has a minn kota 70 lb thrust wireless trolling motor. It is the saltwater trolling motor but it (nor the boat) have ever seen saltwater. I have the key fob remote and a wireless foot pedal remote for the trolling motor.  The boat is on a galvanized trailer with brand new tires and a brand new spare. It will also come with a cut proof trailer lock.  The boat is completely factory camo. The interior is factory rhino lined and camo. It has storage underneath the front deck and underneath the seats.  It has a rod/gun box and a livewell. I have a pedestal seat for both the front and the back of the boat. The boat has power trim, hydraulic steering, and a hummingbird 587ci color depth finder with built in gps. It also has custom made brackets to hold lights for bowfishing.  The motor does not have an hour meter but I would be willing to bet it has less 70 or 80 hours on it. I used to do quite a bit of bowfishing, duck hunting, and cat fishing but that usually entailed a 5 to 10 minute boat ride and the rest would be using the trolling motor. I'll also throw in 4 adult camo life vest. The boat does need some tlc though. The bench seat needs recovering. It has set out in the sun and it has dry rotted the fabric. Also, one of the pedestal seats is this way too. The other seat is fine.  The boat probably needs new batteries as it has set for nearly a year now. One taillight on the trailer, and the transducer for the depth finder are broken (my kids are big enough to mow now, they're great on grass, just not anything in their way). I plugged the info onto NADA price guide and the low retail price is 10,755.  The description of when to value the boat as low includes if it needs mechanical work and shows excessive wear and tear.  My boat does NOT need any mechanical work but I realize it does need some cosmetic attention. I have priced it accordingly and am willing to accept offers. More pictures upon request."

I'm selling this one for $700.00  Call or text Five O One 3 O Four 3 Two 8 Two  From http://trimports.com/store/fieldmaster-deluxeOur proprietary line of double guns come from a region in Turkey, Huglu-Beysehir-Konya with a history of fine gunmaking going back more than a century. Our artisans are typically third or fourth generation, among the country's most experienced. Silver Eagle double guns combine the best aspects of modern, precision machining and traditional hand fitting and engraving. Receivers and barrels are machined from solid carbon steel using state-of-the-art Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machines, and all bores are plated with hard white chrome. Each gun is carefully fitted and assembled by hand, with rigorous quality control at every stage of production. The stocks are of old-growth Turkish (Circassian) Walnut, are dried naturally by air, not in a kiln, and completed with a durable and attractive hand-rubbed oil finish. All engraving is hand-chiseled, meaning that actually, no two guns are exactly alike. 28"" Barrel3"" ChamberAuto EjectorsIC and LM chokes"

The bore is decent with some shallow black powder pitting, but it was looked after. There's some blue turning to patina and most of the edges are sharp. The gutta percha grips are not numbered to the gun, but are of the proper vintage. This gun is an antique, so no FFL is necessary. This iron comes with a rather exceptional holster sold by B. H. Dyas Co., Los Angeles, California, and made by the Audley Safety Holster Company. To quote from Vintage Gun Leather's article ""....The most famous of these inventions was the Audley Safety Holster which F. H. Audley applied for patents in 1912 and they were approved October 13, 1914. The holster incorporates a spring loaded steel catch in the body of the holster which securely holds the pistol in place. It can only be released by using the index finger to depress the catch. It is virtually impossible for anyone other than the person wearing the holster to do this. No other retaining strap is required....."" It is in good condition and everything works!"

She has imporoved in accuracy, but more advanced in age. So now needs a handgun that is lighter in weight and in recoil for home defense.
The pistol has less than 50 rounds through it and is in like new condition. I have the box it came in as well as all the other stuff.  I am willing to throw in nearly a full box of .410 defense ammo as well as about 30 rounds of 45 Colt in at no charge. Also included is an Uncle Mikes style nylon holder with retention strap NOT very suitable for carry, but great for storage to cover the trigger.
Images of the gun are included so what you see is what you get.
My last post inadvertantly omitted the following: You MUST posess a CCW permit to buy directly from me.  If you do not have a Georgia CCW you must be willing to meet me at the Sandy Springs Gun Club for an FFL transfer. You will bear the cost of the transfer. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CCW AND AREN'T WILLING TO MEET ME AT THE GUN CLUB save us both the time and effort of sending a reply. I am not about providing guns to those who the state has determined inelligible to own one.
I accept ONLY cash for the purchase (read no checks, no credit cards, no herds of goats). If you want to trade I will consider only a Glock 42 or 43 in good condition. If there needs to be cash added to the mix we can talk about that.
The price is firm and here is why. New stainless models are around the $500 mark. New polymer models are around $400. This is a like new stainless model, but it's $100 less than new and there's no sales tax."

The Rhino is an innovative tactical revolver with the barrel firing from the bottom cylinder which all but eliminates muzzle flip. The cylinder is slab sided for a narrow more carry friendly profile. I have owned this gun for almost 4 years and it has been a safe queen. It is flawless with a spotless bore and tight lock up. It has an excellent trigger in both single action and double action. Nice crisp single action break and no stacking or slop in double action. It's a dream to shoot since the force of the recoil comes straight back so your arm bears the force and not your wrist. It comes with factory box, manuals, tools and accessories, as well as a green rail mount laser shown attached in a few of the pictures (the speed loader is not included since I will use it on my new $1,200.00 gold Rhino, but I will include 2 speed strips). Also included is a OWB holster that can be used either left or right handed.I am giving this away since I do not need 2 Rhinos. Sale for 850.00 OBO. Lowballers will be ignored."
