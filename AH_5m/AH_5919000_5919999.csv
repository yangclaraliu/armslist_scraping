The slot is just about two inches long and maybe 3/16 inches deep if you remove the cover and included optics mounting plates. The gun comes with a “cover” plate installed which basically fills this gap completely, so at a glance, the Glock 19 MOS looks like a regular Glock 19 Gen 4 model, except for the visible seams. Glock 19 Modular Optic System Pistol MOS To mount an optic directly to the slide, you simply remove the cover plate and replace it with one of four included adapter plates. These plates are clearly numbered one to four and are cut with posts and holes specific to a variety of optics mounting systems. Compatible optics (at this time) include:  Plate 1: Docter, Meopta, Insight Plate 2: Trijicon Plate 3: C-More Plate 4: Leupold  For my test of the Glock 19 MOS I used a Trijicon RMR RM01 and mounted it to the G19 MOS using plate number two. Installation took less than a couple of minutes and Glock includes an Allen wrench and extra screws used to remove the cover plate and install the correct adapter plate. Once the right adapter plate in installed, just mount the Trijicon RMR (or optic of your choice) to the plate and you’re off to the races.

It is my very favorite gun...but due to the crap circumstances of life and the fact that Brown County wants to screw me without the courtesy of a reach around, they are now garnishing my wages to 50%... which means I'm taking home like 450$ every two weeks to live on and pay bills and what not...not to mention taking care of my kid (which I have been primarily doing since he was born but the state of Minnesota doesn't give a damn on account of his mother not working much.)    So, I am now selling all of my toys. I don't want to but I'm going to do it anyway because my son is worth it. M+M M10 AKM based on Romanian parts and built by a company in Colorado. I have had probably around 500 rounds through it and she never skipped a beat. It's got a quad rail, adjustable rear and front sights, angled fore grip, intafuse folding stock (NATO length), hogue grip (it's a thing of beauty holding this grip) and tapco trigger (bump fires like an animal)  This will come with many magazines including 2 Norinco 40 rounders, 3 tapco/magpul poly mags, and a Korean steel thirty rounder. I also have the old tapco stock and sight alignment tool. Installed a recoil buffer also. It comes with the carrying soft case and a dry box of mixed ammo (Tula, Wolf, ect...don't remember how many rounds but probably like another five hundred or so)   This firearm has been meticulously maintained...even though it's an AK and you don't really need to lol... (I've seen these things buried in the dirt for 10 years and then taken out and used again...tank tracks being used to bend the barrel straight after some kind of bend...and torture tested on YouTube (seriously check that out).   Bottom line is, if you want to have a firearm that's reliable and cheap to shoot....and will probably last till Jesus comes back...this is what you need. Your very own SHTF end of the world, Mad Max, Walking Dead, ""Just in case Hillary Clinton wins the election"" Rifle. Forged in the fires of might from the Soviets and all yours should you decide that you need one (you probably do)I NEED THE MONEY OFF THIS SALE TO PROVIDE FOR MY SON...I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE THE PRICE.

A beloved AKM in NATO 5.56. It is my second favorite gun...but due to the crap circumstances of life and the fact that Brown County wants to screw me without the courtesy of a reach around, they are now garnishing my wages to 50%... which means I'm taking home like 450$ every two weeks to live on and pay bills and what not...not to mention taking care of my kid (which I have been primarily doing since he was born but the state of Minnesota doesn't give a damn on account of his mother not working much.)    So, I am now selling all of my toys. I don't want to but I'm going to do it anyway because my son is worth it. This is a Zastava N-Pap pistol AK74 chambered in 5.56/.223. it has the Sig Arm Brace (don't shoulder this rifle in front of an ATF officer...you will go to prison...everywhere else though ;-) RAK trigger I installed myself (the original Yugoslavian trigger felt like sandpaper so that had to go and the new RAK triggers are highly recommended on the new centurion C39's) it's got the Krinkov style muzzle (for added cycle efficiency...and it looks cool...but wear ear protection) flip up night sights, and I did all the woodwork myself. (Stained redwood and glossed), and as per one of its best features, it shares the AR15 style magazine adapter so if you have an AR, your ammo and mags are compatible.  This will come with many magazines including tapco/magpul poly mags (and one 40 rounder), and a blackout steel thirty rounder, an aftermarket aluminum, and some surplus US mags. Installed a recoil buffer also. I also liked the hogue grip on my other AK so much that I put one on this Zastava. It comes with the carrying soft case and a dry box of mixed ammo (Tula, Wolf, ect...don't remember how many rounds but probably like another 200?) And it will come with the old trigger and grip.   This firearm has been meticulously maintained...even though it's an AK and you don't really need to lol... (I've seen these things buried in the dirt for 10 years and then taken out and used again...tank tracks being used to bend the barrel straight after some kind of bend...and torture tested on YouTube (seriously check that out).   Bottom line is, if you want to have a firearm that's reliable and cheap to shoot....and will probably last till Jesus comes back...this is what you need. Your very own SHTF end of the world, Mad Max, Walking Dead, ""Just in case Hillary Clinton wins the election"" Rifle. Forged in the fires of might from the Soviets and all yours should you decide that you need one (you probably do)......and as an added bonus...if the crap really does hit the fan, you'll be safe in the knowledge that you will find ammo and magazines for this because it's the same stuff the feds and half the firearm enthusiasts in the country use.I NEED THE MONEY OFF THIS SALE TO PROVIDE FOR MY SON...I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE THE PRICE. I am a charity case...if you buy this, it's going to help me and my son. AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT;-)"

I'm seeking both affiliates and players for a brand new fantasy sports app that is releasing in October. This is unlike Fanduel, Draft Kings, or the ESPN fantasy app. This is free, not gambling. This is highly interactive, not ""pick your players and watch tv"" boring.To become a player: follow the link I will provide you via email, download the app when it releases, play against friends and family for FREE. When I say it's interactive, I mean it gives you competitions to play DURING a live sporting event (football, basketball, baseball, nascar, golf, soccer, etc!). Questions such as ""do you think the offense will rush for 20+ yards this drive?"" are worth a certain number of points. Rack up points and win jerseys, gift cards, and even paid travel to attend games courtesy of the creators of the app!To become an affiliate: message me for the link allowing you to register BEFORE OCTOBER 10TH! That is the cutoff date for AFFILIATE registration. After the 10th, the only option will be signing up as a player. I'm sure you're wondering how you get paid if the app is free right? When you play the game, you earn coins. If you run out of coins, you have the ability to watch ads to earn more. The companies advertising in the app pay a commission to affiliates when their players watch their videos. In 6 months, do you want to feel the same way that a lot of people felt after watching Candy Crush takeoff and they chose not to jump on board? What about Clash of Clans? Pokémon Go? Fantasy sports is one of the biggest and most commonly played game in the US. Not to mention, this app is offering sports AROUND THE WORLD. When they cutoff the ability to become an affiliate, anyone who downloads the app and signs up on their own without going through another affiliate will be randomly placed under a computer-selected affiliate. You will have people signed up under you that you have never met in your life. If enough people are interested in this, I wouldn't be opposed to increasing the gift card amounts to $100 and $50. How about that right as deer season is upon us? If you win a gift card and would rather have a different type (Visa gift card, Academy Sports, etc.), I will gladly make it happen. Don't let this opportunity pass you by!"

If you're reading this, you likely already know how sweet these rifles are, and what amazing stuff CZ puts out, in general. I'm the original owner, it's in pristine condition, and it's only been to the range 2,maybe 3 times, with a total round count of well under a hundred rounds. It's basically still brand new. This thing is scary accurate, with numerous ammos, from 40 to 62 gr. A big plus with the CZ .223's is that they are one of the few rifles around that are OK'd by the factory to shoot mil-spec 5.56 ammo, which opens your options a bit. These rifles also have a ""set trigger"", but I've found it to be extremely sensitive, and I never had any complaints with the normal trigger. But for a single shot fired with the irons when I first got it (a buddy of mine hit a squirrel at 65 yards, that I couldn't even see!), it's always had this scope on it, a Bushnell Elite 4200 3-9x40. In case you're not familiar with them, Bushnell's Elite series came about when Bushnell bought out the highly respected Bausch & Lomb company, and continued manufacture under their Elite name. These are not your Wal-mart blister-pack Bushnells, they are basically their premium line, kinda like Lexus is to Toyota. The Bushnell Elites are all very nice scopes, made in Japan, w/ fully multi-coated lenses, lifetime warranty, magnum-recoil rated, yadda,yadda. The scope rings are steel CZ's  (very high quality rings that didn't originally come with the rifle, I bought them seperately). As you can see, i still have the original box and paperwork, for both rifle and scope. Also included is a load of various .223 ammos: 50-rd box of Fiocchi Extrema polymer-tipped V-max, a couple boxes of 62-gr Silver bear, a box of Federal American Eagle, a box of Remingtons, and a bag of loose Fiocchi Extrema V-max. That's all the relevant info that comes to mind,feel free to ask any further questions. I might consider some trades +cash, but I mostly need the cash, and my interests at the moment are pretty limited (early gen3 G17 or 19, Ruger SP101 2""). Thanks for looking.........almost forgot, please respond with enough detail that I can tell you're a legitimate local buyer and not another scammer, or I just won't respond. Buyer/trader must be Georgia resident, over age 18, with ID. As always, I'll happilly show my Ga DL and carry permit."

Blackout ammo prices keep falling (found some for about 40 cents/round the other day) and the 300 blackout seems to be taking over the short-barreled and/or suppressed AR market. The 7.5 inch length is great when you really need to be high-speed/low-drag/compact, and 300 blackout is the caliber to do it in because of the minimal barrel length that is needed to achieve a great terminal ballistic effect. In about 15-20 min with an armorers wrench you can swap the barrel and be shooting 5.56/.223. The magazines, the bolt, everything else is the same. This gun shoots very nice and is easy to become proficient at, especially with the single point sling. Selling for financial reasons. This AR only has about 60 rounds through it. It's not even fully broken in yet. This is priced to sell. I don't expect it to last long.

I assembled every part mysef correctly. I choose every part to make shooting this AR like shooting a air soft gun and it does. The recoil impulse is the lowest I have ever felt. She has about 600 rounds of all diffrent ammuntions threw her and not one malfuction. Even tried the dirty under pressured tula and wolf to see if she will cycle and no problems. The weight naked is 6.15 pounds, I kno doesent look like it but it is, shocks every one who holds it. The best part is the weight is centered and the balance is perfect. The scope shown is a Alpen Apex illuminated 1-6x with a light weight Aero Precsion mount. What makes this rifle shine is the Stretch 16 Barrel. It is 16"" fluted, stainless steel, melonite, hand-lapped barrel, with a intermidiate length gas system. Intermidiate length is longer then a mid-length but a inch and half shorter then a rifle length system, which aids in making this rifle so soft shotting. It is a a .223 wylde chamber, which will shoot your 5.56 and .223 more accuratley. Has a 1-8 twist. This barrel is guranteed to shoot sub-moa and it does. Youtube stretch 16 and you will see a few videos. One guy is hooting half moa in the rain. Now for parts list front to back.-Battlecomp 2.1 muzzle device-Strectch 16 barrel-SLR melonite adjustable gas block-Strongside black nitride gas tube-Vella Industries 16.5"" trident rail system-Vltor MUR 1s forged upper recevier (no forward assist)-RCA light weight black nitride bolt carrier -Sharps Reliabolt bolt- V Seven light weight ejection port door and rod-BCM Vltor Mod2 charging handle-Joe Bob outfitters billet spartan lower reciver-V seven light weight, mag catch, takedown down pins, castle nut and end plate.-Velocity 3lb drop in trigger-KNS anti-rotation trigger pins and retainers-Battle arms development 45 degree ambi saftey- Ares armory ERGO grip with a titanium grip screw-JoeBobs Mil-spec buffer tube-JP silent capture spring -Mission first tactical butt stockIf you were to take the time and price every part out, it would come to about $2000 and if you were to buy a similiar setup from a manufacture if would be around $3000. Also the paint job is just rustoleum. I had plans to cerakote identically to what it is now but wanted to see how the colors looked because to cerakote I would have had to sand blast any way. As it turns out I really like the rattle can, cause it wares off nice in contact points and looks distressed plus its easy to remove and do a diffrent pattern. The only reason im selling is because I just bought a new house and have tons of expenses I didnt plan on. The scope is amazing! It is selling for $685 on optics planet and for $628 on Amazon and has great reviews. IT is a perfect AR scope that no one really knows about. The absoulte best part is it has a ""No fault, no questions"" warranty so you can blow it up intentionally and send the pieces back to Alpen and they will send you a new one.  I will sell the rifle, scope and scope mount and 1 mag for $2200 or just the rifle for $1800. I also have ammo we can add on as well. TRADES WILL BE CONSIDERED text or call REDACTED"
