Sights are buckhorn rear and standard blade on the front. The stock shows minimal wear with only small nicks and dings that one might expect on a gun this old - but no major dents and the metal to wood fit is very tight. There is a slight crack where the stock meets the butt plate but it took me years before I even noticed this. This is an ANTIQUE, NO FFL is require.This is the High Wall model –where you cannot see the hammer with the falling block down. The gun would become known as the Model 1885 although the model name had not appeared on the gun when production ceased in 1920. In 2005 Winchester reintroduced this gun and I think the model name does appear on these guns. This gun used case hardening steel and Winchester would not start bluing these guns until 1906, used (128 year old) Winchester Model 1885 High Wall 38WFC with a 28 inch octagon barrel - number 1 barrel weight stamped just in front of forearm. This gun was invented by John Moses Browning when he was just 23 years old and he was awarded a patient on Oct 7, 1879 (see picture 7) as the patent data.. The 38WCF is sort of misleading as this was the old 38-40 cartridge and even this is misleading as you would think it is a 38 caliber but it is a 40 caliber and the 38 is the amount of black powder. Ammo is easy to find as this is a common and popular “Cowboy” shooting cartridge. Shipping and insurance will be buyer’s responsibility and will be notified of exact amount before making payment.

Unfortunately I'm moving to a nazi state that doesn't appreciate all that the second amendment has to offer. My price is firm on 1100$ but I will negotiate if the buyer can make the purchase today (Sunday). I spent over 1400 on this bad boy and put about 200 rounds through it. No scratches, dents, fades, nothing. If you can find a defect I'll knock 50 bucks off. Like I said, I'm firm on the price unless you can buy it today. This is the best AR-15 you can buy for 1100 bucks. This piece of American quality will put a fat smile on your face every time you squeeze that trigger and will surely piss off any Hillary supporters within hearing distance.

Only been used at the gun range less than a half dozen times and cleaned after every use. Comes with pistol grip, action lock, owner's manual, dummy practice shells, and whatever live rounds I have left. Here's some info from Bass Pro where I bought the gun from:The Mossberg 590 Mariner Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a corrosion-resistant Marinecote finish, inside and out, to withstand the punishment of harsh saltwater envorinments. This is an ideal self-deffense shotgun to have in a boat or yacht; as well as carrying in a vehicles that frequents humid coastal areas. the 590 Mariner also makes a practical, low-maintenance home devense shotgun and is one of the best firearms to carry while fishing or camping in bear country. With the included pistol grip kit installed, the 590 Mariner is an extremely compact, fast-handling shotgun that stows in minimum space and deploys in an instant. The U.S. Military's choice of Model 590 pump shotgun for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 590 utilizes dual action bars to prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action, and a single, large lociing lug locks that bolt into the barrel extension, ensuring a solid steel bolt-to-barrel connection. Dual extractors take a solid grip on the shell's rim for reliable extraction, and an anti-jam shell elevator ensures reliable feeding. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safey quickly with the thumb of either hand making it naturally ambidextrous. The Model 590's simplistic design makes fieldstripping easy by tapping out a single pin, and the magazine cap-nut removes for cleaning the spring, shell follower, and any debris in the mag tube. The 590 Mariner Tactial Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a synthetic buttstock and forearm, a durable recoil pad, and sling swivel studs. The Model 590 cycles 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells interchageably."

It utilizes the more user friendly side bolt release which makes it compatable with Accuracy International and other stocks. It has a 24"", fluted, 5r rifled barrel threaded to the 30 caliber standard 5/8x24. The rifle came equipped from the factory with a 20 MOA sight base and Savage's famous accutrigger. The stock is truly unique, the rifle came with a digital desert camo accustock with beaver tail for end and dual front sling studs (one for bipod and one for sling). This particular rifle is in 95% condition. The only marks are mounting marks that are barely noticeable from a bipod on the front swivel stud and mounting marks on the rail from scope rings."

Commonly referred to as a Gen3 or Gen 2.1 by Walther owners as it differs from the 2nd Generation P99's by having the longer mag release and longer, ambidextrous slide release while maintaining the same frame design. Mag changes are very quick and smooth with the paddle mag release on the trigger guard.This German made pistol features a Double Action and Single Action trigger, very smooth and crisp from the factory with a very short reset, and a decocker button on top of the slide. For a .40S&W, recoil is fairly tame. This pistol will come with all paperwork from the factory, two 12 round factory mags made by Mec-Gar, three backstraps of varied sizes, a nice compact Streamlight TLR-3 light mounted on the rail and 25 rounds of 180gr hollow points so it can be carried with 12+1 plus the other 12 round mag. Only 300 rounds through it."

I'll also include (3) 30-Round PMAGs. Also includes the stock flip-up sights and the Ruger carry case that came with the rifle. Rifle is in excellent condition with only 60 rounds total fired (2 magazines worth). My trade value is $1,150. I don't have much cash to add, but you can add cash if your trade is a lower value. I'm not really interested in selling, but if that's what you really want, the price is the same as trade value - $1,150As for the Garands, I'm looking for a 'stock' Garand in the sense that it's not been modified, cut down (no Tankers, etc.) or otherwise changed. CMP Garands are fine, but I'd prefer something Service Grade or better. .30-06 only, not looking for .308 models. If you have something to consider in trade, please be prepared to send good photos so I can look them over - also tell me what you're looking for in trade value. Use the Contact Seller button to reach me - we can continue the discussion via email from there. I'm travelling for business at the moment, so I can't meet until I get back, but I'm available to chat via email.Meeting will be at a local FFL - we will each cover the transfer/BGC fees. I prefer Tigard Pawn 4 More - total transfer and BGC is $25 each.Photos are not of my exact rifle as I don't have time to photograph it at the moment - I'll get to that when I return home from a business trip. For now, these photos look exactly like mine, save for the Magpul MOE stock I have on mine."

It has nice engraving on the receiver and says Pittsburgh Fire Arms Co. on the side and also on the top of the barrel rib"

I was able to create an excellent product full of high quality items at a low price by obtaining all items individually from wholesale distributors. Similar kits sell online for up to $500. This kit has everything you need to deal with daily minor injuries, bug bites, burns, scratches, and such. It also has the goods to deal with traumatic combat related injuries, and everything inbetween. The kits can be customized to order on request with added or removed items.The new Kiloton Field Trauma Kit includes only those items you need to assist in life saving first aid for traumatic injuries in the field. It's designed to be distributed in pockets or held in it's small size Blackhawk medical pouch.The new Kiloton Large Medical Roll has everything the combat kit has, and a whole lot more! Enough to deal with a multiple casualty situation. It comes in the new Blackhawk medical roll bag and organized into a series of clear easy to access containers. Please see the detailed lists of everything in the first aid kits. The Field Trauma kit is $65 without the pouch and $85 with the Blackhawk small medical pouch.The Combat Survival First Aid Kit is $140 and includes the 5.11 medical pouch.The Large First Aid Kit Roll Bag is $240 and includes the Blackhawk Large Medical Roll bag.

The only rounds down this barrel are the 40 rounds their gunsmith put through it for testing and evaluation. I have the old internals that were replaced as well which I will include. The cost of this alone was $252.Receipt as proof of service is included (see photos). Frame/slide do show some holster wear (see photos), but the gun is overall in great shape, and in perfect shape internally.Will include 6 boxes of ammo from Freedom Munitions.

It is mixed steel cased ammo, but mostly 122gr and 124gr tula hollow points. I need $200 cash OR a good working 5.56 bolt carried group AND 2 black magpul ctr stocks. If bought or traded today i will throw in these 2 metal ammo cans. I'm not looking to travel far, and will not ship. Buying online you would be paying a little more then $200, plus shipping, without the ammo cans, and for 1,000 rounds instead of the 95 extra you get from me. So please don't low ball me. This is a fair deal. Any questions, reply to this post. Thanks for looking!"
