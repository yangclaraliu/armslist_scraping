Automag 3 30 carbine in excellent shape, comes with everything that came from the factory. 1 mag and maybe 60-70 rds of ammo2.  Backup in 38 super.  Heavy trigger pull, no sights but that's why it's called a backup. Built like a tank.  These are impossible to find, not a single 38 super backup on gunbroker or anywhere else for that matter.  Comes with Plano hard case, mag and around 50 rds of ammo. Can send more pics upon request.  Would rather sell as a pair. These are not cheap guns and I know what they are worth so no lowballs, the 30 carbine sells online all day for over 1300(although there's only 3 on gunbroker in this caliber)  with the box and paperwork and there's not many I've looked. And the last backup I saw online in 38 super went for over 600 but good luck finding one.  Asking 1800 for both. Text me at 423530five725 anytime, can meet as far as Bulls gap or even better of you're in this area, I work rotating swing shifts.  In state sale or trade only and I will not ship, can meet as far as Greenville"

Cash only.  $975 is FIRM.   I am in zero rush to sell and if it doesn't go it doesn't go. I'll either keep it or wait while the gun stays in my humidity controlled safe.  Also, there are Nigerian scammers on Armslist!  How about that?  Being pretty quick on the draw I've sniffed them out quickly.  Thus, my other condition before selling is if you are not plannng to transact in person because you say you want me to ship FFL is to have a phone conversation upfront. We can exchange phone numbers.Beretta pistols really are different and beautiful, which a major reason I got one.  I went ahead and bought a new Beretta 92FS and sent it directly to Wilson Combat for the following upgrades: Basic carry package ($340), G type conversion ($150 no safety, decocker only), oversize mag release ($45), Wilson Combat Checkered Grips with WC logo in Black Cherry ($70).  I have a copy of the work order/invoice that I'll hand over to the buyer.   Wilson recommended I buy a specific original FS model pistol (with rail) in order for them to do the above work. Also included are two 15 round and one 13 round mags - and, a High Noon inside out leather IWB holster.  All in all, I have about $1450 into it.  I took it to the range twice, have no more than 150 rounds through it.  It is in perfect condition.  Just have too dang many handguns and want to cull the herd.  Since this one has the fewest rounds, I figured I could recoup a bit more of my cost.  Again, $975 is the deal.  I could ship FFL to FFL at reasonable cost."

This gun will turn heads at the gun range. The following parts make up this build for the most efficient short and long distance AR at the least weight.
DANIEL DEFENSE:-18"" S2W Cold Hammer Forged barrel (for longer range and longer life with less weight, rare- no longer manufactured)-chrome bolt carrier group (for longer life and smoother function)-upper receiver-lower parts kit-flash hider-gas tube
BRAVO COMPANY:-Gunfighter Mod3 handle-Gunfighter Mod3 charging handle
AERO PRECISION:-lower receiver
MISC:-MFT minimalist buttstock (lighter and less obstructive)-Fab Defense magazine grip (for close quarter battle)-Veriforce Tactical free float handguard-Troy low profile gas block-45° flip up sights-Magpul aluminum trigger guard -C.C.T. anti-walk hammer/trigger pin-ambidextrous sling mount-single point heavy duty bungee strap-2 Gen3 Magpul magazines-Uncle Mike's AR15 gun case
Feel free to contact me with questions and for more pictures. I have about $1500 in this build not counting the ammo (you can verify if by looking up the parts). I'm asking $1200. That's a savings of $400 for an amazing weapon! I can meet most places. Call, text or email Frank at REDACTED"

As you can see in the picture it's all good ammo. I have 2 50rd boxes of Speer gold dot 230 grain jhp which is hard to get in 50rd boxes and gold dot is one of the best defense rounds on the market, it's all I use. Also 1 50rd box of Speer lawman 230 grain fmj. The lawman series of ammo is loaded in similar bullet grain weights to its gold dot line and uses the exact same powder and powder charge so you can simulate firing your carry load but won't cost you an arm and a leg doing so either. And last but certainly not least there is 46 rounds of blazer brass 230 grain fmj. Good range ammo. I just don't have a 45 anymore and would rather have ammo for the guns I have or at least trade for some cash so I can buy ammo I need. All laws will be followed no exceptions and I will not ship, it's face to face only. If I had to trade for cash I would require 90 bucks. That's a steal considering blazer brass is 20 a box easy, lawman (if you can find it) is 25 bucks a box, and the gold dot in 50rd boxes (if you can find it) is usually around 40 or more a box. If it's ammo trade then I would require it to be equivalent to what my value is in ammo straight up. Thanks for your time!"

Have fed all kinds of ammo through, has never jammed. Clean it every time after taking it to the range. A little heavy for it's size and definitely packs a kick. Built for close range attackers not competition's. No price negotiations, this is my baby. Also I have a box of zombie ammo, a concealed carry holster, and a cleaning rope to go with it. Let it be known I have recently been made aware that this firearm is one of several models in a pending recall, and is now eligible for exchange or refund from the company. I've gone ahead and registered with Taurus and expect to hear back from them soon. Even though this model is in this status, mine personally has never had any issues. Thank you for your interest."

This was a mid-end restoration project on a Model 99 that I'm no longer interested in. It also has a really nice custom ""Come and Take It"" custom leather sling that is made in Texas.This Savage '99 has alot of character and is priced to make room in the safe.This would be a great ranch rifle, truck rifle, project rifle or whatever you want to use it for. It is very huntable for deer and would also make a great hog rifle too.The bore is clean and the action is solid. The Redfield Scope has a small crack on the forward lens, but it doesnt fog up and it doesnt impede the accuracy of the rifle."

Inc."" of Dunellen, NJ (just so happens I'm in Dunnellon, FL now, no relation) -- this became the same company as the world-famous Iver Johnson company, which produced the absolutely-most-sought-after M1 Carbines (and M1911 pistols) on the market.  Before and after the merger and aquisition, and in the post WWII civilian market, Plainfield Machine Co. was a boutique M1 Carbine producer that used Plainfield-locally-made and machined receivers and barrels, with all other parts being USGI.  This rifle is highly sought after and in excellent condition -- but don't think it's only a showpiece, it's also an excellent ""ranch rifle"" or survival implement, or just truck gun to carry around in case you need it.The story with this particular rifle is as follows:  When my father became a police officer in the early 1970s, he was issued a service weapon but most of ""the guys"" would go to buy their own ""off-duty"" weapons and home-defense/""property guns"" for around the ranch/yard/etc.  At some point in his earliest career, ""the guys"" were all going to the downtown K-Mart (yes, K-Mart sold guns back then) because someone knew someone who knew someone who knew that K-Mart just got a shipment of a small-batch of hand-crafted, locally-made rifles that everyone had to have.  Before moving down here a few years back, he even had the box it came in, with a K-Mart price tag sticker still stuck on the box (which got destroyed or lost in moving).  So my father went with the guys, bought the rifle everyone else was buying, and figured if nothing else it was a good deal on a great gun.He believes he has fired it two times, once immediately after purchasing it, and once about 20 years later when I was a little kid and wanted to ""shoot the rifle"".  This was probably 20 years ago.  It was then cleaned up and sent into storage and stayed there until moving down here a few years back.  Since then it's been in my safe.I have absolutely no use for this firearm as my desires lie elsewhere and my calibers and platforms are different.  Also, while I appreciate the fact my father owned it, we have actual family heirloom firearms and I'll own my father's actual service weapons and personal guns some day, this is not one of them, it's simply a rifle he bought.  Therefore I'd like to sell it to someone who'll appreciate it and I'll just get something more to my desires or with more utility for my needs and current platforms/portfolio of firearms and calibers.Other than the fact it was made in the early 1970s and so is therefore ~40+- years old, it's great and in great condition.  My father is not even sure a full box of 20 rounds of ammo was fired down the pipe, if it was it certainly has an extremely low round count, probably the lowest you could ever find.  He is not a ""gun-guy"" and as a cop he carried pistols, so this wasn't something he shot for fun or sport or work etc.  You can take advantage.Doing my research, I've seen Iver Johnson models go for several thousands of dollars, mint-condition and unfired Plainfield Machine Dunellen models go for $1000+ , and this is an excellent condition Plainfield Machine Dunellen model - the best and fairest median price I can relate it to is from $750-$1000.  I am going to go on the low end in the hopes the buyer will be someone who keeps it in their family a long time as well.  Thanks, hope to hear from you.Note: I was forced to select ""Iver Johnson Arms"" as the manufacturer on Armslist due to the fact they do not have a listing for ""Plainfield Machine Co. Inc."" but it is in fact a Plainfield-marked rifle with the mark clearly showing Plainfield, Dunellen NJ .30 Carbine  Last Note: My camera on my phone takes terrible indoor pictures, so the pictures suck, but don't fault the rifle, it's the phone.First person to email me saying they have cash in hand to buy gets it"

I'm interested in either forged or billet receivers, but only in black. I prefer simple rollmarks, not things like crosses or monsters or dragons, etc. Anderson lowers with the horse are fine. Spikes lowers with the spider or badger are fine, but not the pirate with swords, for example. I want to build simple, clean-looking ARs so if the lowers are used, they can't have any deep scratches or dents that cannot easily be touched up. I would pay $100-130 for forged receivers depending on the make and condition. For billet receivers, of course I'm willing to pay more.In addition to lower receivers, I would be interested in Gen4 Glocks in 9mm and 380, and also 9mm Kahr compact pistols.IMPORTANT: I'm a law-abiding citizen and a Texas resident. I have both a driver's license and carry license. However, I do not want records kept on this purchase because it's none of the government's damned business. I will show you my identification if you wish to see it, but I will ask that you not record anything. This would be a private sale between two residents of Texas who are both legally able to buy and sell firearms. I do NOT want to buy from anyone who is not legally permitted to buy and sell firearms in the State of Texas."
