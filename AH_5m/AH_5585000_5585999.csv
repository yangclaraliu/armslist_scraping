212,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5585212,"For Sale:  Henry ""Big Boy"" .357 mag and Ruger GP100 .357 mag like-new condition!","Near Regis and Memorial H.S., Eau Claire, Wisconsin",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, June 16, 2016",Rifles,Henry Repeating Arms                                                                                ,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a Henry ""Big Boy"" rifle in .357 mag/.38 special. This is the most beautiful gun I have ever owned, and it shoots very well. This is by far one of the most ""naturally"" shooting guns I have ever used. It doesn't feel like aiming a gun, it is more like pointing a finger. Less than 100 rounds have been fired through it (probably closer to about 50 or so), and it is still in like-new condition. It is slightly on the heavy side, but this helps with the recoil, especially when shooting the .38's through it. When firing the .357 mags it is noticably more recoil, but by no means un-managable or painful to fire. Extremely fun to shoot at the range or for ""plinking"" (especially with the cheaper .38 ammo!) but could also be a ""varmint"" gun. I do not particularly want to sell these, but I am in need of money for car issues.  These are retail at 899.99, but I would let it go for $800, plus throw in some ammo, especially if interested in the package deal (see below). I also have a stainless steel Ruger GP 100 in .357/.38 (4"" barrel) available for sale, and new these are around $700, but this one has had slightly more than 100 rounds through it, but still in fantastic shape (I just have owned it longer than the Henry). It comes with the plastic carrying case, and I also have two speed loaders with a belt carrier (these are loaded with .357 hollow points (six in each for twelve total) free of charge. It came with a crappy solid black front sight, and so I put in a high-visibility bright green front sight for better targeting. It also has very nice Hogue grips that fit the hand very well. It would make a fantastic home defense gun, and that's what I used it for. I would be willing to take $550 for it.In case it isn't obvious, both the pistol and the rifle are able to fire the same ammunition, which is a great convenience whether you are going to the range or elsewhere. I do have aprox. 200-250 rounds of FMJ (majority is Winchester white box, some UPC) of .38 spcl and about 65 rds of hollow point .357 (WWB, not including the previously mentioned dozen rounds in the speed loaders which are free), but would be willing to work out a deal. If someone was looking to buy both together, I would include the ammo for free. Edit: I also found 25 rounds of high quality Hornady 357 mag defense and another 25 rounds of Hornady .38 spc + P also good for defense, but slightly lower power and recoil. In the interest of full disclosure, in the picture showing the ammo boxes, not all of the boxes are 100% full, but the amounts listed above are correct (it just looks sloppy and potentially dangerous to have loose rounds rolling around). DEAL: I would be willing to do $1350 for both firearms (Henry Big Boy .357 and the Ruger GP100 4 inch barrel), original plastic case and speedloaders for Ruger, original box for the Henry, and all the previously mentioned ammo. Value around $1550 but will let it go for $1350. NOT looking to trade or to sell the ammo separately from the firearms. I am looking to meet within the Eau Claire area only. I will not ship. Cash only. I am able to provide more pics if you would like. Email communication preferred, but can set up texting for serious offers. Low-ball offers will be ignored. Thanks for looking, and I hope to hear from you soon!"

The factory original blue finish is in good condition, showing minor holster wear on the high edges, barrel ends thinning a little as well, and with a small area of dulling on the right sideplate and some faint speckling on the cylinder. The Magna style grips are in excellent condition. Forcing cone and recoil shield are clean and the cylinders are sharp. Lockup is tight, the bore is well defined and all mechanical actions operate as designed.Included is a Hogue gunfighter-style finger-groove synthetic grip. Very comfortable for target shooting or hunting, and allows you to keep the factory wood grip safe and in pristine condition.This is a revolver that you will be proud to display and one that will earn you respect on the range or in the hunting camp. These sell for up to $1,000.00, but it's yours for only $850.00. This one will go fast, so don't wait."

From the factory:The UZI PRO pistol is a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety, Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block. Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round"

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety, Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block. Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round"

372,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5585372,For Sale/Trade:  Armasight thermal 640 60HZ,"FAYETTEVILLE, Fayetteville, North Carolina","$ 6,500","Listed On: Thursday, July 7, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This brand new are $7145 this is a brand new unit I have the invoice to prove it and for warranty purpose they have 10year warranty Armasight is excited to introduce its latest and most technologically advanced family of Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights to the Sporting, Law Enforcement and Military markets. The Zeus product line is based on the latest FLIR Tau 2 VOx microbolometer core and is composed of ten (10) different models – each optimizing performance, price and state of the art technology for a variety of uses and mission applications ranging from the seriously committed hunter to the military designated marksman. While primarily designed as a weapon scope, the Zeus functions equally well in its collateral assignments as a magnified spotting scope or handheld thermal imager.The Zeus is a solid state, uncooled, long-wave infrared, magnified dedicated weapon scope intended for day and night engagements without the need to remove the sight from the rifle. The 24/7 mission capability is only one of the strengths of Zeus. The thermal imaging technology also allows you to detect targets by cutting through snow, dust, smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants. Unlike the use of laser targeting or near-infrared illumination to augment night vision equipment, the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight is extremely difficult to detect with other devices as it emits no visible light or RF energy.In addition to being the smallest and lightest in their class, Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights are characterized by their simple and intuitive controls, functions and features that are layered among direct button adjustments, direct combination button functions, and electronic menu selections. This “layering” of easy-to-understand control functions provides the operator with a framework for customizing his preferences and exploiting the robust variety of setting options available in the Zeus. The Zeus has a series of selectable color modes based on a rich, upgradeable software package. A wireless remote switch is included to activate the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight when positioned in the “standby” mode. The Zeus has the ability to record imagery and is equipped with a video-out capability in operator selectable NTSC or PAL formats. The Zeus uses the same multi-pin connector to provide both video-in imagery, where there is a need for map or rangefinder display overlays, and external power access.Zeus weapon installation is easy, repeatable, and reliable based on a unique and highly user-friendly MIL-STD-1913/WEAVER/PICATINNY rail compatible quick-release locking mechanism. The solid state technology and software algorithms combined with a complimentary color reticle platform used in the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight ensure maximum reticle contrast, high level target accuracy, and boresight retention that cannot be achieved with mechanical boresight adjusters and traditional ballistic drums. This level of accuracy is translated into the electronic zoom (e-zoom) function of the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights which can be progressively increased from 1x to 2x and 4x without changing the point-of-aim to point-of-impact relationship of the targeting reticle.Armasight is convinced that the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight represents one of the most sophisticated sighting devices available to hunters, SWAT Teams, and the Military on the market today based on superior price-to-performance value.Special User-Adjustable Imaging ToolsActive Contrast Enhancement (ACE) – a digital “Contrast” correction that allows for a smart scene optimization based on dynamic adjustments where a variety of contrast levels occur depending on relative scene temperature.Second Generation Digital Detail Enhancement (DDE) – a “Sharpness” correction that is digitally enhances the picture to present clearer imagery, significantly improves edge sharpening and further reduces image noise.Smart Scene Optimization (SSO) – a fine-tuning computational correction that significantly improves an overall visual acuity for targets that have thermal signatures similar to a surrounding background.Automatic Gain Control (AGC) – a “Gain” correction that used to automatically adjust the gain to an appropriate range, the weaker the image signal, the stronger the gain.User-Controlled Manual Non-Uniformity Correction/Flat-Field Correction (UCMNUC/FFC). There is a mechanical shutter between the camera sensor and the lens. This shutter is used to perform a non-uniformity correction (NUC) also known as flat-field correction (FFC. During FFC, the shutter presents a uniform temperature source to each detector element in the array. While imaging the flat-field source, the camera updates the offset correction coefficients, resulting in a more uniform image after the process is complete. All Zeus models allow for user to manually trigger or interrupt scheduled UCMNUC/FFC function.Silent Shutterless NUC ™ (SSN) – In addition to user controlled manual NUC/FFC all Zeus models employ a digital supplemental non-mechanical flat-field correction that allows to extend the periods between mechanical shutter events and to further reduce image noise. SSN is always ON enhancement.FEATURESThe lightest and most compact scope in its classOptical Magnification 1.8x(PAL)/ 1.5x(NTSC)User selectable NTSC or PAL formatThe latest Tau 2 17-micron uncooled FLIR core technologyPixel Array Format: 640×512Display Type: AMOLED SVGA 800x600Easy and Intuitive Drop-down user interfaceFast 30Hz or 60Hz imagingDigital E-Zoom: 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8xColor Modes: White Hot/ Black Hot/ Rainbow/ Various Color Modes6 onboard digitally controlled reticle patterns available: “Dot 4 MOA,"" “Line Dot,"" “Cross-Center Dot,"" “Cross,"" “Crosshair,"" and “No Reticle”Reticle Colors: Black, White, Red, CyanElectronic zoom reticle tracking capability maintaining boresight"

Other info: Yes this P226 is worth the price!!! The gun itself retails for about $1,100 (turners price check 7/9/16), but remember this is a double action gun with a 24lb first pull and having about 2000 rounds through it the trigger pull has lightened up. If you go buy one new you will have a new heavy first trigger pull, by purchasing a used P226 it is broken in & smooth.  GUN COMES WITH OVER $700 OF EXTRAS!!!!
 
The gun eats anything you put in it. The night sights are brilliant, the light is blinding to threats & being full-size you are in complete control.  The gun has a deactivated round in chamber indicator, because it's stupid.

I also have a total of three magazines. Two are the smaller 5 rd capacity, and I bought a small extending lip for one of these for ease of handling. I also have a larger seven round mag which has a grip extender too, in case you have larger hands or want the extra 2 rds when you carry. I also will be including a ""Sticky"" soft holster that can be used for conceal carry. EDIT (found more ammo in range bag): I also have slightly under 400 rounds of FMJ from American Eagle (381, only one box of the four boxes has been opened), 100 rds of FMJ winchester white box. I also have 20 rounds of high quality Hornady Critical Defense 185 grain for home defense. Over 500 total rounds across all types.Ammo value alone would be over $275. Sticky brand holster is around $25 or $30. Gun new is around $600. Value around $900 or more, but I am just looking to get $750.NOT LOOKING TO TRADE or to sell the ammo separately from the firearms. I am looking to meet within the Eau Claire area only. I will not ship. Cash only. I am able to provide more pics if you would like.
