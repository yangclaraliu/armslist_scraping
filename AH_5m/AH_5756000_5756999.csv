The 92G Brigadier Tactical features the most sought after Beretta 92 features and all-steel Beretta and Wilson Combat custom parts right out of the box.  Some features of the limited production Wilson Combat/Beretta 92G Tactical include steel ambidextrous decocker-only levers (G model), enhanced Brigadier slide, a modified M9A1 style checkered frame with accessory rail and rounded trigger guard. This model also features enhanced accuracy with an ""Elite"" style match grade stainless barrel with recessed target crown, the action features a ""D"" hammer spring for lighter trigger pulls, and Trijicon dovetail tritium front sight and Wilson Combat rear sight. Wilson Combat G-10 grips, Wilson Combat steel guide rod and numerous other features to enhance performance. The 92G Tactical is finished in Beretta black Bruniton and marked with the Wilson Combat logo and specially serialized to ensure its place in Beretta history. Although the 92G Tactical has been optimized by Beretta to meet the needs of high round count tactical and competitive shooters, further customization and finish work is available through Wilson Combat. ""Being a serious Beretta collector, I have always considered the 92G SD the best model ever produced, but almost too expensive and rare to shoot. I feel fortunate to have been able to work with the fine people at Beretta USA to produce a pistol that, in my opinion, is an improved 92G SD. Having Beretta USA build my dream 92 series pistol is awesome and I’m very happy that a lot of people will be able to enjoy this fine pistol model."" -Bill Wilson ***Not available for purchase to MA residents.***  *Photos may include features and/or upgrades not included in the base price.

The VTAC II uses the excellent M&P15 tactical rifle as its base, with a mid-length gas system. The mid-length system (as opposed to a carbine-length) reduces recoil, resulting in a higher probability of 2nd and 3rd round hits, and it stays cleaner. The M&P15 VTAC II has a 4150 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel with 5R rifling (5 lands and grooves), and a 1-in-8-inch twist rate that works well with all bullet weights. S&W's Enhanced Flash Hider directs gases and sounds forward, away from the shooter's face, and reduces the flash signature significantly. The lightweight, free-floating, rigid VTAC/Troy 13"" Extreme TRX handguard has a full Picatinny rail along the top, and elongated venting slots that allow shooters to add 2-inch Picatinny rail sections (2 are supplied) for attaching other tactical accessories only where needed. Because there are no permanent rails on the sides or bottom, the handguard is quite comfortable and controllable for most sized hands. The VLTOR™ IMod 6-position, collapsible stock allows users to adjust length of pull according to stature, clothing layers, or shooting environments. The stock has an A2-style pistol grip, a storage compartment, and ambidextrous QD swivel connections. The VTAC II utilizes the single-stage, a non-adjustable trigger designed exclusively for Viking Tactics to provide optimum reliability in combat. The bolt carrier and gas key are chromed on the VTAC II, and the receiver has a full rail that mates with the handguard rail. The Smith & Wesson M&P15 VTAC II Viking Tactics Semi-Auto Rifle comes with a Kyle Lamb-designed, 2-point, padded sling, push-button QD swivels, and a 30-round PMAG magazine.
