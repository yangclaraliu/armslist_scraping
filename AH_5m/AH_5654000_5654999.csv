Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. The GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms but updates allow it to be used in multiple weapons like the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.  In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit."

After the war in Japan, police were limited to revolvers from terms of surrender, so Miroku made a clone of the very popular Colt Detective Special for introduction to police forces. They ultimately went with something else so Miroku was left with lots of pistols so they shipped them over here and sold them. Miroku today makes high quality firearms under license of Winchester and Browning.This specimen is in pretty good condition for it's age. There's a bit of wear in the finish but zero rust. It's a very early serial number from the first run of them originally made for Japanese police so that's a cool little tidbit, and it also means there's no ugly import mark.

(You can legally purchase 9MM at 18 y/o+ with this firearm. Most gun shops I've been to I've discussed if since the "".22 law"" applies to other pistol caliber weapons, if someone under 21 came in your shop, would you sell them ammo? The answer for all of them as been yes. If you are between 18-21, and you buy this gun, make sure to bring firearm unloaded, in box in your car with you. When you go to purchase the ammo, make sure they know it's for a RIFLE. If they question you, tell them you can show them the rifle. The alternative is just open carry it in, as OH allows open carry at 18. Just make sure it's unloaded during the car ride over unless you have your CHL.)"

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.            SPECIFICATIONS   Finish Black   Type Semi-Automatic   Action Single/Double   Caliber 40 S&W   Barrel Length 4.25""   Capacity 10 + 1   Safety Manual, Decocker   Grips Black   Sights Fixed   Weight 1.7 lbs"

Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum and .308 Winchester, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own. Mounted on this rifle from the factory with Barrett rings is a Leupold Mk 4 4.5-14x50 long range riflescope. The Leupold sports a 30mm main tube, mil dot reticle, and M1 turrets. Rifle will ship with two 10-rnd mags, 2 rail sections with flush cup mounts, and one plain railed section. All will ship in Pelican 1750 case."

Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum and .308 Winchester, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own. Mounted on this rifle from the factory with Barrett rings is a Leupold Mk 4 4.5-14x50 long range riflescope. The Leupold sports a 30mm main tube, mil dot reticle, and M1 turrets. Rifle will ship with two 10-rnd mags, 2 rail sections with flush cup mounts, and one plain railed section. All will ship in Pelican 1750 case."

If you haven’t seen these pistols do your research.. They are the new polymer pistol design of the future. These are new to the US market. Made and designed for the Russian Spetsnaz (Special Forces) 17+1 and the gun feels so good in your hands. Hardest hitting semiautomatic pistol in the world, Lowest recoil of any semiautomatic pistol ever engineered, Least amount of muzzle rise of any semiautomatic pistol ever created, Quickest target acquisition of any service pistol ever shot, Fastest shooting semiautomatic pistol the world has seen. You need one of these pistols.
What Makes The Strike One from Arsenal Firearms Special?
The Strike One semiautomatic pistol is the fastest, most controllable, most accurate, and hardest hitting service pistol in the world.
Unsurpassed Engineering:The frame of the Strike One is engineered with exacting and unprecedented standards. The operating frame block (made of the best 42CrMo4 steel) features 5″ full length rails for total axial and torque control of all moving parts, pins, and springs. The frame itself, with its unique and true 3D molded hand grip (not just “millings” on a flat surface) comes today as the only service pistol in the world with a full-fledged IPSC standard magazine insert (miniskirt). This allows Special Operation and SWAT teams to work as if they were using a competition pistol.
Unsurpassed Shooting Feel:The Strike One operates on a horizontal plane, without risers and without a long, rubbery trigger pull (known as trigger creep). It has a crisp and short firing pin release giving the feel of a competition type trigger. This is the secret, along with a lightning fast locking mechanism, that gives the Strike One its unbelievable semiautomatic firing speed. It is faster than any other pistol ever manufactured because of the in-line barrel operation. Email or text in interested Nine18-four02-zero854"
