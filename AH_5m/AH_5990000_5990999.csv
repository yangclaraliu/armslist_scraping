Nighthawk Custom is excited not only about the Model T4 for what we designed it as but what the response has been from the consumer market. The 9mm cartridge in a 1911 designed for concealed carry may be the best of both worlds when it comes to muzzle controllability and magazine capacity in a 1911. The T4 contains some of the most evolutionary features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a 3.8” barrel platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8” Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5” or shorter barrel. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast® Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawks popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and recessed with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by Nighthawk. Grips are like the T3 and are thinned for less bulk. Barrel length is 3.8”. Available in Steel or Aluminum frame upgrade.

I have painted the back of the front sight in bright orange so that it can better be used as the ""poor man's eotech"" as Rob from AKOU says, meaning that it works the same way a red dot sight does, in that you only have to line up the bright orange with your target.  It works great for close targets.  The muzzle brake is something I made from a barrel extension from CNC Warrior.  It works well, but you can always get something else if you don't like it.  Cleaning rod included.  This has the Century Rak1 trigger group, and it's very decent, I can hit a 12 inch steel plate at 300 yards with this, open sights.  The sling is NOT included.  As stated above, you will get the Magpul furniture, which includes the MOE triangle stock, the MOE handguard and the MOE foregrip. Price is $700.  I will NOT ship.  No ammo included.  Please be within an hour of Chambersburg PA, or be willing to meet me halfway."

Gun was manufactured a few months ago, so night sights should be good for at least 10-12 years according to Sig.Also includes two sets of grips...one set of rubber wrap-around Hogue grips and one set of Sig's ""Blackwood"" weed grips (both pictured, but I just laid the wood grip over the rubber so it might not look perfectly straight?Will include a box of 100 rounds of brand new range ammo.Sorry, no trades and no shipping. Face to face cash only! A true steal at the price!! This gun looks and operates much like a 1911 - although it has a Browning tilting barrel action and a thumb safety that will let you rack the slide even with the safety engaged (convenient and completely safe).Trigger is single action only, so short pull and short reset. Extremely accurate for a gun that will fit in a pocket and surprisingly little felt recoil for such a small gun in 9mm. And of course it's a Sig, so you know it's a high quality pistol and has a transferable lifetime warranty!!!Please do not ask if I'm interested in trades - -I need to sell my firearms to help pay for a recent surgery.Thanks for looking!"

Built with reliable parts, the level recoil layout allows the shooter to hold on target with little to no effort.  Those who own an AR find themselves upgrading to the parts that are already provided on this BKA BAMF 15.For starters, BKA uses an adjustable bleed off gas block manufactured by Superlatived Arms.  The Superlative Arms patent pending ""Bleed Off"", direct impingement, gas block for the AR 15 platform adjusts the gas flow by bleeding the gas out of the block instead of restricting the flow like conventional adjustable blocks.  As a result, the pressure is reduced to the amount required to drive the bolt carrier back allowing the remainder of the gas to bleed out of the system.  This reduces the recoil and allows the system to run cooler and cleaner.  We use a sturdy 16"" HBAR barrel with a 1-9 twist chambered .223 Wylde with Phosphate finish and M4 feed ramp.  This is a sturdy barrel that has proven itself worthy to be a part of our design.  Where others failed, this barrel not only remained in one piece, but it continued to hold a tight pattern. Another great feature is the Troy Battle Ax CQB Std Stock.  Improved ergonomics, vital storage capaity, and Battle Ready toughness define Troy's new Battle Ax M4 butt stock.  Advanced reinforced polymer ensures strength and durability.  A comfortable cheek weld helps operators settle in quickly for rapic target acquisition.  The stock collapses compactly and seccurely.  A solid metal butt plate opens to reveal storage capacity unmatched by any other stock on the market.  It has a quick detach swivel socket at 9-6-3 o'clock.The Troy Modular Combat Grip offers versatility, unmatched durability, and outstanding ergonomics in a grip that complements all picatinny rail systems.  This three part modular design and waterproof high capacity storage compartment allows the operator to adjust for fit as well as have a reliable storage compartment.  This grip converts easilhy into two sizes: 4 5/8"" when completely assembled and 3 1/4"" when in short mode.Troy industries have proven to be top of the line when it comes to battle equipment.  This is why you will find an array of Troy parts on our top of the line rifles.  Such as, Troy micro battle sights, Troy medievel muzzle brake, Troy ambi mag release, Troy Enhanced trigger guard, Troy enhanced battle ax pistol grip as well as a Troy ambi bolt release.  There is no doubt Troy industries produces excellent accessories as you will find when shooting this rifle.  
 
The 10"" Midwest freefloat forearm is one of the best on the market.  It is indeed the ultimate 2-piece handrail.  It is billet machined from 6061 aluminum and has a hard coat anodized finish.  Its design is perfect for an adjustable gas lock like we have on our BKA BR 15 and this model our BKA BAMF 15.  It is also perfect for an upgrade to a top of the line piston system which we can instal by request.  The ease of access as well as its sleek design is what won out over other handrails we considered and tested. This rifle is also equipped with the AXTS ambidextrous Raptor charging handle due to its smooth design and function.   The receivers have a sturdy Cerakote finish which is the best on the market.  We also furnish a reliable PMag magazine by Magpul.  This rifle is ready to go.  No upgrades are required to have a top of the line rifle which others will envy.  It is lined up, ready to load and shoot when you receive it.  We are a two man operation and we take great pride in our work.  We do everything from designing to milling to sighting in the rifles we build."

Suffice it to say, this gun is far from its original configuration. I will go over the impressive list of modifications in a moment, let's talk about the base gun first. The VEPR line is based off of the original Russian RPK model. It features a robust construction, with thicker receiver and trunions. This particular model is a type II with integrated FSB/GB. It also has the more desirable, flat back receiver! This allows the use of several standard AK stamped receiver stocks, without a adapter. It also features a spring loaded firing pin, to avoid slam fires common with commercial ammunition and free floated pins. This particular gun is still in unfired condition, and has only recently been finish built. Made to last generations, the VEPR line is as tough as it looks! This gun as stated, is far from stock. It started life as a standard 20.5"" barreled VEPR with the 2x4 wood furniture. When I say 2x4 furniture, I'm not exaggerating! It wasn't fit for this rifle. To build this exactly as shown, with the mags, expect to spend around 2700.00! Why do I say that, I'll tell you. Lantac Drakon muzzle brake (145.00), CSSPECS mags seven in total (240.00), Manticore Arms handguard unmodified (200.00), RS Regulate scope mount top and bottom (180.00), Leupold VXR-R patrol optic with Leupold QD rings (380.00), FAB Defense AK rubberized grip (30.00), LUTH-AR stock with adapter (185.00), and the gun, if you can find a NIB flat back, 800.00. Total without gunsmith labor, over 2100.00. You may ask me what gunsmith work was done. Well, for starters, I had the barrel shortened. I wanted to be around 21"" with the muzzle brake. He cut, crowned, and threaded it at 19"". That gives you a barrel length that's perfect for the 308 round. He then indexed the muzzle brake correctly, to the 14×1 LH thread. Next up was the scope. Many people just buy the Russian combo optics. While they are nice, there is a reason they came serial numbered to the gun. Often times, they need to be fitted to the rifles side rail to guarantee zero! Most people don't do this, and wonder why they can't zero their new optic. Enter RS Regulate. Due to their unique two peace design, you can zero the top half of the mount over the rifle! This was indeed done with a lazer alignment systeml. Also bore sighted at 50 yards to get you on paper fast. To top it off, the top half of the mount is a 1913 rail! Don't like the Leupold, simply pop it off via the QD mounts. The 1913 mount itself is still centered over the rifle! My smith also custom modified the handguard by removing the top halves of keymod, exposing the gas tube! It shaves weight, while just looking bad ass! Truly one off design. Last up is the custom two tone cerokote. It's a flat black, sniper gray mix. All of this labor wise comes out to around 320.00. With this gun you will also receive everything pictured on the gun! Seven CSSPECS steel double stack mags in total also cerokoted! Six 20 rounders and one 10 rounder. Put this all together with the endless adjustment of the LUTH-AR stock, and you have one serious rifle! The last picture is of this exact rifle in its stock form! That way, you can truly appreciate the amount of work into it! I can accept PayPal friends and family payment, or USPS money order. Have questions, please ask! I probably only scratched the surface with this description!"

The trigger is just phenominal.  I've never fired it with a scope to take maximum advantage of the barrel's full length, so I can't say exactly how accurate it is.  I can tell you that with my mediocre shooting, I can hit soda cans at 25 yards with out a problem.  Also, this revolver is just so fun to shoot.  The feel of the solid weight that just soaks up recoil, the trigger that has almost no take up and just breaks so crisp.  This is not one of the newer ones built with the safty key and is part of the original production as can be seenn by the numbers behind the yolk.  I'm not sure why, but this revolver has a parkerized finish, see photos.  Selling the S&W for $625.  Sorry, will not ship.  Must meet FTF, be an Alabama resident with a Carry permit, 21 or over.  I don't intend on being rude, but any offer to ship will be ignored as will out of state contacts.You can reach me throught the site or call or text 205 4 five 1 2348.You're going to love shootng this gun, good luck."

All complete with the military proof marks and acceptance stamps, which read like a history book. The Mauser K98 is an authentic piece of History for any collector. These rifles remain first in Bolt Action Design, Strength, Reliability, Accuracy and Safety.
All K98k were issued to a German soldiers and actually used in WWII, most likely in combat. After the war, the allies took control of all of the German K98k’s. The rifles offered from Mitchell's Mausers Collection survived the war in superior condition and still work like the day they were made.
    Matching serial numbers - Original German markings - Cleaned and inspected"" [could more accurately be called ""arsenal refurbished""]  *Including WW II original accessories plus lots of extras - original ammo pouch, original cleaning pull through, original oiler, original screwdriver tool, official Mitchell's Mausers Letter of Provenance, english manual, reproduction bayonet, reproduction sling, and lots of extra stripper clips, AND a .30 cal ammo can with 12 boxes of 8mm Yugoslavian surplus ammo in stripper clips (180 rounds), 5 boxes of PRVI Partizan 196grain M75 sniper ammo, 1990s manufacture without stripper clips (75 rounds), plus 7 extra loaded stripper clips with a mix of surplus and sniper ammo for a total of approx. 290 rounds of good quality ammo.
The rifle has obviously been refinished although there are a few minor cosmetic blemishes and areas where the stock looks to have been repaired before refinishing, probably at the arsenal; the metal and wood finish are both in great shape; bore is pitted, with visible rifling but showing signs of significant use and age.  I have tons of pics, email for more info.
According to Mitchells: ""Unfortunately, it is true  —  NAZI Mausers are sold out world wide.  Hitler’s NAZI’s were defeated seventy years ago; and the Iron Curtain fell twenty-five years ago.  Since then astute collectors have taken most all of the NAZI-marked rifles that had been stored in the old Soviet warehouses.  More recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict cut us off from the last few NAZI rifles in Russia.  There are simply no NAZI rifles available  –  anywhere.""  [Except for this one!]
The supply of these rifles has really dried up these days; Mitchell's has been sold out for a long time now, and even on gunbroker you'll be hard pressed to find one in this condition.
NOTE: I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of any information quoted from Mitchells or appearing on their Letter of Provenance.  All used firearms should be checked by a qualified gunsmith before use. CASH ONLY - NO TRADES - Serious inquiries only; No Shipping. Local sales ONLY."

Sorry to have to say this but I am not interested in haggling over the price for a box or two. It's just not worth it. If you come to me with a reasonable offer for all of it I will entertain it but please understand that I have taken the time to find out what it is worth and priced it accordingly. Trying to barter for 5 or 10 bucks is exhausting and I don't have the energy. If you have a handgun that is in the $500 range that you would like to trade for all of the .380 ammo, I would entertain that as well.  A Glock 26 would surely get my attention.  I have (3) Glock 42 magazines that I could include for the right deal."

The 3 30rnd magazines have been lightly used. I only put 30rnds in one magazine. The other 2 have never had more than 10rds in them.
The 20rnd magazine has been used twice, and only put 20rnds in it once.
The 10 rnd magazine have been used the most. And have been the most reliable.
I'm a bench shooter and the range I shoot at doesn't allow more than 10rnds per magazine.
I've also done modifications to the magazines to make them feed better. You'll see in the photos I flared out the feed lips. And dremaled down the front lip of the magazine. As shells tended to get stuck on it. I learned this researching failure to feed issues with ASC 7.62x39 magazines.
I made the mistake being way to many before I completed my build. And just don't have the space for them.

This rifle has the standard A2 front sight, Flip rear sight, Mid weight barrel, Bayonet lug, carbine length gas system, forward assist and dust cover.It has a rear flip up sight already so you don’t have to go out and spend money for a sight and is easily removable if you wish to change out. It also has a 1:8” twist instead of basic model 1:9” this will give the bullet a bit of extra spin which helps with stability and accuracy. Nice rifle to have and get it while you can. AR’s are selling fast and most direct sellers (Stag arms, Aero Precision, Anderson Arms etc.) are weeks out already and there is about 6 weeks before the election and it is only going to get worse.- FAMILY: Del-Ton AR15•MODEL: 316M.•TYPE: Semi-Auto rifle•FINISH: Black•STOCK/FRAME: Steel Frame•STOCK/GRIPS: Synthetic•WEIGHT:6.6 lbs.•CALIBER/GAUGE:5.56/223 cal•CAPACITY:10•# OF MAGS:1•MAGAZINE DESC:10 rd.•BARREL: 16""•Twist: 1:8""•OVERALL LENGTH:36.37""•SIGHTS:Flip up rear and A2 front sight•SAFETY:Frame Mounted*pics are sock photos**** Not taking trades at this time*******Due to Colorado law there has to be a background check completed before selling of gun.
