A brand new in the box never loaded, fired, or carried Glock 19 Vicker's Tactical RTF2 Black edition. This is the newest release from Lipsey's/Vickers and is the nicest pistol in the lineup. For those unfamiliar, this is a special collaboration between Lipsey's, Glock, and Larry Vicker's which are limited to only 3,000 Glock 19 pistols total for the production making this a rare pistol. This particular pistol was released within the last week and is the nicest pistol in the Vicker's line in that special ""additions"" have been added that the previous Vicker's pistols do not have. First off, the front sight post is the upgraded gold bead dot over the previous fiber optic sight, the serial number prefix has been placed as LAV for Larry Vicker's unlike the previous pistols, and you still receive the same upgrades that all of the previous pistols have ie RTF2 frame, flared magazine base plates, grip plug with built in take down tool, extended slide release, extended mag release, special sights, all of the factory Glock replacement parts for the above upgrades (not including sights), correct paperwork including a discount for any Vicker's Tactical training class, and all of this is wrapped in the new classic black option. Again, this is a very hard to find pistol and commands a premium and is also a higher retail price to begin with than any of the previous models. For those that check GunBroker for price comparisons, please do. Currently on GunBroker several of these are selling, not listed for but SELLING, for $799 and up due to the low production numbers and the fact that this is the nicest Lipsey's/Vicker's Glock to have been release. Again, this is brand new in the box purchased by me from my FFL today and is a low serial number as these just started to ship a couple of days ago. I am not fond of the Vicker's Edition Glocks but had the opportunity to purchase one new and make a few $ so here it is. My price for the pistol new in the box including a Reign Tactical IWB carbon fiber FDE holster (3 month wait on these through Reign plus a $70 charge) is 100000% FIRM at $670 cash only. Keep in mind I paid $670 with tax plus the $70 holster. If you do not like my price go elsewhere but we both know your chances are slim to none as these sold out through Lipsey's in record time or you will pay the same on GunBroker plus shipping and transfer fees. I will not, I repeat WILL NOT, respond to any offers below my asking price nor will I respond to trade offers of any kind. No I will not ship it. No I will not split the holster and pistol up. No I will not provide further pictures. No there is nothing wrong with it. No I will not meet you half way. If you want it, you will meet me at the Kroger off of I-71 and King's Mill in Mason with a state issued photo ID and cash in hand. All local, state, and federal laws apply, cash only, and buyer must present state issued photo ID at time of sale as well as sign a bill of sale. NO EXCEPTIONS.

The optic adjusts to the light conditions so that it is always the correct brightness.  I have had no issues with the gun I just am an avid gun collector and with that comes selling guns to get new ones.  I may be interested in trades.

The coin is named after its designer, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It is considered by many to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins. In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage, and proposed Saint-Gaudens as an artist capable of the task. Although the sculptor had poor experiences with the Mint and its chief engraver, Charles E. Barber, Saint-Gaudens accepted Roosevelt's call. The work was subject to considerable delays, due to Saint-Gaudens's declining health and difficulties because of the high relief of his design. Saint-Gaudens died in 1907, after designing the eagle and double eagle, but before the designs were finalized for production. After several versions of the design for the double eagle proved too difficult to strike, Barber modified Saint-Gaudens's design, lowering the relief so the coin could be struck with only one blow. When the coins were finally released, they proved controversial as they lacked the words ""In God We Trust"", and Congress intervened to require the motto's use. The coin was minted, primarily for use in international trade, until 1933. The 1933 double eagle is among the most valuable of U.S. coins, with the sole example currently known to be in private hands selling in 2002 for $7,590,020.Cash is obo and highly prefered but limited trades would include:Wilson Combat Tactical ShotgunBlack Rain AR in 223Quality side by side with cash from meMorgans or Peace Dollars?????"

Feel free to offer wether cash/trades. Mainly looking for a Beretta 1301, Glock 9mm mags, Glock 26 & 43, and maybe some other stuff.I built this shotgun more around the ""Tacticool"" niche just to have fun, yet still add useful mods and retaining its functionality for home defense style scenarios. I have right at $1,400 just in parts (including the shotgun) not counting tax, shipping, FFL fees and the $150 in gun smith work to drill and tap the receiver to mount the picatiny rail. Total cost well exceeds the $1,650 mark once tax/ffl fees/gun smith work is added.All original (synthetic) furniture and the stock barrel (I think its either 26 or 28"" but dont quote me on that) come with it. I have kept all original parts as well as extra parts from the mag extension and whatnot.Part list is as follow, including what I paid for them:$700.00 - Remington 870 Wingmaster$100.00 - Magpul SGA Stock$15.00 - Magpul SGA Cheek Riser$20.00 - Magpul SGA Sling Mount$65.00 - Mesa Tactical SureShell 6 Shell Aluminum Saddle$10.00 - Receiver Mounted Picatinny Rail$100.00 - Sightmark Sure Shot Reflex Sight w/ Quick Detach$30.00 - Magpul MOE Forend$35.00 - Magpul AFG V2$40.00 - 2x Magpul Aluminum M-Lok Picatinny Rails$80.00 - Fenix TK15UE Flashlight$20.00 - Scope Rings (for flashlight)$130.00 - Remington 18.5"" Barrel, Parkerized, IC Bead Sight$45.00 - Wilson Combat +2 Magazine Extension$15.00 - Wilson Combat Jumbo Head Safety"

Has receiver side mount for optics, I'd think with some nice glass she'd hit nice a lot farther. The barrel is also threaded and has an AMD style break. The only real flaws are the finish on the receiver, someone painted it, and the hand guard was cut down. Wouldn't take much to convert the last bit to accept a standard quad rail or hand guard."

They made these as limited inital production models. They made limited 16s and 17s. Limited 16s have 7 digit serial numbers, that is how many they produced. The 17s only have 3 digit serial numbers. These are incredibly rare. Mostly only dealers and company heads got their hands on these and still have most of them. I have never seen another come up for sale nor has the few big appraisors I had look at it. They came in a rolling Hardigg Storm case, 2 mags, and a Certificate of Authenticity. The intial production run was the test trial to see how well they would do. Only these were produced at a plant in the US. The same plant they made the ones for the military. After the initial production was released, all production moved to Belgium. So very few of them were made that when I called FN, they could not give me a exact number of how many were sold to the public. This is gun 186 out of all made. You won't see another much less one for sale. If you are lucky to see another one... it will be shot. Not brand new. Even has all the tags still on it. This is a great collectors item so dont miss it. Shoot me an offer. No I will not sell for the price of a new one that comes in a cardboard box and one mag that they made a million of. I know what its worth. Or close enough at least. Any other info email me and ill answer to the best of my knowledge. I have had several offers so just email me your best offer.

It’s in good shape for its age and i have not restored it in any way, other than changing out the firing pin and giving the internals a deep clean (everything besides the trigger mechanism). The rifle has two screw holes in the receiver for a side mounted scope. It has the tube magazine which holds 10 rounds plus one in the chamber and feeds through the butt stuck. The cycle of the rounds is flawless on this rifle. This thing shoots straight and is very fun to shoot. If not sold at the right price or traded for the right trade, than I will just keep the rifle: I’m not in desperate need to sell.Here is a link to a video of me firing the rifle on 22SEP16: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubfsUDaBsBA"
