Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel.

Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition.Local face-to-face cash sale only.

Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. But it doesn't stop there.

Times have changed, but Springfield's impact on the industry has not. With their line of XD and XD(m) semi-autos Springfield has answered the call for an ergonomically sound, lightweight, high-capacity and reliable pistol. Crimson Trace has backed Springfield's quest by producing revolutionary laser sighting capabilities for these high tech handguns. Springfield Armory Full-Size XD and XDM The Crimson Trace Lightguard for Springfield XD & XD(m) features a highly compact and slim design specifically for ease of holstering. Its 100 lumen tactical white light seamlessly attaches to your defensive pistol, much like Crimson Trace's Laserguard. Lightguard also uses the same instinctive activation that Crimson Trace laser sights are famous for. Lightguard removes the need for a flashlight separate from the pistol giving you a free hand. This low-light tool can be operated by gripping the firearm in a natural firing grip, or with a single hand gripping the pistol.   UPC: REDACTED09"

This flat dark earth model of Springfield’s popular pistol includes a variety of fine tuned, new and improved features. Mod.2 ergonomics are a next-level experience that you have to feel to believe and understand. The entire interface between the shooter and the gun has been updated, while retaining the Point-and-Shoot characteristics that made it famous. Key features have been tweaked and enhanced to further enable effortless shooting. And you’ll find that the overall package is now more concealable as well. Springfield XD Mod.2 9mm FDE Features  GripZone: the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact 9mm FDE applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. The GripZone is a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. Fiber Optic Front Sight: Achieve easier and faster target acquisition with the fiber optic front sight. Low Profile Extended Rear Sight: The rear sight on the Mod.2™ is low profile, snag free, and holster friendly. Posi-Wedge Serrations: A more pronounced rear serration makes racking the slide effortless. Slimmer Slide and Frame: The Mod.2™ has a slimmer slide for concealability and more comfortable carry. The Mod.2™ frame has been re-contoured, a slimmer frame adds up to a more natural grip. High-Hand™ Beavertail: Higher hand positioning toward the barrel’s bore axis reduces felt recoil when firing. High-Hand™ Grip Relief: Works in unison with the High-Hand™ Beavertail to reduce felt recoil."

The rifle comes with a Nikon Prostaff 3x9 scope (see pic).I have hunted with this rifle for many seasons, but it is still in great condition. One flaw is that the bolt release button is a little sticky. When you press the bolt release and extract the bolt, it often takes a minute or two for the spring to release, reengaging the bolt lock. This does not affect the functioning of the firearm, and I believe it only needs a good cleaning with solvent.At the time of sale the purchaser and I will fill out a Record of Firearms Transfer Between Unlicensed Persons. In order to buy this rifle you will need two things:1- Valid NC Drivers License showing you are 18+ years of age. (I will make a copy.)2- Cash in the amount of sale.Only reasonable offers considered.

AR does come with 4 mags but I'm keeping my ammo for my other rifles.  Do your homework on this rifle before you make ridiculous offers, this is a mil-spec rifle you would easily spend $2000 for the rifle and sight brand new. I am open to trades of equal value of multi gun trades or will sell for cash with or with out the Trijicon sight. Let me know what you have........Thanks"

If there's no interest I'll post more thourough individual listings with pictures this weekend, but prices will be higher by then. I'm feeling lazy right now, so if you bite, you'll win. First, Remington 1100 with 2x barrels. Gun is flawless mechanically, but probably 85-90% cosmetically. one barrel is 18"" smooth bore with rifle sights, one barrel is 26"" vent rib with bead sight. $450 gets the package. Second, Benelli M3 super 90. Gun is used, in 90% costmetic condition. Mechanically it runs well, but seems a bit ammo finicky, which is why I'm selling it. I've installed a tube extension so it's 7+1+1, and it has the factory pistol grip fixed stock on it. Ghost ring sights, but buyer will have to source screws for and install rear sight (which I'll include) as the place I got it from had taken off the rear sight to mount a god awful B square bridge mount and they didn't have the rear sight to give me. I spent $115 to get a new rear sight, but purchased the wrong screws to instal it and haven't followed up on it since. My loss, your gain. $1100. (note, if you don't know what an M3 is, look it up... it's badass... one of the only pump/semi shotguns out there). Third, Benelli M4. this one does not have the full length tube, but does have the collapsible stock that was for the longest time impossible to get outside LE channels. This particular M4 has a very nice, very expensive but currently out of production full length quad rail on it. the gun is in about 85-90% condition cosmetically, and runs great as long as you're using full power loads in it. $1750. I'm only selling to fund some other projects, so I'm not super motivated to move the stuff, so please no lowball offers. I will, however, reward people for not wasting my time, and will give discounts for package sales."

This one also has a Chrome Lined 5.56 NATO 1x7 twist to stabilize the M855 bullet with more accuracy than the more common 1x9 twist. Yes, it has a Foward Assist and Dust Cover...Thanks for looking."
