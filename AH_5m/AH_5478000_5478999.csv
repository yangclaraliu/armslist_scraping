The wood stock is nearly perfect I would say about 99.9% it has no dents dings or scratches. The shellac coating has very little wear under the barrel, I would say it is 98% perfect on the shellac coating and is the original finish on the gun. The bluing is 98%, however on the top of the receiver there is very little pitting. The Hand guard Has the more desirable brass metal ends, and Comes with the bayonet.Great rifling.

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Influenced by HK engineers' experience with the P30 pistol, the VP Series breaks ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK ""light pull"" trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in a production striker fired handgun. The VP trigger has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP40 uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail is molded into the polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams). All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. VP pistols feature HK's patented charging supports - simple components mounted on each side of the rear of the slide to provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring to help reduce the recoil forces, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK's famous cold hammer forged barrel, made from cannon grade steel, also ensures long service life. The polygonal bore profile contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; this model comes with three 13-round capacity magazines and night sights.Ships to your FFL Holder for $25"

This piece cost 1500 new after taxes and shipping and I am only asking $1000. Also has a pinned and welded battlecomp. The upper is very accurate and reliable. It has eaten every type of ammo I have thrown at it and never once had an issue. It is also the softest shooting rifle I own. Just to reiterate. This add is for the upper reciever only.

Comes with case, 2 15rd magazines and glock holster. Holster actually came with the gun when it was brand new. For those who know what it is, this model has the amazing tenifer finish that glock stopped back in 2012. That new finish is garbage. Tenifer models are becoming more sought after due to its durability. This gun has only had 50rds through it. Need money for other things or i wouldnt be selling it. Dont let this one go. Sorry no trades, emails regarding trades will be ignored. You must be a WI resident to buy."

Appreciate fine German engineering? Got tax return money burning a hole in your pocket? I've got what you need to to lay some serious and accurate whoop-a** on whatever needs whoopin' :-)
HK91 G3 rifle, 7.62x51 (aka .308 for the metrically challenged).  Comes with original sling, 2 range mags (well worn but function perfectly) a dozen like new mags, cheap hard case and a bit over 300 rounds of quality, non-corrosive surplus ammunition.  Ammunition is Malaysian - about 50/50 on belt and de-linked.  Will include links and a couple ammo cans.  All mags are pre-94 ban if that matters.
This is an IB date code gun (1981, I think) in very excellent condition.  Overall condition is on the ++ side of excellent.  NO dents, dings, scratches, rust, etc.  Does not appear to have had scope mounted- no scratches or wear on upper receiver scope mounting area.  These guns chew up brass and send it flying about a mile so there are a few marks around ejection port (indicates very minimal use).  Bore is minty and gun is more accurate than I am.
Selling to partially offset cost of a new automotive toy.
This is the real deal in G3 battle rifles, not ""it's just like an HK"".  Nothing else comes close.  $2600 FTF in Wheaton or where convenient.  Note to the bottom feeders and indigent - I am not broke, destitute, desperate or upside down on my mortgage.  I'm selling to keep peace in my home and ostensibly partially offset cost of a new toy.  If you cannot afford this gun, you should not try to get me to give it to you at a steep discount to market pricing.  I you need help understanding market pricing go look for one in your local gun shop.  Oops, not there.  Check out completed sales on gunboker and figure out the avaerage.  Sorry if this is too direct but the trolls have been busy with this gun.

The receiver only needs the ejector riveted or welded in to be LIVE! extremely easy to do.I didn't finish it cause I'm in CA and prefer to keep it as is and not go any further. The bolt slides smoothly. Well made. ___ The welds should be ground down to look nice The other work to be done is rivet or weld in little rail support piece(again stupid easy and part included)..and if you wanted, demill the dust port door off original receiver section(included) and weld on new receiver. Also a good idea add additional weld to rear upper to lower receiver mount block. Easily done but not necessary. I think the weld is good and strong as is. Comes with two 10rnd mags. ___This is a great opportunity to finish build a rare rifle with 99% of the work done. No refunds. I'm selling at a loss as it is.

Comes in its original hard case, and it has the optional rail kit and forward mounted vertical grip as well.  This is the more desirable 90 series model, so it will accept Beretta 96 magazines, and it will come with 7 of them.  Has been a great rifle, is very accurate, and has been totally reliable, but I don't use it much.  Would make a great pair with a Beretta 96 pistol.I'd like to sell it for $650.  For an extra $50 I can include a Primary Arms red dot sight. If you're interested in having a matching pistol for it as well I can also include a Beretta 96A1 pistol and an additional 7 magazines, for 14 total, for a package deal of $1200.Would prefer to sell, but may consider trades of similar value for one or both.  Would like a AR10,  a ""DMR"" style AR15, or possibly a Tavor or other interesting 556 rifles (not interested in a standard AR15 Carbine). I also like Sig P series pistols, but would consider most quality handguns.If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3, texts are best as I may not be able to respond until this afternoon, but I'll get back with you asap if interested. Thanks!"

I upgraded the scope rings from the cheap ones that came on the gun. I sighted it in twice and then killed 2 deer with 2 shots. It's a nice gun but it's one of 3 30-06 that I own and the wife thinks I should thin the heard. I have $450 in to it and it's like new. Throw me an offer.
