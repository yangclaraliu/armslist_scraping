I have a second 20rd box of Elite Performance V-Crown I will include with the gun for a local trade.Trades offers need to be in the $1600-1700 dollar range, Cash I would like to see $1600.  There is an El Cabo on gunbroker with multiple bids right now over $2k, and this is a higher end gun."

KRISS Vector CRB Gen. 2: Carbine / Semi. / 16"" barrel / M4 stock / 13 rds / .45ACP / FDE

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16Ã�Â¢Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states."

When I placed the order, I chose two options: fancy wood and crescent butt plate. It took several weeks for the custom order to go through, and then right before it was to ship out, Turnbull called and told me that their final inspection showed the wood was not up to their standard for ""fancy"" - so they would need a couple more weeks to re-stock the gun. Well, it was worth the wait and they outdid themselves, don't you think? I mean, I ordered a 1X wood upgrade and got this! The wood is just amazing!! And the color case hardening? Fantastic, as to be expected from Turnbull Manufacturing."

This is the latest generation of the Sub2k released from Kel Tec. From the factory: The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model). The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

The trigger is smooth but a little long in travel for my taste.  So here is a chance for a CA civilian resident to own this one through a private party transfer. This is the law enforcement model that comes with night sights and THREE 10 round magazines as well as the LEM trigger.  You have to feel the trigger to appreciate it.  This is the most desired model of the P30SK out there. It is indeed the fully loaded model. Must meet at your local FFL of choice within 30 miles of RiversideUPDATE:  I have received many replies to this post.  My apologies if I have not responded quickly.  I am not looking to trade.  I should have mentioned that earlier. Thank you all for who have been sending offers.  I must change this listing to ""price is firm.""  If you are a serious buyer and responded to this post and have not seen a reply, please resend.  Armslist is not the most reliable system.  The only reason why I am selling is because I accepted another position out of state so I want to give a fellow CA citizen a chance to own a off roster handgun legally. Otherwise, I can train and get used to the longer travel trigger. SPECS:
The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.This is NOT the double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame.Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.
