It delivers incredible multi-caliber sound reduction, while retaining a compact, lightweight package. Coupled with our rock solid, precision Taper Mount system, the Recce 7, weighing only 17.5 ounces, provides minimal and repeatable point of impact shift with only minor weight gain. With the INCLUDED 17-4ph Taper Mount Minimalist Brake, the Recce 7 weighs only 19.3 ounces (Mounted total system weight with a functional muzzle brake). The Recce 7 offers best in class system weight, coming in 5 - 7 ounces lighter than comparable suppressors in the high performance, high durability 7.62mm suppressor class. For users seeking a do it all silencer for their centerfire rifles, look no further. The Recce 7 is the only known production silencer to survive the abusive LWRCI UICW 8"" 6.8 SPC stress test, proving that it is not only quiet, light, and accurate, but also tough as nails. Also new to the Recce 7 (MOD 3) is a tuned, Patent Pending baffle system offering the apogee of multi-caliber sound performance. Elite tactical units requested minimal flash signature and Griffin responded by developing a low-profile flash reducer integral to the suppressor. The Recce 7 is CNC machined, and Tig fusion welded for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. Every component in the Recce 7 is manufactured from solid billets of strong, heat treated, high temperature corrosion resistant 17-4 Stainless Steel. Years of internal testing has found 17-4 stainless steel to provide longer service life than 718 Incolnel, the prior market leading alloy. 17-4 stainless is also twice as strong as cast Stelite 6, used by other industry companies. A Taper Mount Minimalist Brake is included, making the Recce 7 a terrific value. Overall SPL on a 12"" 300BLK with Remington 220 Subsonic is 123DB, quieter than some 22 rimfire suppressors on the market. Whether hunting your favorite game or rucking on a long range patrol the Recce 7 is the right tool for the job. Rated on Following barrel lengths 7.5"" 5.56mm, 8"" 300BLK, 8"" 7.62x39, 8"" 6.8SPC, 12.5"" 7.62x51, and 22"" 300Win Mag INCLUDED: TAPER MOUNT MINIMALIST BRAKE"

The Omni Hybrid AR-15 features ATI's metal-reinforced polymer upper and lower receivers, which help to reduce weight and increase maneuverability without sacrificing durability! The lower receiver features an over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin. This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin, delivering the strength and durability to withstand recoil and constant use. INCREDIBLY TOUGH. In fact, the Omni Hybrid lower has been specifically tested to withstand all sorts of use and abuse. The folks at ATI put it through all the pressure and weight-bearing tests, similar to the US Military's testing, and found it to function flawlessly, even after supporting up to 250 lbs. and being run over by an 800-lb. forklift. Then, they ran 2,000 rounds through it without a hiccup. You can deploy this dependable AR-15 in your collection for less than you think when you order from The Guide.  Polymer lower is built from a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert, with extra reinforcements in high-pressure sections Inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system built into the Lower prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing 16"" M4 phosphated barrel with A2 flash hider Mil-spec sized M4 buttstock and buffer tube Low-profile gas block with rail Standard charging handle Polymer CAR handguard Includes one 30-rd. polymer magazine"

This gun is in mint condition, as I've shot it very little. In 9mm form, it holds 16 rounds and features a 3.6"" barrel with three-dot sights. It easily changes to a .22 target pistol with a full length barrel and slide, 10-round magazine, and black adjustable target sights. I'm not a bullseye shoter, but this is the most accurate .22 pistol I have shot. Feeds very reliably. Comes with original box and all papers. I have had this gun for a few years now and don't shoot as much as I'd like. New, this set-up retails for over $550. FTF is fine within 20 miles from Salem/Roanoke or Boones Mill (VA DL and bill of sale required). If you really want me to ship this, you pay the shipping and the fee my FFL charges (no more than $20). Thanks for looking."

Steyr is the “other” Austrian gunmaker, and this mid-sized pistol (6.9”L X 5.3”H X 1.2”W) is an excellent, accurate shooter. Unique grip angle points naturally and puts your hand high under the bore, resulting in very soft recoil. The trapezoid sights are fantastic (wish I had them on my other pistols!), and quicker to pick up than three-dot sights. Only selling because, try as I might, I just don’t care for plastic striker-fired pistols. If I were going to keep one, though, it would be this one. Bought new last month, this is the latest generation, not the version from five years ago that had extractor problems.No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga area."

This is the .40 S&W version of the K5, the South Korean military's sidearm since 1989. If you know these guns, you know they were marketed in the US as the DP51 and now imported by Lionheart as the LH9. This DH40 has an alloy frame and a steel slide, ambidextrous safety switch, and the unique ""triple action"" trigger. You can fire it in single action, double action, or a ""double action plus"" mode where the hammer is down but the trigger pull is very light. This is how the Korean Army carries it. This pistol has some nice touches such as grooves on the front and backstraps and a waved topstrap to reduce glare, just like what you get on the Lionheart. The magazine (one included) holds 11 rounds and the DH40 will take Smith & Wesson 4000 series magazines (so I hear. I have not tried one.) This is one solid gun, and I hate to part with it, but this is my only .40 and I'm trying to cut back on ammo.

A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR 15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part. PicMod Technology The Mod.2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyModTM attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present. This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyModTM mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.

I've had it about 4 years, but have only shot it about 50-75 times. I am the second owner of this firearm, but the first owner had also only fired it few times. I used it as a skeet shotgun but didn't skeet shoot that much. It is in excellent condition, very few cosmetic imperfections. The only imperfections are so very tiny scratchs around the ejection port where the bolt is. It is a very reliable shotgun, out of the times I've shot it, it has never misfired or jammed. Everything about this gun works, no rust, always been cleaned and oiled. It comes with 3 additional choke tubes from when I bought it, a gun sock, and a gun lock. This shotgun also had a custom adjustable buttstock pad that was on there when I bought it. This gun normally goes for about 350-400 on gun broker without any attachments, so I am willing to go around 350 for the shotgun. It does hold 3 in the tube and 1 in the chamber.

It is a 34MM tube, instead of 30MM like most of this style.  It has Japanese glass and is First Focal plane and serves as a red dot when set at 1X power with a tacitcal horseshoe reticle when zoomed in.  The reticle is graduated in MIL hash marks, and the click adjustments are very noticable with .1 MIL values.  The turrets are resetable and push down to lock out changes.  It includes an American Defense Recon 34MM QD mount ($175) that is rock solid, flip-up caps, box, manual, and a switchview power zoom lever ($70).  There is over $2000 in this rig.  Asking $1300 for the whole thing, or a trade + or - cash for high end (comparable) log range scope.  Something with at least 20x power and adjustable parallax.  REDACTED.  Thanks!Here is a link to Midways page:

The Bushnell SRMS Elite Tactical 1-8.5x is a precision powerhouse with numerous features that will give operators a distinct advantage in any situation. The robust 34mm tube provides a 105' field of view at 100 yards on 1x for extreme situational awareness in CQB situations. The SRMS also is able to gather light in the most adverse situations, making dimly lit rooms a breeze to maneuver through with the aid of the 11 reticle illumination settings. Operators will be able to engage targets with ease at long range with the crystal clear ultra wide band coated lenses and the BTR-2 reticle. The first focal BTR-2 allows precision ranging at any power and the locking 1/10 Mil turrets allows dialing for known distance. The SMRS is truly an Elite scope and will give shooters a true tactical advantage.

I have shot the gun 1 time other than that it has been sitting in my dresser in a Vedder holster (included) and I think it is time I let it go. I am/always have been a glock person and I bought this after shooting a friend of mine owns. I really dont need it so I am going to move along. I would prefer a trade since the money is already invested. I like Glocks and 1911 and Rifles / Shotguns. I am only interested in .40/.45 and 20/12 guage for shotguns. I paid $626.73 for the pistol and a warranty plus another $60 on the holster. So I vaule it somewhere in there. The warranty is transferable also. I am not interested in adding cash or accepting low balls. Either a straight sell. A straight trade or a trade plus cash on your end. Copy and Paste from Springfield:::The ideal concealed carry pistol would have all the features, performance and power you’d find in a full size handgun, but in a smaller package. The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack from Springfield Armory® does exactly that. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack.
The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack is a mid-sized single stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. The sub-compact frame extends to full size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine. Combined with the 4.0″ barrel, this gives you a pistol that’s ideal for a day at the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.
But the strengths of the XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with a flush fitting magazine, and you’ll find that your range pistol has shrunk into something that carries so easily that you’ll forget it’s there.
Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power or size. And you certainly don’t have to take a gun to the range that you’d rather not even shoot. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack  in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."
