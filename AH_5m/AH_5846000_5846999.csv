Multi-Coated Lenses The Vortex StrikeFire II Red Dot Scope was built with multi-coated lenses to increase light transmission. The Vortex StrikeFire allows you to be effective in low light environments especially with the night vision mode. 2. Anti-Reflective Coating The lenses have an anti-reflective coating to minimize glare, which helps keep you safe from detection and remaining stealth. 3. Parallax-FREE Design This Vortex StrikeFire II Red Dot Scope employs a parallax-free design that helps to eliminate parallax shooting error over 50 yards. This means you can use both eyes to acquire a target and shoot faster and more accurately at long distances. 4. Adjustable Brightness and Red Dot/Green Dot Intensity The Vortex StrikeFire IIhas easily adjustable brightness and red dot intensity on the left side of the riflescope. Brightness and intensity can easily be adjusted with your non-shooting hand. This feature makes it most effective and user-friendly while in action. 5. Automatic OFF feature (saves battery life) The scope is programmed with an automatic shutoff feature. It will shut down after a few hours if unused. This minimizes the occurrence of battery drains due to accidental activations. You also get to conserve battery life when outdoors. See below for full battery features. 6. Waterproof  & Fog Proof Inclement weather and change in temperatures can render a perfectly good scope, useless.  The Vortex StrikeFire Red Dot Scope is both water proof and fog-proof allowing you to be confident in your ability to shoot your weapon effectively regardless of the weather.  Never let inclement weather put a damper on your shooting fun.  Battery Life of the Vortex StrikeFire Red Dot Scope 6-hour auto-shutdown feature maximizes battery life When set on maximum brightness 130 hours (Red) | 420 hours (Green) When set on minimum brightness 4400 hours (Red) | 4700 hours (Green) Typical battery life in night vision mode: Maximum brightness of 7200 hours (Red) | 7200 hours (Green) When set on minimum brightness of 7600 hours (Red) | 8000 hours (Green)."

A full-length ejector rod shroud puts extra weight out front to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster sight acquisition on follow up shots. The single-action trigger pull on the 686 Plus is light and crisp for precise shooting; the double-action pull cycles the cylinder smoothly for rapid fire. The red-ramp front sight is pinned into an integral sight ramp, and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation.Comes with a box of Hornady .357 hollow point and RT IWB Suede Holster.
