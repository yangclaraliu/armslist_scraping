The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.This AUG uses the Steyr proprietary magazines.  Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax."

With a velocity of 2200 FPS, the Hornady 250 Grain SST/FT bullet in the .450 Bushmaster ""Thumper"" is designed for all large North American game. Accuracy has proved to be exceptional with felt recoil similar to a 20 gauge shotgun. Tubular aluminum forends allow the barrel to free float from the nut forward, and chrome lining in both bore and chamber makes for long barrel life and easy cleaning. This upper receiver assembly comes complete with a charging handle, forward assist, ejection port cover, bolt and bolt carrier assembly. The upper also features a versatile flat top for mounting optical devices or accessories. Includes a 10 round magazine.Technical InformationUpper Receiver Type: A3 Flat-TopBarrel Length: 20""Barrel Material: Chrome Moly SteelMuzzle Thread Pattern: 11/16""-24Chrome Lined: YesBarrel Finish: Black MatteTwist Rate: 1 in 24""Chamber: 450 BushmasterMuzzle Device: Izzy Muzzle BrakeHandguard: Free FloatExtras: 10-round magazine"

I have maybe 250 rounds through it, and am the first owner. It's a beast of a gun, but very manageable as far as controlling the powerful 10mm cartridge. The dual recoil springs in the Gen4 platform really shine in this caliber. I decided to part with this gun since I'm trying to consolidate calibers in the stable, and while a blast out on the range, 9mm and .45 are the two calibers that I'm sticking with. Not it willing to travel super far, so local is best. I won't ship it, must be face to face. Must not be a felon, CHL holders preferred, and there will be a bill of sale signed. May have some ammo around I could throw in, I'll have to check and see what I've got. Firm on the price. Gun retails for 680, and in GREAT shape, so I'm firm on price."

Despite the title 'Hammerless', the Model 1903 does have a hammer. It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allowed the pistol to be carried in and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging. In addition to lawful owners, many gangsters of the pre-World War II era favored the Model 1903 and Model 1908 because they were relatively small and easily concealed. It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh. Bank robber John Dillinger was carrying this model of pistol when he was shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph theater on July 22, 1934, and another famous bank robber, Willie Sutton had one when he was captured by police in Brooklyn on February 18, 1952."

Of the 150,000 pistols commissioned, approximately 137,000 were delivered before the war ended. Because the army delegated the branding to unit armourers, not all 9mm pistols carry the nine."

This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.        Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.         Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Some Electric Airsoft Rifles come with semi-automatic fire. That means that when you pull the trigger only 1 BB will come out at a time. Other Electric Airsoft Rifles come with full-automatic fire. This means that when you pull the trigger multiple BBs will come out at a time. The longer you hold the trigger down the more BBs come out. Check the description above to see which kind of gun this is and if it is right for you. Electric Airsoft Rifles don't require any pumping or cocking, just simply point and shoot. This is a High End Electric Airsoft Gun. Please only use .20 gram high quality BBs with this item in order to keep it in proper working order. Using anything else as ammunition for this gun will void the warranty and may cause it to jam. Also, to keep your Electric Airsoft Gun working properly, do not fire the gun when there are no BBs in it as it may cause damage to your gun. You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase this Airsoft gun."

It is right handed for the FN FNS-9 It is brand new because I sent away for it to be replaced after my first one had broken. They replaced it completely and it was a fantastic customer service experience. I am selling it simply because it is not quite the best match for me. I started using a Stealthgear because it worked better with my job requirements. You can contact me at eight 63 five 21 four 679. Text is preferred but calling is fine though my answering might be sporadic. Again, you are getting a brand new, never touched holster still in the manufacturer's bag. That's the reason for the pricing. I'm not looking to haggle. This is meant for someone who was wanting to buy one of these anyways and just didn't want to wait for their shipping delays. I am willing to ship anywhere but you will have to pay for the shipping and holster up front if you want to get it shipped. Armslist for whatever reason won't let me change the shipping box so ignore that it says no shipping."
