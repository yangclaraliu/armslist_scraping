For sale or trade, I have a mint condition Pre-Ban Daewoo K2 in 5.56x45mm NATO. These battle rifles were imported into the U.S. in the 80's and are becoming harder to find with every year that goes by.. I did a quick search on Armslist and GunBroker before listing this to get a persective on value, and could not find even 1 for sale! Although I did find listings for people looking to buy them... so here it is! The K2 is the civilian version of the select-fire K1 rifle, and it was sold stateside for a few years, before the assault weapons ban was put in place. This is not to be confused with the post-ban dr200 sporter rifle that came equipped with a keyhole stock. The easiest way to tell the difference ist that the authentic K2's have a bayonet lug mounted just forward of the sling swivel.. They are the ""original piston AR"" made by the South Korean government, and are still in service today with the S. Korean military..Imported by I.A. CO. SAC' TO, CA and listed as a 5.56 K2 with serial number 458###.. this is the sought after model. I've modded 2 things on this rifle... installed a AKG ACT trigger, and added a muzzle comp in place of the faux flash suppressor. Comes with original sling, original side-folding stock (which is second-to-none as far as side folders go!), and one Magpul 30rd Magazine. You will look for a very long time to find another K2 in this one's condition. The only items I may be interested in would be high-end AR's, m4's, FN SCAR, semi-auto .308 battle rifles (M1A or AR-10 style... DPMS or Armalite platform), and possibly some semi-auto pistols plus cash.  $2,000 - Make me an offer!"

There's alot of good aftermarket for it too and out of the box they are known as being more accurate than alot of other factory semi auto .22s, hence why I bought it. But I don't shoot it that often (really into milsurps currently) and would like to swap it for something different. Maybe even a different .22, scatterguns, milsurps, etc. I can put cash on top.

This is a rare gun and very difficult to come across, especially in the 3"" version. The gun is in very good condition cosmetically and mechanically. I have a Model 66 (357 Mag), 629 (44 Mag), 646 (40 S&W) and this gun. I shoot this one the best. It just has the best balance of power/size. Some of the original models (625-2) had some mechanical problems with a ""floating hand"" that could break. They fixed that problem with this model and that's why to most the 625-3 is the more desirable model even though it isn't the original variant of the gun. I don't know how many of these were made, I don't think anybody does, but it's safe to assume not many. The gun will come with moon clips and the box. I do not have the original paperwork with the box, but the box is original with the gun. I'm the 2nd owner of this gun and the gun has been shot. I don't know how much the original owner shot it but it's in very good condition so I'm guessing not very much. Any questions feel free to ask!Here are some more detailed pictures: http://imgur.com/a/BUssFHere is a description from a S&W Collectors Catalog:Model 625: The model of 1989 .45 Stainless. Calibers: .45 ACP or .45 Colt (not interchangeable). Double-action revolver built on the round butt N target frame with three screws. 6-shot fluted cylinder with a nominal length of 1.55"". Original introduction has 5"" full-lug barrel, later production with 3"" and 4"" barrel, round butt N Target frame with 10-groove serrated backstrap and forestrap with Pachmayr SN/GR grips, later changed to the Hogue monogrip, pinned serrated black ramp on rampe base front sight with micrometer click adjustable rear sight, .400"" semi-target hammer, .312"" smooth combat trigger, half moon clips, non-glare glass beaded matte finish.The authors are quite befuddled by varying information surrounding the introduction of this model. It’s not confusing enough that the first introduction of this model is a dash two (-2) model designation. Early variations will be found marked both “Model of 1988” and “Model of 1989,” this despite the fact that some information indicates 1989 introduction. We have come up with varying production quantities for both 1988 and 1989 variations, so have deleted quantities from this book until the matter can be clarified. Also we find that calibers seem to be mixed between engineering changes, thus creating further confusion. Looking at a Model of 1988 and a Model of 1989 specimen side by side, the following differences are observed: the 88 has roll stamped barrel marking while the 89 has etched; the 88 has a ramp front sight while the 89 has a Patridge. Beyond that, and of course the markings, they look about identical.Asking price: $1300"

The VP40 is the .40 S&W version of the very highly regarded VP9. Importantly, this VP40 is the better LE version that comes with TRUE DOT Tritium 3-Dot, Night Sights and (3) 13 round magazines (instead of 2 on the base model). The base VP40 comes with sights that have to be charged under a light and will glow for a little while but the Tritium sites glow without charge for years. The VP40LE retails for $819 and the base VP40 retails for $719. I am selling this for what would be a good deal even for the base model so my price is firm and I am not interested in any trades. I am not one of these guys on here listing firearms for more than you can buy them new at the gunshop. The pistol really is new and it really is a bargain- especially factoring in no transfer fee, taxes or shipping. If you see this ad, the pistol is still available. I take my ads down as soon as I sell something."

This one is a Colt 6920 upper with a C-marked Colt M4 upper receiver with T-markings and a Colt C-stamped 16"" Govt. Profile M4 5.56 barrel with the FSB removed and replaced with a railed gas block. It comes with flip up iron sights (the front sight is the correct gas block height), OD green M4 handguards and a Colt A2 flash hider. I kept the Colt BCG but it'll come with the PSA BCG that's in it now. It also has a real Aimpoint Comp M2 red dot (it has been repainted black because it had some wear but it works 100% and you can still read the original markings to confirm that it is 100% legit... because it is). The lower is just an Anderson Ar-15 lower receiver with an authentic Colt M4 stock. The stock has been krylon painted FDE and the grip has been Krylon painted the OD green. 
I'm fine with trading the whole gun as-pictured or trading just the upper, or the upper plus the Aimpoint or whatever. I'm just more or less curious what kind of trades roll in as I don't need this gun. Also, if you don't want the Colt upper recevier (because it does have quite a bit of cosmetic wear on it) I can swap it for an identical non-Colt receiver that has less wear and matches the finish of the Anderson lower a little better. Oh, and the Anderson lower is brand new."
