Almost same dimensions as the Shield, but with a very nice textured grip. Three-dot sights, but front sight is large orange dot, very easy to pick up when firing. Weighs 3 ounces more than the Shield, making for softer recoil. Nice pistol, but I just don’t care for striker-fired triggers, so it’s available. Check out on-line reviews, one of which says it’s “the best single-stack 9mm ever!""No shipping, no trading; will meet in/near Chattanooga."

$1,100 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.

Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

It has a 28"" ventilated rib barrell with screw in chokes. I was trying to help by being the first bidder on this shotgun at a Friends of NRA Banquet, and I was the only bidder. I have absolutely no need for this shotgun since I have plenty of Remington 870s. (I'm old school.)Beretta® designed the A300 Outlander Semi-Auto Shotgun, coated with Realtree MAX-5 Camo, specifically for waterfowl hunting. The MAX-5 coating reduces corrosion inherent to goose and duck hunting conditions, and blends in with cattails, reeds, cornstalks, and marsh grasses. Under field conditions, the A300 easily disassembles with no tools into 4 major components; and with a self-cleaning gas piston the A300 is the embodiment of a reliable, low-maintenance hunting shotgun. The Beretta Outlander features a synthetic stock that allows you to customize the drop and cast by means of spacers so you always have a Semi-Automatic Shotgun that fits right, points instinctively, and swings fluidly on fast moving targets. A reversible safety adapts the A300 for left- or right-handed shooters. A high-absorption recoil pad, coupled with the gas operating system reduces recoil and keeps you on target for fast follow up shots. Sling swivel posts on stock and forend cap allow for carrying the A300 slung on your shoulder while carrying decoys and gear. Beretta's A300 Outlander Shotgun is an affordable, well made Semi-Auto Shotgun that handles well and is comparatively lightweight. The Berretta A300 Outlander MAX-5 is made for waterfowl hunting, though with its sleek lightweight design it doubles for pheasant hunting, and your all-purpose semi-auto shotgun. The A300 shoots 2.75"" and 3"" shells interchangeably and uses Mobilechoke screw-in choke tubes. Made in USA.They are $799.99 (plus tax) at Cabelas or $779.99 (plus tax) at Bass Pro Shops. All I want to do is recover the money I have in this thing. I will take $725.00 for this new in box; never had a round chambered in it; incredibly awesome Beretta A300 Outlander 12 ga shotgun."

This bayonet meets all of the US Government specifications & design requirements, and then some. The handle is dual overmolded polymer with a soft texture and multiple gripping surfaces. It is comfortable in both forward and reverse grips. The color is Coyote Brown with Loam Green grip panels on each side. An index finger notch has been incorporated for additional grip security in wet or slippery situations. The blade measures 7.375"" and is made from the super rugged Camillus 0170-6C carbon steel. lt features a near full length double edge, with 2"" of serrations for extra cutting power on the primary edge. The double edge allows the weilder to cut in both directions while in combat, unlike the current single edge of the M9 bayonet. The sheath is just as remarkable; featuring the same duo molded technology and a noise reduction panel on the front. Reversable for right or left hand use, the sheath also features a built in sharpening hone for field maintenance of the knife's cutting edge. The polymer sheath also houses the removable wire cutters with two different types of cutters, one sheer type cuts razor ribbon, the other cuts chain-link or barbed wire, and it has a spade type screw driver on the end. A quick release Bianchi clip attaches the sheath to standard military web belts, and the entire system can quickly be detached using the integral side release buckle. The 1A1 XM8 Bayonet will fit all current standard US Military bayonet mounting hardware. General Specifications Blade Length:: 7.375"" (partially serrated) Overall Length:: 12.5"" Blade Steel:: 0170-6C Handle Material:: Polymer Sheath:: Polymer Weight: 13oz Box, documents and a silicone cloth are all present with this knife.

There's not a lot of love out there for the Remington 710's.

This particular rifle is in excellent condition and has no functionality issues nor rust. I upgraded to a .270, so I no longer have a use for this gun. I'd keep it becasue it is fun to shoot, but I would rather use it to get a firearm I haven't tried before."
