Features a fluted stainless steel Bergarra barrel, mossy oak ambi thumb-hole stock, and a 3-9x40 scope that has been mounted and sighted in at 100 yds. I believe the scope is a Konus, as that is what generally comes on CVA rifles. This rifle will shoot standard loads as well as magnum loads, which i used to sight it in. This rifle has one of the best triggers I have felt on a black powder gun. I am getting rid of it to make room in my gun safe. I left my hunt camp last year and have no further use for it.  

This will be my last price reduction! I am asking $225 or will trade for a quality pistol light/laser combo, ammo, knives, or a nice pelican rifle case. I will probably not budge much on the price as I have already done so. But offers dont hurt. I will likely take the first good offer I get, so first come first serve. Text is the best way to reach me, as I generally dont check emails during the day. If you have questions or are genuinely interested, please text me at 9o4 465 o812. Thanks and God bless."

Because it has the lowest bore axis in its class, its intuitive accuracy is unrivaled. The low bore axis also reduces muzzle rise by 25% for faster recovery between shots. Its Pederson block design and optimized grip angle work together to dramatically diminish felt recoil. With a 3.4” barrel and smooth, rounded edges, it conceals easily and deploys like lightning. And it all comes with a confidence-boosting 7+1 rounds of 9mm Luger.   Updated features include a precision-built fast-reset polymer trigger, a more aggressive and durable extractor design, enhanced recoil spring and a host of other features that make it the model of dependability.   KEY FEATURES Less muzzle rise and reduced felt recoil Light slide racking force Optimized grip angle and slim aluminum frame 9MM +P match-grade 3.4” barrel Light, smooth and crisp trigger Two semi-flush 7+1 magazines   Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales taxBuy this handgun online at www.copsgunshop.net."

IWI® Tavor SAR-B16 5.56 NATO / .223 Remington® Semi-automatic Rifle - Combining the convenience of a short rifle with the accuracy of a long rifle. A full-length top rail accepts all your favorite optics, and the high-impact polymer body is incredibly durable in all weather conditions-from the desert to the arctic. And it's fully ambidextrous, so anyone can operate it comfortably and efficiently.Bullpup configuration offers the convenience of a short rifle with the accuracy of a long rifleA2-style flash suppressorAmbidextrous configurationUses standard AR-15 magazinesAll-metal parts treated for corrosion resistanceRubber recoil padErgonomic design for ease of use and comfortHigh-impact polymer body for durability*Less than 200 rnds fired.
This Tavor has top of the line additons.Trigger - While the factory trigger is acceptable is somewhat heavy on the Tavor, you can take advantage of long range accuracy, quicker trigger speeds/follow up shots, and have the same nice feel of a high end rifle by up-grading your trigger.  This Tavor has been up-graded with the Geissele Triggerpack and Ligntning Bow Trigger.
The Geissele Super Sabra was born from the combat heritage of the SSA and is a drop in replacement for the OEM trigger pack. It is a precision two-stage trigger and allows precise and accurate trigger control. The Super Sabra’s two-stage design allows the trigger to be light enough for accurate and precise shots, but forgiving enough for close quarter combat (CQB). The Geissele Super Sabra also features an adjustable first stage, which will allow the shooter the ability to fine tune the first and second stage weight distribution, without compromising the total pull weight.  The Geissele Super Sabra's housing is precision CNC machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum and type 3 hardcoat anodized for a long lasting and durable finish. The Super Sabra internal components are of constructed ofshock and wear resistant S7 tool steel. A nitride process finish on the internal components allows further abrasion and chemical resistance.  Price $350.00
The Super Sabra Lightning Bow® Trigger is precision machined from precipitation hardened 17-4 and is designed to replace the standard trigger in IWI Tavor rifles. Once installed, the Sabra Lightning Bow is adjustable via a set screw that removes the “slack” that is inherently found in the trigger mechanism of those rifles. By removing the slack, the trigger pull is instantly transformed into a feel that is much more familiar to that of an M4 Carbine. Pairing the Sabra Lightning Bow with a Super Sabra Trigger Pack will result in a pull that is truly two stage and has a match grade feel.  Price $100.00With this platform being ambidexterious the ejection port can be on either side of the rifle.  The stock version has a plastic cover for the side not in use.  Gases can escape around this cover and do to the configuration vent in to the users face.  The solution, that has been installed on this rifle.  Gear Head Works FLEx stands for Fulcrum Located Extra swivel. It provides a centralized location for use with a single point sling or just an additional swivel location for a 2 point. It can be mounted on either side of a Tavor or X-95, with the swivel towards the front or rear of the rifle, replacing the plastic factory port cover. But its greatest feature may be that it also seals off the port from escaping gases that tend to leak out of the factory port cover. This phenomenon has become known as ""Tavor face"" and leaves you with black smudges on your cheek and shooting glasses, and is exacerbated with suppressor use. The GHW FLEx is truly a must have if you are running a suppressor on your Tavor.I'm selling this rifle with one of two options - A)  The EOTech XPS2 is the shortest, smallest and lightest EOTech model holographic weapon sight available without night vision. Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters and law enforcement officers to carry.  It is also fast and runs on a single 123 battery. The compact, single-lithium-battery configuration leaves more rail space than ever for rear iron sights or magnifiers.  The retail on this sight is just under $500.00.  I will also include the iron sites in the picture with the EOTech.  These sites are co-witnessed to align with the point of aim on the EOTech.B)  Bushnell TRS-25 HiRise Red-Dot Sight - This AR Optics series sight features a brightness-adjustable 3 MOA red dot that can be illuminated with 11 different brightness settings to meet the demands of ambient lighting conditions. The AR Optics series is configured with a built-in Weaver rail mount that is engineered for shock-resistant performance when correctly mounted atop an AR-style rifle. The unmagnified optics have multiple layers of Bushnell's Amber-Bright high contrast coating for enhanced image quality and improved target acquisition in low light. The 1/2 MOA point of impact adjustments and unlimited eye relief further equip the TRS-25 for the speed and accuracy needed from a tactical weapon system.  The retail on this site is around $100.00.One of the best features of this platform is the compact size.  I will also include a very nice and brand new carry case that is perfect for this setup.  The case is set up for hand carry or shoulder strap. There are multiple attachment points for strap adjustment.  It also has a good size pocket for accessories.  As pictured, the manual and cleaning kit will come with the case. Tavor - List Price around $1800.00Trigger Up-grade - $450.00EoTech - List Price around $500.00Total price for the Tavor as described with EOTech sight - $2750.00.  Willing to take $2500.00. If you want the Bushnell Red-Dot instead of the EOTech and iron back-up sites, I'll take $2000.00.Price is firm.  I don't want to trade unless you have a Harley Davidson you would like to talk with me about."

AS IS. Price:  $250**Harvey Special**Inventory # : G-1004771-1 Manufacturer: HARR & RICH Model: 1871 Caliber: 12 GAUGE Barrel: 21INFUN FACTS: The name says it all. The H&R Pardner Pump Protector wasn’t built for wing-shooting doves or busting clay pigeons. No, this is a gun to be kept at the bedside, ready for behavior modification on bad people who want to go bump in the night. Loaded with up to six rounds of 2 ¾” or 3” shot, its twelve gauge bite is even worse than its thunderous bark, and that says a lot.   This H&R shotty is crafted in China by Qiqihar Hawk Industries Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China North Industries Corporation. Commonly referred to as Norinco, most gun fanciers know China North Industries as a major producer of inexpensive SKS and AK-pattern rifles. Hawk confines itself to making shotguns, including a slew of clones of the classic Remington 870 sold under the H&R name. Oh, and H&R is an affiliate of Remington, which is part of the Freedom Group, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Got that? Thus, the H&R/Hawk alliance reflects the modern era where money-loving American capitalists and money-grubbing Chinese communists come together like lions and lambs to sing “Cumbayá” and peddle inexpensive defensive firearms to a grateful American public. The deal twixt the two companies might not be Mao Zedong’s idea of a Great Leap Forward, but the rest of us can enjoy one of the fruits of this cross-cultural incest: the H&R Pardner Pump Protector."

Trijicon 2200005 TRJ 1x25 mro 2.0 MOA Adj Red dot sight - Only $493.00! The Trijicon Miniature Rifle Optic (MRO®) is a reflex-style, sealed sight intended for use on rifles, carbines, and shotguns to provide fast target acquisition. It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness.   The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot.   The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments.   The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools.   Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions.Lucid HD7 Gen III Red Dot Sight - $249.00 In the past few years the HD7 Red Dot sight from LUCID has been battle proven and tested in the very capable hands of Law Enforcement and Military professionals. While we believe in the old adage, “If it’s not broke, don’t fix it,” it was time to make a set of customer requested improvements to the HD7 and introduce the Generation III unit. These improvements include capped turrets, a new reticle set with more capabilities for the operator built in and the availability of a Kill Flash accessory. We also have upgraded the buttons to be more durable and the light sensor is nearly twice as sensitive as previous versions. As with the original version of the HD7, you don’t have to compromise with the GEN III HD7. At LUCID we recognize that no two shooting situations are ever the same. We feel your optic should be able to provide functional feature benefits to assist in most situations. The HD7 has been designed from the ground up to be a strong, reliable optic that offers the most in operator selectable features and benefits that exceed the market standards at a price that is friendly to the wallet.
