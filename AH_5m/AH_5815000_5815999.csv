These guns have absolutely zero recoil when shooting and are perfect for beginner shooters or even someone that wants to hone their skills, not to mention in today's world fairly cheap to shoot. Also an excellent gun to qualify/test with for concealed carry licenses. I have added and or subtracted a few things to make this gun even better.

I have a couple of these and love them they are a great plinker guns and obviously easy to shoot. Great for target shooting or even carrying if you prefer a smaller caliber. These guns have absolutely zero recoil when shooting and are perfect for beginner shooters or even someone that wants to hone their skills, not to mention in today's world fairly cheap to shoot. Also an excellent gun to qualify/test with for concealed carry licenses. I have added and or subtracted a few things to make this gun even better. I have my other ones built the same so decided to do the following...1. Deleted the magazine safety (gun will now fire as a ""normal"" 1911 should) so chambered round can be discharged WITHOUT the magazine being loaded in gun2. Aftermarket Recoil Buffer Pad3. Aftermarket Extended Magazine Plunger (Mag conversion from 10 rnd to 15 rnd hi capacity)FYI: This gun also has threaded barrel to accommodate accessories!!!

I have less than 20 rounds through her, which is part of why I'm putting her up for sale. I don't get her out enough. I haven't found time to get her out to a range where I can shoot past 100m, and I'm buying a car, so I could use the extra money.  My loss is your gain!The M&P10 has ambidextrous fire controls, mag release, and bolt catch/release. It runs on standard sr25 magazines, of which I have one; made by magpul.One of the nice things about the M&P10 is that it fires .308 but uses parts from the 5.56 M4s. Trigger groups, buttstock, handgrips, rails, etc are all swap-able.Right now, she's equipped with a Magpul ACS-L buttstock and front and rear Folding Battle Sights from Troy Industries. The rifle alone is worth approximately $1450 new at Vance's, and is out of stock. The sights are worth $93(rear) and $77(front), and the buttstock costs $80. So I have about $1730 in the rifle as it stands.I am willing to let her go as is for $1600.  Since I can always take the sights and buttstock off, if you'd like to work on the price a little, I'm happy to work with you.Please contact me with any questions or to see more pictures!"

The magazines holds 14 cartridges, and the gun originally came with 2, but I was lucky enought to add a 3rd magazine.  I never used a suppressor on this gun.  I do have mixed emotions about selling this great gun because I believe every serious collector should  own at least one.  Although I am not an FFL dealer, I will only send the gun to an FFL dealer to finalize the sale.  I am not interested in trades or layawys.  There is nothing wrong with this gun.The gun is being sold AS IS.  Buyer should contact the seller at REDACTED.  I will accept credit cards but will charge a 3% uptick to cover processing fees. Under no conditions will the gun be sent until after the funds have been cleared.  I will not ship outside the continental U.S..  Finally, I charge a $35.00 mailing and insurance charge in addition to the sales price."

I have also upgraded the mainspring to the Wilson Combat 16# ""D"" spring, which improves DA trigger pull dramatically, with no light strikes in DA or SA. The original grips and mainspring are included, as well as the factory box, papers, and two 13-round factory magazines.This has about as much kick as a 4"" revolver shooting 38 specials. Every part of the action is buttery-smooth. Racking the slide feels like it's on glass. The gun is thoroughly clean, lightly lubed, and ready for a range visit.  This isn't an absolutely perfect specimen, it has been very lightly used and shot, but it has been obsessively well cared for.Price: $650Need to meet in the Noblesville/Fishers area.

Looking for offers of cash/partial trade. Looking to get $2500 for it, but at least $2000.00 of it has to be in cash. I got this gun after my grandfather passed away and it has been in the zippered case with silica gel, ever since. This has been inspected in full by a gunsmith and his exact words were ""Don't waste your money. It does not even look like he ever fired it."" He says that because it is a blued finish and the cylinder has not a mark from being turned. But I told him to do it anyway and let me know about any issues with it. He gave it back to me the next day and said the only issue was that it wasn't his. He is funny like that. So IF I had the box for this, I would be holding on to it and taking it to the Tulsa Gun Show coming up and since I have monitored Gunbroker and watched 3 of them in similar condition go for over $3500.00, asking $3200.00 for it. However I have no box (looked) so I am willing to drop the price all the way down to $2500.00, but my price is firm. So if you contact me please keep that in mind. I know most of you are intelligent enough to know better than to say ""Hey will you take $500.00?, but there are some super idiots out there. I have seen them.So if you are going to offer something besides the cash minimum, please let me know what you have. More interested in handguns than rifles, but if you have a Henry or something nice and unique; I would be interested in that as well.I look forward to hearing from you. I will be willing to ship the firearm for anyone out of state that is interested. I have a very nice method on how to handle everything if you need to ship a trade item, so don't let that discourage you. My neighbor offered me $2000.00 cash and a Ruger 10/22 Takedown with a very nice scope. That is the standing offer. Pretty much, first offer of cash and a handgun is going to take it at that point (as long as I am interested in it)Thanks for reading my posting. Very much appreciated."

Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Purchased new at Buds last month- never fired, pristine, and still nestled gently in the box- just the way the Germans intended. If you look closely you can see the factory grease- every time you see it an angel gets it wings. Probably. Ambi safety/decocker make this equally functional for left or right handed shooters. Secondly- full sized USP 40. Excellent condition but this one has been shot some. Lovingly shot but shot all the same. Will come with the box, 5 factory magazines, a leather Yaqui holster, and all parts to convert to the LEM trigger set up if desired. Gun is currently v1 with safety/decocker setup for a right handed shooter. Conversion was done by a local HK fetishist/gun smith and was done right. Both guns are up for sale or trade- will sell one or both; they don't have to go as a package. I am especially interested in a Tavor, PS90, quality ARs, high end 1911s, as well as other HKs, Sigs, etc. I have cash/ammo/other guns to add to a trade if it's something I like we can certainly make a deal.
