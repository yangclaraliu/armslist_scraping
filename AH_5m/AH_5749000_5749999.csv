There were only 1350 12 ga Pigeon grade shotguns made and far far fewer with an extra matched set of barrels. Additional features that add to the rarity is that it is equipped with ejectors and the Hunter One (single) Trigger. The receiver still shows most if not all of it's fine engraving. Most of the case colors have faded. There is still a little on the water table and on the upper tang under the lever. At some point it was it was subject to some heavy handed gunsmithing. A few of the screw slots are buggered and there are a few marks on the edges where the lock plates fit in the receiver. The deluxe French walnut stock may have had some finish applied at some point. The LOP is 13 7/8"" to the end of the pad. It may have been ordered with a short stock. The butt end of the wood is still curved and doesn't look like it has been cut. the spacer and pad have been added. There is a fine hairline crack starting at the back end of each lock plate at about the 10:00 position traveling back, up and around to the end of the upper tang. It is much easier to see on the left side than the right. The lock up is tight with both barrels and the lever rests right of center when closed. Barrel set number 1 is 30"" Chainette Damascus choked full and full. It retains 90 to 95% of the bold Damascus pattern. There are just a few rub/fade areas, mostly at the camber end and around the muzzle. The bores are excellent. Very shiny no rust or pitting. The left is perfect the right has one very small dent. The chambers are bright with a small amount of rough area. The splinter style for end has a few dents on the wood edge, one fairly substantial. It has an ivory center bead and a brass bead at the muzzle. Barrel set number 2 are 28"" Nitro Steel choked Modified and Improved.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System™ The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded Chamber Indicator The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip Safety All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. Fail-Safe Disassembly The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol. Secure Grip Texture The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure. Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.   Springfield Armory XDS .45ACP  MFR# XDS93345BE    CALIBER .45 ACP CAPACITY 5 + 1 RDS WEIGHT 21.5 oz.

Very reliable, zero failures, This Sig has upgraded Trijicon HD high visabiity night sights ($130 upgrade). I will also include a Stealthgear Appendix IWB holster ($80), and a Sticky holster ($25). The P938 is basically a mini 1911, just like the Sig P238 (.380). Sightly larger than the P238 (can't reall tell unless you see them side by side), but has a bit more punch than the P238 via being chambered in 9mm Luger cartridge. Small pistol with the punch of a larger framed gun makes it an awesome conceal carry sidearm. I prefer to cash out on this gun, but wil entertain trade offers. Cash price is firm at $650 for all. Below are some things I would seriously consider in trade."

They are very hard to find on the internet anymore, folks just don't want to get rid of them. It 22lr with sporter/hunting stock, lighter but not light barrel (rifle and scope are about 5.5-6 pounds, this is a REAL GUN)  I have 1 Anschutz 5 round clip and 2 Savage 5 round clips. New unmounted Nikon Prostaff Rimfire II 4x12x40 scope in box. There are scope mounts but no rings with this sale. $600 firm.The gun over all is in excellent shape. There are several small hard earned hunting dings and light scratches on the stock, nothing serious, most of them are like what you could do with your fingernail pushing down. Overall finish is great except one section about 1.5 inches on the bottom of forearm as pictured. I bought this gun 15 years ago and it was a ""safe queen"" from the seller. I am guessing a mid 90's manufacture but don't know for sure. I bought the gun when I moved to Alaska in '03 and used it for Ptarmigan hunting. We hunt Ptarmigan from snowmobiles in spring when they come down from the mountains to the tundra. The forearm marks are from resting it on the ""snowgo"" windshield. Wood is undameged. Bluing over all is at least 97%. There is a new mark (I am embarresed to say I did when putting iron sights back on) right under the rear sight about 1/6"" x1/16"" and two smaller marks about 1/16 x 1/32 (bluing intact) on the other side of the rear sight. All bluing is solid, no rust or frekles aywhere that I can see bore is bright and crisp. This is not a ""safe queen"" but rather a good, solid tack driving hunting or target shooting 22lr. Thiis is a solid REAL rifle and would make the perfect first gun for a kid or a welcomed addtion to anyone's hunting collection. I hate to sell it but trying to clean out the gun safe of ones I donuse any more and I simply don't need it. My daughter doesn't shoot so can't really pass it down, so I will let someone enjoy a quality 22lr. You will have to pay over $1,000 for a new one IF you can find one. this one with a NEW scope I'll let go for $600 plus shipping. This is a more than fair price for a super quality gun so price is FIRM. It will sell eventually and am in no hurry so no offers please. Will ship to your FFL for $35 USPS priority. Rifle and Scope will be shipped in a Savage factory box and shipping box If the rifle is picked up locally I have over 250 rounds of Lapua Center X match ammo (all same batch number) and a box or two of Wolf Match extra about 150 or so rounds of CCI subsonic that I will let go for a steal"

Dual Use  Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting.
