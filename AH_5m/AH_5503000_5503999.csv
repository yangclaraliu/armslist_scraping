About 14 pounds with the scope.  It would make a great foundation for long range shooting.  Comes with 2 AI 10 round magazines.  Also comes with a box of 168 grain federal gold match, a box of 150 grain sp for deer and about 15 rounds of handloads that I built just for this rifle.Will also include dies, 100+ brass and some primersI have over 2500 in the rifle so i feel the asking price is very reasonable."

This gun looks as if it has seen slight use. It is rendered in USFA’s Rodeo Matte Blue finish and presentation and checkered US black synthetic composite grips. This model is not just for looks or occasional use but was also designed to be used by Cowboy Action Shooting (SASS) enthusiasts in shooting competitions. Its Matte Blue finish reduces sun glare that a polished finish throws off and the checkered grips help the shooter maintain a solid non-slip grip while handling the gun. This gun is like new in box and was made by USFA, which is now out of business. In the opinion of many collectors, writer/reviewers, and enthusiasts, these  reproduction single action revolvers made by USFA are the acknowledged “best in class” of the Colt style reproduction manufacturers, including Colt itself, as well as Uberti and other high end repro manufacturers. USFA SAA revolvers are celebrated for their unparalleled adherence to original model 1873 and later model specs, exceeding even first generation Colt originals for quality and detail. In addition, this revolver has been ""slicked up"" by Long Hunter Shooting Supply making an already excellent pistol even better. Also has the low profile hammer for faster target acquisition.

There is zero wear on it. If you want more pictures contact us . We are on line at ChiTowntactical.com This info was taken from A.G. Russell website. The A. G. Russell™ Dozier Combat Folder is the most quietly intimidating tactical folder I have ever seen. It reeks of menace and yet it folds into the trouser pocket. This is a pure Dozier design with the exception of the flipper, which I added. The handle is Beta Titanium and the massive armor piercing Wharncliffe blade is Bohler D2 at 60 Rc. It will function as a sturdy folding camp knife, suitable for all-around outdoor use and it is undoubtedly one of the best designed and executed tactical folders that I have ever seen.
The Dozier tab lock system serves as the lock and replaces the stop pin to assure that the blade stops in the correct position when it is opened. The Dozier locking tab is Ti6Al4V Titanium alloy. Each handle side measures just over 3/16"" thick and the overall handle thickness is just over 1/2"". The 4-3/4"" blade is 0.145"" thick German D2. The conventional pocket clip or the deep pocket (both provided) can be positioned for right or left hand, tip up or tip down carry. Measures 5-3/4"" closed and weighs 8.6 oz.

If you want to know how a $1,000.00 handgun should look and function, this is it! This is BY FAR, the most aesthetically pleasing and finely crafted handgun that I have ever owned; the fit and finish are impeccable. Once I zeroed it at 25 yards, I was able to shoot same-hole groups while standing offhand at 15 yards. Even while using full-power 158-grain magnum loads, recoil was negligible due to the weapon's superb balance and tapered-lug 5-inch barrel. To be clear, I do not NEED to sell this handgun; however, I enjoyed shooting it so much that I am getting its snub-nosed (2.62"") variant for concealed carry and I cannot justify two similarly priced handguns of the same model and caliber. Although I would love to attempt CC'ing this beast in a shoulder rig, it is simply untenable given this weapon's length. This handgun retailed for $1,289.00, minus shipping and FFL transfer; therefore, I will accept $850.00 for the weapon. Comes with original paperwork, cablelock, Hogue monogrip (N-frame), and Performance Center case. Must have valid and current NC purchase permit or CCL. If outside of NC, will ship to FFL of your choice; thank you."

I am the original and sole owner.The rifle is missing its original charging handle, and I have replaced it with one that I mocked up, as you can see in the photos. The replacement functions exactly like the original -- there's no play in it and it's comfortable to use. I also have additional long machine screws to fit the bolt so you can make your own version with plastic or metal standoffs if you want.Condition:The bore is in immaculate condition, but I was unable to get a good photo of it. There is a small patch of minor pitting on the top of the barrel where the metal is first exposed. It's very difficult to see in person. There's some finish wear on the barrel where it meets the red sliding safety indicators, and some wear on the ends of the disassembly pins. Other than that, there's not really any wear or cosmetic problems to speak of.The case (not pictured) is in good, functional condition. It shows plenty of use, including some damage to the foam inside, but is fully functional. I actually have been using it for lots of other smaller guns when I am not taking the G22 to the range.History:The gun has around 3000 rounds through it. Bulk ammo works well. I have had good luck with many different types of .22 LR. Early on, it didn't like Remington Golden Bullet, but either it ""broke in"" or Remington changed their ammo, because it seems to run fine with it now. Several months after buying the gun, I sent it off for repair because the trigger bar (connecting the trigger back to the sear) was able to bend too much, causing a ""squishy"" trigger. Smith and Wesson replaced the part and sent it back much better. I haven't had a problem with it since.Overall, the gun handles and operates very well and is amazingly accurate for a semi-auto. The main negative is that it's a pain to take apart to clean (similar to a Ruger Mark 2 or 3 in annoyance level). The good news is that a bore snake and an external wipe-down is really all that's necessary 90% of the time. The gun tolerates lots of internal dirt and fouling.I'd recommend the gun for any bullpup enthusiasts or for rimfire action competitions, due to its handling characteristics and super-short overall length.Asking $325 for everything. Other offers considered, but I'm in no hurry to sell the rifle, so don't waste your time with a low-ball offer. No trades.Pick up in Cary is GREATLY preferred. If you need it shipped, you'll need to add the cost of shipping and the outgoing FFL fee, which I would estimate at $55 total. I'll also need a picture or scan of your driver's license, regardless of delivery method.Thanks for looking!"

Has a very small CAI import mark on the side.  Very smooth rifle and great shooter!  Its chambered in 7.5x54 French and eats everything I've ever fed it whether it be Privi factory ammo or hand loads in a wide spread of different loads.  I receiver the rifle and found the front left sight ear had been broken off during shipping, but I've enjoyed it and shot it without and you can still aim just fine.  I did get the replacement part (which will be included) to get it fixed, but found no gunsmiths in the area who made me feel like they knew what they were doing.  Who knows, maybe the loop (also included) can be silver soldered or welded back on, but as I said, it has no affect of any functionality of the rifle. Bore is great and shoots accurately.  Makes quite a lot of noise as well!  Looking to get $375 + actual shipping out of it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!"
