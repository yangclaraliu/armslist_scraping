It is in good working shape but does have holster wear on it.  Approx 200-300 rounds through it.  It is my ranch gun I use for fixing fence among other things and mainly sat in a Blackhawk nylon holster hence the wear. I replaced the original grips with Magpul FDE MOE TSP Panels. I am selling it because I bought a Para Black Ops and I don't need two 1911s.  Comes with the box, original warranty card that hasn't been submitted to Armscor, 4 Chip McCormick 8RD magazines with removable base pads and 50 RDS of Federal American Eagle 230 GR ball ammo.  This gun is 100% reliable with ball ammo as long as it is oiled but I do not know about JHP ammo as I have never shot them in it. I cleaned both the gun and the magazines in an ultrasonic cleaner prior to listing it and Rem Oiled the gun when I reassembled it.  Price is firm, cash only, must sign bill of sale.  I can deliver to Great Falls. If you have any questions please let me know."

Pack is very comfortable and well made, like all of Eberlestock's stuff. Nothing but positive reviews for this pack all across the internet. Great pack for day hunts, or if you pack light you can head out for a couple days. This thing'll do its part to pack out an entire elk quarter if you've got the muscles to match. Asking $180 cash for what is a brand new and unused pack in off the shelf condition. Only the pack is for sale, not the guns. Sorry. Feel free to shoot me an email with questions.
FIELD TEST: We field test the X2 with a 100 lb. bag of sand attached to the pack by wrapping the X2's built-in compression straps around it. This pack will carry a serious load, like an elk quarter, just by banging it onto the front of the pack with 4 quick buckles.
 
SUSPENSION: A full mesh back panel, with pads in the essential places, is separated from the main pack by a big air gap. This is a cool-wearing, tight riding little pack that has more capabilities than any book bag you'll ever find.
 
POCKETS & STORAGE: The X2 opens its wings to unveil two tuck pockets inboard of the zippered hydration pockets. These are perfect for stowing a spotting scope and tripod, or other items you'll want quick access to.
 
MULTI FUNCTIONS: At the bottom of the pack is the FlexChassis, ready to flip forward to use as a seat, or to cradle the bottom of a load that you strap to the front of the pack with its oversized compression straps.
 
ULTIMATE CONVENIENCE: X-project packs are designed for the hunter that wants light and fast mobility. Whether you're a bow hunter or a gun hunter, once you've discovered the ability to move with your hands free from carrying your weapon, it'll change the way that you think about hunting."

LMR made the best barrels that the M1 Garand has ever seen...and if you do some research on the IH M1 Garand, it really has an interesting history. I have it listed under Springfield Armory (SA) because IH wasn't available on the drop box, by the way.The rifle is in excellent condition, with the exception of the original LMR barrel showing throat wear that almost swallows the bullet during the ""bullet-test"" (I dont' have a gauge at home)--that said, I've fired this rifle several times at an indoor 50 yard range and it is spot-on for accuracy and functionality.I have stripped the full rifle and from everything I can tell, it is 100% original (which explains why the barrel was never replaced) which is pretty darn cool. I can send you as many pictures as you like from my phone/email.Caliber is your standard 30 cal (30-06), and the rifle comes 2 USGI metal cans of original ammo. 1st one is USGI Korean War era marked ammo with a bunch of loose rounds (not sure exact amount, probably over 100 rds. 2nd is WW2 era USGI ammo can with the original repackaging slip from the ammo depot, dated as filled in 1940, and all the ammo is on the original cloth belt for quick loading onto the US Browning .30 cal Machineguns if needed.All rounds are in great condition and you can still hear the powder shake easily inside, test fired a few hundred from the Korean War marked can, all flawlessly fired. The 1940 can is full (250 rds on the original cloth belt). The rifle has very little external wear. No parts aside from LMR and IH from as far as I can tell with a total strip of the rifle. The rifle DOES still have the cartouch on the bottom of the trigger-hand grip, something that I've read typically wears away with use, but hey, mine is still intact so that's awesome. The rifle also comes with an exact reproduction leather 1903 sling and an exact reproduction heavy cloth/nylon sling, both appropriate for the rifle in the WW2 and post-WW2 era. I also have an exact reproduction Olean, NY full-size bayonet for the rifle. I have a ton of pictures that I can send upon request from my phone or from my email."

Pack is very comfortable and well made, like all of Eberlestock's stuff. Nothing but positive reviews for this pack all across the internet. Great do-all pack to get you and your gear where you need to go. This thing'll do its part to pack out as much gear as your muscles can match. Asking $180 cash for what is a brand new and unused pack in off the shelf condition. Only the pack is for sale, not the guns. Sorry. Feel free to shoot me an email with questions.
FIELD TEST: We field test the X2 with a 100 lb. bag of sand attached to the pack by wrapping the X2's built-in compression straps around it. This pack will carry a serious load, like an elk quarter, just by banging it onto the front of the pack with 4 quick buckles.

 

SUSPENSION: A full mesh back panel, with pads in the essential places, is separated from the main pack by a big air gap. This is a cool-wearing, tight riding little pack that has more capabilities than any book bag you'll ever find.

 

POCKETS & STORAGE: The X2 opens its wings to unveil two tuck pockets inboard of the zippered hydration pockets. These are perfect for stowing a spotting scope and tripod, or other items you'll want quick access to.

 

MULTI FUNCTIONS: At the bottom of the pack is the FlexChassis, ready to flip forward to use as a seat, or to cradle the bottom of a load that you strap to the front of the pack with its oversized compression straps.

 

ULTIMATE CONVENIENCE: X-project packs are designed for the hunter that wants light and fast mobility. Whether you're a bow hunter or a gun hunter, once you've discovered the ability to move with your hands free from carrying your weapon, it'll change the way that you think about hunting."
