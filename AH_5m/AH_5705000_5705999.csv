Pistol shows a little bit of wear on the barrel near the muzzle, this is typical of any semi auto pistol where the slide moves back and forth. Has never been holstered, in fact don't own a holster for it, it has always just been a range toy. As you can see from the pics I have the box, manual and factory goodies. It has two 10 round mags, and extra O rings for the barrel, a key, and an extra back strap. I have never changed the back strap. The only thing missing is the lock, I most likely gave that away, it is missing, just wanted to mention it.  It has been 100% with anything I have fed it, NEVER steel cased ammo. It has mostly had ball ammo with a box or two of hollow points. This one has the Glow in the dark sights once activated with sun light or a flash light they will glow for a few hours, they are not true night sights. For me this has been a very nice range toy, not a home or self defense pistol, although it would be great in that role. It has the ""Hostile Environment"" finish on the slide and other metal parts.   I will need to see a valid IN DL and a LTCH, no info recorded, just want to make sure you are a proper person.I carry a receipt book for those that may want a receipt.If the ad is up, then yes I still have it, I will only meet in day light hours in a public place.

This is an amazingly accurate long range hunting or sniper rifle for an even more amazingly reasonable price. The rifle has under 60 rounds through it and has been to an indoor range only twice.  The first range trip I zeroed it and the second I spent maybe 2 hours sinking .50 inch groups at 100 yards from a bench rest. Other than that, it has been sitting in my safe well lubed and untouched. It is immaculate with no signs of wear. This rifle will make a great deer hunting rifle or SHTF sniper rifle. I have included all the factory paperwork, box, child lock, and a sling.  As to why I am selling it, I have plenty of 30 caliber rifles and I simply don't have a need for it anymore at this point. Like the rest of you, I am trying to make more room in my safe.These rifles are currently running $370 - $390 on Bud's Gun Shop, Gunbroker, and Cheaper than Dirt websites.

This is not an SBR.
It has a 10.5"" barrel and is chambered in 5.56 with a 1/7 twist. I've put around 500 rounds through it without any malfunctions whatsoever. The muzzle device is a clone of the Noveske KX3 meant to redirect blast forward and away from the shooter. This 10.5"" pistol has less concussion than a 16"" with a compensator and is very comfortable to shoot. The gas system is carbine length, and the barrel is industry standard 4150 melonited chrome moly vanadium. The quadrail has an endcap installed, and I've also got an A2 birdcage flash hider if you want to make the package as short as possible. The irons sights are Magpul MBUS and they were zeroed by my Army friend. The red dot is not included. The side rail covers are authentic Knight's Armament panel covers. The top rail cover is a standard ergo rubber ladder cover. The bolt carrier group and the lower receiver are both mil-spec Palmetto State Armory, and I colorfilled the lower with high temp enamel. The lower parts kit and trigger are Mil-Spec PSA as well. The charging handle has been upgraded with an extended latch. The buffer tube assembly is the steel setup from KAK specifically designed for the Shockwave Blade arm brace. Mounted to the Shockwave Blade is the Command Arms SST1 cheek saddle. It is securely mounted and allows you the rest your cheek comfortably. The front QD socket mount is from Magpul, and the endplate QD mount is from Impact Weapons Components up in Loveland. It is ready to run a sling with QD attachments either as single or dual point. The sling isn't included. The Shockwave Blade and SST1 cheek saddle setup works very well and far outperforms the Sigbrace. I will include paper copies of the 3 relevant ATF letters regarding the Shockwave Blade, the SST1 cheek saddle, and AR pistol usage. 
This is a fantastic truck gun, home defense gun, or just fun range toy. It shoots very well and I'm sad to see it go. The build is one of a kind."

Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece.

Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does.

So Leupold engineers developed Multicoat 4, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You'll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold's Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.Quantum Optical SystemLeupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold's newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.Generous EyeboxThe generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.Lockable Fast-Focus Eyepiece3:1 Zoom Ratio1/4 MOA Finger ClickFinger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).Tactile Leupold SelectorProprietary Nitrogen Fill ProcessOne inch Maintube6061-T6 Aircraft Quality AluminumDurable Lens CoverKeep the lenses of your Leupold riflescope looking like new.

So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.2nd Generation Argon/Krypton WaterproofingWhile we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.One inch MaintubeTactile Power SelectorSpecificationsActual Magnification: Low: 1.5x, High: 3.9xLinear Field of View (ft/1000 yd): Low: 73.00 ft., High: 29.30 ft.Eye Relief (in): Low: 4.1 in., High: 3.7 in.weight (oz): 9.6 oz.Objective Clear Aperture (in): 0.8 inElevation Adjustment Range: 125.0 moaWindage Adjustment Range: 125.0 moa"

The Quantum Optical System is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max design software and evaluation using Leupold's Zygo Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk Leupold's when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.Index Matched Lens SystemA Leupold exclusive, this system has nearly perfected Leupold's already impeccable light management. Leupold engineers specify different coating materials for each lens surface in the riflescope, based on the lens index of refraction, placement and function, layering each coating to eliminate reflections and maximize light transmission. The result is unparalleled brightness and extremely sharp resolution across the entire visual field.DiamondCoatThis coating on the exterior lenses gives you the ultimate in abrasion resistance and light transmission. The result is a flawless sight picture over a lifetime of hard use. DiamondCoat has made a difference in battle; now it can make a difference where you hunt.2nd Generation Argon/Krypton WaterproofingWhile Leupold still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen technology pioneered by Leupold Select models feature Leupold's exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside Leopold's scope even more than Leupold's proven nitrogen technology already does. Leupold pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we're exceeding the standards Leupold set Leupold's.Lead FreeLeupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.Generous EyeboxThe generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get Leopold's eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high Leupold, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight picture that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.FireDot IlluminationSelect models are available with Leupold's exclusive FireDot Reticle System in Leopold's choice of FireDot Duplex, FireDot Circle, Ballistic FireDot, FireDot LR Duplex, FireDot 4, FireDot Pig Plex, FireDot TMR and FireDot SPR. Once activated, the dot within the reticle illuminates with bright, sharp definition, while the rest of the reticle is non-illuminated. This combination leads Leopold's eye naturally to the center aiming point and makes target acquisition quick, precise, and simple.Blackened Lens EdgesBlackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.Twin Bias Spring Erector SystemOne Turn, Extended Range FocusThe one-turn, non-locking eyepiece accommodates a wider spectrum of visual acuity, even in diminishing light. Near-sighted, far-sighted, or anywhere in between, adjusting the focus of the reticle is smooth, fast, and precise. An Alumina rubber eyepiece guard is included with select models.3:1 Zoom RatioMST (Motion Sensor Technology)An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to 'stand-by mode after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (weed by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.1/4 MOA Finger ClickFinger click adjustments for windage and elevation (MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments 1 cm per click).Extended Battery Life30mm MaintubeTactile Leupold Selector6061-T6 Aircraft Quality AluminumSpecifications: Linear Field of View (ft/100 yd): Low 75 ft., High 29 ft.Eye Relief (in): Low 4.1 inches, High 3.7 inchesweight (oz): 11.5 oz.Objective Clear Aperture (mm): 20 mmElevation Adjustment Range: 90 MOAWindage Adjustment Range: 90 MOA"

Just follow the steps below or give us a call and we will be happy to walk you through the entire process. What paperwork will I need to legally register a suppressor? There are two main methods for registering your suppressor:   Registration using a “Trust” (easiest method)   Registration in your name   Option 1 Registration using a “Trust”   Set up your trust   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out your Form 4 and Mail in your $200 payment to ATF   Sit back and relax because you are done!   It will cost approximately $100 more to buy using the trust method, but it will save a ton of time and provide a great deal more flexibility than an individually registered suppressor. There are many advantages to using a trust for registering a suppressor.  Some of these advantages include:   more than one person (family or friends) can legally use the suppressor if they are listed on the trust   one trust can be used for multiple suppressors   trusts can be modified to add or remove people without approval from the ATF   most importantly you DO NOT have to get fingerprint cards or your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on the purchase.  These benefits will save a lot of time and hassle down the road.   There are many places you can go online or locally to download a Trust to be used for registering your suppressor. Here are a few examples which range in price from $99 - $129:   http://199trust.com/   http://www.thefirearmlawyers.com/   http://www.guntrust.com/   Option 2 Registration to an individual   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out Form 4 and $200 payment for ATF   Obtain 2 Passport Photos   Obtain Chief Law Enforcement Officer Sign Off (Must be in the county you are a resident in)   Two copies of fingerprint cards (FBI form FD-258)   Complete Certificate of Compliance – ATF Form 5330.20   This is a less expensive method for registering your suppressor since you will not have to pay the $100 for a trust to be set up. However, you will be the sole owner of the suppressor and will have to be present any time the suppressor is being used (this includes your spouse and kids). In addition you will have to complete several additional steps (Steps 3 – 6 above) that you do not have to complete if you opt to register your suppressor using a trust. FAQ’s Am I eligible to own a suppressor? If you are 21 years old or older AND able to legally possess a firearm then you should be eligible to purchase a suppressor. This also assumes you have verified it is legal to own in your State and County. Is it legal to own a suppressor in my State? Suppressor ownership and hunting with a suppressor is legal in most States. Please reference the map, provided by the American Suppressor Association, below to see if suppressors are legal in your State. This map is for reference and you should be sure to check your State and County laws before making any suppressor purchase.    * Minnesota hunting law to take effect August 1, 2015.* Maine Hunting and Shall Sign laws to take effect mid October.   How long is the wait? Wait times will vary throughout the year but can be anywhere from 3-6 months. Once you submit your paperwork you will be able to contact the ATF to inquire about the status of your paperwork. Just keep in mind this is a government process that is out of all of our control and you will need to be patient. As they have told us in the past, “It will be ready when it is ready”. 7 Step Process To Order A Suppressor From Gun Pro:   Use the Gun Pro FFL Locator for Class III dealers to find a dealer in your area. If you can't find a Class III dealer contact us and we will assist you in locating one.   Make sure the dealer will take “Title II” or suppressor transfers and inquire about their transfer fee. (Fees average $75-$100)   Purchase your suppressor on WWW.GunProDeals.Com and choose that dealer from the drop down menu at checkout   If the dealer you want is not currently in our database please have your dealer email us a copy of their FFL and SOT to REDACTED We will update your order and let you know once we have the information.   Once our transfer forms are in place with your dealer, usually 2 weeks, we will email you the Form 4 information you will need to complete. You can complete this information and submit it right away. Please check with your local transfer dealer for their policy and procedures.   We will transfer the suppressor to your local dealer and they will contact you once your Form 4 has been approved.   At any time in the process if you are not sure about a step, or are needing help please contact us at REDACTED   We are unable to process cancellations, returns or refunds for silencers or any NFA items once the order is placed."

Just follow the steps below or give us a call and we will be happy to walk you through the entire process. What paperwork will I need to legally register a suppressor? There are two main methods for registering your suppressor:   Registration using a “Trust” (easiest method)   Registration in your name   Option 1 Registration using a “Trust”   Set up your trust   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out your Form 4 and Mail in your $200 payment to ATF   Sit back and relax because you are done!   It will cost approximately $100 more to buy using the trust method, but it will save a ton of time and provide a great deal more flexibility than an individually registered suppressor. There are many advantages to using a trust for registering a suppressor.  Some of these advantages include:   more than one person (family or friends) can legally use the suppressor if they are listed on the trust   one trust can be used for multiple suppressors   trusts can be modified to add or remove people without approval from the ATF   most importantly you DO NOT have to get fingerprint cards or your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on the purchase.  These benefits will save a lot of time and hassle down the road.   There are many places you can go online or locally to download a Trust to be used for registering your suppressor. Here are a few examples which range in price from $99 - $129:   http://199trust.com/   http://www.thefirearmlawyers.com/   http://www.guntrust.com/   Option 2 Registration to an individual   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out Form 4 and $200 payment for ATF   Obtain 2 Passport Photos   Obtain Chief Law Enforcement Officer Sign Off (Must be in the county you are a resident in)   Two copies of fingerprint cards (FBI form FD-258)   Complete Certificate of Compliance – ATF Form 5330.20   This is a less expensive method for registering your suppressor since you will not have to pay the $100 for a trust to be set up. However, you will be the sole owner of the suppressor and will have to be present any time the suppressor is being used (this includes your spouse and kids). In addition you will have to complete several additional steps (Steps 3 – 6 above) that you do not have to complete if you opt to register your suppressor using a trust. FAQ’s Am I eligible to own a suppressor? If you are 21 years old or older AND able to legally possess a firearm then you should be eligible to purchase a suppressor. This also assumes you have verified it is legal to own in your State and County. Is it legal to own a suppressor in my State? Suppressor ownership and hunting with a suppressor is legal in most States. Please reference the map, provided by the American Suppressor Association, below to see if suppressors are legal in your State. This map is for reference and you should be sure to check your State and County laws before making any suppressor purchase.    * Minnesota hunting law to take effect August 1, 2015.* Maine Hunting and Shall Sign laws to take effect mid October.   How long is the wait? Wait times will vary throughout the year but can be anywhere from 3-6 months. Once you submit your paperwork you will be able to contact the ATF to inquire about the status of your paperwork. Just keep in mind this is a government process that is out of all of our control and you will need to be patient. As they have told us in the past, “It will be ready when it is ready”. 7 Step Process To Order A Suppressor From Gun Pro:   Use the Gun Pro FFL Locator for Class III dealers to find a dealer in your area. If you can't find a Class III dealer contact us and we will assist you in locating one.   Make sure the dealer will take “Title II” or suppressor transfers and inquire about their transfer fee. (Fees average $75-$100)   Purchase your suppressor on WWW.GunProDeals.Com and choose that dealer from the drop down menu at checkout   If the dealer you want is not currently in our database please have your dealer email us a copy of their FFL and SOT to REDACTED We will update your order and let you know once we have the information.   Once our transfer forms are in place with your dealer, usually 2 weeks, we will email you the Form 4 information you will need to complete. You can complete this information and submit it right away. Please check with your local transfer dealer for their policy and procedures.   We will transfer the suppressor to your local dealer and they will contact you once your Form 4 has been approved.

Just follow the steps below or give us a call and we will be happy to walk you through the entire process. What paperwork will I need to legally register a suppressor? There are two main methods for registering your suppressor:   Registration using a “Trust” (easiest method)   Registration in your name   Option 1 Registration using a “Trust”   Set up your trust   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out your Form 4 and Mail in your $200 payment to ATF   Sit back and relax because you are done!   It will cost approximately $100 more to buy using the trust method, but it will save a ton of time and provide a great deal more flexibility than an individually registered suppressor. There are many advantages to using a trust for registering a suppressor.  Some of these advantages include:   more than one person (family or friends) can legally use the suppressor if they are listed on the trust   one trust can be used for multiple suppressors   trusts can be modified to add or remove people without approval from the ATF   most importantly you DO NOT have to get fingerprint cards or your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on the purchase.  These benefits will save a lot of time and hassle down the road.   There are many places you can go online or locally to download a Trust to be used for registering your suppressor. Here are a few examples which range in price from $99 - $129:   http://199trust.com/   http://www.thefirearmlawyers.com/   http://www.guntrust.com/   Option 2 Registration to an individual   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out Form 4 and $200 payment for ATF   Obtain 2 Passport Photos   Obtain Chief Law Enforcement Officer Sign Off (Must be in the county you are a resident in)   Two copies of fingerprint cards (FBI form FD-258)   Complete Certificate of Compliance – ATF Form 5330.20   This is a less expensive method for registering your suppressor since you will not have to pay the $100 for a trust to be set up. However, you will be the sole owner of the suppressor and will have to be present any time the suppressor is being used (this includes your spouse and kids). In addition you will have to complete several additional steps (Steps 3 – 6 above) that you do not have to complete if you opt to register your suppressor using a trust. FAQ’s Am I eligible to own a suppressor? If you are 21 years old or older AND able to legally possess a firearm then you should be eligible to purchase a suppressor. This also assumes you have verified it is legal to own in your State and County. Is it legal to own a suppressor in my State? Suppressor ownership and hunting with a suppressor is legal in most States. Please reference the map, provided by the American Suppressor Association, below to see if suppressors are legal in your State. This map is for reference and you should be sure to check your State and County laws before making any suppressor purchase.    * Minnesota hunting law to take effect August 1, 2015.* Maine Hunting and Shall Sign laws to take effect mid October.   How long is the wait? Wait times will vary throughout the year but can be anywhere from 3-6 months. Once you submit your paperwork you will be able to contact the ATF to inquire about the status of your paperwork. Just keep in mind this is a government process that is out of all of our control and you will need to be patient. As they have told us in the past, “It will be ready when it is ready”. 7 Step Process To Order A Suppressor From Gun Pro:   Use the Gun Pro FFL Locator for Class III dealers to find a dealer in your area. If you can't find a Class III dealer contact us and we will assist you in locating one.   Make sure the dealer will take “Title II” or suppressor transfers and inquire about their transfer fee.

Once our transfer forms are in place with your dealer, usually 2 weeks, we will email you the Form 4 information you will need to complete. You can complete this information and submit it right away. Please check with your local transfer dealer for their policy and procedures.   We will transfer the suppressor to your local dealer and they will contact you once your Form 4 has been approved.

Just follow the steps below or give us a call and we will be happy to walk you through the entire process. What paperwork will I need to legally register a suppressor? There are two main methods for registering your suppressor:   Registration using a “Trust” (easiest method)   Registration in your name   Option 1 Registration using a “Trust”   Set up your trust   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out your Form 4 and Mail in your $200 payment to ATF   Sit back and relax because you are done!   It will cost approximately $100 more to buy using the trust method, but it will save a ton of time and provide a great deal more flexibility than an individually registered suppressor. There are many advantages to using a trust for registering a suppressor.  Some of these advantages include:   more than one person (family or friends) can legally use the suppressor if they are listed on the trust   one trust can be used for multiple suppressors   trusts can be modified to add or remove people without approval from the ATF   most importantly you DO NOT have to get fingerprint cards or your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on the purchase.  These benefits will save a lot of time and hassle down the road.   There are many places you can go online or locally to download a Trust to be used for registering your suppressor. Here are a few examples which range in price from $99 - $129:   http://199trust.com/   http://www.thefirearmlawyers.com/   http://www.guntrust.com/   Option 2 Registration to an individual   Purchase your suppressor online at grabagun.com   Fill out Form 4 and $200 payment for ATF   Obtain 2 Passport Photos   Obtain Chief Law Enforcement Officer Sign Off (Must be in the county you are a resident in)   Two copies of fingerprint cards (FBI form FD-258)   Complete Certificate of Compliance – ATF Form 5330.20   This is a less expensive method for registering your suppressor since you will not have to pay the $100 for a trust to be set up. However, you will be the sole owner of the suppressor and will have to be present any time the suppressor is being used (this includes your spouse and kids). In addition you will have to complete several additional steps (Steps 3 – 6 above) that you do not have to complete if you opt to register your suppressor using a trust. FAQ’s Am I eligible to own a suppressor? If you are 21 years old or older AND able to legally possess a firearm then you should be eligible to purchase a suppressor. This also assumes you have verified it is legal to own in your State and County. Is it legal to own a suppressor in my State? Suppressor ownership and hunting with a suppressor is legal in most States. Please reference the map, provided by the American Suppressor Association, below to see if suppressors are legal in your State. This map is for reference and you should be sure to check your State and County laws before making any suppressor purchase.    * Minnesota hunting law to take effect August 1, 2015.* Maine Hunting and Shall Sign laws to take effect mid October.   How long is the wait? Wait times will vary throughout the year but can be anywhere from 3-6 months. Once you submit your paperwork you will be able to contact the ATF to inquire about the status of your paperwork. Just keep in mind this is a government process that is out of all of our control and you will need to be patient. As they have told us in the past, “It will be ready when it is ready”. 7 Step Process To Order A Suppressor From Gun Pro:   Use the Gun Pro FFL Locator for Class III dealers to find a dealer in your area. If you can't find a Class III dealer contact us and we will assist you in locating one.   Make sure the dealer will take “Title II” or suppressor transfers and inquire about their transfer fee. (Fees average $75-$100)   Purchase your suppressor on WWW.GunProDeals.Com and choose that dealer from the drop down menu at checkout   If the dealer you want is not currently in our database please have your dealer email us a copy of their FFL and SOT to REDACTED We will update your order and let you know once we have the information.   Once our transfer forms are in place with your dealer, usually 2 weeks, we will email you the Form 4 information you will need to complete. You can complete this information and submit it right away. Please check with your local transfer dealer for their policy and procedures.   We will transfer the suppressor to your local dealer and they will contact you once your Form 4 has been approved.   At any time in the process if you are not sure about a step, or are needing help please contact us at REDACTED   We are unable to process cancellations, returns or refunds for silencers or any NFA items once the order is placed."
