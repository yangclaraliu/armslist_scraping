Its engagement surfaces are precision ground, polished and overall tolerances refined. The wider trigger face increases trigger-to-finger contact – all for a more consistent and comfortable pull. Ergonomically enhanced with a slimmer forearm and sharper, distinctive lines and contours, the reduced grip diameter and slight right-hand palm swell equal less weight, increased comfort, control and quick-to-shoulder mounting for fast target acquisition.

Hand-lapped, free-floating No. 3 contour, fluted stainless steel barrel with recessed target crown ensures consistent and true bullet paths. The 54° bolt lift is among the shortest available – it allows fast chambering on follow-up shots and enhanced bolt-to-scope clearance, leaving battered knuckles a thing of the past. One-piece forged and machined receiver features integral recoil lug for exceptional strength. Metalwork features two-tone Cerakote® finish with Desert Sand and Flat Dark Earth added flutes."

The events of Orlando and Dallas show us that law enforcement cannot protect you. If you are a member of the LGBT community, you are especially vulnerable and I am genuinely concerned for your safety. It is our good fortune to live in Nevada, which does not restrict lawful citizens from practicing our natural right to self-defense. However, no matter your skill level, good training is vital to practicing that right.To enable such proficiency, I am offering certificates to attend two-day and four-day classes at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute near Las Vegas, Nevada for FREE to anyone who is interested, which can be used for handgun, rifle, or shotgun training. These courses retail for $1000 (two-day) and $2000 (four-day) but that cost is waived with these certificates. When using a course certificate, the costs associated with attending a course are a $50 background check, transportation to and lodging in Pahrump, NV, and the supplies you would need for the course (ammunition, equipment, etc). There are no strings attached to this offer, it is what it is. The more Nevadans trained and proficient in firearms there are, the safer we all are. Anyone with questions about these certificates, the training being offered, or the school, please message me via the Contact Seller button above. I will leave this post up as long as I have certificates to give out."

Fiber  Optic Ghost Ring Sight rear aperture sight to match the front ""M16-style"" fiber optic post sight.  The rear Ghost Ring aperture features dual green Fiber Optic light pipes to contrast the front red Fiber Optic light pipe , giving you a perfectly awesome Fiber Optic ghost ring sight setup -- front fiber optic tower/post with rear fiber optic ghost ring aperture.  Both are fully adjustable -- the rear being easily adjustable with just the rim of a shotgun shell.I have also installed a precision-fit LimbSaver recoil pad which amazingly reduces the recoil -- it made a huge difference.  I also rigged up a sling and added a soft stock shell-carrier for a few extra rounds.This shotgun is in great condition -- the absolutely only issue is the fact that the finish isn't pristine, you can clearly see in the pictures there a couple-a-few scuffs.  This is only because of the fact Mossberg uses an aluminum receiver with steel parts, and the bluing/oxidizing process they use for finishing is weak at best.  Choate uses a different bluing entirely , which you can see because the mag ext. is different shade of black than the rest.  The gun is pristine, has been treated perfectly, was my baby for a long time -- but i have a collection of shotguns, I want to buy a 1911, so I'm going to let this go.... It's an amazing shotgun.  In early 2010, the Mossberg 930 SPX was the hottest firearm on the market, people were buying them and then immediately asking $1,200-$1,300 online.Ok thanks , hope to hear from someone who will love this bad mama jama like I did.$650 or best trade/offer"

""The Level 1.5 package is the one seems to be just right for most shooters. This package specifically targets the lower 1/3 of the backstrap, to reduce/reshape the pronounced backstrap hump that so many shooters find disagreeable. Many shooters find that the factory backstrap hump placement and profile not only makes the muzzle present high (compared to other pistols with a more natural grip angle), but also prevents the hollow of their hand from making solid contact along the spine of the grip. This package does not eliminate the hump completely, rather makes it less prominent and alters its profile for a more ergonomic shape, thereby delivering noticeably improved grip contact."""

I liked the stocks, trigger group, and other parts.The receiver and barrel have some very light rust spots in the parkerizing that will brush out with light oil.I would like to get rid of this reciever/barrel group. It may make a nice budget shooter with a little money.
