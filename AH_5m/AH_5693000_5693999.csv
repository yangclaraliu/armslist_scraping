The appearance of the Model 110 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers. The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made. The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots. Our crisp, clean AccuTrigger ™ allows the user to easily adjust trigger pull weight from approximately 1.5 – 6 pounds.

The IC-A5 is the latest model in the IC - Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and the longer 12"" SPR style rail system on the same rifle. The IC-A5 is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of their longer modualr rail system. The upper rail section on the IC-A5 is an aesthetically pleasing special cutback version which allows us to use the low profile gas block and at the same time keep the full 12"" modular rails available on the sides and bottom of the handguards. This IC-A5 brings together features on both the IC Enhanced and the IC-SPR in one package. Like all IC models the IC-A5 is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on their patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel allows most often used in aerospace, LWRCi raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance - delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5. LWRCi Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard. Their investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. The IC-A5 uses LWRCi manufactured - NiCorr threated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter. The increased surface area reduces heat - speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity. The LWRCi IC-A5 comes complete with, LWRCi Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCi Adjustable Compact Stock, Magpul MOE+ Grip and LWRCi High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider. All LWRCi forgings are coined: the material is struck twice in the die for precise dimensional accuracy and a superior surface finish.

1) When a listing reads NO TRADES, that means the seller doesn't want your S&W, FNS or Glock in exchange for their gun no matter how great you say your gun is.2) ""No low ball offers"" means don't offer the seller $400 for a gun with a value of $500. And throwing in ""CASH"" doesn't help. Stop it. You think I would take personal check from a person I don't know?3) If you ever begin a text with ""Wassuup"" to ask about a gun for sale or type an email as though it were a text, I will personally never sell you any gun even if you offered more than I'm asking.4) Don't be a pathetic, urgent & desperate buyer. It comes across like want this gun to pull off a hit over the weekend.

The IC-A5 is the latest model in the IC - Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and the longer 12"" SPR style rail system on the same rifle. The IC-A5 is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of their longer modualr rail system. The upper rail section on the IC-A5 is an aesthetically pleasing special cutback version which allows us to use the low profile gas block and at the same time keep the full 12"" modular rails available on the sides and bottom of the hand guards. This IC-A5 brings together features of both the IC Enhanced and the IC-SPR in one package. Like all IC models the IC-A5 is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on their patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCi raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance - delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5. LWRCi Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard. Their investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset. The IC-A5 uses LWRCi manufactured - NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter. The increased surface area reduces heat - speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity. The LWRCi IC-A5 comes complete with, LWRCi Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCi Adjustable Compact Stock, Magpul MOE+ Grip and LWRCi High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider. All LWRCi forgings are coined: the material is struck twice in the die for precise dimensional accuracy and a superior surface finish. LWRCi applies its own Cerakote: Ceramic-based Thermoset Epoxy finish in 3 color selections.

It was designed and manufactured by the Spanish company Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA, and its design is based on the previous guns by the same manufacturer, such as Star 30M. Production of the Megastar was completed in the late 1990s.Megastar is a recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. It uses a Browning High-Power type locking system with tilting barrel. Megastar is a hammer fired pistol, with double action trigger and ambidextrous, slide mounted safety-decocker lever. The safety lever has three positions: upper one for ""fire"" mode, red dot is shown; medium one for ""safe"" mode, this withdraws and locks the firing pin; and the lower one for safe decocking (after decocking safety lever springs back to the ""safe"" position). Megastar also features a magazine disconnect safety which does not allow to fire the gun withouth magazine in the place. Megastar slide and frame are made from the steel, and like other latest Star pistols, Megastar has internal slide rails, instead of more usual external rails. This pistol features non-ajustable sights. Magazine capacity is quite impressive, especially when speaking about the period of the early 1990s, and is 12 rounds of .45ACP or 14 rounds of 10mm Auto.Overall, Megastar represents one of the strongest designs in auto-pistols, heavy but powerful and built to last forewer. Heavy weight also helps to control the recoil of the powerful cartridges used."

The sellers won't meet in person and usually want the rifle shipped to some other address (My favorite is ""I'm buying this for my dad. I'll pay for it, but can you ship it to him?). This is not one of those ads. My strong preference is for a face to face, cash sale. Because of the number of scamers that have responded to this ad I will only ship this rifle if it is paid for with a USPS money order. And I will only ship it to a valid FFL (01 or 03 C&R)... not some other address.
Not thrilled to sell this. However, I run the site gear-report.com and just bought a surplus Humvee as a field vehicle for the website... but I had not budgeted for it. So, I have to liquidate a few assets to cover the cost. If you go to my site and use the search bar at the top right to search for ""Garand"" you will find an article with video about this Service Grade Garand and articles about the other Garand I have for sale.On my website you will find a video of unboxing this M1 Garand and an article and video of the other Garand I have for sale. Just search for ""garand"" in the search box on my site.M1 Garand with Springfield receiver in the 3.08M serial range.Brand new CMP stock with a couple of coats of BLO/mineral spirits scrubbed in. A friend who is knowledgable in Garands told me the following about it:-Fairly rare WWII M1 Garand 3 SA Curve Side Op Rod. D35382 3 SA marked with NO relief cut.Dash 3 ""Curve Side"" rods were used from approx Mar '41 thru Oct '42 on WWII M1's(ser# range 197812 thru 1,000,000). Curve Side Op Rods have a distinctive curve on the hump forward of the charging handle, hence curve vs flat side.
-All Springfield parts except HRA-W rear sight.
-Trigger pack appears to be NOS Springfield with no evidence it has been apart.-SA 8/53 barrel measured 2 at the muzzle, 3 at the throat.
Not interested in trades or low-ball offers.Strongly prefer a face to face sale in Burlington, NC. I am willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense ONLY if payment is made with a USPS money order.  I had a rather convincing prospective buyer try to sucker me on a remote deal with payment by some othe means. Not dealing with that crap again."

Best pocket pistol there is. This beauty jas original factory stainless steel looking barrel and the U notch by the rear sight. Just got it back from Ruger and it has new frame and new internal components. Its like brand new on the inside with that rare slide and barrel makes it a unique gun. It comes with: 2 brand new Ruger brand 6 round magazines made in Italy ($59.99 each), 2 different size Pierce pinky grips($20 each) 1 Ruger brand($29.99) +1 pinky extended floor plate (7 rounds total, so you can carry 7 + 1)1 15 round ProMag extended magazine ($29.99) with better spring in it. 1 Uncle Mike's holster Ill add enough ammo to fill up all the mags. I have close to $500 dollars into this gun.It is very accurate and the stainless steel barrel brings a lot of attention from the Ruger fans. Hard to find one like that. This is not a model that is recalled. Has the diamond stamp by the hammer. You will get also a box and all the paperwork that shows what Ruger did to it. Im sorry but i cant find the paperwork for the ProMag extendo but it works fine. I use it for range time and i feed it FMJs only. I have 2 LCP guns and the 15 round works great in both. Have NOT fired this LCP since it came back from Ruger, just want to keep it clean and scratch free for the next owner. I have Indiana ID and LTCH and would require you to show me the same. No LTCH, no deal.  Interested in bigger caliber full size or compact size handguns only. No shotguns, no ARs or AKs, no revolvers. Mainly looking for Glocks in .40SW, .45acp and 10mm. I like XD also but no single stacks and no safeties, may be interested in sub compact M&P in .40SW, or SD40VE.  I prefer Gen 3 Glocks.  Here is a short list as an example of what gets my interest:GLOCK 30 (S/sf)GLOCK 29 (sf is fine)GLOCK 27GLOCK 22 (sf is fine)GLOCK 20 (sf is fine)SMITH AND WESSON SD40VE M&P .40SW SUBCOMPACT NO SAFETYFNS .40SW NO SAFETYBERETTA 96D (POLICE ISSUE NO SAFETY)XD SUBCOMPACT DOUBLE STACK IN .40SW HK VP40HK P30(L) .40SW HK P2000 (sk) .40SW,  only LEM modelsI have some ammo i could add to make the trade better for you, in .22lr , .22wmr, some .45acp tulla, i have some very hot 10mm ammo by Liberty ammunition as well, and about 50 rounds of 7.62x39 soft tips. I can add cash also but not too much. If you have any of those guns but no box or not many magazines its not a deal breaker. I dont mind holster wear or handling marks as long as it functions. I dont care for lasers or lights because i have some good ones myself."

The sellers won't meet in person and usually want the rifle shipped to some other address (My favorite is ""I'm buying this for my dad. I'll pay for it, but can you ship it to him?). This is not one of those ads. My strong preference is for a face to face, cash sale. Because of the number of scamers that have responded to this ad I will only ship this rifle if it is paid for with a USPS money order. And I will only ship it to a valid FFL (01 or 03 C&R)... not some other address.
Not thrilled to sell this. However, I run the site gear-report.com and just bought a surplus Humvee as a field vehicle for the website... but I had not budgeted for it. So, I have to liquidate a few assets to cover the cost. If you go to my site and use the search bar at the top right to search for ""M1A1"" you will find an article about this M1 Carbine.
U.S.A. Model M1A1 ""paratrooper"" semiautomatic carbine # 109xxx (.30 Carbine) mfg. by Inland (General Motors) in 1942 with 11-43 dated Underwood barrel. Excellent condition with full Parkerized finish remaining on all metal and having an excellent bore. All late parts (sliding rear sight, lever safety, bayonet lug) with what I am sure is a REPRODUCTION paratrooper stock (although in the correct serial number range to be an original M1A1). Includes 15-round magazine (only where legal), sling and M8A bayonet and scabbard. Markings:Front sight: “P0 Q” or “P0 0”Front barrel band: “AI”Rear sight: appears to be a “H” on a shieldTrigger housing: “BE-B”Safety selector: appears to be “M” or “W” inside a circleHammer: very faint double stamped “WA”Sear: “RIA”Trigger: “M” or “W”Bolt lug: “A.T. L” ? (4 characters, but only first 2 clearly readable)Magazine: “IA”Slide: “V” Not interested in trades or low-ball offers.Strongly prefer a face to face sale in Burlington, NC. I am willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense ONLY if payment is made with a USPS money order.  I had a rather convincing prospective buyer try to sucker me on a remote deal with payment by some othe means. Not dealing with that crap again."

Selling this to fund my dreams of becoming a member of Club le ACOG.Comes with QD mount that fits neatly behind the standard rails that your Aimpoint or EoTech fits on. This magnifier will work with all red dots, but matches the best with Aimpoint aesthetically.The QD mount requires no tools, and I am throwing in a ring mount for a PVS-14 night vision monocular. So now you can use the magnifier for longer range, or switch to night vision when the situation calls for it. You will see the dot through both, and now your rifle becomes useful in any lighting condition. The NVG mounting ring is at least a $60 value, and I am throwing it in for free.Thanks for looking!"

The Husqvarna action is very precisely machined from top grade steel. It handles escaping powder gasses as well as any other Mauser pattern action. It is one of the slickest, perhaps the slickest, Mauser 98 pattern action that I have ever used. Other positive features include a one piece bolt, one piece firing pin, flat bottom receiver with integral recoil lug, adjustable trigger, one piece bottom iron, generous loading/ejection port and full length extractor for controlled feeding. Like all Mauser 98 style actions, the Husqvarna's full length extractor takes a very large bite on the case rim for positive extraction of dirty, oversize, or stuck cases. If you can find one, the Husqvarna is a very fine action and an excellent choice around which to build a custom rifle. -- Chuck Hawks

It utilizes high-impact polymers, aircraft grade aluminum (7075-T6), and ultra high strength steels. Ergonomic stock panels attach directly to the receiver. The HTI sustains its accuracy and reliability in virtually any environment, including subzero arctic temperatures, extreme desert heat and dust, and wet jungle environments.  Accurate  The HTI maintains exceptional accuracy becuase of its match-grade (free-floated) barrels, chambers and crowns, a high-quality match trigger, and solid return-to-zero barrel mounting system.  Compact  The perfectly balanced bullpup configuration of the HTI makes it shorter and 12 lbs lighter then the M107 currently in use by the US Army.  Convertible  Choose between four powerful calibers to suit specific mission requirements. Caliber conversions for the HTI take sixty seconds.  Features  Recoil Pad: The recoil pad is raised to position the shooter's shoulder above the bore line in order to minimize muzzle rise and the pad is soft enough to allow long strings of fire with large caliber cartridges like the .50 BMG. Adjustable Length of Pull: Users can quickly adjust length of pull by adding or removing multiple 1/2 inch spacers with their proprietary lever locking system. Monopod: Their patent-pending monopod is the fastest actuating device of its kind. Just pull down on the knurled thumb wheel to engage the spike for rapid elevation modification and then spin the wheel right or left for fine adjustment. Cheek Piece: Their non-slip cheek piece adjusts up or down and securely locks into place via two screws and locking ribs ensure it doesn't come out of adjustment. Telescopic Bolt: Their bolt utilizes a 60° bolt throw for fast manipulation. It's collapsible desing allows the rifle  length to be extremely short. Safety: The ambidextrous safety switch easily actuated from firing position. Match Trigger: The match trigger is adjustable for travel, creep, location, and weight. Barrel Mounting System: Their patented barrel mounting system ensures consistent mounting & return-to-zero repeatability. Its five inch locking engagement reduces harmonic barrel whip of a 26"" barrel to that of a 20"" barrel which improves accuracy as a result. Handguard and Accessory Mounting: The free-floated handguard has six flush cup sling mounting points to choose from and also allows users to strategically place picatinny rails to optimize mounting of support accessories. Barrel: Stainless steel fluted match barrel. The barrel mounting system utilizes five inches of locking engagement which reduces harmonic barrel whip of a 26"" barrel to that of a 20"" barrel which improves accuracy as a result.  Specifications  Caliber: .416 Barrett Barrel Length: 29"" (73.66 cm) Rifle Length: 45.37"" (115.24 cm) Weight: 20.25 lbs (9.18 kg) Barrel Twist: 1:13"" Magaizne Capacity: 5"
