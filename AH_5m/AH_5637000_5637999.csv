The .375 Holland & Holland Magnum (9.5×72mmB) is a medium-bore rifle cartridge. The .375 H&H was only the second cartridge ever to feature a belt, now common among magnum rounds.The .375 H&H often is cited as one of the most useful all-round rifle cartridges, especially in shooting large and dangerous game.[4] With relatively light bullets in the region of 235 to 270 grains (15 to 17 g), it is a flat-shooting, fairly long-range cartridge ideal for use on light to medium game, whereas with heavy bullets of 300 grains (19 g) and greater, it has the punch necessary for large, thick-skinned dangerous game. In many regions with thick-skinned dangerous game animals.Unlike what is seen in most calibers, many .375 H&H rifles also achieve nearly the same point of impact over a wide range of bullet weights at all commonly used distances, further simplifying a professional hunter's choice in selecting different grain bullets based upon the game hunted by requiring fewer scope or sight adjustments, which further serves to popularize the .375 H&H Magnum among professional hunters.Production historyDesigner Holland & HollandDesigned 1912Produced 1912—presentVariants .375 H&H Ackley Improved, .375 Weatherby MagnumSpecificationsParent case UniqueBullet diameter .375 in (9.5 mm)Neck diameter .404 in (10.3 mm)Shoulder diameter .448 in (11.4 mm)Base diameter .513 in (13.0 mm)Rim diameter .532 in (13.5 mm)Rim thickness .050 in (1.3 mm)Case length 2.850 in (72.4 mm)Overall length 3.6 in (91 mm)Case capacity 95.3 gr H2O (6.18 cm3)Rifling twist 1-12"" (304.8 mm)Primer type large rifle magnumMaximum pressure 62,000 psi (430 MPa)Ballistic performanceBullet weight/type Velocity Energy200 gr (13 g) JFP 3,195 ft/s (974 m/s) 4,534 ft·lbf (6,147 J)235 gr (15 g) SP 2,964 ft/s (903 m/s) 4,585 ft·lbf (6,216 J)250 gr (16 g) SP 2,835 ft/s (864 m/s) 4,463 ft·lbf (6,051 J)270 gr (17 g) FS 2,694 ft/s (821 m/s) 4,352 ft·lbf (5,901 J)300 gr (19 g) SPBT 2,645 ft/s (806 m/s) 4,661 ft·lbf (6,319 J)The 375 H&H Magnum was so well designed and popular that it became the parent cartridge to all those listed below, especially noteworthy are the popular 300 Win Mag, 338 Win Mag, and the 6.5mm and 7mm Rem Mag.

If you're one of those people that thinks ""a Glock is a Glock and all Glocks are worth $450"" then, please, hit the back button now. If you know what you're looking at, then keep reading because this is the pistol you've been looking for. Let's get this out of the way though: it's spray paint. It comes off easily and I can remove it before you buy it. NO, I'm not going to give this gun away for cheap just because it has a light coat of spray paint on the frame and light.
This is a Glock 17 RTF 2 with ""fish gill"" serrations. I'm not going to go too far into the details of the RTF II because if you're read this far then you already know all that stuff. Short version: they're the Glock that Glock guys drool over. This one has a Lone Wolf threaded barrel, Trijicon Heinie night sights, factory extended mag release, factory extended slide release and it also comes with a metal low profile mag well funnel. I forgot the manufacture's name for this magwell but it was like $120 and was designed to be smaller and less absurd-looking than the huge competition ones but still aid in mag changes duty use. 
 
This is a gunfighter's gun. It doesn't want to be stuck in a safe or shot at some bull-crap indoor range while standing still and punching holes in paper zombie targets with an RSO standing over your shoulder. This gun BEGS to be run hard by a hard bastard. It holds a TIGHT group with that match barrel from Lone Wolf. Mag changes are a snap with the magwell funnel. The light is a Streamlight M3 and the extender on the mag is factory Glock +2 extender. I have a TON of Glock 17 mags. This ad essentially includes ONE mag but I can add more depending on your trade. 
 
Oh, and I have the box and all the stuff that came in the box... but, again, consider trade offers starting with one mag coming with this gun and we can negotiate up as-needed. I know a lot of Glock people already have a bunch of 17 mags."

Has super clean trigger pull in double action and single action, short rest and great balance!  He trigger is smoother than most double action/single action guns that cost twice as much. I'm not sure why they stopped making them and I wouldn't be getting rid of it if I didn't have a bunch of other stuff that I primarily shoot. I just don't shoot it any more.  Has been well taken care of, never had a malfunction and doesn't have a ton of rounds through it. Text me with inquiries REDACTED"
