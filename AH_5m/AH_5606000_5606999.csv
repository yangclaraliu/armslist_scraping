This item is OPEN BOX, but never removed from box, installed or used. Buyer may inspect all items to ensure quality.-------------------------The SportDOG Brand In-Ground Fence System has been proven safe, comfortable, and effective for dogs over 10 pounds.The system works by producing a radio signal from the Fence Transmitter through up to 8,600-feet of Boundary Wire. The Boundary Wire is buried or attached to a fixed object to enclose the dog's Boundary Area. You temporarily define the Boundary Area with Boundary Flags for a visual aid in training your dog.Your dog wears a Collar Receiver with Contact Points that touch his neck and, once trained, is allowed to roam freely in the Boundary Area. When your dog reaches the Warning Zone, the Collar Receiver gives a warning beep. If your dog continues into the Stimulation Zone, a safe stimulation will be delivered through the Contact Points to get his attention until he returns to the Boundary Area.CONTENTS:*Transmitter*Collar Receiver*1,000 Feet of 20-Gauge Wire.*100 Flags*Operating Guide with Training Information*Charging Adaptor"

The markings on the rifle indicate production by Royal Ordinance Factory (ROF) Maltby circa 1943. ROF Maltby was established during WWII to further away from German air raids to help increase war time production. As a smaller factory there are fewer Maltby rifles than those produced in Fazakerly or Enfield. The stock and band have matching serial numbers and, though faint, the attached magazine does as well. There is the usual dings and nicks of a service rifle but nothing major. From the short range time I have had it the rifle shoots flawlessly. Rifle will be coming as you see it. If interested send me an email through the site or text me at REDACTED."

Read the reviews on BassPro's website, this is a 200 yard capable shotgun that will shoot inside 2 MOA. Includes a full length scope rail, which is a $30 item. BassPro is selling them for $529 without the scope rail. This one is new so please no lowball offers. Left handed bolt. I will include ammo and possibly a red dot or 4x scope for the right trade."

It is in pretty good shape and comes with only 1 magazine. No box or anything else. Have about 19 +/- rounds of .25 that will go with it.Full disclosure- I bought the pistol used, obviously, and the seller told me it does not fire. So I took it apart and used Ballistol to clean all the gunk accumulated. The firing pin is in decent shape, whereas most don't work due to breakage from dry firing- so if you come to check the gun out, do NOT dry fire unless you have your own snap caps.I went to the range with a full box of 50 and as you can see, I shot off 31 rounds.However, when I loaded the magazine full of rounds, it jams, and had to take out a round. Then I shot off @ 2 rounds consistently with no FTF and then jammed.Then, I tried loading only 3 rounds in the magazine and it cycled all 3 with no problem. I ran 3 rounds at a time in the magazine.So, it may need more cleaning, the ramp polished, or a new magazine spring?Must see your GA CCW license. No exceptions. NO OUT OF STATE INQUIRIES.  I don't care if this qualifies as a C&R pistol, I WILL NOT SHIP."
