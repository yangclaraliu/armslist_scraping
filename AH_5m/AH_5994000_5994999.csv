The weapon was a carry and its time to move on. That being said it has a few very minor knicks but is overall in great shape. It has a low round count and I did just replace the recoil spring with a brand new Kimber replacement. The safety was also replaced due to slight wear from thumb and the back plate on the slide. All Kimber parts. Old ones will come with the firearm if requested. The gun also comes with VZ ETC grips. I would be open to a trade for a 357 Mag revolver or a quality hunting bow with cash on top. I don't need or want your AR/AK.FLDL and would prefer a CCW but not mandatory. A bill of sale WILL be done however. The firearm is a blast. Any LOW ball will be ignored.More pictures available as well.
