It is at home as a tactical pistol as much as an IPSC Limited gun (non-Production class). The longer barrel puts more weight forward and will translate into less muzzle flip for rapid follow up shots, and the longer sight radius gives a better sight picture for accuracy. For those who like their full-size 1911, this is your Glock, because it handles like a 1911 with that long slide.Both the National City Police and Escondido Police Department in Southern California issue and carry the G35, using both the Gen 3 and Gen 4 iterations. These agencies have found the G35 is the best gun for their money."""

The longer barrel puts more weight forward and will translate into less muzzle flip for rapid follow up shots, and the longer sight radius gives a better sight picture for accuracy.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World ShootProduct Name  CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical – 9mm   SKU  91153   Firearm Type  Handgun  Chambering  9mm Luger   Magazine Capacity  18   Magazine Type  Double Stack   Frame  Steel   Grips  Rubber   Trigger Mech  DA/SA   Sights  Fixed Night Sights   Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged   Barrel Length  4.6   Weight  2.4 lbs   Overall Length  8.15 in   Height  5.79 in"
