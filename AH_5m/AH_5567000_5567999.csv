I will send pics later. I have both of these awesome Pedersoli caplocks. Both are in new to excellent condition. I am looking to trade. I want the 30 inch barrel pedersoli 1859 or 1861-3 or newer 45/70-110 Sharps but would consider the 22 inch if I have to. Please let me know what you have and its condition. Right now Cabela's has the 22 inch sharps for 995.$ Great news from cabelas lol. They just listed several new versions of the 1859 & 1863!!! This opens up possibilities! I would trade both  for the 32 inch 63 or 30 in 59. Let me know....My 10 ga was 1200 and as you know the swivel barrel ( if you can find one) sells for 6-800 for a worn one (there is one listed here right now for 1000 in almost as nice of a condition as mine) and higher for excellent versions like mine. Both are really great. They look unfired or possibly very lightly test fired. There are no bad marks on either.Thanks and let me know what you have. The swivel barrel is truly a unique piece and the 10 ga.has two geese flying over a marsh scene engraved in the sides. I believe this makes it the deluxe edition now a collector itself and worth the same as an 1863 itself. So.... Make the trade n you come out ahead and I get my dream rifle!Thanks againNormaWill consider shipping but the sharps will be here before I send these out. Will consider cash or other trades as well.

I got it brand new and it has been sitting in its case for the past couple months. It is a solid, very well built rifle that is for sure. If you want more pictures or info you can text me, I will respond fastest to that and price Here is a list of additions to the rifle and/or upgrades of whats included:- 15"" Keymod free float handguard from 556 tactical ($200)- Stryke 2 Compensator ($90)- BCM Mil-spec BCG ($150)- Fully ambi safety selector ($50)- Atibal red dot optic w/ standard mount plus absolute co-witness mount ($150)- VooDoo tactical 36"" rifle carrying case ($75)Now there are some things I did not mention but you get the idea, it has an upgraded free float handguard with everything that goes with that, magpul collapsible stock, the rifle is fully Mil-spec essentially so very solid rifle. I added the price list to the stuff I added just so youd see its been very well upgraded. Those prices are retail and I never ask retail so basically whoever gets this rifle will get a steal cause it is an awesome deal. The red dot and carrying case are essentially free cause I am not adding that to the price. Again if you have questions or want pictures give me a text and I will get those for you. Price is 1550 or best offer. REDACTED"

These guns were imported for a very short time in the late 70's to early 80's, and are high quality guns made to compete with the Weatherby Mark V's.  Nikko has also produced guns for Winchester, Weatherby and a few others.  Most of the Golden Eagle Model 7000 that i've come across have been in .30-06, 7MM and a few .243's.  This is the first one I've seen in .25-06.  This has both a high gloss stock and metal with skip line checkering on the stock. It comes with a Millett 4X12-40 scope.  This gun is near new, and has had less then a box of shells fired through it.  These guns also make a great collector. I listed the gun under Weatherby, there is not a classification for Nikko or Golden Eagle.  More pictures upon request.If interested, please email or call me.  Rich   REDACTED   $899.00 AND YES, I will ship or your FFL.  Buyers pays actual shipping costs. September 2016 issue of Petersen's Hunting magazine lists the .25-06 as one of the top 10 big game calibers for anything from preditors to elk. Take a look at this gun before you buy a new rifle.
