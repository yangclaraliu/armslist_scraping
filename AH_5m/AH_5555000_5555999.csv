I'm selling this baby because as you can see from above, my fiance and I are no longer together, so there is no need to keep this thing. The lady currently in my life shoots a G19, so... Every gun I list here sells on the first day to the first buyer who contacts me. The reason is simple: I am meticulous in my care and maintenance of my firearms (yes, even ones I don't shoot).

A 37mm objective lens sits in front of a Turret Parallax Adjustment Locater (TPAL) system guaranteeing the sharpest image resolution possible at 10X magnification, making target acquisition for accurate shots beyond 1,000 yards possible. ST-10 optics features an Erector Repositioning Elevation Knob (EREK) system with 1/10 MIL or 1/4 inch per hundred yards (IPHY) click values that maximizes gross elevation travel adjustment. The same mechanical precision engineered into the EREK knob is incorporated into the US#1 windage knob to ensure that reticle adjustment is precise. A 12-position illuminated reticle system provides an advantage for taking your best shot in low light conditions. Housed in a rugged, Type III hard-anodized 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum body, the ST-10MIL will always hold zero from daily use and in the harshest field conditions. The MIL GAP reticle features full MIL and 1/2 MIL hash marks that are laid out in a clean display. The full MIL hash marks are numbered every 2 MILs for quick and easy reference. The hash marks represent a total of 9 MILs of adjustment below the horizontal axis; 4 MILs of adjustment above the horizontal axis and 4 MILs of adjustment to the left and right of the vertical axis."

This is a fully fluted 18"" barrel ($225) with a BCP custom 4 prong flash hider and comp ($85) and ARP custom 6.8 bolt.

These have MK4 coatings but 1"" tube and cappet turrets to save some $$ but the glass is unreal. Mounted in a Warne Team Ramp mount ($189) also holding in the 45* offset a Primary Arms Micro Dot ($70).
