Engineered with Taurus' drop hammer forged steel slide and forged ordnance grade alloy frame with three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in a variety of models in the popular .4 caliber or 9mm, Taurus' models 909, 911 and 940 offer big firepower in a size that's just right for a variety of carry needs. Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms."

Up for grabs is this T/C encore pistol with a custom-made15 inch brand-new unfired Bullberry barrel in “that’s right .444 Marlin”. I had the barrel custom made by Bullberry Barrel Works with the intention of using it for hunting 450 to 500 pound Black Russian boar in Paso Robles California where I’ve been hunting them for years. Unfortunately I fractured my left tibia and tore the tendon in such a way that I can no longer hike and climb in the way needed to hunt down those big beasts. I paid over $600.00 dollars for the barrel alone, $125.00 for the sights & $150.00 for the receiver. It is tapped for a scope & has 2 sling swivel studs for easy carry.. I’ll let it go for $600.00. This Gun is guaranteed to bring down anything in North America. This is the .444 Marlin next to a Ruger Super Redhawk just for comparison, it's big & it's mean. The second photo is the Encore with a .444marlin round next to a .44 magnum round for size comparison. Why would you want .30-30 herret or 30-30 Win when you can have a real gun? The “Redhawk is NOT FOR SALE”. If you add a 1 inch muzzle break you can then add a shoulder stock and convert it to a carbine. So 2 guns in 1. I am not interested in trades of any kind. I am selling this because I can no longer hunt and am funding another project that I can manage to do. CPL & WA driver’s License a must."

Nickname ""Mississippi"" came from Jefferson Davis appointed Colonel of Mississippi Rifles and were equipped with this rifle model.  Very likely carried in the Civil War (why not?).  Both North and South carried this rifle and through the end of the war was still in use as a sharpshooter's rifle.

Proof marks include two ""w's"" and a ""p"" and eagle head. 1853 stamped top of receiver and side plate. Nice looking bore. Metal is pretty.

Low cost, extremely reliable rifles coupled with equally low cost imported ammunition assured that the SKS would become a favorite. Once the budget-minded shooter has laid down his hard-earned cash for the SKS, he’s rewarded with a rifle whose quality is very disproportionate to its cost. If for some reason some manufacturer decided they were going to go into the business of building SKS rifles, new ones would undoubtedly be 6-8 times the price of what we’re buying now. Simply put, this kind of quality costs money. Top quality, has one small ding in the stock. Never fired, has new sling, Boar Buster Scope, recoil pad, 30 rd mag, gun sock and gun case.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable.Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.Must have ptp or ptc and valid Mn drivers license."

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol."
