That means if you get stuck in a corridor with some evil doer, you wont be trying to maneuver something the size of a walking stick! Secondly, the extended tube adds 3 more rounds to your shooter. That way you can pop off a warning shot and still have enough lead in the smokewagon to do business. Lastly, the nifty little light on the front is there so you can see bad guys in the dark!If you have any questions regarding this post, give me a call at REDACTED.Thank you!"

A simple adjustment turns the laser into an IR illuminator for rapid target identification with night vision goggles (NVGs) and IR sensors. It is ideal as a command pointer, for target marking, and for visual communication between ground forces and aircraft.  Overcoming virtually all ambient lighting conditions, the IZLID 1000P laser places a very powerful and tightly focused IR dot on the target. The bright beam is often used by a Tactical Air Control Party  or Joint Terminal Attack Controller to communicate visually with aircraft and direct airstrikes. The IZLID 1000P is known for its distinctive powerful beam with a 43 km range that stands out from every other IR laser on the battlefield.Tre- REDACTED"

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date. Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. May ship with or without a lanyard loop.

Comes with all original accessories: (2) 15 round magazines, easy loader, interchangeable grips (L, M, & S), safety lock, hard sided case, and documentation.This is an amazing pistol! Shoots like a dream, very easy to control and shoot with accuracy; the kickback is minimal. The trigger is outstanding, definitely the best in its class. Read any review on this gun and you'll see what I mean. It has an excellent ergonomic grip that can be customized to your hand size with easily interchangeable back straps. I have loved owning and shooting this gun, I just don't have time to get the most out of it and could use the cash for some business ventures.This is a great deal for a really nice gun! Don't miss out!Read Walther's description from their website:""The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.""This review from Truth About Guns help to sell me on this pistol. It is for the longer barrel model, but all of the info still applies.http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/07/joe-grine/walther-ppq-m2-5-inch-slide/"

My intention was to make use of the long barrel and create some kind of ""mini Druganov"".  It has the factory-pinned standard AK scope rail on the L side, and I'm sure it will drive tacks with a decent scope.  I added a Druganov style stock that really makes a great cheek weld and adds a little length over the standard AK military stock.  The overall length is just under 42"", making it 4-5"" longer than a standard AK.  I like the original forearm from the Saiga...its light, rock-solid, and is on the slim side of aftermarket options available.  Somewhere along the way I lost interest in putting more effort into this rifle and now I'm selling it.  $1100 cash is the firm price...I can wait as long as necessary, or even keep it until the next assault rifle rush.  I will consider shipping the rifle to a FFL of your choosing, but only if you pay me first...I dont know who in the world would do that, but I'm willing if you are.  So I'm sure this will have to be a local deal in the Houston area.  I am flexible and am willing to meet at a gun shop or other public location around lunch time on weekdays, or any weekends.  I will need you to show me a valid Texas driver's license or CCL and sign a release for my records; I will give you a reciept.Thanks"

You can do research on them but basically what it does it massage your muscles, unlike a tens unit this moves your muscles like its massaging them to work them, get all the bad toxins and other stuff out of there, exactly what a massage does. A tens unit just sends signals to your nerves to stop the pain signals, this actually fixes the muscles. You can have up to 8 pads hooked up at a time healing 8 different places. To buy it new from the company retail is $2500. There's other places you can get it where it may be cheaper or more expensive not sure but I'm wanting to trade for a gun let me know what y'all have.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.   The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on current models are 18"" long; a longer barrel length of 24"" available as the hunter variant.. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style flash hider.  All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel assembly. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from optics and sight systems available on the market. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  FREE SHIPPING!Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."
