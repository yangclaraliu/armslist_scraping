The gun is in beautiful condition, and works great. The Frame, Breech Block, Hammer and Trigger are all beautifully case hardened steel. The 26"" barrel is a really nice piece of machining, as it's 1 1/8"" octagon for the first 11"", then it steps down to 1 1/16"" round and tapers to the muzzle to about 3/4"". The bluing is deep, with NO machine marks present. The butt plate, barrel band, trigger guard and frame pin keeper are all polished brass, again with no rough machining lines. The wood looks to be Walnut, and is in 100% condition. The case hardening is probably 95% or better, and the bluing on the barrel is probably at 90%. The only real flaw is the bluing on the top of the barrel by the rear sight is worn, with some flaws in the finish.The gun shoots wonderfully, and it's really a pleasure to shoot as it's quite heavy, so there's no sharp recoil like a lever action .444 Marlin. The rifle weighs over 10 pounds, and feels nice in your hands or at your shoulder. The stock shape has a nice grip and pleasant drop. Also included in the sale is a box of loaded ammunition and spent brass, as well as high-quality .444 diesIf you haven't fired the .444 marlin, it's really a neat round.  Size-wise and overall performance is similar to high-performance 45-70 rounds (for modern firearms, NOT trapdoors), so it can be loaded at fairly high pressures.  The nice part is it uses .429 bullets, the same as the .44 Magnum, .44 special, .44 Russian, etc.  So there is LOT of options out there for projectiles.  Normally the round can have a sharp recoil when loaded to it's potential, but the weight of this rifle keeps that very comfortable.  My 13 year old son shot heavy loads with no problems, and he's a bean pole!We'll have to go through an FFL for this rifle, but I know one in South Mt Vernon that will do it for only $25. Buyer pays transfer fees. I can also ship the rifle, but keep it mind that actual shipping charges will be fairly high due to the rifle's weight.Give me a call if you want to come look. I'm located near Sedro-Woolley in Skagit County."

A few things about this scope people might not be familiar with due to its similarity to the PST series. 1.The turrets are capped. People freak out about this, but it is due to the reticle design, which is of the Horus type. The reticle is designed to eliminate dialing for both windage and elevation, especially out to long range. This is less busy than most Horus reticles, which means the extra stuff is there when you need it, and you only really notice the main crosshairs when you don't need it. Pic of the reticle subtension below. 2. FFP - meaning that the subtensions are consistent across the whole magnification. This concerns people for short range. I shot a deer at around 40 yards with this on 5X last year in crappy light. Wasn't that hard. 3. MOA instead of MILS. I have shot both, I find that an MOA reticle of the Horus type is extremely useful, especially in a hunting context if you aren't used to thinking in MILs. 4. The PST is illuminated, this is non illuminated. I also think that the reticle is more useful in this scope than any of the PST reticles for wind calls. If they made this scope in MILs and in 4-16 I would have one. But they don't. I believe this scope is most at home on either an SPR or a lighter precision or hunting rig, both of which I have pictured. I purchased this new from Cabelas, it retails for 900 dollars, street price is usually 800 or so, similar to it's slightly different brother the PST. I am selling it because I am interested in precision rifle competition, and want to get a MIL based reticle with more magnification. I will sell for 450 shipped Or I will trade for the below scopes, or scopes similar to them. Vortex PST 4-16 in MILs, either FFP or SFP SWFA 3-15x Vortex HST in 4-16 in MILs. If you have another quality mid range scope in the 3-15 or 4-16 range, that is MIL/MIL, illuminated doesn't hurt, throw it out there."

I'm willing to meet at the gun range and prove it. It will cycle any type of ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger.  I will not come down on price. Thanks"

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.
Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.
No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.Includes:KillflashCaseACOG coverLens BrushOwner's Manual"

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.
Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.
No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps.Includes:KillflashCaseACOG CoverLens BrushOwner's Manual"

It also includes the 1911 style thumb safety. Includes 2 mag and can throw in a holster if the offer is good. Comes with the standard magazine blackstrap lock and another one from M&P with a ring to allow the gun to be dummy corded (shown). I have the original box and interchangeable back straps of the pistol and will sell it with everything it came with. This lightly used gun is a bargain at this price given the extensive trigger upgrades it has. Reason why I am selling it is because I recently got a 1911 and I have little use for another .45 ACP. If I where to keep it, it will simply stay as a fun range gun. Florida resident, valid conceal permit and bill of sale upon purchase. I would preferably transfer the gun through my FFL at my own expense."

Introducing the future of semi-auto excellence!  A technical masterpiece, blending advanced materials with the best in innovative Beretta® technology! Like the gas-operated Blink action capable of firing off 4 shots in less than a second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots in the industry. Or the Kick-Off3 Recoil System that eliminates felt recoil by as much as 70%. Combining hydraulic shock-absorbers with an ultra-soft Micro-Core butt-pad, these systems work together to minimize not only the recoil from the cartridge ignition and firing, but also from the backward-movement of the bolt. Also, the A400 Xplor Unico is designed to recoil parallel to the cheek mount, which also reduces felt kick while giving you faster follow-up shots. Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this Shotgun's balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class. And it can shoot ANY load, lead or steel, from 2 3/4"" to 3 1/2"" magnum, making it extraordinarily versatile too. Upland hunts, duck hunts, small-game hunts, even the clay range... the A400 Xplor Unico looks great and shoots even better. Special features:   Innovative Blink gas-operating system allows it to shoot 4 shots in less than a second   Steelium barrel features a wide, stepped sporting rib that minimizes mirage, and will still outperform other barrels afters years of shooting   Kick-Off3 Recoil System uses two dampers between the stock and pad along with a third damper inside the stock bolt to eliminate up to 70% of felt recoil. The Micro-Core buttpad softens up any remaining recoil   Can safely handle ANY 12 Gauge shell, lead and steel shot, from 2 3/4"" or 3 1/2"" shells, and can handle any power (mild for targets, to hard-hitting for hunters)   Optima Bore HP choke geometry was conceived to offer the best ballistic performance available, with steel or lead shot. Thanks to its design, shot pattern remains perfectly uniform whatever the shell size or load, giving you consistency and accuracy on the hunt and at the range   Includes 3 Beretta® Optima choke tubes (cylinder, modified and full) to modify your pattern   Simple to field-strip, and breaks down into just 5 major components with NO tools   Beretta A400 Xplor Unico Shotgun specifications:   Gauge: 12 Gauge   Action: Semi-automatic   Capacity: 4+1   Barrel length: 28""   Barrel finish: Blued   Stock: Synthetic   Length of pull: NA   Chamber: 3 1/2"" (accepts ANY load from 2 3/4"" to 3 1/2"")   Receiver material: Aluminum   Sights: Front bead   Overall length: NA   Overall weight: 7.1 lbs."
