This rilfe is in very good condition and comes with a BCM 2.5in rail section that was previously used for mounting a light. Can include the Daniel Defense sights (pictured) for additional $110 (paid $155). Rifle will come with 1 Magpul PMAG + Rail section.   This rifle is a blast to run and is very accurate and easy to shoot! I hate to see it go but I have other firearms that I want to try and don't have the space in the safe for all of them.   Price is $1350 for bare rifle and $1460 with sights.   Would prefer cash but will consider trades for IWI Tavor, 5.56 ARs or AKs (7.62x39/5.56 that take AR Mags) of equal value.  Will also consider multiple firearms trades as long as they are equal to the value of this rifle. EXAMPLE: Century C39V2 AK + Aimpoint optic, C39V2 + Glock 19, ect...   I am a CCW holder and would prefer to do business with the same. Please don't contact me if you are not actually ready to do business in a prompt, professional manner. I am a very busy person and don't have the time to waste on people who are just trying to get a knock down drag out deal. I know the value of the rifle and I don't need the money so I do not intend to budge off of the listed price. Take it or leave it.   I work several jobs which means I have commitments 7 days a week. But I will be prompt as possible with my communication and I request that whoever contacts me affords me the same courtesy in an effort to do business quickly and proffesionally.   Thanks for looking!   Pete"

As the Charger is intended to be a multi-tasker adaptable to hunting, target shooting, competition and plinking, instead of iron sights it comes standard with a Weaver rail mounted on top of the receiver, allowing the shooter to mount telescopic or electronic sights. Each pistol came with an adjustable bipod for added control and stability on the range or in the field, while an extended magazine release allowed easy removal of the 10/22 ten-shot rotary magazine.Ruger reengineered the Charger with a threaded barrel with a 1/2-28 thread pattern to accept most popular muzzle accessories, such as suppressors and muzzle brakes. A2-style pistol grips and extended, 15-round BX-15 magazines.This is a pretty cool lightly used gun - maybe like 200 rds - and if you know 10/22s that is like brand new since they go forever. I have a 10/22 and it shoots bulleyes at 100 yards easy. This can do the same but is smaller more compact. It's a duplicate for me so I am offering it here. First $300 gets it. Thanks"

It is a Mauser action with control round feed (CRF).  This would make the perfect truck gun or one you can keep in your cabin throughout the year.  Please call REDACTED."

It's been shot but not much from what I can tell. I've put less than 200 rounds through it since I've owned it and I'd guses it's had less than 500 in its lifetime. The picture doesn't do it justice and armslist will only allow one but I have more pictures available for serious offers. The condition of the rifle is amazing considering the cartridge and configuration. the only non original part on it is somebody put a recoil pad on and lost the original buttplate other than that this rifle is completely unmolested from how it left the factory. I never shot it for an actual group but it never missed any animal I aimed at. The throat looks great and the bore is nice and shiny with good crisp rifling. The hand checkering on the wood is beautiful and only light, light scratches in the finish.This rifle is an extremely rare find in this condition and would be the perfect start or nice addition to your collection.All transfers will be done at an FFL no exceptions."

It's a statement piece for that special someone, or as an investment. Over the last decade the demand for these has sky rocketed, only problem, not many have survived the last 40-50 years of diamond cutters cutting them into brilliant cuts. So with that being said, over the last 10ish years, demand has gone up, value has jumped greatly as well because of the demand it's more than what's available. Also Over the past few years, an increase of roughly 15-20% in value has been very steady on these.Appraised value is $3,520, but I'm not looking to sell it but trade it.Estate jewelers pay between 35-45% of appraised value to turn around to retail it. If you look up these rings you will see them going for a minimum of $2,100 sold price.If your trade is like new with all original accesories or extra stuff I would be willing to add cash on top."

SEAK I was limited to 500 rifles, I have not found any edition limit for SEAK II but judging from the small time frame I doubt more than 500 were made. I have upgraded the rifle with NOS Soviet lamented furniture, I like it more than the poly furniture. It is a great shooting rifle just getting out of the 5.45 x 39 cartridge and focusing on my 7.62 guns. I was trying to sell this as a package with ammo before but have since been told to break it down but the rifle must go first, as I don't want a ton of ammo and magazines sitting around. The rifle buyer will have first shot at the 2100rds of ammo and additional 15 magazines I have for it. The rifle will come with 3 magazines.The only trades I am interested in are other 7.62 AK's, RPK's go to the front of the line. Please no pistols or AR-15's. This is a triangle sidefolder and locks up in both positions perfectly. I have many more pictures and usually promptly reply to emails.
