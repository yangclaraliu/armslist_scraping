Old winch solenoid was bad from water damage, have a brand new upgraded factory replacement that is fully sealed, have not had time to complete the install on it. - Front axle was pushed forward 3in for better angle of approach.- 3in lift all around- Rear diff is welded with 4.56 gears front/rear- Full length sliders welded directly to frame- Very heavy duty bumpers custom built front and rear. Rear gate is removeable to use as a bridge for small gaps.- Smittybuilt 8,000lbs winch - Corbeau bucket seats up front- Working stereo - Two spare locking hubs and recovery gear, including straps and a high lift jack included- Has a full CB unit but it needs to be tuned, I never messed with it.Has been garaged for the last 10 years. I bought I from a guy I work with. I bought if from him as is and have just maintained it ever since. I have only taken it off-road once but was amazed at what it could do. It will go absolutely anywhere! I start it and drive it around a couple miles every month around the neighborhood to make sure it stays in running order.24 pictures available on my craigslist ad http://seattle.craigslist.org/tac/cto/REDACTED.htmlAny questions just ask. 253 four6eight15zero4"

I had Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights installed, which are awesome and only a year old. I also put a Hogue Handall Jr. grip sleeve on, which helped to ""fill"" the grip. 
I've got big hands and yet this tiny pistol fits my hand perfectly. The pinky rest on the mags and Hogue grip definitely help, but even without, it's ergonomics are nice.I bought this used, got the night sights installed, and shot it once, then got a Glock 26 to carry. So, I'm just looking to sell or get something else.If you're looking for a very well engineered ultra sub-compact 9mm, this is it. And it's already got night sights!I've found that trying to sell with ALL mags can make for an unappealing price. So, I'm offering this up for sale at this price with 2 mags, but I also have 4 additional mags that you can buy if interested. ALL are Kahr factory mags, no Promag junk here. 4 of the mags are 6 rounders (with Pierce pinky extension) and 2 of the mags are 7 rounders. For an extra $100, you get the extra 4 mags, which is a great deal.Please email or call/text me (five 1 three - 4 six 0 - five 2 seven 2) with any questions, or to make arrangements to see and buy.Thanks!"
