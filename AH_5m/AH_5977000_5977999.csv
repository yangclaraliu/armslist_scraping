This is an antique in good working condition, likely from the early 1950s, and has no markings other than the “Firearms International Corporation   Washington DC 20022” on the inside of the skeletonized buttplate. The Firearms International firm was begun in around 1952 as a front for the CIA to obtain and ship, through supposed commercial sales channels, surplus firearms to allies of the United States during the Cold War. After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, to which they apparently supplied the weapons, the company was outed and reorganized. They bought, imported, and sold many good guns from various manufacturers and this rifle may have been made by FN in Belgium, although there are no numbers or markings other than the importer info. Cool little survival rifle with a neat history. Face-to-face deals only and full refund if you are not happy with the rifle."

Asked for an AR and as a gift the wife of course purchased me this. She did not know anything about various calibers and Shooterworld kinda took advantage lol. I was looking for 5.56 / .223 and really prefer to build my own upgrades so although a great gift I am looking for something different. This gun is essentially Brand New I did taken it out and put 1 full magazine through it while zeroing another weapon to see what the .22 AR felt like. After serving in Afghanistan two times with the Army I must say this rifle is a lot of fun and I have basically shot everything under the sun. Regardless I prefer a different caliber and want to build something from the ground up. I am open to trades even can through in some cash on my end if it's worth it so feel free to text me some pics and  a proposal...cash always works though Thanks for looking - Skyler

It shoots fine with gas system shut off, but this means it is only a single shot rifle (you have to rack the bolt back after each round to eject spent casing).I have tried to remedy with a new gas valve, but this did not work. Wish i could keep, but i do not have the money or time to figure this out. Could be something as simple as a bore polishing, but then again I am not a gunsmith by trade or hobby. *****UPDATE: Unbeknowst to me, I recently discovered the previous owner has shortened the barrel by removing the grenade launcher completely(which was about 4 or 5 inches). So this rifle is a MODIFIED weapon. Not sure if that has to do with the gas issues but hey, could be the reason why. Looking to trade for any cheap handgun(.38,9mm, etc). OR cash offer. Usually these can be found for $300-400 or so in perfectly running condition."

It is just like any other Handi-rifle with interchangeable barrels. The optic is not garbage, but it ain't no Nightforce either. Works well enough, given the 300 BLK is not good for much more than 300. (Yes, I saw Travis Haley hitting steel at 800 yards, but I can't do it and won't waste the ammo trying.) They don't make these rifles anymore, and I know it is kinda a niche gun, so it is priced accordingly. Works incredibly well for suppressed sub-sonic shots, no clunky cycling, just a hammer fall.   If interested, call or text REDACTED. You can email also, but I will only do face to face for cash.

A 1 7/16"" long Nickel Silver inlay on the top barrel flat is stamped ""W. J. & R. H. SCOTT / ALBANY"" while the name ""REMINGTON"" is discretely stamped on the left flat near the breech. Remington of course started out primarily as barrel manufacturers who would supply gun makers with quality barrels and/or actions. The lock and furniture are nicely engraved throughout, with the lock being marked ""ALBANY"". The barrel has a silvery appearance, likely having been lightly cleaned long ago, and appears to have a thin coat of varnish added. The lock and furniture retain a darker untouched patina. The stock features a coarsely checkered wrist and shows a pleasing untouched original finish. The name ""C. E. SCOTT"" is stamped under the buttstock just behind the triggerguard, likely a relative of the gun maker who made the stock. There is a fine 2"" check on the left side of the buttstock forward of the buttplate and a 6 1/4"" crack forward of the lock. Otherwise the wood is very sound with sharp, clean edges throughout. Engraved iron buttplate, toeplate, and triggerguard. The forward tip of the triggerguard is broken and missing with the rear tip having been repaired. Nickel Silver scroll lock screw escutcheon, wedge escutcheons, and Pewter forend cap. Ramrod pipes and rib appear to be brass and are original (pipes have been re-soldered). Original wood ramrod retains a threaded worm tip. The action functions very well and the nipple is a clean original. Overall a very nice and well marked example of a New York sporting rifle."

This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. Very accurate and smooth shooter The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.The revolver has lots of holster wear and some freckling in a few spots, but this is just honest wear from being on the job for many years. There is wear primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster, but there is also evidence externally of it being a true ""on the job"" weapon. Bore and chambers on the cylinder are good and have been well maintained. After all, this officer's life depended on this gun working every time he might have to pull the trigger. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.The gun came to me with beautiful custom-made dark walnut with target thumb rest grips. I will include them in the sale, but the buyer also gets an additional pair of S&W wood grips and rubber Pachmayr Gripper grips. I have attached pics of the gun with the original target grips, as well as pics of both additional grips installed. Local face-to-face cash sale only.

Together, Cooper’s team had over 50 years of combined experience, so it didn’t take long for Cooper to establish a reputation for making some of the finest shooting bolt-actions many of which are adorned in high-grade wood in the US. Another attribute of a Cooper rifle is extreme accuracy. Each Cooper comes with a 1/2 MOA accuracy guarantee and a test target to prove it (pictured). The Cooper Model 54 Classic is designed to deliver maximum accuracy in a mid-weight hunting rifle. Built to excel in the harshest and roughest conditions, it will not let you down in the moment of truth. An exceptionally accurate rifle with classic looks in a proven all-around hunting cartridge!

These are the most Historically Accurate produced AK Rifles produced today right down to the Cryllic Selector and receiver markings and the serial number matching on the trunion and receiver. This Rifle was purchased in 2014 at the cost of $1200 from James River Armory and you won't find another one like it for sale anywhere  as this example features not only the Cryllic selectors markings but also the factory manufactures marking on the receiver in a star. I have yet to see another one like it. These Historically Accurate AK-47s are in very high demand and are currently sold out everywhere. The only current example I could find anywhere is on gunbroker at a cost of $1200 plus shipping. I believe the rifle itself is unfired except for the factory test fire as there is no wear on the front or rear trunions where the bolt slams against during recoil. If it was fired after the build it was very very little. The only wear on the entire rifle is a spot where the varnish has flaked on the  front bottom handguard which I believe came from moving it around in a safe. Just Google James River Armory Ak or AKM reviews and you will find several great articles on them which explain the painstaking detail that is used when producing these Rifles right down to the markings, correct sized rivets, and original bluing procedures. These are as close as you will come today to having a real Polish AK-47 from 1968 (minus the full auto of course).
