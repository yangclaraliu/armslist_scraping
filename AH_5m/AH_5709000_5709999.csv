I had some issues on my first lower and chipped the teeth of the endmill. It still cut right through both lowers even after that so it's not a big deal but they sell new end mills for $27.99 if you really want one. Overall this jig made it very easy to complete my lowers and I would highly reccomend it. I will accept cash in the Denver metro area or a Paypal transfer to ship it.
