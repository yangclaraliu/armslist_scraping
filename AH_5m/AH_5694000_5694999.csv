Rock solid shooter, zero failure to feed/fire over 200 rounds. I love this pistol just need something smaller to carry in my dress clothes. Very low recoil due to the weight of the full Metal frame and slide. There is some holster wear from carrying it. The fit is phenomenal for such a low priced pistol but the finish could leave a little to be desired but what more can you ask."

The only downside I can find with this weapon is that it seems to have lost some varnish on the front end, but not a lot as it is barely noticable. Blueing is near perfect. Chambered in 7.62x54R this weapon would make an excellent addition to any collection. Price is 1450 OBO, and I will entertain trades."

I have a 1943 Izhevsk Mosin Magan 91/30. Barrel is in great shape. All metal parts are original and matching. This particular rifle was one of the top shooters of the time when made. It was pulled off the line, drilled and tapped for a scope. There is evidence of these drill holes in the receiver. There is a very high chance this bad boy was on the front lines dishing out some commie justice to nazis. After the war, it was re-arsenaled. The scope was removed, the holes were filled is and the scope number was crossed off of the barrel. There was another stock put on it and it sat and waited for its chance to come back around. It was crated and sent to the States. I purchased it and loved shooting it. Still do. It was very well taken care of and is still in great shape. I am now looking to get rid of it. I love Mosins, but I really want a Remington Arsenal Mosin. I'm looking for $300. This is a great rifle, and shows the marks of being a sniper rifle. Could have seen action in Stalingrad.

I have fired less than 200 rounds through this rifle and other than an improperly staked bolt carrier key screw it functions flawlessly. I looked online and plenty of people say you can either stake it with a punch and hammer or a staking tool. I haven't had the time or money to get it restaked by a gunsmith and I didn't want to try and restake it myself. If you tighten the screw by hand it functions fine for about 60+ rounds but after that it starts short stroking and fails to extract the spent cartridge. Other than this, the rifle is in great condition. I'm formerly active duty Military and have spent pleanty of time using and maintaining AR platform rifles. I have babied this rifle and made sure it never got put back in the safe with out a thorough cleaning and a proper coating of CLP. The rifle comes with one factory aluminum magazine. I have installed a Magpul B.A.D lever and it can be included with the rilfe if buyer wants for an added cost. I'm asking $650 or best offer (no trades please), I won't sell to anyone who can't produce a valid NV Drivers Licence or ID card at the time of sale.for those interested in more info on this rifle, this is a link to DPMS's website: http://www.dpmsinc.com/MOE-WARRIOR_ep_91-1.html"
