There are some light scratches on the barrel/stock from normal field use.  This gun shoots fantastic groups, the only reason I'm selling it is to get a larger caliber.  I had this rifle glass bedded and it increased accuracy immensely.  I have the original packaging, user manual, warranty card(lifetime warranty) and purchase receipt for the scope as well.  Also included is the rifle owners manual and gun lock.  I'll also throw in 18 rounds of mismatched .270 ammo to shoot up at the range.  $650 obo."

Now kel-Tec and Utas uts make somethign similar but for a lot more moeny anyhwere from 850 to 2,000.

I would believe that without a doubt as I put 60rds through the gun myself and wasn't even trying to be as accurate as possible and still landed every shot on a 8x12 target about 100 yards away. It is very accurate! The first 4 rounds jammed, but all I did was adjust the gas port one notch every shot and after I got it running there wasn't a single malfunction. This is a Metric FAL not the Inch pattern. I was hoping to get an FAL with a folding stock, but my financial situation is in a bad spot so I'm listing this for the next few days until my paycheck gets here then the price is going up or I'm taking the ad down. I already have a great .308 so I don't need this or I wouldn't be listing it. This FAL was built by Dow in Dade City which is ran by Bruce Dow who is considered one of the best gunsmiths in Florida. You can feel free to research him and know this firearm is Top Notch! It is on an Imbel receiver ( most sought after and the first receiver brought into the states ). It has a 16"" barrel with a DSA mounted top cover for any optics you would like to run as well as a SAW stock ( cost $200+ alone ) that has a flip up metal shoulder rest to help stabilize any shots. Comes with 2 magazines and the Sling pictured. Price is $1200About the lowest you will find an Imbel Receiver FAL on an Imbel Kit. ( Not even including the DSA rail cover for mounts and the SAW stock. )Not interested in trades unless it's an AK + cash, a Galil , a MPX , or a Sig Sauer P938 + cash.You can email me on here or best thing to do would be to text me at ( I don't usually answer numbers I don't recognize ) 904-5zero9-0517Located close to Jacksonville ( about 30-45 minutes west ) towards Lake City.
