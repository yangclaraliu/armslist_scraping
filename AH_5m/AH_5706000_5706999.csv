I'm up in the air as far as if I want to sell it or not. SWFA SS 3-15x42 FFP in LT 808 Larue QD rings. Keeps the optic just about as low as you can get, with still being able to run a 50mm obj if you need. This is lighter than a normal LT-104 and not needed in the 308 AR frames.Accuracy...My pet 175GR Loads (44gr Varget 175Gr SMK pill in Nato Brass) shoot around 1/4"" @ 100yds. My favorite plinker load (PMC BRONZE 147GR) will shoot 1/2"" @ 100yds!  (I have photos to back this claim up as well)Quick story about me. I used to be a machinist, working for a couple of different shops in the So Cal region. I ran a gun company with a friend and manufactured barrels, receivers, etc.. I've put together THOUSANDS of AR variants, and fixed PLENTY. I served time in the USMC, and have been around guns all my life. This is a great rifle, I've never had a problem with it (except when I was shipped a AR15 Rifle buffer spring... BROWNELLS!!!!) But I hate to see it go, I know I can always build another one later down the road. But money is tight, I'm supporting the wife going back to school and working full time.California is going down a slippery slope, and I don't know if we will ever be able to get AR variants in the future. It would be a great gun for someone that wants to step up from a AR15 to the big boy version. Unloaded, naked and stripped down to just MBUS sights it comes in just under 9lbs with an empy mag. So its pretty light given it has a pretty heavy 18"" barrel. It would make for a great pig rifle for you hunters. And its accurate enough to take to a Precision Rifle match. Price I'm going to start at $2000, This will include a 10rd magazine and no sights. Optic I'll let go for $800 with the scope rings. (SS 3-15x42 FFP in Larue QD rings)I also have a SWFA SS 3-9x42 FFP that I'd sell for $550 with rings (Larue QD Rings $200 alone)"

The bow is made by Jennings when it was owned by Bear Archery. The bow is one of the later generations when they started to improve the quality of the Black Lightning Series. According to online people, this has compression molded glass limbs and are more durable than the older models. The bow is in very good condition. I got this about 10 years ago as a young teenager. I practiced a few times with it, took it hunting (never got a deer with it), and put it in storage. Originally, it was at a 24"" pull with 45lb draw weight. Last year, I went back to the place where I bought in Bay City, Michigan (Bay Archery). I am 6'-4"" so I had the draw made to about 36-40"" and 60lbs. I would say that I have shot it less than 100 times.  Has a lot of character and still looks modern. If your looking to get your kid into a bow that will grow with him, this would be perfect.

This carbine conversion will turn your Glock pistol into a Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) in about 4 seconds. That's all it takes to firmly secure your pistol inside the conversion and it is a rock solid setup. No rattling, no loose pistol.  It has a non-reciprocating charging handle on the left side which racks the slide inside the conversion.  All of your other pistol controls are still functional.  There are 4 picatinny rails on the handguard for mounting accessories (Magpul AFG in photos is included), with the top rail running about 3/4 the length of the conversion to enable use of optics or BUIS.  The carbine conversion utilizes most any AR-15 stock and is currently outfitted with a Magpul UBR stock.  Use of the conversion provides the shooter with greater accuracy at greater distances than would normally be possible with the pistol alone.  The Hera Triarii normally sells for around $495 and the Magpul UBR stock around $250.  All NFA rules apply.  If you want to use the carbine conversion with a stock, you will first need to apply and be approved for a federal tax stamp for your Glock pistol. Check out the following video to see the Hera Arms Triarii in action!  https://youtu.be/B1A53A39clENOTE - this ad is for the carbine conversion kit only, Glock pistol and hi-cap magazine in photos are NOT included.Price is $550. Cash Only. No Trades. Pick up in Martinsville or I can ship via UPS Ground for actual insured shipping cost to your address, with payment to be made via PayPal. Email me with any questions."

Please let us know if you have any questions.In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application.
If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series."

The other Scabbard appears to have been used but is in excellent shape. The new Scabbard has Olive color to the leather and they used one has a standard brown leather color. Both have good working locks. Both bayonet and Scabbard are free dents, Knicks, dings and chips.These particular models we're only made for two years in 1956 and 1957 and are not particularly rare but are not as common as the 1958 model which they continue to make to this day.I will sell them for cash price of $120 each or would prefer to trade for a decent .380 or 9mm hand gun for my wife. I work OKC during the week and we have 65 acres down in McAlester where my wife and children stay. A rifle just doesn't cut it when it comes to self defense if she needs to use it in the house.You may contact me via email or by phone or text at REDACTED anytime day or night.Thank you!"

She is 1 of 1000 that were made during the 3rd and last run of the 629 Mountain Gun.The 629 Mountain Gun was a limited run/edition revolver that was also done for the model 29. They were produced to be a ""lightweight"" backcountry carry gun. There were only 3 production runs of it between 1989 to 2005, making them sought after by collectors. Total production number for both models was 15000 with 6 dashes/changes on the 629 during the timeframe of production. My 629-6 Mountain Gun was in the 3rd and last production run. There were only 1000 629's produced during that run. The Mountain Gun had square butts until dash 4, then went to round butts. It came with a tapered 4"" Barrel that was 2ozs lighter than the 629 Classic. Mountain gun also had beveled/curved areas around the end of the cylinder for smoother placement of the revolver back into a holster. The MG had a smooth textured trigger, whereas the Classic had the target style serrations texture. MG maintained wide hammer. MG front sight post was all black, as well as rear adj. sight post. The classic had red front sight post with white outlined rear post. The dash-6 came with the lock. $950 cash, or $1100 cash and/or trade. CWP preferred, but SCDL with no felonies will be required."
