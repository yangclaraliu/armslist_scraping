The B-14 Hunter rifle features a molded synthetic stock made of glass fiber reinforced polymer. As with the entire B-14 Series, the Hunter brings Bergara Barrel accuracy to a line of hunting rifles that is affordable to serious big-game hunters. Built in Spain at our highly automated and efficient barrel factory, this rifle delivers a level of quality and performance that is unmatched in its price range.
The world-renowned Bergara barrel on this rifle for hunting whatever your heart desires is complemented by our own super-smooth B-14 Action, which is a two-lug system with a Sako-style extractor and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure a smooth feeding and extraction of the cartridge. It’s also outfitted with a Bergara curved trigger we designed to guarantee a crisp, clean pull every time you fire the rifle. The trigger comes set at about three pounds. The Hunter is available with either a hinged floor plate or a detachable magazine. It has been factory drilled and tapped to fit Remington 700 style rings and bases.
The (#3) Bergara 4140 CrMo steel barrel is finished in matte blue and is available in 22 inches on the short action, which weighs 7.05 lbs and 24 inches on the long action, which weighs 7.35 lbs. Our stocks are bedded with integral pillars for stability and enhanced accuracy.
During the molding process solid steel pillars are inserted and permanently molded into place, providing a secure and stable bedding surface for the barreled action. The base color is green with tan and black flecks, providing a very tasteful camo look.  A SoftTouch coating gives the stock soft, tacky feel that is easy to grip even in harsh weather."

Pulling from his background in law enforcement, training and his passion for competition, allowed a truly special pistol to be formed. The 5"" Shadow Hawk Government with the RMR sight is a unique blending of the pistolsmithing skills at Nighthawk Custom along with Mr. Fisher, and the electronic sight geniuses at Trijicon. The Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is the most rugged miniature red dot sight available and works in any lighting condition. This red dot sight allows faster first-shot target acquisition and follow-up shots. The RMR helps those with aging eyes to enjoy handgun shooting again or just be more proficient in their shooting. Attention to detail starts with the one piece machined steel magwell/mainspring housing for quick and sure reloading of the Shadow Hawk. You will notice the chiseled look and feel of the black flat faced trigger preferred by competition shooters. The gun is topped front and rear with Trijicon Tall Tritium Night Sights. The rear sight is integral to the base plate used to mount the RMR. This one piece unit is built for sturdiness and durability. An advantage of these sights is that a suppressor can be used effectively without having to change out to other sights, as long as you have specified the threaded barrel option. They will co-witness with or without a suppressor attached. Your hands will quickly notice the high undercut on the trigger guard along with 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The high beaver tail will amaze you with the almost seamless fit and finish. Spiral cut black and gray G10 grips add a subtle highlight to the black nitrite finish. The stainless bushing contrasts nicely with the slide and frame. The aggressive cocking serrations are not just for looks but provide a sure purchase to rack the slide. Finally, leaving nothing to chance, we have beveled and recessed the slide stop to allow for the addition of Crimson Trace Laser Grips if you so choose. One you get the chance to use the Shadow Hawk Government with the amazing Trijicon RMR sight, you'll have a true appreciation for the experience, thought process, and technology that went into this particular pistol.

Before someone starts with why a safety on a Glock or it's between your ears stuff.....This was my family camping and hiking gun. I preferred to leave one in the Chamber in the tent without the worry of the kids bumping into it in the dark. Remember it does have a very light trigger -￼. When I'm solo I just turn off the safety and leave it off. So have it on or off - pretty simple.Also, has a Trijicon front night sight. Box and 2 mags.

By eliminating the barrel bushing and installing a full-length guide rod and a coned (wafered) match grade barrel, accuracy is improved and recoil is reduced. The added weight to the muzzle along with the full length guide rod dampens the recoil and muzzle flip, which allows for faster follow up shots, giving the shooter a distinct advantage. Nothing short of an engineering masterpiece, the fit between the integral barrel wafer and the slide is impeccably executed to appear as one, yet the two never contact each other. The Predator is the perfect candidate for protection, uniform, competition, hunting and recreational employment. Mr. Browning would be envious. One Gun.

I'm selling ( now sold) my AK, so I don't need the mags anymore, and since these are now considered collector's items, i figured I'd sell it seperately, rather than include it with the AK (and basically get nothing out of it). I bought these Russian 40-rounders maybe 10 years ago, they were sold as new, and still are. I put some of these on another classfied site recently, with a bulk price, and I got 3 ""I'LL TAKE THEM"" messages out of Atlanta within 15 minutes, so apparantly, they're hard to find and very desirable. The only place I could find these on-line, had them for $39.95, plus shipping, and those were permanently altered (i.e. ""wrecked"") to only hold 10 rounds.Along with numerous other strange little proof/arsenal stamps, it has the ""star in the shield"" stamp on the upper right side of the spine, indicating Russian manufacture at the Vyatskie Polyany Arsenal, also known as ""Molot"" (see 2nd photo). Thanks for looking..........M.edit: Sorry, no shipping to ban states !!!! (in fact, I'm not wanting to bother with shipping, at all.) And, if the ad is still up, then it's still for sale !!!"

This is a Just Right Carbine (JRC) chambered in 45 acp. This has been completely gone through and upgraded by the factory with new bolt, feed ramps, extractor and spring, etc. This has all of the newer upgrades to make it shoot more reliably and is something the vast majority of the other of these out there do not have. It is ready to tear up the range. This takes Glock magazines. This has Magpul Flip Sights and a Red/Green/Blue dot sight with cantilever mount, adjustable Buttstock, MFT Buttstock cheek weld enhancement, quad rail, threaded barrel, thread protector, magazine, quad rail cover on Palm area, and box. This is a great little gun and is a blast to shoot.  I would also consider trades. Really only interested in CZ Scorpion, CMR30, towards a 1927-a1 type (Tommy gun), AR10, maybe even a CETME or similar build in 308. May consider other offers. Some trades will need boot on my end, some will on yours. Mainly looking for cash though, so trade will have to be really worth it. Pickup in Norman only. Thanks for looking and happy hunting."
