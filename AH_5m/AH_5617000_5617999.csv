Rifle was imported with the threaded barrel and shaved bayonet lug but with the cleaning rod under the barrel intact, so this was definitely an early one.  Rifle already had the original folding stock installed with a thumb hole stock attached on the rear which was removed by the previous owner and an original Chinese pistol grip installed. Also comes with original sling, green oil bottle and magazine shown in picture. This is a rifle you just don't see very often anymore.I will NOT sell this rifle for cash, interested in mil surplus items like Garands, 91/30 sniper rifles, Jap rifles and pistols, K98 rifles, 1903 Springfields, Walther PP and PPK, etc. I know what these guns sell for so low ball offers and offers of plastic guns will be ignored. One of these guns on Gunbroker Item# 565394829 is currently selling for over 1k, please feel free to look it up. Only difference is mine can still retain the cleaning rod, the one on GB has the standard MAK barrel which can't. I'll entertain all reasonable offers, but they must be realistic, I'm not hard to deal with. Must be willing to meet locally. Email or text to REDACTED. Thanks for looking."

I bought this gun about 1 year ago. It has worked well and been a blast to shoot, but I'm looking to buy a 10mm with the money made from this sale. Would consider trade. This is a great rabbit/ coyote gun! Also destroys water jugs/ watermelons very well ( search youtube and you'll find plenty of videos). Comes with both interchangeable barrels. Basically 2 guns in 1For those unfamiliar with the 22 TCM, it is based off the .223 case, but cut down to about the length of a 9mm. It sends a 40 grain .223 bullet at ~ 2000 fps. Very low recoil and easy to shoot with lots of power. Look it up on youtube; you'll be impressed! This is a double stack 5"" barrel 1911 style handgun. 17 +1 capacity. To switch between calibers you simply swap the barrels and recoil springs. The magazine accepts both 9mm and 22 TCM rounds.  Included with sale: 22 TCM/9mm handgun w/ 5"" barrel (used) 2 22 TCM reloading dies ( resizing and bullet seating dies. resizing die has been slightly shortened to allow for deeper resizing) ~900 (probably closer to 950, but I havent counted) 40 grain jhp .223 bullets (not loaded rounds) for reloading 22 TCM. These were ordered from armscor and are the same bullets used in stock ammo.  ~ 1 lb Hodgdon lil'gun powder. opened and used, but I won't have any use for it once I sell this gun so it's your if you want it.  interchangeable wooden grips for 22 TCM (I made these myself and they're not the perfect fit, but I'll throw them in if you want them).  ~ 100-150 22 TCM brass ( I could reload these for you if interested) Carrying case for 22 TCM, both barrels, both recoil springs, 1 17 rnd magazine. Latch on right side of carrying case missing, but stays closed without any problems. 22 TCM MSRP: $851900 bullets ~$55Lee 22 TCM reloading dies $46.98Hodgdon lil'gun powder $25Total value: $977.98 asking $650 since it's used. Would consider shipping to FFL of your state if outside of Oregon if you cover shipping."

The Suomi was originally the main submachine gun used by the Finnish forces in the Winter War of 1939-1940 and the Continuation War, as well as other forces during and after WWII, and was the basis for the later Russian PPSH-41 design. Barrel is orignal Finnish barrel with mandatory extension welded on by importer (TNW) to comply with SBR restrictions. Receiver is made in USA I believe to comply with 922r, but all other parts are original Finn. The carbine shoots great and has a slightly improved trigger than most of the rebuilds/imports floating around. Seriously a fun gun to shoot (just read reviews) with tight shot group, but I've got a couple other things I'm really wanting to put in the collecton right not. These are getting hard to find, as they are no longer produced or imported. Yes, it is heavy, as this once SMG was made for real men in the 1930s and needed to be able to function properly in freezing temperatures and stand up to the elements of war."

It's one of the softest shooting AR15's on the market due to intermediate gas system tuning.  Lower features a unique forged ambidextrous lower and a proprietary enhanced bolt design for increased realibility and function.   The SR-15 E3 Mod 2 series’ 5.56 mm NATO barrel is manufactured for military grade durability, and is free-floated inside a URX4 M-LOK handguard. An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The ambidextrous bolt release, selector lever, and magazine release offers left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The 5.56 mm 3-Prong Flash Eliminator interferes with propellant gas combustion forward of the muzzle to significantly reduce flash signature, will not ring upon firing or when struck, and is compatible with the Knight’s line of 5.56 mm QDC Signature Reduction Devices.Cash Discount Price: $2300 + TaxLocated off Exit 7 off I-405 in the Renton Hawk's Landing."

She is the original owner of this classic .22SL/.22LR single shot rifle. She received it as a gift as a teenager in the late 1960's and has not used it much in many years. This gun is in way above average shape for these guns. Please see the pictures. The only things not perfect would be the one place where there was some mild pitting on the outside of the barrel and some wear to the finish on the wood of the stock near the butt. The inside of the barrel appears like new. I have test fired the gun with no problems and it has been re-cleaned and lubed. She is also wanting to include the cleaning kit and some ammo that she had which are both also pretty old. The test firing I did was with some of the old ammo and it worked. She has kept it in a cloth cover which will also be included. It is the cloth that is under the gun in the picture. Please text if you want more pictures or call or text if you want to see it and purchase. Thanks for looking!

It is in probably 99%, with almost 100% perfect bluing and absolutely beautiful walnut wood. The action works as it should, and the gun shoots great. Like all 62A's, it is a take-down model, and it easy made into two pieces, the longest of which is 26"". The 23"" barrel has crisp, clean rifling. The action cycles shorts, longs and long rifles well for me, and holds a ton of them in the tubular magazine. I think it holds 15 long rifles, and around 30 shorts! With the long barrel, shooting CB makes less noise than a pellet gun. No need for a silencer!I can't express how nice this gun looks. The bluing is only worn off where the action slides, but that's it. The gun looks 100% perfect other than that. It looks like it has been used a few times and put in a safe for 60 years! I purchased from an estate years ago, and no longer ""need"" it. I can e-mail more close-up pictures on request.  The serial number of 344XXX indicates the rifle was manufactured in 1956.  I have been told by fellow armslisters that the front sight and steel butplate are not original.  Both are in good condition.We'll have to go through an FFL for this rifle, but I know one in South Mt Vernon that will do it for only $25. Buyer pays transfer fees. Due to it's age, Selling directly to FFL C&R holders would be OK with me. I can also ship the rifle directly to C&R holders, or to your local FFL for just the price of shipping.Shoot me an email if you want to come look. I'm located near Sedro-Woolley in Skagit County."

Original folding rear sight is also present and complete. This firearm is in absolutely beautiful condition, has been in my collection for many years, and I hesitate to sell it. No rust or significant wear anywhere on this firearm.  The classically styled one-piece stock is free from cracks, significant dings or scratches. The polished lacquer presentation finish is unlike any other I have ever seen on a Model 100. Winchester reportedly stopped production because they were too expensive to manufacture, which probably means a pretty damn fine firearm. This one would make a fine collector piece or a great “classic” hunting rifle. The firing pin recall was completed by a competent gunsmith, and I believe that is the only change from factory condition."
