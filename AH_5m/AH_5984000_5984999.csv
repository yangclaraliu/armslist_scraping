I will also include 50 rounds of ammo as well to sweeten the deal. I have cleaned the gun 3 times. Once before I ever shot her, (oiled her up), once after I put 50 rounds through it, and once again 2 months later just because I got bored and wanted to keep in perfect condition. She has rested in her case for the 9 months that I have owned her. I HAVE ONLY SHOT BRASS THROUGH THIS GUN. No crappy steel ammo, and remember, she has only had 50 rounds fired through her total. Feel free to inspect the gun however you'd like. I can field strip it for you in a matter of seconds. I will not entertain low ballers, and I am NOT open for trade, as I am in dire need of the money.

Pretty much new. Willing to meet within the surrounding area. Murphy, Wylie, east Plano, north Garland, and Richardson. Thanks!Description:The advanced SureFire SF3P-762-5/8-24 three-prong flash hider, which fits the Armalite AR-10, DPMS LR308, and 7.62 mm rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads, features a patent-pending design that greatly reduces muzzle flash—typically greater than 99%—when compared with a plain muzzle. Boasting robust tines built to withstand the rigors of combat, the SF3P-762-5/8-24 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 7.62 mm Fast-Attach suppressors, the SOCOM762-RC model having recently won the Mk13 .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle contract award with the US Special Operations Command in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted. Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—and including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SF3P-762-5/8-24 flash hider is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning, even after extreme use. When used in conjunction with a SureFire SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SF3P-762-5/8-24 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment and to prevent the audible ringing of tines inside the suppressor. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. SureFire flash hiders are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment and are covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee. Fits: Armalite AR-10, DPMS LR308, and 7.62 mm rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threadsMounts: All SureFire SOCOM Series 7.62 mm /.308 caliber sound suppressors"

I have polshed this revolver to a pretty good looking shine; if you added some wood grips this revolver would be super sweet. Being chambered in 357 magnum makes this a great gun to carry 38 Special +P in as it will absorb most recoil, and since the parts are cast for 357 pressures this handgun will last literally forever if you mostly shoot 38 Specials out of it. Having the 2.25 inch bore makes this a great CCW option, open carry option, truck gun, or just a plicking gun. I can easily get on paper with the DA pull up to 25 yards, any decent marksman can easily shoot this revolver. There has been maybe three hundred rounds of mostly 38 Special. Cabelas is selling this same SP101 for $624.99 plus tax, I am asking $600 and this includes the the Ross Leather holster that cost $60, so in reality I am selling this SP101 for $540.

I inherited my father's Remington model 12 since then so all this is for sale. Everything here is genuine Browning and I'm not interested in splitting any of this up.A living tribute to John Moses Browning! Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning Semi Automatic-22. The SA-22 is one of the first autoloading rimfire rifles ever made, and one of the most desirable. One of John M, Browning's final designs, his genius shines through in every detail. The slim, forged steel receiver and slender barrel take down into two compact units without tools."

http://www.brownells.com/rifle-parts/barrel-parts/rifle-barrels/ar-15-m16-9mm-threaded-barrels-prod53925.aspx
 
The barrel likely has about 500 rounds through it, and the condition will attest to this.  You won't find a nicer 9mm carbine barrel for a pistol-caliber build.UPDATE: I installed a hydraulic buffer in my SBR, so now I also have available the YHM 9mm buffer which I will throw in.  These are $50 +/- before shipping and are specifically designed for the recoil of the 9mm blowback carbine."
