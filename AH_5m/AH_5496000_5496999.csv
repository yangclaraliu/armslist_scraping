One magazine has an issue where the pistol won't lock back after the magazine is empty. Theother magazine works just fine. the pistol wasn't cleaned after the last firing because I moved up from southern vermont into a apartment complex. I don't have an open spacewhere the fumes won't kill me to clean it, and no privacy so the neighbors won't freak out.  I am selling it for $400, these normally for for about $600-$650 range. The low price isn't becauseits crap, but because I know how much it sucks to go on Armslist looking for a deal and people have the prices of their guns jacked up. This was listed for awhile but took it down because I wasn't sure if buyers were serious. I also have 250 rounds of underwood ammo I can throw in for extra if you want to deal. I am open to trades as well .Its a great piece, but I don't see the point of owning something I can't use.Of course you have to be a vermont resident and no criminal record.

230,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5496230,For Sale:  Soldier Marked Civil War Rifle!,"Spartanburg, Greenville, South Carolina","$ 2,000","Listed On: Thursday, May 19, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale: likely 50th Mass. Soldier Carved, Rifled and Sighted Springfield 1842 Pattern Musket and Bayonet ... A very nice example of one of the last smooth bore muskets made and likely one of the first to be rifled. When the 1855 series of arms introduced rifling for all shoulder arms, there was a rush to retrofit older smooth bores. Cone-in-barrel percussion conversions could not withstand the higher pressures caused by the new minie rounds until the breeches were changed, but the 1842 pattern smooth bore muskets could handle the new ammunition and moved to the head of the line for rifling at the arsenals, some being given the 1855 pattern long range rear sight as well. This one is a very nice example of the rifled and sighted '42.
Overall the metal shows armory bright, as is correct, the lock plate having clear Springfield 1853 marks at rear and the Springfield eagle/US forward. Lock plate and hammer are smooth with smokey gray over silver. The barrel is generally a tad lighter silver/gray with an overlay of that powdery dark gray tiny dimpling from exposure and use, but with clear V/P/eagle proofs and clear 1854 date on the breechplug tang. The mismatched dates are TOTALLY CORRECT on a ""rifled and sighted"" model 1842. The guns were disassembled and the parts sorted without regard to which gun they came off of. The barrels were rifled, some were given long range sights as this one has, all steel parts were refurbished, and then the muskets were reassembled without regard to whether the dates matched. What makes this musket so interesting are the added markings put on by the soldier. Four small circles have been stamped around a central oval just forward of the bolster on the top of their barrel. This may be a rough representation of a Catholic symbol based on Jesus in a central circle surrounded by four other circles containing crosses and two human figures in each. Further evidence of religious symbolism is a clearly carved Christian cross on the left side flat, This cross has a Celtic flavor with half a circle incised above the cross arms. The traditional Celtic cross bears a complete circle, but this seems very close. The initials “GS” and “GHS” next to a “50 M..” have been deeply carved on the underside near the triggerguard, another “G” to rear of the lock. Research was as follows:50 M assumed to represent the unit designation... There are only two states beginning with the letter ""M"" that also have 50 regiments of infantry. These are Massachusetts and Missouri. Each state has one soldier bearing the initials GHS in their 50th Regiments. The least likely in my opinion is George H Shephard who enlisted 9/15/1864 and has no record of date of discharge. The more likely owner in my opinion is George H. Spofford a 28 year old shoe cutter from Georgetown, Mass. He enlisted in the 50th Mass 9/19/62 and served his entire term of service until 8/24/63 when the entire regiment was mustered out of service. He then rejoined the 17th Unattached Company of infantry and served again from late 1864 through June of 1865. I believe the Catholic and Celtic symbols on the gun are more likely done by someone from the densely Catholic state of Massachusetts... though Missouri did have 4,362 Catholics residing there when the Civil War broke out according www.theCatholicthing.org. The 50th Mass. has a decent history. The 50th left for New York, Nov. 19, 1862 arriving the following day, and being almost immediately ordered thence to Camp Banks, Long Island, the rendezvous of the Banks expedition to Louisiana. The regiment was conveyed from Fort Monroe to Louisiana in fragments. At Baton Rouge the regiment was assigned to Dudley's (3d) Brigade, Augur's (1st) Division, l9th Corps, and before the arrival of the last three companies it had, on March 14, taken part in the demonstration against Port Hudson, made in cooperation with Farragut's fleet, two vessels of which, the HARTFORD and the ALBATROSS, succeeded in passing the Port Hudson batteries and securing a position on the river above the city. From this time until March 26, the regiment was at Winter's plantation on the west bank of the Mississippi about three miles below Port Hudson. On the latter date it returned to Baton Rouge. On May 12 the regiment proceeded to White's Bayou about ten miles southeast from Port Hudson where it remained until the 26th when it moved up to the works in front of the city. It took part in the assault on Port Hudson, May 27, its losses, however, being slight. It did not participate in the second assault, June 14, but was engaged in supporting batteries and in trench duty until the surrender of the city, July 9. From this time on for about twenty days it was in Port Hudson doing guard duty. On July 29 it boarded the steamer OMAHA bound for Cairo, Ill., en route for home. At Helena, Ark., the boat grounded on a sand bar, and the regiment was transferred to the steamer L. M. KENNETT, reaching Cairo, Aug.5. Here it entrained for Massachusetts, reaching Boston, Aug. 11. After a collation at Beach Street Barracks the regiment was marched to the Common and there dismissed, to reassemble at Wenham Mass., August 24.where it was formally mustered out of the United States service.Overall VG condition. Nipple is in good shape, some signs of use, but not battered. 1855 pattern long range rear sight with ladder is in place. Wood has a pleasing dark, uniform tone, and pretty sharp edges around the lock and sideplate, but the gun did see action: some minor dings overall and one small chip at the rear point of the lockplate. All bands, swivels and springs are in place, as is the front sight and bayonet stud. Rod is the correct rod for a ’42, and is the first pattern '42 rod. You also get the correct bayonet: good US marking, functional locking ring, etc. A scarce gun in its own right and even better with the tangible carving which reveals the history.

This is a fantastic pistol,looks and functions as new; with only two trips to the range, cleaned, now just sits in the safe.
 
Need a home defense or a perfect Concealed Carry Weapon that does not jam, is thin, small, light weight, packs a full (10) rounds of ammo, and totally disappears in a holster or pocket...? This is the one.
 
This off roster pistol is the only one I found for sale in California, unless your in Law Enforcement of course.

536,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5496536,For Sale/Trade:  Bulldog - Belgium made,"West, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 100,"Listed On: Thursday, May 19, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Belgium made British Bulldog revolver. 90% functional. This 'oldie' is a Belgian version of the old 'bulldog' pocket pistols. Probably a 450 or .455, or comparable , black powder certified by the proof marks that are also Belgian. Belgium made bulldog style revolver. Black powder, belgian proof marks.No brand or serial # on it anywhere. Style looks like a Jules Warnant or Pryese.As you can see in the pics, it is marked ""made in Belgium"". Cylinder is 5 shot, measures approx. 1.25"" long(32mm) Barrel is 4"" long.Based on some of the design features I believe this is a Jean Warnant, or a really good copy like a Webley Pryse style. Jean & Julien Warnant worked on projects of revolvers and improved a double action, ejector and rebounding hammer which was largely adopted by other manufacturers of weapons. The cylinder is not fluted which is also an early design. From 1870 to 1890, Warnant produced a quantity of revolvers largely based on the system of construction of Smith & Wesson contemporaries. The work he did with Francotte is very similar to this pistol.This design was copied heavily by makers during the latter half of the 19th century for export throughout the world. Who made it may be a mystery but it is certainly one to collect. This is not a shooter. If you want more photos - let me know. I would consider a trade for Mosin-Nagant rifle. I'm prepared to add cash to the right offer and rifle.The cylinder filial end is an art-deco style like Warnant used. I have several other images, or can take more of specific areas if you request them. Make an offer if you're interested in it. Let's get the discussions rolling. Thanks"

Emptying safe after divorce. These are rare and go for over $800 with the extended tube.  Let go for $650.• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

From the markings it was made by fazakerley as best I can tell. I'm no gunsmith but I can tell you the bore looks like a beautiful 2-grooved mirror when you look down it. Overall metal finish is what I would call fair to good. Metal finish is wearing off but not abnormally so for a piece of this age. Wood in front of the action is somewhat dark and the buttstock is a little lighter.  This is not perfect but as I said the bore makes up for it. I will include 2 boxes cheap brassed cased .303 ammo that I had left over.  Will need to see and verify FOID for this transaction. I would like to get $300 but will consider all reasonable offers.  Will trade for BCM KMR alpha 13"" or 15"" rail or for a geissele 13"" or 15"" rail.

I know I'm not looking for shotguns and I have my bolt actions so semi rifle or handgun let me know what you have the worst I can say is no thanks
