This scaled-down model of everyone’s favorite combo gun, the Taurus Judge, still gives you the ability to fire your choice of ammunition—now in a size that fits in most pockets—also in a lighter, polymer body frame with new updates for improved handling and accuracy. Truly amazing! Just like its big brother, this little gun delivers amazing versatility and devastating firepower for self-protection.       Extended Ejector Rod For positive extraction of fired cases.           Ribber Grip  Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.           Taurus Security System (TSS)rs Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.           Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.           Fiber Optic Sight Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic                 Finish: Blue             Caliber: 45 Colt/410-ga (2.5"" chamber)     Grips: Ribber         Capacity: 5     Weight: 27.0 oz.

The weapon displays with almost zero signs of usage. The bore is mirror bright with crisp rifling. Serial numbers are present on frame, slide and barrel - all matching. The action is crisp and smooth. The brown Bakelite factory grips are excellent and show little to no signs of carry wear. The photos are an accurate representation of this offering. This example was my pride and joy. It would hard to find a nicer example of this scarce hand gun.  As an alternative to all cash, I'd consider as partial trade a Marlin Model 39a, dating from 1953 or earlier, with Ballard rifling in excellent original condition. A second option is a Ruger 10/22 dating from the mid sixties up to 1970 also in like / original condition.Face to face sale only - Requires paperwork through FFL.

The Model Karabiner 1898a is similar to the 1898 rifle as it was a lighter, shorter version designed for cavalry, but found useful in trench fighting as well. Production started in 1905, for use by cavalry, foot-artillery and signal troops. The stock extends almost full length, with a stacking hook beneath the front stock band. The barrel is lightweight. The receiver ring is slightly smaller than the standard rifle receiver. The bolt handle is turned down close to the stock. Due to its close position against the stock, the underside of the handle knob is flat and checkered for easier grasping. This model was used in considerable numbers during World War I. After the war, many were issued to the small German Army, called Reichswehr. The designation ""K 98"" is stamped on the left side of the receiver. The designation Karabiner 98a was not stamped on the arm but was used in official papers in order to avoid confusion with other Model 98 carbines. This particualr one is a Polish rework, likely used in the Spanish Civil War. This is an excellent example with matching numbers throughout to include the stock itself. Strong, clean bore. Weight: 8 lbs. Length: 43.3 inches. Barrel length: 23.6 inches. Face-to-face local sales only, please."

Comes with Polaris Mid Windshield, Polaris cover, Polaris mirrors, Polaris Handlebar bag, new Polaris spare belt, electric visor plug and battery tender plug.  I purchased this sled new from my local Polaris dealer and has always been adult ridden.  Sled has always been stored in a garage or enclosed snowmobile trailer its entire life. Sled has always been serviced by Polaris Dealer.  Last year the sled was serviced and ridden 1 time.  The current mileage is 1,763 miles.  The sled has 73.3 hours.  The sled has 4 inch carbides that are in great condition.  Hyfax are 80% according to last service by Polaris dealer.  Sled is ready to run and is very clean.  Look at my feedback I try to describe as accurately as I can and the feedback shows this.  This sled will not disappoint.  I have had no issues with sled other than the occasional ECU updates from Polaris that the dealer installed during its annual service.  This sled is the complete package the ride and handling are incredible.  The suspension included walker evans clicker shocks front and rear.  The MSRP for the sled in 2010 was well over $10,000 with factory electric start.  You will not find a more complete package on a low mileage sled that is in excellent condition.  Just buy a jug of Polaris Oil and you’re ready to ride.

It came with a all S.S. Parkerized bolt, which I upgraded for the non Park'd solid S.S. one they currently sell. See it for yourself...there's hardly any marks inside or out. You can tell it's barely used...thanks for looking. Not really looking for trades. Well maybe if someone has a like new AERO C.O.P. upper complete kit. But I doubt they'd want to get rid of that OR the odd chance someone has stripped uppers MUST have the no forward assist. But HAS the ejection port cover mounts still. These would be valued @ $50 ea.
