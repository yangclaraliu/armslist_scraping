The firearm is used.  I do not know the round count.  I have additional photos but can only upload 4MB of pics so the two I posted hit the limit here.  Thank you for looking."

The receiver is a stamped AK-pattern; however, it has the heavier-built RPK receiver, which is thicker and stouter than a standard AK receiver.This is one reason why I selected the O-PAP over the N-PAP. I wanted an AK that would be almost indestructible in a SHTF situation. The forearm is slightly longer on the O-PAP than on a standard AK, and it has three “vents” for aiding the barrel in cooling, instead of the standard two. The forearm, as well as the stock, are manufactured from wood, much stouter than that of a standard AK. The pistol grip, longer and thicker than typical AK, is made out of a black polymer and has finger grooves perfectly placed for a great hold.There’s also a slanted muzzle brake on the end of the barrel. The front sight is adjustable for wind and elevation. Once set (zeroed), you don’t need to make any further adjustments. Elevation adjustments are then set with the rear sight, which is graduated from 25-meters all the way out to a very optimistic 1,000 meters. The 7,62X39 round simply isn’t designed for shooting at that distance. I believe the AK is best used inside of 400-450 yards myself. Beyond that, you’re only guessing where the rounds will hit.The receiver is stamped sheet metal and is 1.5mm thick; most AKs have a 1mm thick receiver. Also, the O-PAP has the dimpled receiver for a better fit of the 30-rd AK magazines (no rattling). After a bit of practice, insertion and removal of magazines was effortless once you get used to how the magazines rock into place. Another difference between the O-PAP M70 and a standard AK is the top-cover on the receiver. On a standard AK, you simply push the little “button” in and the top cover comes off. With the O-PAP, you have to press in a cross pin under the top cover before you push the top-cover release button. It was designed that way so that when grenades were fired through the O-PAP M70, the top cover wouldn’t pop off. Nice touch!This O-PAP is one beauty of an AK-style. If I were to have to grab and run with one rifle for the end of the world, my O-PAP M70 would be that rifle. I don’t see this firearm failing me under the harshest of conditions. This is a reliable, tough, and quality choice suitable for any survival scenario."

Comes with two factory 9rd mags, all the springfield goodies (extra fiber optic rods, mag pouch, holster, case). There is very little wear, the only area I noticed are on the light rail (which of course had a light installed on it). No mags over 15rds, must meet at an FFL (prefer Damage Factory in Centennial, but will drive around Denver). Asking $750 with the normal single sided safety, or $780 with the ambi safety (off of a Springfield Operator, it was a drop in fit and no modifications to the gun or safety were performed). Only trades would be a Gen 4 Glock 19 plus $350 cash or a Springfield EMP four inch."

It has served me well at the range and as a carry gun for the past couple of years (it carries remarkably well for a full-sized gun), but I fell in love with another, so this one is getting the boot. The gun is in excellent shape, with minimal slide wear despite being carried consistently for two years. I did the D-spring swap a while back, and this PX4 shoots like a dream, with about 2.5lbs taken off the double-action pull and about a pound off the single-action pull. It might have the lightest DA/SA trigger in a semi-auto handgun that I've ever felt.

The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment. Features Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun’s manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol’s manual safety in the “safe” position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an “at-a-glance” verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus’ commitment to outstanding firearms. Accessory Rail Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories Specifications: Model: 111G2 Finish: Blue Caliber: 9mm Luger Capacity: 12 +1 Weight: 22 oz.

Includes the barrel extension of course.I'm pricing this to sell, much lower than I can find it for sale anywhere.I work in the firearms industry, and was offered a good deal on an HTI, but it had to be in .416 Barrett. I don't plan to shoot .416 Barrett, so I got the .50 barrel (same bolt+mag as .416) and .375 CT conversion kit, because I prefer those calibers. Aaaand this barrel is of no use to me unless I move to CA.The barrel came installed on the rifle, and I immediately removed and placed it in my .50 BMG barrel sleeve when I received it, to protect the finish. It's in perfect condition, stored in a dry environment. I've only had it a couple months. Photo is from DT website, but is identical to mine.Willing to ship or sell face to face. I won't charge the buyer for shipping. This is a niche item, so there is a low likeleyhood of a local person wanting it. No background check, obviously. because it isn't a gun, just a part. Do need to collect a payment before shipment. Happy to give you my info and the firearms accessory manufacturing company I manage to help put you at ease with my integrity and identity.
