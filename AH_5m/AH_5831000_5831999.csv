LOL!VEPR 12 ""FOLDING"" STOCK CUSTOM SEMI-AUTO 12 gauge ""ASSULT"" SHOTGUN $1200 GUN ONLY with 5 ROUND MAG$1900 GUN PACKAGE As listed belowI have over $2200 invested asking the above OR TRADE + cash either way for Nice/Excellent O/U (??) or Semi-Auto for Clay Sporting. Trap/Skeet/Sporting Clays. This is a 1 year old gun, bought new when they were still shipping these with the full folding capability RARE!!. They have now re-designed the trunnion to not allow for folding stock at ALL. Mine folds perfectly, secures locked when folded (so it can be shot folded) great for close quarters combat (home defense) and opens for shoulder mount, and secures perfectly. The following has been customized for this gun package 1) Polishing on the bolt carrier and other bits within the action to create the capability for the gun to perfectly cycle most any ammo, yes, even the cheap stuff. When I received the gun, I immediately took it with me to a Vegas 3-gun competition. I brought with me decent 1200 fps ammo. When I practiced the day prior and it would not cycle consistently at all. I had to shoot that match with 1400 fps ammo to get it to cycle consistently. When I got home, I went to the gunsmith and had them polish as well as help me get the gun 922r compliant fire control group and hammer spring. After the work was done, I now shoot 1175 cheap Walmart ammo, no problem. Excellent. This gun has last shot bolt hold open. ($310)2) Rare (Difficult to acquire) Russian by Melot GK02 muzzle brake. It's incredible. The gun literally has no muzzle rise, and it has very little recoil. Important to be able to quickly shoot and reacquire targets in 3-gun competition. Can shoot 10 rapid fire into a small target with instant re-acquisition of target after each shot. Shooting clay is amazing, We double pull doubles! 4 fliers, splash 4. ($200)3) Professionally installed underside picatinny rail. Can mount anything, I mounted an excellent angular forehand grip. ($115)4) Professionally installed ATI Scorpion Recoil cushion pistol grip. ($60)5) SureSite red dot - I used this while shooting slugs 100 yards, quick site acquisition. ($80)6) Gun comes with 2x 10 round mags and 1x 5 round mag. All have been cycled, and work perfectly ($120)7) Gun comes with nice large tactical ballistic material case. Holds gun, accessories, mags, shooting supplies, etc. ($40)8) Original box included if you want it - perfect condition. (Priceless)I love this gun, and I built it up for me as a competitive 3 gun shooter. I am selling specifically because I'm not doing 3 gun shooting anymore."

Bought for wife but she wasn’t interested, preferring her M&P Shield with CT laser.I don’t care for striker-fired pistols, but after all the rave reviews for this American-made pistol, I shot it just out of curiosity: 175 rounds of FMJ and 25 rounds of hollow points, with zero problems. Almost same dimensions as the Shield, but with a very nice textured grip. Three-dot sights, but front sight is large orange dot, very easy to pick up when firing. Weighs 3 ounces more than the Shield, making for softer recoil. Nice pistol, but I just don’t care for striker-fired triggers, so it’s available. Check out on-line reviews, one of which says it’s “the best single-stack 9mm ever!""No shipping, no trading; will meet in/near Chattanooga."
