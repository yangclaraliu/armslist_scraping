It comes with a Carlson Modified choke, a stock Full Choke, and a TC Extra Full choke.  The plug is already installed to limit the gun to 2+1, but it is easy to uninstall.  Also included are the two gas pistons (a heavy and a light) to use for either turkey loads or normals loads, respectively.I can meet you most likely somewhere in Topeka, Manhattan, or Emporia.  We live in Council Grove so that is out of the way for most people.  Email me with any questions!"

It has HK style front and rear sights, NO rear sight block, fixed gas tube, and fixed receiver cover (removed with a tool). I bought it from a guy on here a while ago who couldn't tell me a lot about it either. It is in good shape and functions flawlessly. If you're into unique AK's, this is for you. I have put one mag through it and have also installed a hogue pistol grip on it as well. The wrap you see in the picture is only cotton and wont leave any residue on the gun if you want me to take it off (the handguard warms up fast though). So shoot me an email or text me at 317 six four 4 9 eight 5 six. I can take more pics for you if you want.

This was the everyday carry weapon for a New Jersey police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean. Very accurate and smooth shooter. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today, bit that can easily be removed if you choose.The revolver has lots of holster wear and some freckling in spots, but this is just honest wear from being on the job for many years. There is wear primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster, but there is also other marking as a result of it being a true ""on the job"" weapon. Bore and chambers on the cylinder are good and have been well maintained. After all, this officer's life depended on this gun working every time he might have to pull the trigger. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun. I had it at the gun range Thursday evening and it shoots as well as my newer Smith & Wesson revolver.You have your choice of any set of the following listed grips you want on the gun for the $225 price. For $250 you can have all three pair of grips. The gun came to me wearing beautiful custom-made dark walnut with target thumb rest grips. I also have S&W wood grips and rubber Pachmayr Gripper grips you can choose from. I have attached pics of the gun with all three pair of grips to help you make your buying decision. If you want additional pictures, please feel free to ask. Local face-to-face cash sale only.
