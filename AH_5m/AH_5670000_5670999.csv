You don't have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack today, and you'll want to shoot it.

The bolt is numbered to the gun (outlined in red on the photo of the bolt.)  It has front and rear iron sights, is factory drilled and tapped for a scope, and shoots lights out. (It loves Winchester 150 gr. Power-Point.)  As far as I know, it's all-original, with the exception of a Pachmayr pre-fit recoil pad that I installed, in place of the original factory butt plate (which is also included).  Great gun, but I don't shoot it enough to keep it.  Asking $325 shipped to your FFL anywhere in the Continental US.  Paypal is preferred.  No trades.  Any questions or additional photos needed, please ask.  Thanks."

I got this package at the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation banquet in May. Unpacked everything and used both cameras exactly once to check functionality. They both worked fine. Now they've been sitting in the case for a couple of months and I don't see me actually using them much (maybe I'm too old). The RMEF put a fair market value of $990 on the package and I added a couple of 32 gig micro SD cards, bringing the value up to over $1,000. I'm looking to get $695 for the whole package. I might look at keeping the Session camera and sell the rest for $525. Not really looking for trades, but if you have the right model of Bowtech bow you're looking to get rid of - Carbon Icon or Prodigy - we could talk about it.  Also could talk about quality bolt action .223 rifle, or always willing to consider quality handguns.Face to face.

I've fired only 16 rounds through it so it isn't even broken in yet. Total length is 41"", barrel length is 20"", holds 8+1 rounds, and weighs 7 pounds, making it a great home defense weapon. Following is Mossberg's description: The Mossberg FLEX 590 Tactical Pump-Action Shotgun features Mossberg's TLS, Tool-less Locking System, that enables shooters to rapidly switch stocks, forends, and recoil pads, using a single receiver as the core component for wide array of shotgun configurations. All FLEX TLS components mount and remove from the gun in seconds, without tools. The FLEX 590 Tactical shotgun features a 20"" cylinder bore barrel with a bead sight and a 6 position, adjustable stock with a full pistol grip. A tri-rail tactical forend allows further customization with the attachment of aftermarket tacticalk accessories. An anti-reflective finish on the barrel, receiver, and magazine tube resists corrosion, as well as aids in concealment. The U.S. Military's choice of Moidel 590 pump shotgun for combat attests to the design's reliable function and durability. The Model 590 pump-action shotgun uses dual action bars, dual extractors, an anti-jam shell elevator, and a large locking lug for a steel-to-steel connection between bolt and barrel. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous. The Model 590's simplistic design makes fieldstripping the action easy by tapping out a single pin, and the magazine cap-nut removes for cleaning the spring, shell follower, and any debris in the mag tube. The Moidel 590 cycles 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells interchangeably."

Following is Bass Pro Shop description: The Ruger LCR Double-Action Revolver makes a lightweight, fast handling concealed carry gun that is quick to get on target. The innovatively designed LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) has a monolithic frame of aerospace-grade, 7000 series aluminum, a streamlined  fluted stainless steel cylinder, and a stainless steel barel insert, threaded into the aluminum frame. The frame is finished in a non-relective matte black, optimum for self-defense weapons. To keep overall weight to a minimum, the LCR uses a polymer grip frame that houses all the fire contraol components. Tjhe LCR has a concealed hammer that prevents the gun from snagging while being drawn rapidly from a holster, pocket, or purse allowing the firearm to function when an emergency situation calls for it to be purposely fired from inside a pocket or purse. The double action trigger pull is a smooth as silk, due to Ruger's refined trigger geometry and spring rates. The non-stacking trigger allows shooter to maintain a constant sight picture while sysling the cylinder and firing the revolver. A front sight blace is pinned to the frame and con easily be replaced with after market sight options, and the fixed rear sight consiste of a groove on the top of the frame. The Ruger LCR Double-Action Revoilver is a reliable firearm that is easy to operate for most any shooter regardless of experience, making it a perfect firearm for concealed carry and home defense."

Mathimatically, more than what a 9mm can deliver.  To clorify, I am not putting 9mm down, I'm just saing, there is plenty of arguments to be made for the practical use of 40S&W.  It all comes down to what you're comfortable with, make up your own mind.I'm not going to make a list of all the extras involved in this pistol and tell you what they sell for on Midway.  A.) you already know what this stuff is worth  B.) I'm so tired of people trying to sell used items for retail.  I'd be delusional to try and get every dime I put into this (plust a little more), out of the sale price.  What I'm asking for all of this is a simple $425, four hundred fwenty five dollars.  Hell, that's just $250 or so more than a Hi-point out of the box.Sorry, no shipping or out of state sales.Any questions, just let me know.Contact me through the sight or call or text me at 20five 45one two 3   48.Thanks, good luck."
