Machined from solid steel bar stock, optimal dimensions are maintained and corners radiused for extended life and smooth feeding. While this is a drop-in part, many guns may require minor tension adjustments. Series 70 and 80 1911 Extractors: The difference between Series 70 and Series 80 extractors is a plunger retainer stud machined into the Series 80 extractor. This retainer stud holds the firing pin lock plunger in place on Series 80 slides. All extractors which are designed to work in a Series 80 1911 will also work in all Series 70 guns, however extractors designed for Series 70 guns lack the machined cut which allows the firing pin lock plunger to be installed and therefore can not be used in Series 80 guns.Will ship free Cont.

This is not a WASR. In fact it is very far from a WASR or other surplus guns. It is a Romanian receiver put together with American parts including a chrome lined barrel, G2 trigger, Hogue Grip, quad rail, and a side mount for a scope that many standard Ak's do not have. Look up some reviews and the specs on this gun. People absolutely love them. I would say it is between the base AK's and the arsenals as far as fit and finish. Not quite as nice as an arsenal but much nicer than a base model surplus gun. Gun comes with 5-6 magazines (I forget how many I have) a bolt on rail mount, and an OD green tactical case. I can also throw in a few boxes of ammo to fit the buyers price/needs. I'm not going to give this gun away. I really do like it but I like motorcycles more and that's what I'm trying to buy at this time. I'll sell it to whoever throws me a price I'm comfortable with. (As long as I get what's fair based on what I know they're worth. This exact gun is sold out on every site and for good reason. They're great weapons. This gun is not new but you wouldn't be able to tell. I took very good care of it. Also so take into consideration that with the current state of paranoia of upcoming ""assault weapons"" restrictions that prices on these are going to skyrocket in the next 4 weeks or so. If I had the time to wait and sell it I would but I would prefer the money sooner rather than later. That being said, I'm not expecting an outrageous amount of money for it.Text is the best way to reach me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking.edit. Red dot site is not included with package.

composites. The mix of AR and semi-auto shotgun features balance out
well to create a very workable, flexible shotgun.
The “MKA 1919 Match” semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gasoperated
action which is located around the support tube that runs below
the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube
which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The barrel can
be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is
manufactured from high grade aluminum alloy while the lower receiver,
pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant
polymer. On the upper receiver, an integral picatinny rail exists which will
accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical
sight attachments.if you are interested, please contact me at REDACTED"

The rifle also wears Magpul MOE hanguards and stock, in addition to a US Palm pistol grip. It also features a CNC Warrior muzzle brake which is extremely effective and practically erases recoil. The gun also has a Tapco  trigger group with around a 3lb pull. The original wood furniture WILL BE INCLUDED AS WELL.The rifle has seen only 300 rounds of use to test for function, which has been flawless. It's otherwise in better than excellent condition, and is much more attractive than any stock WASR out there. I can also include an RS-Regulate AK301 with the foward bia, AKML micro dot mount, and a Primary Arms 2MOA micro dot for an additional $200. They will not be sold separately, so don't ask. These rifles are becoming exceedingly rare and are currently not being imported at the moment, and have otherwise seen a pretty big price increase over the last few years, which will likely only continue. With the coming elections, if you want a quality AK, this is the best time to get one!Not interested in any trades. Thanks"

Both bbl sets are dated May 1939, and are serialized to the receiver. One bbl set is 16ga over 16ga measuring 28"" long, and the other is 16ga 0ver 8mm Mauser measuring 25.5"" long. This gun has been used and hunted with, and shows signs of use. Recoil pad has been replaced many years ago, which leads me to think the finish has at least been added to, if not refinished at some point in it's life. Finish is thinning is spots. Photos do not correctly show color of bluing - it is much darker in reality, but is also thinning some in spots, and shows light freckling in places. Not rust, but dark spots..... Case hardening colors have also faded to the point they are all but gone, except in hidden areas. Stock also has a few small dings, but no cracks or breaks. Somewhere in time the scope also took a hard left and disappeared. On the up side, bores are perfect, action locks up like a tank, and this gun should offer many more decades of use. Photos will show that the shotgun chambers are 2 3/4"" - that is incorrect. they are chambered for 2 1/2"" shells but someone measured the chamber and determined it was 2 3/4"" long, but that is the distance to the begining of the forcing cone. Markings were applied here as the Germans would have marked it in millimeters. Do NOT fire 2 3/4"" shells in this gun or pressures will rise significantly. I will stick a couple photos in the listing, but I can give you a link to a photobucket folder with many photos. Not able to poste a link here."

This is a Just Right Carbine (JRC) chambered in 45 acp. This has been completely gone through and upgraded by the factory with new bolt, feed ramps, extractor and spring, etc. This has all of the newer upgrades to make it shoot more reliably and is something the vast majority of the other of these out there do not have.

This has an adjustable Buttstock, MFT Buttstock cheek weld enhancement, quad rail, threaded barrel, thread protector, magazine, magpul flip sights, quad rail cover on Palm area, and box. This is a great little gun and is a blast to shoot.  I would also consider trades.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 Nato Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed becasue the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62mm Nato caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on current models are 18"" long; a longer barrel length of 24"" available as the hunter variant. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with their A2-style flash hider. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel assembly. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from optics and sight systems available on the market. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with Nato style bayonets including their own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

They are lying around in my safe collecting dust, so I figured I'd put them up and see what I can trade them for. Here is what I got: Hi-Point C9 - Less than 300rds fired. Honestly has never jammed on me once and shoots every bit as straight as my higher end handguns. Heavy as a brick, so if it did jam, you could throw it at someone and do almost as much damage. Comes with an extra magazine (possibly two if I still have it) Lorcin .380 - I cleaned it up and threw some paint on it last year. I believe they call it ""polishing up a turd"" but it was looking rough, so I did it. It is picky with cheaper ammo, but I don't have issues with the white box Winchester 95 grain.

It has a pistol grip and upgraded tactical sights! The gun it's self is amazing and the accuracy for a shotgun is ridiculous (75+ yards easily) I'm just looking for anything from a nice Assault rifle to a couple pistols! I have so many shotguns I'm just ready for something new!! I will consider selling if price is right!!
