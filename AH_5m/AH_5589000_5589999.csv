This is not a typical listing, although I have seen one like this ocassionally. I have for trade a Snap-ON seven(7) drawer roller tool box w/six(6) drawer attatched end cabinet. I downsized a lot of tools and items I no longer used. Now that the tools are gone, the box is left, which I hope I can trade for a firearm of some sort. It is in nice condition with a little surface rust on the drawers. Touch up paint can be bought on-line. A small vise mounted on top is included. I have two new top pieces to replace the wood on top as well.I value the tool box to be around $1200. I think that is a fair price. Let me know what you have, it may catch my interest. I am interested in a Thompson 1927A1 deluxe or a nice FAL with wood furnature or Israeli FAL.thanks for looking.call/text: REDACTEDkey words: bolt action, sniper, rifle, custom, pistol"

This SR15 is on a whole nother level than the SCAR 16. She's been a safe queen so I've decided to sell her since I don't give her enough use.Rifle comes with everything as new including locks and documentation. I have a ATLAS Bipod with ADM 170-S Lever, Vortex Viper PST 2.5-10x32mm MOA scope with a throw lever, and an EOTech EXPS3-4 Holographic Sight on her which does not come with the rifle. I can any of these with additional cost for much cheaper than buying these things new. The only difference between this and the MOD 2 is the URX 4 rail(which I prefer 3) and a pinned gas block.I have sold 3 guns on here ranging from $2,400-$550. I prefer to meet at WCA Bellevue, but am open to meeting you half way at a FFL Dealer.Price will not budge too much.Have a good weekend everyone and safe shooting.Photos: http://imgur.com/a/hYLqgRespectfully,Nathan"

520,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5589520,For Sale:  AK / AKM / AK47 Wood Furniture Set; Red; New,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, June 17, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This auction is for one refinished, new AK furniture set. It was bought factory new and the original production brown finish was stripped, refinished a Russian red style color, then given several coatings of polyurethane for protection and for a glossy look. The set was USA manufactured and so it counts for several 922r compliance parts. It fits standard stamped AK’s and will not fit Yugos, Chinese rifles, VEPRs, milled receivers, or other non-standard rifles. See Timbersmith AK furniture sets for more details.
Due to the slight variance in dimensions between AK’s, the user will need to fit the wood set to their rifle. Generous amounts of polyurethane were applied to the areas where the wood mates with the rifle so the user can sand down those areas to ensure a snug fit. Also, the user will need to drill the two screw holes in the buttstock to attach it to the tang of the rifle. Drill bit, screws, and fitting instructions will be included along with a grip screw and T-nut. This kit does not come with an upper handguard retainer spring or a lower handguard U-shaped barrel support insert.
I am a college student who moved to the city and I no longer have time or money for shooting, but I refinish stock sets and other odds and ends to stay active in the hobby. Therefore, I do not claim to be a professional at finishing wood, but I take pride in my work and I am confident that you will be satisfied with this beautiful furniture set.
Thank you for taking time to view this auction and if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask!
Note: Please be aware of your state’s laws regarding firearm related purchases."

If you don't know what a MR 73 is, the French issue these beautifully hand-crafted works of art to their special weapons and tactical police teams (RAID,GIGN). They are absolutely built to last, requiring over 12 hours of hand fitting during manufacture. Likened to the Colt Python but built on a frame to withstand greater use. There are not many examples Stateside and they quickly sell when available. This particular example is a French police trade imported to the U.S. but in very good condition. It has obviously seen use and rounds down range during its time issued in France. I put a few boxes to verify function. The trigger return spring and hammer spring are both adjustable. A quick setting of the adjustable screws to increase tension on the trigger return spring and this revolver has proven reliable through a couple hundred rounds of .357 and .38 special. Bluing is beautiful, but does show wear from use. This is one of the better examples I've seen show up in these small imported batches. Barrel bore has mirror shine and is excellent. The revolver wears the Trausch rubber grips that absorb recoil quite well. Accuracy was excellent with quality loads as it should be. The MR 73s are held to the highest of standards during manufacture.  I'm moving this to fund some optics for different projects.  I actually had this listed on Gunbroker and had plenty of interest but pulled it due to a change of heart mid-way through the listing.  Well, I'm back to where I started and am deciding it's time to give to get.  $775 is the price.  I may eventually move this to auction.  FOID card and verification online is required for purchase.  Please feel free to ask questions.  Thank you."

You can tell when you inspect it if we meet. Do your homework on Core Rifle Systems. Most companies don't build a base model rifle to mil spec at all. These guys start with mil spec and build from there. By far the best warranty around and they don't care if you are the 10th owner and the gun has seen 50k rounds. They stand by the gun. Comes with 3 thirty round Magpul P mags, also brand new, as well as a single point sling, and magpul MBUS rear sight and all the original paperwork, case, stickers. 5.56/.223. Everything that should be staked is, chrome lined, magnetic particle inspected and the reviews are great. Comes with 90 rounds of ammo."

I've only shot about 100 rounds through it. It's got a 16 inch barrel and the furniture is real walnutl. Really nicely finished.If you want to see more about this rifle, Military Arms Channel on youtube did a good review of his SBR'd Thompson by the same company. $900 cash (no checks, sorry) 950 trade.
