All items are in original, used but strong condition and are the results of several years of collecting. These items have steadily gone up in price, especially since films and shows like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers have come. You can safely bet that with upcoming films like Hacksaw Ridge and Dunkirk coming out, WWII militaria will go up in price once again. I have priced these very fairly, and would like to sell them locally as shipping would be chaotic due to number of items and weight, but will consider it if interested. Please email for photos. Rifle and pistol are NOT included, just part of photo display. Pictured are two impressions that are lacking only a couple items to be complete. The first is a Battle of the Bulge impression, and the second is a D-Day or Pacific theater impression. 101st or 82nd Paratrooper impression (which I started doing, before switching to 2nd Rangers) can be well started with many of the items below.

(8+ hrs for the IRIS240), and a field of view for these units range from 17x13 degrees on the low end (FLIR Scout III 240) to the highest being 24-18 degrees (FLIR Scout III 240).  This compares to 28.5x21.5 degrees FOV for the IRIS240.  Magnification or zoom ability was also less attractive with some providing fixed magnification of 3x-6x but no 1x magnification, while most provided 1-2X magnification, and some provided 4X.  In addition to the FLIR product series mentioned above, below are a couple other units I've been able to test at one time or another:Pulsar Quantum Thermal Imaging Scope - $2500 to $3500Night Optics Thermal Imaging TM7X - $2500+"

I have shot about 60 rounds doing some load development but never took her hunting. She shot like a dream but I don't have time to shoot her anymore. Let me know if you have any questions or would like more pictures of the combo. I am firm on price but I may throw in the rest of the box of Berger 140 BTHP projectiles to sweeten the deal.
$1600 for the whole package or $1450 without the scope.

I then sent the rifle to Mike Lau at Texas Brigade Armory in Mingus, TX to have the Sadlak Airborne mount installed and to also install the NF optic and Badger rings. After assembling the rifle Mike inspected and test fired the rifle to ensure everything was in proper working condition. I originally purchased this rifle with 400 rounds of ammo from various manufacturers. I have exactly 100 rounds left, which will be included with the rifle. Note: this gun is NOT a safe queen. I carried this rifle with me in my pickup when I worked as a hunting guide in NW TX, so it has some dings and scratches. However, there is no rust, damage, or inoperable parts. This rifle shoots extremely smooth and is fantastic to shoot at extended distances. I am selling this rifle because I am beginning a M.B.A program here in Texas and need funds to be able to pay for such. I prefer to sell the rifle in a face-to-face setting, but wil consider shipping from my local FFL to your local FFL. I am currently located in Lubbock and frequently travel around the state of TX. If you live outside of my local area and are interested in the rifle, please don't hesitate to contact me. I travel to the Houston and Austin areas often and don't mind bringing it with me if you would like to meet up and see the rifle in person. I prefer cash, but will consider other forms of payment such as: USPS or Wells Fargo Money Orders with a tracking number (once I receive payment I will ship the rifle if a FTF sale does not occur). I have invested nearly $5,000 into this gun and would like to see a reasonable return for such. However, I understand that this rifle is not in mint condition and I am willing to take that into account in terms of my asking price. As of right now, I am asking $4,500, but will consider any reasonable offer. At this time, I am not interested in any trades. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like additional information/pictures."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.  While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. The PMAG 40 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit. Made in U.S.A."

No bushings are included. 7mm-300wsm: Round count 234. I chose this caliber instead of the 7 wsm due to brass availability. I am using high quality readily available norma 300 wsm brass. I had the gunsmith run a 7 wsm reamer until it would headspace off the 300 wsm gauges, meaning it has a shorter neck just like the 7 wsm. Once cases are necked down, I trim the necks back .039"" and turn the necks to .015"". I was getting 3000 fps with a 180 berger hybrid with h1000. This is a broughton 5.75 contour fluted 9 twist at 26"". Included with this barrel is (60) 2x fired, and (38) 3x fired prepped, trimmed, turned, and annealed brass. Redding 7 wsm competition seater and a custom redding 7mm-300wsm full length sizing die that I had Dave open the neck up to .312"" which is the bushing size I was using with the 300 wsm type s neck die. Also if the buyer wants to make things easy, I could have Dave run the 7 wsm reamer all the way in to make it a 7 wsm chamber. This whole package comes out to about $5700"
