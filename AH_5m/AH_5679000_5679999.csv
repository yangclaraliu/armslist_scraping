From the factory: RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

This pistol is a one hole shot with Winchester 115 gr white box ammunition. This pistol was built to shoot in the USPSA Production class. The pistol has an APEX Competition spring kit in it minus the striker spring due to light primer strikes on select ammunition. The trigger pull is a smooth pull with a short uptake and short reset that is right around 3lb. The trigger job in this pistol is VERY smooth. The pistol also has an APEX Ram setup to give a more positive reset feel and sound. The Ram setup in this pistol made a VERY big difference in my shooting scores due to actually being able to shoot off of the reset unlike almost all M&Ps. The pistol also has Dawson Precision Adjustable sights with a fiber optic front and regular blacked out sight in the rear. I had the grip stippled as well according to USPSA rules and that is also a feature I like about it. Just wait, there is more! Pistol is sold as a package deal with a CR SPEED Rig setup for M&P. The holster is a blade tech drop holster and the mag holders are all CR Speed (This would have to be verified as I cannot remember). The package will come with 5 factory 17rd magazines as well. This pistol is awesome and was purpose built for USPSA. Unfortunately, my life circumstances have changed and I don’t have the time to devote to USPSA anymore. This gun also works in Steel Challenge very well. The Race Rig can be used in Steel Challenge as well. Pictures upon request. Please call or text me REDACTED. Text preferred first. Pics upon request.

Thus, this first, no-dash model is most desirable for shooters and collectors alike. Did I say the trigger is excellent? Weight unloaded is 36 ounces. For me, 696 felt recoil is way better than with an L-frame .357 magnum. This is a fantastic and powerful concealed or open carry handgun that should last several lifetimes.

Gorgeous finish on this rifle.   No low-ball offers please.  This is brand new in a Daniel Defense hard case.  No shipping, no taxes, no transfer fees.  Definitely a good price for this.  ABOUT: The DDM4 V11 Kryptek Typhon, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM RAIL™. KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM RAIL 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."

While in combat, Chris chose the Springfield Armory® TRP™ for its reliable performance and toughness. In his best-selling book, American Sniper, he credits the TRP™ with saving his life. ""In 2004, I bought a Springfield TRP™ Operator®, which used a .45 caliber round. It had a 1911 body style, with custom grips and a rail system that let me add a light and laser combo. Black, it had a bull barrel and was an excellent gun - until it took a frag for me in Fallajuh. I was actually able to get it repaired -those Springfields are tough."" WHAT'S INCLUDED?  A serialized 1 of 1,000 1911 TRP™ A presentation case included with the pistol A Chris Kyle FROG Foundation commemorative coin A copy of American Sniper autographed by Taya Kyle  ABOUT THE LIMITED EDITION CHRIS KYLE TRP™ OPERATOR® 1911 The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications.

With the exception of the magazine, all part numbers match.  As this is a very high dollar item, I'm open to how we handle shipping; regardless, full value shipping insurance is a must. Three day inspection period begins the first business day after your FFL receives this pistol. I'm willing to work with the buyer on purchase details, just email me before the auction close to discuss.  This pistol will not leave my physical possession until my bank guarantees that the funds are available in my account.
