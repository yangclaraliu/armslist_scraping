It belongs to my wife and has a low round count. Pistol comes with around 400 rounds of .22 lr ammo as well as 2 magazines and the original case. Second is a Remington 887 nitro tactical. I am the original owner and have put around 20 rounds through it. Has a small rail on the right side of the shotgun for a tac-light which I could include for an extra 40 dollars or to sweeten a trade deal, and the shotgun also has factory night sights. Third is a Winchester model 88 lever action rifle chambered in .308. Rifle has been in my family since it was manufactured in 1960. Gun has some slight wear on the stock but other than that it is in great condition. The 1' scope rings flip to the side to allow use of iron sights while keeping your scope zeroed. Rifle comes with factory 5 round magazine and I think i have a box or two of winchester .308 ammo in the safe. I am asking 300 for the SR22, 425 for the shotgun, and 850 for the rifle. I think these prices are reasonable and so they are pretty firm, but I will be a little flexable if you have something im interested in trading for.

I have the original box and two brand new Pmags still in packaging.These have sold out at most shops, with limited production due to Zastava fulfilling military contracts over civilian orders.This pistol is ready to be SBR, or kept as a pistol.  I have fired approx 250 rounds through it, never had any malfunction, I am only selling it so I can work on another project.I did file off part corners of the bracket that connects to the receiver, so that it doesn't stab into your hand as you grip it, it makes a world of a difference.I did also install a Magpul AK+ pistol grip, which compared to the stock polymer grip, again makes a world of a difference.MY PRICE IS FIRM, PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ASKING ME IF I WILL TAKE $XX AMOUNT, I DON'T NEED TO SELL THIS SO THAT IS WHY I HAVE MY ASKING PRICE."

Gold bead front sight, but drilled for a rail if you want to add a scope.  Pistol grip is easily removable with an Allen wrench (included) if you want to change stocks.  The barrel is easily removable too: can add a longer barrel...this gun has the shortest barrel legally allowed without applying for an expensive BATF permit--it's 18 1/2 inches. Great preppers gun, camping protection against bears or other big critters that hunt back...fun at the range too.  Includes case for compact storage and transport."

I'm selling the ammo I have for it too. I would have liked to keep it since it looks like the surplus imports have dried up, as well as the GP-11 ammo and the value of these is going to skyrocket over next couple years. Bore is decent, stock has plenty of character dings, bluing is worn but no serious rust problems, I can send more detailed pics or you are welcome to inspect before purchase as long as meet close. Operates perfectly and shoots great. Let me know if you have any questions. I have 235 rounds of GP11. Some people are valuing this at over a dollar a round, I think a more realistic value is about $0.75 a round. I have 100 rounds of PPU and Hornady soft point ammo. New the boxes are $14-$18, I'll put a trade value of $0.55 per round on these. Rifle: $375GP11: $175 SP ammo: $55 bayo: $50cleaning kit:$20I am asking $600 for all. This is as low as I can go, please don't offer less. This rifle has some character, but still a very good gun overall. One of the calibers I decided to keep is 7.62X54R, so I would trade for an M44, M39, or other Mosin variant, I'm not very interested in a standard 91/30 though. Ideally, I would find a semi-auto battle rifle, either a VEPR with 20 or 23"" barrel or a Garand. Depending on the trade, I could add some cash with the rifle and ammo. The only other thing I'm in the market for right now is an AR upper or possibly a bow, but let me know what you have, worst I can say is 'No'. I prefer to communicate by email, once we get a deal lined up we can exchange numbers. Thanks for your interest!"

It belongs to my wife and has a low round count. Pistol comes with around 400 rounds of .22 lr ammo as well as 2 magazines and the original case. Second is a Remington 887 nitro tactical. I am the original owner and have put around 20 rounds through it. Has a small rail on the right side of the shotgun for a tac-light which I could include for an extra 40 dollars or to sweeten a trade deal, and the shotgun also has factory night sights. Third is a Winchester model 88 lever action rifle chambered in .308. Rifle has been in my family since it was manufactured in 1960. Gun has some slight wear on the stock but other than that it is in great condition. The 1' scope rings flip to the side to allow use of iron sights while keeping your scope zeroed. Rifle comes with factory 5 round magazine and I think i have a box or two of winchester .308 ammo in the safe. I am asking 300 for the SR22, 425 for the shotgun, and 850 for the rifle. I think these prices are reasonable and so they are pretty firm, but I will be a little flexable if you have something im interested in trading for.
