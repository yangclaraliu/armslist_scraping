The P227 also features the new Enhanced Ergonomics 'E2' wraparound grip, rather than the two-piece grips of the P220. The P227 has a magazine capacity of ten rounds and one in the chamber, unlike the seven- or eight-round capacity of the P220. SIG also offers a fourteen-round capacity magazine, which is included in various models. The P227 is a double-action/single-action-operated handgun, meaning that the first trigger pull is a ten-pound double-action pull, but all the follow-up shots are a 4.4-pound single-action pull. It is 7.7 inches in length (with a 4.4 inch barrel) and 5.5 inches in height with 1.5 inches in width. It weighs 32 ounces with the magazine, features an accessory rail and three-dot contrast sights. The frame is constructed from anodized aluminum alloy with a Nitron finish and a milled stainless steel slide.This is a used Sig P227 in Excellent Condition.

Easily identify whether the firing pin is in the cocked or uncocked mode. Quickly view the amount of ammunition present. With slide releases present on both sides of the frame and a magazine release on the rear, bottom portion of the trigger guard, VP9 controls are completely ambidextrous. The VP9’s high strength polymer frame includes a unique ergonomic handgun grip design consisting of interchangeable grip panels and backstraps, as well as a dustcover with a standard Picatinny rail interface. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. The barrel — made from canon grade steel — ensures long service life. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into the VP9’s polymer frame can mount a wide variety of lights, laser aimers, and other accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9 is well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
