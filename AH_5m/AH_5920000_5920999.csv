This rifle and round have fantastic potential to take a wide range of game from hog and deer all the way up to elk and probably larger with some of the heavier bullet offerings. Recoil is very managable: A real pleasure to shoot. The finish on the stock is excellent as is the bluing. There are were a few very small surface rust spots on the bluing in various areas but purely cosmetic. I can send pics of the area if you'd like to see some.The Rifle is equiped with a very nice Leupold VX-R 3-9x50 Scope with a illuminated Red dot feature for low light situations. The rifle and scope are in excellent condition as I have only put 20 round through it since I've owned it now for about three years. It's trigger is around 2.5lbs-3lbs from the factory and it has a ""set trigger"" option which reduces the trigger pull to what feels like a .5lb! Incredibly light. I have receipts for the gun and the scope if anyone would like to see them. I would like to sell everything together: the rifle, the scope and the bag."

I'm the third owner and the person I purchased it from had a trigger job performed on it through the Freedom Arms shop and the trigger is the most crisp breaking trigger I've every experienced. It can't be more than 3lbs either, probably closer to 2-2.5lbs. It's a 6"" barrel with factory porting which definitely helps with recoil and provides an awesome light show at indoor ranges or in low light, haha. I don't find the recoil to be punishing but I wouldn't want to shoot more than 20 rounds or so in a row. If you're at all familar with Freedom Arms you can rest assured this is an excellent example of the products they produce. Everything about this gun is tight and smooth. Hate to get rid of it but just don't shoot it that often or have much use for it and could use the money for other things."

Metal is in great shape, bore is good with sharp lands and mostly shiny with only some darkness in the grooves. Stock has what looks like some battle damage towards the back but otherwise is in good shape as well. Eagles are not peened, has some nice clear markings on the stock. As this is a Russian capture parts do not have original matching numbers and have been force-matched by Russian armorers. The BYF code on the reciever means this was made at the actual Mauser factory and it was not built under license by another company. Mechanically excellent. For more pictures please see album here : http://imgur.com/a/utKUv . I'm more than happy to take additional pictures or answer any quesitons. Looking to get $650 firm for the rifle, no trades. I also have 150 rounds of surplus 8mm loaded on stripper clips that I can throw in for an additional $50 to the buyer of the rifle."

MADE IN 1911. EXCELLENT BORE AND LOCKS UP TIGHT AS A VAULT. CA & C&R OK. Boy, would I love to know the history of this old timer! It’s 115 years old and was made in the very last years of the old west. It’s still nice and tight with perfect lock-up and an excellent bore – mirror bright with sharp rifling. It’s definitely seen some action since pretty much of the finish has turned to a pleasing smooth plum brown color. But you get a very good solid C-O-L-T four clicks when you cock the hammer and the lock-up is like a bank vault door – not a speck of wiggle! The wood grips are a later replacement. They are very nice walnut with one slight chip at the bottom front corner of the right panel. All serial numbers match although the hammer appears to be a replacement. All lettering is sharp and deep. The .32 WCF was a very popular caliber for the Single Action Army because it was interchangeable with the Winchester Model 1892 in that caliber being made at that time. A really wonderful piece from the early days of the 20th century that could certainly tell us some intriguing stories!If you want more photos or have any questions please dont hesitate to ask me! I will send this to your FFL via fedex or ups.

Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface. The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability. The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed. The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting. The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Includes one 30-round Magpul® PMAG® magazine. Manufacturer: Ruger Model: 8500 Condition: New Caliber/Gauge: 5.56 NATO Quantity: 1"

It's designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Light Weight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.
