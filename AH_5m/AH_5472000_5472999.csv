Guys , this is not just another AR. This is a purpose built, long range sniper rifle. I dont like calling a weapon a sniper rifle because of what it implies. But when it comes right down to it, this is the weapon you go to when your life is in danger, and you want to keep your family out of that dangers range. Unless your going up against military trained sniper, this weapon will keep anyone a long distance from you and your family. Its going to be the centerpeice of someones collection. I've lowered the price to 1100. I will not go any lower. I'll keep it first. Email a phone number, and I'll give you a call. I will call twice. If no one answers, I figure you didn't really want it. I have a new bipod, and a rock solid quick detach scope mount on the way. Both will be here in the next three days. I intend to include them with the weapon, if it sells. Otherwise, I'll put them to good use myself. If it does not sell by the first weekend in June, I'll keep it. Rifle is not 5.56 NATO. IT's 6.5 grendel, or .264LBC."

I took this in to my local gun shop as the owner is a bit of a mil surp guy. He says that it's a 1894 with just the sights and stock replaced. It has a 1914 manufacture date, 18"" barrel, matching numbers to the receiver, bolt, extractor, magazine, and HK inspection marks (a 1894 inspector) but the barrel seems to have an endcap over threads and I've read the 1894s did not have threaded barrels. I'm not a milsurp expert and this is the extent of what I can tell about this rifle.

My price is $650 FIRM, face to face in N.

The 20"" Extra Heavy Fluted Barrel ensures maximum bullet velocity and uses 1 in 8"" Twist Button Rifling to help stabilize heavier projectiles of up to 77 grains in weight, giving the shooter more reach and greater retained energy on target at longer distances. The Predator's Hybrid Match Chamber has tighter tolerances than a 5.56 NATO chamber for enhanced accuracy potential, while still retaining the ability to safely use both commercial and military surplus ammunition. The Predator features a rifle length Free Floating Tube Handguard with cooling slots for a comfortable off-hand grip that also removes accuracy-robbing influences from interfering with the barrel's harmonics upon firing. Accuracy is further emphasized by the barrel's 11 degree target crown at the muzzle. The upper comes complete and ready for instant use with bolt carrier group, charging handle, low profile gas block, forward assist, shell deflector and ejection port cover all included.

It comes with all original equipment and box. I am the original owner and the gun only has had 100 rds through putting it at 90% value per the blue book. It has no scratches or wear other than on the slide stop/release due to holstering. I am looking for trade mainly, I have a carry gun that I prefer over this one and I'm looking for a full size pistol. I appreciate your offers and thank you for your time but please only send request for what I have listed. I am willing to travel but no more than 40 miles from greenwood.  I am mainly looking for straight trade and depending on your trade I'll either add the sights or keep them, they are worth $80. I also have two +2 Pearce pinky extensions I'll thrown in as well. All this for $550 same as trade value and please don't hike up your Glock, I know the value due to my experience with firearm sales! Thanks for looking!"

The blueing isn't perfect, but, it has no pitting or rust or issues of any sort that effects it's reliability. The Hammerli 22SA Sport is the best shooting 22 I have ever owned. It isn't made any longer, and was carried only a short time by retailers. It's a 17 shot rifle, and is a pleasure to shoot. I've owned many 22's including Brownings and Henry's, but neither in my opinion hold a candle to this Hammerli. Search Hammerli and you'll see they are very well made comp. guns. I have quite a bit of 22 ammo that goes with this package, about 1700 rounds, which are CCI, Winchester, Federal. This rifle eats any ammo, it's not picky.
