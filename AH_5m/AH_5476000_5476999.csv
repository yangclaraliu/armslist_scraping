The muzzle brake, bolt shroud and handguard are all updated from the original Ruger Precision! MSRP is $1599 on this model.   Medium-contour (.75"" at the muzzle) barrel features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Hybrid Muzzle Brake to effectively reduce recoil while minimizing noise and blast to the sides of the shooter (thread protector included).   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 5R Rifling at minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace and centralized chamber.   20 MOA Picatinny rail secured with four, #8-40 screws for increased long-range elevation capabilities.   ""Upper"" receiver and one-piece bolt are precision CNC-machined from pre-hardened 4140 chrome-moly steel to minimize distortion.   Three-lug bolt with 70° throw features dual cocking cams and a smooth-running, full diameter bolt body.   In-line recoil path manages recoil directly from the rear of the receiver to the buttstock, not through a traditional bedding system, providing maximum accuracy potential.   Ruger® Precision MSR stock with QD sling attachment points features a bottom Picatinny rail and soft rubber buttpad. The left-folding stock hinge is attached to an AR-style buffer tube and accepts any AR-style stock.   Barrels can be easily replaced by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges.     Magazine well front is contoured for a positive grip for bracing against shooting supports.   Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation, with 5/16""-24 thread for easy replacement. Bolt disassembly tool is stored in the bolt shroud for easy striker channel cleaning. Also features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Billet Aluminum Bolt Shroud.   ""Lower"" magazine well halves are precision machined from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum and are Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Patent-pending multi-magazine interface functions interchangeably with AICS and M110/SR-25/DPMS/Magpul-style magazines (works with some M14 magazines).   Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger is externally adjustable with a pull weight range of 2.25 to 5.0 lbs.; wrench is stored in the bolt shroud.   Extended trigger-reach AR-style grip and 45° reversible safety selector. May be configured with any AR-style grip and selector.   Also includes: two, 10-round Magpul® PMAG® magazines.   Equipped with a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Short-Action Handguard for improved scope clearance for long-range scopes."

Romanian AK-47 made by CN Romarm SA/Cugir. Imported by Century Arms into the US. 
Lightly used, in great shape. standard wood furniture. palm-swell-finger-groove pistol grip. 30-rd steel magazine. 
According to research, there were two Arsenals manufacturing the AKM rifle in Romania: Cugir and SADAR. Unlike Arsenal SADAR, which always produced weapons sold as contract arms to other countries and other militant groups, Arsenal Cugir was the sole producer of arms used by the Romanian military. Arsenal Cugir no longer produces small arms, so modern Romanian WASRs are all SADAR-built. If WASR AKMs received something of a bad reputation, it was due to the lower quality of the SADAR rifles, slapped together for foreign sale. It was rumored that in the 90's, the Romanians would actually use Cugir-built guns as ""demos"" to make sales, but the rifles that shipped were actually SADAR-built.

I am throwing in 314 38 special rounds (mostly lead round nose with a few hollow point) and 10 357 rounds. Also comes with a Hunters Nylon right side hip holster. This gun is ideal for concealed carry.Featuring a recoil reducing grip, the SP101 is comfortable to shoot and perfect for personal defense. The shape of the grip is actually engineered to fit the human hand, resulting in greater recoil control and improved target acquisition.For iron sights, the gun has a low profile integral U-notch pattern that gets on target extremely well. The Ruger SP101 has a highly corrosion resistant stainless steel construction, operates as a traditional double action revolver and has a 2.25"" barrel."

The new Walther Softcoil gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther Softcoil Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP's Softcoil gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.CCP Features:3-Dot Polymer Sights  Rapid aiming and targeting acquisition  Rear sight screw adjustable for windage Low profile - won't snag clothing  Custom Rail Accessory  Picatinny Rail  Mounts optional flashlight or laser  Dynamic Trigger  5.5lb trigger pull Short .27"" trigger travel  Softcoil Technology   Gas-delayed blowback system  Easy cocking slide  2 Safeties  Manual thumb safety Firing pin block for safe carry  Finish  Steel barrel housing Stylish Stainless or Cerakote Black  Slide Serrations  Front and rear slide serrations  Non-slip surface to operate the slide Distinctive Walther styling  Slide Stop Lever  Slide locks back on empty  Magazine Release  Conveniently positioned for thumb operation Ambidextrous for right or left hand operation  Ergonomic Walther Grip  Non-slip, cross-directional grip surface  Better control Comfortable shape    Specifications:  Caliber: 9mm Barrel Length: 3.54"" Trigger Pull: SA 5.5 lbs Trigger Travel: 0.27"" Capacity: 8 Rounds Overall Length: 6.41"" Height: 5.12"" Width: 1.18"""

I've got a complete custom surgeon 591 built by APA and finished by phantom finishing. It has a 23"" bartlein barrel and will also come with another barrel that was used to fireform the roughly 900 pieces of Norma brass you will get. It is chambered in 7-300wsm. It's a 300 wsm necked down to 7mm. Basically it's a 7wsm but allows you to use the better Norma brass that's made in 300 wsm. It shoots 180 grain Berger vlds at 2980 into one ragged hole. I have a video of a cold bore shot at 780 yards in a decent wind I can send to anyone that's wants to see it.Back to the gun, it sits in an AICS chassis that has been custom milled to lighten it without reducing strength. A rail was installed into it as well for a bipod and is covered with a matching rail cover. The skins also had customMolding done to the grip to make it very comfortable. Much more so than the chassis comes stock. It also had an adjustable length of pull installed. The camo pattern is awesome. Very similar to multicam but with skulls for the light tan. It will come with a custom matching 3 port brake that is flush with the barrel. It has a jewel trigger set to go off by a sneeze. This is not an exaggeration. my guess is it's set in the area of around 4 oz.I am asking 4900 for the gun, extra barrel, brass, 2 mags (one FDE aics and one alpha mag), and ptg reamer to chamber any barrel in 7-300wsm. The Velcro ammo card comes with it as well.Open to trades for a .50 bmg or a thermal/nv scope. Potentially a multigun trade for a FDE scar 17, DT MDR or something else. Honestly can't hurt to ask. Text me at REDACTED or email at stevis182 at gmail dot com. Scope and bipod not included unless for the right trade such as a Barrett."

That is what some avid shooters consider the Coyote Light. Most crossover varmint/long range guns are easily recognized by their heavy barrels, bipod mounting studs and long range scopes, but they are far from being equal. The Winchester® Coyote Light is the rifle to take along for varmint, long range big game hunting and target shooting fun. It has been carefully trimmed of any unnecessary bulk but is no lightweight when it comes to performance. Fall in love with a skeleton. The matte-blued receiver and medium-heavy fluted stainless barrel mount into a skeletonized aluminum bedding block that is set in a lightweight carbon fiber/fiberglass composite Bell and Carlson™ stock for superb accuracy. Flow-through vents on the fore-end reduce weight and help cool the barrel during long strings of fire. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® pad helps soak up recoil. Available in standard short action and WSM calibers. (Scope and mounting system not included.) Bell & Carlson makes a uniquely high-quality product. That is the reason Winchester Repeating Arms has teamed with them over the years to produce our finest specialty rifles. With features like a proprietary molding system that maximizes strength and one of the industry's most acclaimed aluminum bedding block designs (for a total lock from action to stock), you get superb accuracy, ideal balance and strength only possible with non-traditional stock engineering. This rifle does not have a traditional injected type stock. As per specifications developed by Bell and Carlson and Winchester Repeating Arms, the stocks are ""constructed using a 'hand lay-up' process, using a variety of composite materials. These composites --  including fiberglass, aramid fibers, graphite, epoxy gel coats and laminating resins; and polyurethane reinforcement with milled fiberglass -- provide a warm and solid feel rather than the hollow feel one gets from injection molded stocks.""  The stock is reliable over a temperature range of -50 degrees to +140 degrees Fahrenheit for extreme stability under any heat and cold conditions you might encounter around the world: Alaska to Arizona and beyond. SCOPE NOT INCLUDED"

Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone doesn't stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol's felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealablility and increased magazine capacity, you'll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.Specifications:  Caliber: 9mm  Recoil System: Dual Spring with Full Length Guide Rod Sights: Fiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat Rear Weight (with Empty Magazine): 26 ozs. with Compact Magazine, 27 ozs. with X-Tension Height: 4.75"" with Compact Magazine, 5.5"" with X-Tension Slide: Forged Steel, Melonite Finish Barrel: 3"" Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite / 1:10"" Twist Length: 6.25"" Grip Width: 1.19"" Frame: FDE Polymer Magazines: 1-13 Round Compact, 1-16 Round with X-Tension, Stainless Steel"

It has the same dual-conical locking mechanism that lets Beretta over-unders stand up to years of constant shooting and to be passed on from generation to generation. Placing the locks between the barrels allows a low frame profile that gives Beretta over-unders an unmatched lively feel and natural pointability. Befitting of a field gun that will be used in exciting hunting situations, the safety is automatic, resetting each time the Silver Pigeon is opened for reloading.

Patton referred to as: "" the greatest battlefield implement ever devised."" She was originally purchased through the Civilian Marksmanship Program years ago. The rifle is chambered in the venerable 30-06 cartridge. The SA barrel dates to 4-55. The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. There is evidence of a faint ordnance cartouche stamp on the stock just below the left side of receiver.  The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips.  The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.This Garand is an excellent example of American Ingenuity. It retains the history of "" the greatest generation"", and will continue to be a legacy for generations to admire.*Numerous additional photos upon request."

I am asking $1450 cash or $1500 trade value. Looking for high end ar15 (factory built guns only), high end tactical 308 rifles, high end non railed 1911's, glocks, sigs, h&k, as you can see I'm fairly open to trade except hunting rifles. You must be able to meet in the greensboro area I'm not able to travel due to my job. Below I'd the description from dan Wesson's website about the specialist.
The Specialist is one of the newest additions to the Dan Wesson stable. When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public.
A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 or 9mm and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front.
The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there.
The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads (10 rounds in 9mm) and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear."

It has the same dual-conical locking mechanism that lets Beretta over-unders stand up to years of constant shooting and to be passed on from generation to generation. Placing the locks between the barrels allows a low frame profile that gives Beretta over-unders an unmatched lively feel and natural pointability. Befitting of a field gun that will be used in exciting hunting situations, the safety is automatic, resetting each time the Silver Pigeon is opened for reloading.

For those unfamiliar with 10mm it is basically a .40s&w supercharged, with that being said you can also shoot .40s&w flawlessly. Ammo is not really hard to find but quite expensive (20 for 35). Only trades that I will consider are semi automatic rifles chambered in 5.56, 7.62×39mm, or 7.62x51mm.
