Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes. This is unused.

I'm selling my Spikes Tactical model SL-15 AR-15 with SAR serial number. These are in HIGH demand because it stands (Spikes Assault Rifle). It means that is has the lower shelf for a full auto drop in sear. It is a multi caliber lower and you can shoot both .223 and 5.56. I have done a ton of upgrades to this since it was my first AR rifle. With all the upgrades, this thing shoots like butter and kicks about as much as a Ruger 10/22. It has about 1000-1200 rds and most were before a lot of the upgrades and is still in EXCELLENT condition. Here are all the upgraded items that I threw on it and the price paid for said item:
 
-WMD Guns Nickel Boron Full Auto Rated Bolt Carrier Group - $170
-Enidine AR-restor Hydraulic Piston Buffer - $100
-Superior Shooting Solutions Chrome Silicon Flat buffer spring - $29
-BattleComp 1.0 Muzzle Brake/Compensator - $150
-Rainier Arms Raptor Ambi Charging Handle - $86  -  YHM Low Profile Gas Block - $15
-Knights Armament URX III 12.5” Rail/Handguard w/ integrated front sight - $300 (Last I checked on m4carbine.com and ar15.com, they were selling for $450-$475 since they are discontinued)
-Knights Armament 200m-600m Folding Micro Rear Sight - $120
-Knights Armament Combat Trigger Guard Assembly - $30
-Chip McCormick CMC Flat Trigger 3.5lbs pull weight - $180
-Magpul BAD Lever Bolt Release - $28

-Fortis Shift Vertical Grip - $80
-Primary Arms Red Dot Sight 3MOA dot w/mount  - $179
-Primary Arms 6x Magnifier (Gen 1) w/ quick detach mount- $115  
(and the Stock Spikes rifle was $750 when I bought it)      Also, it comes with 2 Magpul window 30rd mags and 2 without windows, all are gen 2 I think.
 
So, I have about $2425 into this beast and I am only asking $1500 OBRO - Or Best Reasonable Offer.  I can Throw in my EOTech Insight L3 WL1-AA weapon light for another $150 as well. You wont find one of those for less than $200 anywhere!  If you would like to shoot it to see how little recoil and impulse there is, and how accurate it is, just let me know and I can try to set it up.

I'm pricing this gun way cheaper than Buds (plus you have to pay sales tax over there). Low ball offers and whiners will be ignored.

It will hold 3 shells on the stock where I use to keep 3 slugs. It is in very good condition and comes with a 28"" Express barrel with screw in choke, improved cylinder is in the barrel now. The barrel is chambered for 3"" shells but, it will handle 2&3/4"" shells just fine. The shotgun will not take 3"" shells, however the barrel fits functions just fine with 2&3/4 shells. Great defense shotgun, the shorter law enforcement stock allows for better maneuverability in a house or vehicle and it shoots fine from the shoulder as well. With the 28"" barrel and shorter stock it makes it a good hunting gun for a youth or woman. Will consider a reasonable off for either the shotgun or barrel or both."
