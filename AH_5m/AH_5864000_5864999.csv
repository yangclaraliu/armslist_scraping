I've put approx 100 rounds down range with this handgun. It's a awesome compact version of the C75 I just don't really need it. I am not desperate to get rid of it so please no low ball offers. I'll be using this towards another AR build so if you have any nice AR's for trade let me know and I can include cash. Always interested in other trades so let me know what you've got. Any questions shoot me a text or call REDACTED. I'm asking $525 for it.

Features engraved receiver, 2 3/4"" chamber and 28"" barrel with modified choke. Would make a handsome and reliable dove gun. I am in no rush to sell this gun and am only doing so because I do not need two semi-auto 12 gauge field guns. In other words, the price is firm.All applicable laws will be observed in the sale of this firearm. Buyer must produce valid NC driver's license and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

The 1911-22 A1 compact model is designed faithfully to look and feel like the original government model 1911-A1, in a compact package. The slide and frame are precision machined from aircraft grade 7075 T6 alloy for light weight and long life. A steel slide block encloses the firing pin and extractor, and a durable matte black anodized finish completes the overall package. After extensive testing and research, it was determined that 85% of the original size was ideal for the smaller cartridge. Just like the original 1911 design, the Browning 1911-22 has both a grip safety and a manual thumb safety, making it one of the safest autoloading rimfire pistols available.

This rifle is a pretty nice all around platform, recoils only slightly more than a 5.56, and the accuracy is certainly there. I am open to offers and possibly trades depending on what you have.

There is a small discolored mark on the slide that looks way worse in the picture I took than it does in person.  Just want to be fair about the condition of the gun.
Included with this pistol is one 10-round magazine with a Pearce PG-26 extension, an original Glock factory magazine base plate (flush fitting), a cable lock, the original Glock case, and a Don Hume inside-the-waistband leather holster.

Included with the gun is a Pachmayr slip-on grip, a Tacticool Inc bolt tube cover, three Genuine Glock 17 - 17 Round magazines, and a cable lock.  I also upgraded all the screws for the receiver and forend to socket head, instead of phillips because it looks a lot nicer that way!

This is a really sharp gun!  There's one little scratch/scuff in the barrel which I've taken a separate picture of.  Included is just the gun and a cable lock.
