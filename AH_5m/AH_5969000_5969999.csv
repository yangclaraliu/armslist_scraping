So my loss is your gain. I'm sure some one with more experience can get it going but I'm at a loss. I have put over $600 into this build and I don't want to spend more trying to figure it out.

The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.Features:Caliber: 22Stock: Wood stockMagazines: 2 magsAction: Semi-AutomaticCaliber: 22 Long RifleBarrel Length: 16.5""33.5"" overall barrel length Capacity: 24+1Trigger: StandardSafety: LeverStock Style: WoodMetal Finish: MatteWooden furniture Hand weathered finishTape and bandana added Gun Weight: 6.75 lbs"

This police package came from an estate sale.  The revolver is a 1968 model Smith & Wesson Model blued 10-5 that shows ""character"" and wears it with pride! This was the everyday carry weapon for this police officer until his retirement many years ago. Bore and cylinder are clean and everything feels tight. The rear sights and front ramp have white paint lightly dabbed on for the ""old school"" edition of fiber optic sights we have today.  The revolver has lots of holster wear and some light freckling in a few spots, but I think it is in better aesthetic condition than I would have expected from a career long everyday use and carry gun. This gun has not been abused, as this is just honest wear from being on the job for many years. There is wear primarily on the inside corners where they rubbed while in the holster, but there is also much evidence externally of it being a true ""on the job"" weapon. Bore and chambers on the cylinder are good and have been well maintained. After all, this officer's life depended on this gun working every time he might have to pull the trigger.  The gun came to me with beautiful custom-made dark walnut with target thumb rest grips. I will include them in the sale, but the buyer has their choice of an additional pair of either Smith & Wesson wood grips or rubber Pachmayr Gripper grips. I have attached pics of the gun with the original target grips, as well as pics of both options to help you decide which of the two bonus options you prefer.  I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.  The holster is a Jay-Pee Spring Lock Safety Swivel Holster that features a trigger guard click retention button to keep the pistol securely inside the holster until it can easily be removed with a push of the finger as you draw the pistol. It also has space on the belt to hold a dozen .38 Special bullets. The belt is a Bianchi 42 with adjustable sizing and quick connection prongs.  This is a really cool police package that will easily take you back in time to when this officer carried his gun with this belt and holster.  Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions.  $295 for the entire package. Please contact me if you would like to see the belt and holster pic and other pictures I have available."

It was purchased NEW by me last fall (original receipt will be included in sale) and used very sparingly. Please refer to pics-- optics are perfect. Video is perfect. Updated 10/3/16 with newest firmware which added new reticles and improved on/off feature, etc. An external power USB power supply and cable (Aukey 3600 mAh) which DRAMATICALLY improves the run time (adds several hours of user time); a focus assist pigtail (seen mounted on scope and ESSENTIAL for quick focusing!); an extra powerful Evolva IR Flashlight/batteries/charger which I used mounted under my .223 which DRASTICALLY improves nighttime illumination over the included original ATN IR illuminator. The original illuminator/batteries are also included. A micro USB and adaptor are included for you to record photos/video on. The original ATN OD green tactical bag, paperwork, lens cleaner. The original eye shade and an extended eye shade are included, but I never used them. I did mount this scope on a better than original pica tinny mount base. It is solid as a rock and worked perfect on my ranch rifle. Less than a couple hours (and less than 40 rounds of ammo) of service time on this fine optic. Works as new. I did have the front lens shade drilled as seen in the photo as this DRASTICALLY improves resolution in all lighting conditions. You can flip it out of the way if you don't want to use that feature, but I don't know why you would as the image is that much better.  The price is firm as I have over $100 in accessories for this included.  Scope also does Geotagging, E-compass, GPS, Velocity, Altitude, etc etc.  Rediculously good reviews.  Best Night Vision scope for the money by far.   KentHere is a link for full description: https://www.amazon.com/ATN-X-Sight-Riflescope-Stabilization-Android/dp/B00B0BB4SK"

The optic has the Plex reticle which pairs nicely with the ballistic turret. The optic is currently on my .308, but has NEVER been shot. I bought this optic (as you can see on the Scheels sticker ) for $1,175.93 ($1099 X 7% Tax). It still has the original boxing and paperwork. Nothing has been used including the sticker. I bought this with the hopes that I would be doing a lot more big game hunting but have struggled to find the time to do so or even dial it in. It is doing me no good to sit in my closet so I figured I would let someone else enjoy it. The best feature on the optic is the ballistic turent, if you are not aware of what it is, I would advise to go to Swvorski's website and do some reasearch. To sum it up real quickly, the sight is fully adjustable on the go, you can either adjust the colored rings, as you see in the picture, or you can download the app, where you put the weight and caliber of bullet in the app and it will tell you how many clicks set the scope so that there is no guessing and you are dead on at virtually any distance. Really an awesome feature, it was originally the reason why I purchased this optic. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me, I am easiest to contact by text. Please no unreasonable offers, I am already losing $200 on a scope that I have never shot. Cell: REDACTED"
