Too many guns and not enough time. It is a full-size polymer frame semi-automatic pistol chambered in the potent .22 Magum round. It comes with (2) 30-round capacity magazine's and factory case and manual. That's a lot of firepower and plinking fun, for such a light weight pistol. This gun is perfect for your “Bug Out Bag.” A careful distribution of polymer and aluminum around key steel components has reduced the pistol's weight to a feathery 13.6 ounces when unloaded. A fully loaded magazine will only add 6 more ounces to the total weight. The pistol has a narrow profile overall. The front-to-back distance in the grip is a bit longer than usual in order to accommodate the .22 Mag. cartridges. The full-length grip also has a subtle pie-wedge shape, narrowing at the front under the trigger guard. The overall effect is a grip that is quite comfortable to work with, even for shooters with smaller hands. The PMR-30 has an ambidextrous safety that is easy to reach and operate. The slide arrives from the factory fitted with bright fiber-optic sites, and it's drilled and tapped to accommodate a scope base. The frame has an integrated Picatinny accessory rail to allow shooters to attach various lights and laser sights. I also have 100 rounds of .22 WMR ammo that I will sell with the gun for an extra $30."

It has the box, and all of the paper work I never registered the warranty with Ruger, so you have the option to do that as well if you want.The gun itself is great for conceal carry, it fits in my back jeans pocket with the factory grip, and easily conceals with a IWB holster or loose T Shirt.

The XM3 was specifically developed to be a light, compact, and highly accurate sniper rifle. (sub-MOA out to 1,000 yds.) Though these are employed by our military branches heavily it is rare when the civilian market gets a chance to own one. Even more rare is the chance to own a XM3 Reaper (1 of only 2 made). I have documentation from the builder proving what this gun is and its rarity. This rifle was actually built by Remington's custom shop while they were at Camp Perry during the National Rifle Match. There ahve been other XM3's that have been sold for $16,000+ (non reaper edition). However, I need cash and am willing to let this rifle go. This would be a perfect gift for the person that has it all!If you have any questions or want to see more photos feel free to email me.Need Cash, Certified Check, or Money Order!"

(fight like a man or die like a dog) I had originally intended to accurize this gun with an aftermarket trigger and spring kit, but it doesn't need it. The machining and fitting of this gun is on par with the Kimbers that my father in law has. I hate to get rid of it but the money is needed and I can't part with my custom Glock. The gun comes in the box with all of the included papers and lock. I also have a Kimber Pro Tac Mag with 3 baseplates, 50 rounds of generic FMJ and 20 rounds of Winchester PDX1 230 grain bonded jacketed low flash hollow points. I do also have a brown leather Bianchi holster. It's for a S&W but it does fit and hold the 1911 well. It fit and it was on sale so...This gun is excellent and you could easily spend a grand on the same level of quality. I was the first private owner of it and supposedly it was a SHOT show demo prior to my purchase but I have no way to verify that. Thank you for looking"
