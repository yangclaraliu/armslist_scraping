I prefer face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you.  No middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship. 
 
This is a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Model 06390, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol, manufactured in 1986.  In Like-NEW Condition, with the rare 150th anniversary silver medallions on the handgrips, 100% of original Colt blue finish, machined from solid block hardened-steel (no cheap polymer, zinc alloys or aluminum as found in recent Colts). 
 
Only one round was test fired from this 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang; I purchased it from a dealer in 1986, along with Federal hydra-shock ammo (ammo still has $8.99 price sticker) and I kept both in the night stand by my bed for personal protection for 40 years.  There are no scuff marks, no wear-marks, no scratches.  Included are the factory box, Colt manual, and all original paperwork (including a letter from Gary French, the President of Colt). 
 
Great defense weapon – small, accurate and solid as a tank.  It has a 2 3/4” barrel, 6 round capacity, 5” overall length. 
 
Do not compare this solid steel, 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol to the flimsy, cheap plastic, and aluminum versions, this is a precision milled weapon that is solid like a tank!
 
My asking price is $850 cash, no trades.  The fair market value of a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV/Series 80, Mustang .380 is $895 to $1,000.  Look for yourself at  http://www.gunbroker.com/item/573988609    The non-anniversary editions of the Mark IV, Series 80 Colt Mustang are all priced in the $700’s, do a search here at Armslist for “Colt Mark IV/Series 80 Mustang” and see for yourself that even the non-anniversary edition is in the $700 range!
 
As you can see, my $850 asking price is a bargain.  Remember, cash only, no trades!"

$700 cash or a little better on trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax and I'm sure it's a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.

There are good illegals but there are a lot of gang members also. Mexico has harsher laws for illegal Aleins then the US anyd they enforce their laws. You are not racist if you don't want ISIS coming into our Country, you are not racist if you want illegals to come in legally, you are not racist if you want your laws enforced, your not racist if you want jobs for American citizens, your not racist if you think all lives matter, your not crazy because you want to bare arms, you are a patriot if you want these things. The judges Hillary will put in the Supreme Court will be far left and will judge with their opinion instead of law. You must vote for Trump. You must register soon, so that you miss your chance. Your vote has never meant more then it does this election. Watch you tube videos of Hillary on you tube. She called young African Americans preditors. She is racist. We the people are not stupid.

I prefer face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you.  No middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship. 
 
This is a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Model 06390, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol, manufactured in 1986.  In Like-NEW Condition, with the rare 150th anniversary silver medallions on the handgrips, 100% of original Colt blue finish, machined from solid block hardened-steel (no cheap polymer, zinc alloys or aluminum as found in recent Colts). 
 
Only one round was test fired from this 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang; I purchased it from a dealer in 1986, along with Federal hydra-shock ammo (ammo still has $8.99 price sticker) and I kept both in the night stand by my bed for personal protection for 40 years.  There are no scuff marks, no wear-marks, no scratches.  Included are the factory box, Colt manual, and all original paperwork (including a letter from Gary French, the President of Colt). 
 
Great defense weapon – small, accurate and solid as a tank.  It has a 2 3/4” barrel, 6 round capacity, 5” overall length. 
 
Do not compare this solid steel, 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol to the flimsy, cheap plastic, and aluminum versions, this is a precision milled weapon that is solid like a tank!
 
My asking price is $850 cash, no trades.  The fair market value of a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV/Series 80, Mustang .380 is $895 to $1,000.  Look for yourself at  http://www.gunbroker.com/item/573988609    The non-anniversary editions of the Mark IV, Series 80 Colt Mustang are all priced in the $700’s, do a search here at Armslist for “Colt Mark IV/Series 80 Mustang” and see for yourself that even the non-anniversary edition is in the $700 range!
 
As you can see, my $850 asking price is a bargain.  Remember, cash only, no trades!"

The new AR-556 has a gas-impingement system, just like the original AR 15 rifle design. The AR is a gas-operated rifle that uses the expanding gasses from the firing sequence to unlock the bolt directly via a tube that passes from under the front site, to a gas key connection on top of the bolt carrier. Most other gas operated rifles – including Ruger’s SR series – use a gas piston and op-rod to unlock the bolt after firing. The AK, M1, M14, the new M4-A4, and a host of others use a version of that basic mechanism.
 
The chamber is cut (out of the factory) for the 5.56 (and .223) round and utilizes the improved M4 feed ramp for increased reliability.
 
The gas piston mechanism results in a much cleaner firing system; all the carbon fouling stays on the end of the piston-more or less. The gas impingement system is like a smog device for your car: all the gunk ends up in the engine, or in this case, the bolt and carrier.  It’s a much dirtier arrangement. However, the gas-impingement rifle has much less reciprocating mass, giving it an edge in accuracy
 
Designed to reliably fire bullet weights up to (at least) 77 grains (and down to 35 grains) in weight.
 
The lower Receiver is standard with it six-position stock and military trigger. The trigger broke at eight pounds and is an improvement from most out-of-the-box military M4s.  The hand grip is not standard M4; it is shaped for a better feel.  The entire rifle is finished in a black oxide. No front sling swivel, but there is an attachment point for one as well as a bayonet, bipod, or other device.

I prefer face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you.  No middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship. 
 
This is a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Model 06390, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol, manufactured in 1986.  In Like-NEW Condition, with the rare 150th anniversary silver medallions on the handgrips, 100% of original Colt blue finish, machined from solid block hardened-steel (no cheap polymer, zinc alloys or aluminum as found in recent Colts). 
 
Only one round was test fired from this 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mustang; I purchased it from a dealer in 1986, along with Federal hydra-shock ammo (ammo still has $8.99 price sticker) and I kept both in the night stand by my bed for personal protection for 40 years.  There are no scuff marks, no wear-marks, no scratches.  Included are the factory box, Colt manual, and all original paperwork (including a letter from Gary French, the President of Colt). 
 
Great defense weapon – small, accurate and solid as a tank.  It has a 2 3/4” barrel, 6 round capacity, 5” overall length. 
 
Do not compare this solid steel, 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV, Series 80, Mustang 380 semi-automatic pistol to the flimsy, cheap plastic, and aluminum versions, this is a precision milled weapon that is solid like a tank!
 
My asking price is $850 cash, no trades.  The fair market value of a 150th Anniversary Edition Colt Mark IV/Series 80, Mustang .380 is $895 to $1,000. Even the non-anniversary editions of the Mark IV, Series 80 Colt Mustang are all priced in the $700’s, do a search here at Armslist for “Colt Mark IV/Series 80 Mustang” and see for yourself that even the non-anniversary edition is in the $700 range!
 
As you can see, my $850 asking price is a bargain.  Remember, cash only, no trades!"

I only got this AR in June, and overall it has been great, but I am moving and selling most of my firearms to pay for the expenses.Beginning January 1st of 2017, it will be illegal to buy this exact rifle in California, and ammunition purchases will require background checks.

With 300 rounds of quality ammunition, this is a great purchase for somebody who wants to get into the world of ARs for the first time. Also for sale is 300 Rounds of Wolf Polyformance .223 ammo, and I included that in the asking price of $650. If you want only the rifle or only the ammo, go ahead and shoot me an offer, I am open to anything. I need to sell this gun, so it is priced to sell quickly.
