This is not your typical little pocket pistol, this one comes with two major upgrades not commonly seen on other P238 or .380 pistols. Firstly is comes with extremely comfortable and soft Hogue Rubber Grips that will make the recoil feel like nothing and make it ergonomic in any hand.Secondly this comes with upgraded glow sights. They are not night sights but they will glow up to 24 hours on a single charge. The sights absorb ambient light and will glow for hours.There is a reason this pistol is called the ""La-Z-Boy"" of pistols becuase of how easy, smooth and comfortable it is to shoot. It is one of the MOST preferred pistols for conceal carry. It will easily fit inside of a pocket and look like a cell phone at a glance. With the ability to carry with the hammer down, round in chamber and the safety on, it becomes the perfect companion for ever day every where.This deal comes with many addons and accessories but the most important being 750 rounds of ammo. 700 of it is JHP and 50 is FMJ. 500 of the JHP rounds is loaded by Freedom Munitions but they used SPEER Nickel casings and Hornady JHP bullets, extremely high quality defensive ammo. The other 200 rounds was produced by USAAmmo with SPEER bullets and generic brass casings, very high quality. Then the 50 FMJ rounds are standard ball ammo from freedom muntions.Most importantly this comes with 4 magazines! Two mags hold 10 rounds, and the other two hold 7 rounds, one of which comes with a finger extension for a full grip on the pistol. Carry 7+1 during the day, then when you get home swap out the mag for a 10 round mag and it becomes a perfect home defense gun with plenty of ammo and glow sights.This also comes with a kydex holster, lock, case and other small accessories as seen in the pictures.In it's life it has probably seen 200 rounds total through the barrel and so it is in Like New condition. Please contact me with any questions."

The Savage Arms 64F .22LR rifle is well known for it's accuracy and crisp trigger. It features a free floated barrel which is an absolute must for accurate rifles, a feature you don't see in the Ruger 10/22.This rifle comes with 4 magazines that each hold 10 rounds. It also has a rock solid receiver and bolt group that can even be dry fired with out damaging the firing pin. It has an easy to access firing side safety mechanism as well as the ability to lock the bolt back which is another feature not found commonly on .22lr rifles. Sights have a rear dovetail rear sight and a bladed bead front sight, which is very easy to adjust for distance and accuracy. This can easily hit targets with sub moa accuracy past 150 yards with the right ammo! This rifle out shoots many rifles twice it's price. I have never had any particular ammo problems, it will take any type of ammo you shoot through it. This helps make the gun reliable even after hundreds of rounds it keeps hammering off with no problem. It is easy to disassemble and clean with simply removing two screws near the trigger guard.Here is a great review of the rifle: go to you tube and search ""Savage Model 64 Shoot & Review"" by ""Recon Media""The bipod is included with the rifle."

Of the 310rds 260rds were 556 and 50rds were .300Aac. I purchased this rifle late September of last year for my survival pack but am thinking about building a more compact lightweight Ar. This rifle gives you the cool option of being able to switch out your barrel to a higher caliber (.300Aac blkout) without the usuage of any tools and still have the capability to hold zero on the sights. As well as giving you the great reliability of being piston operated. Also includes a nice durable FDE Lucid Hd7 gen3 red dot sight with a x2 magnifier and kill flash that has only been field tested once! The Hd7 gives the the option between 3 or 4 different red dot reticles with auto brightness and manual and auto shutoff after two hours. Another thing I like about Lucid besides their quality work is they give you a lifetime warranty on the optic itself. So no matter what happens or who owns it they'll fix it or give you a new one.. My Asking price for the setup is $1850.. Mrsp for the rifle is $2049 and the .300Aac blkout package is mrsp at $450 plus the lucid & accessories was a little less then $300.. If interested shoot me an offer the worst I can say is no.. Not really looking for trades but will always entertain them.. Never know something might catch my eye.. (360)319-9192 I will send more pictures to people who are interested. Will only allow me to upload one picture. $1850 with FDE Lucid Hd7 gen 3 $1750 without INCLUDES: Ruger Sr556 Takedown .300Aac Barrel 3 PMags2 metal mags marked .300blkoutRuger Takedown Pouch FDE Lucid Hd7 x2 magnifier kill flash 160 rds of 556
