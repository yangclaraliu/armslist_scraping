Send request for more pictures or information.Note, this gun is registered to me so the transfer will take place at a gun shop. Shipping is a huge PITA so unless you're willing to do the footwork (I have no idea how to go about the transfer and shipping) please don't ask. Figure it out first with your local dealer with an FFL and then get in touch. Lastly, I'm not in need of the cash so the price is what it is.

The pistol weighs in at just shy of 32 ounces, so it's a heavy duty pistol. It has been fired twice, with about 150 rounds total run through it. At this time I am not interested in any trades. I am asking $950, but am open to reasonable offers. Thanks for looking!"

The knife has a blade that is approximately 7.5"" (19cm) long, and is of the classic Bowie shape. The hollow-ground main edge is about 6.5"" (16.5cm) long. The false edge is serrated on one side. The back of the blade features a very aggressive 3"" (7.5cm) long sawback. Maximum blade width is about 1.5"" (3.7cm), and the blade is .288 - .290-inch thick. The blade is forged 425mod steel. The handguard is about 6mm thick, with both ends curving slightly towards the blade. Each end is drilled and tapped for a 2"" (51mm) long, 10mm diameter ""point"" which is designed to allow the knife to be used as an anchor when a line is attached to the lanyard ring at the pommel. The grip is 4"" (102mm) long and 1.25"" (2.8cm) in diameter, knurled and grooved for a sure grip. The grip is hollow, with a usable internal opening secured by the threaded pommel, which in turn is knurled, slightly larger in diameter than the grip, and sealed with a black rubber O-ring. The threaded pommel also secured a 4.5mm thick steel stamping which is pierced to provide a lanyard/rope hole. The sheath is of black rigid fiberglass-reinforced plastic. Attached to the front of the sheath are one removable black nylon pouch; This pouch contains a full-size Silva Type 12 compass. The back of the sheath has an inlaid sharpening stone. Heavy black nylon webbing is used to cover the stone. This is also a loop provide for a leg tie. An additional loop of black nylon webbing, with a Fastex-type closure, provides a quick-release belt loop. As for the knife's production, the Buckmaster was tested by and issued to the Navy SEALs for a short time. I have read that the knurled metal handle did a number on hands while chopping; it didn't do too well in salt water tests; and it was very heavy. These days the Buck 184 ""Buckmaster"" are extremely popular with collectors. Please E-mail me for questions or concerns. Thank-you for your time."

It is a 1893 dated rifle made at Spandau. This rifle is a 88S and not a 88/05 that you will often see, meaning that it still uses the original enbloc clips. It is in overall great condition for a 123 year old rifle. The bore is in decent condition, slightly dark with good rifling. This does have a .318"" bore, so you need to be careful when shooting this, modern 8mm may cause overpressure, due to having a larger bullet. Shooting this with any sort of regularity should be considered a reloading affair. I have test fired 10 rounds of Winchester 8mm(undersized bullets and a reduced charge), and it shoots wonderfully and I managed to get very good groups. Numbers appear to be all matching, with the exception of the bolt. The bolt matches itself, with the exception of the cocking piece. This may have been lightly sanded at one point, but the cartouches are still visible and deep on the stock. This rifle Is S-marked and has the dot punched on the receiver for the reinforced barrel contour. From What I can tell this is a genuinely German rifle and not one of the many rifles that came here from turkey.Included is 4 reproduction enbloc clips(these have a reputation of not working well, but I have modified these and they work decently now). Asking $300 for everything."

This shotgun has been lightly used, maybe 50-75 rounds through it just to get past the break-in period. All of the basic restoration work has been done on this firearm; factory fire control group and factory trigger guard have been replaced with US-made parts (Tapco G2 trigger group and billet aluminum trigger guard with safety stop), a receiver block has been installed at the rear trunion and fitted with an ACE folding stock hinge and Mississippi Auto Arms aluminum skeleton stock with rubber recoil pad. The bolt carrier has been polished and smoothed to remove rough edges and contact surfaces. Safety lever has been modified with a notch to hold the bolt handle back, similar to the Krebs Custom enhanced safety lever. Pistol grip is a Magpul MOE AK grip with a core that has waterproof storage for CR123 batteries. I have also installed a TAC 47 Auto Plug, which does away with the need for manual adjustment of gas pressure and allows the gun to fire a wide variety of different loads without feed failures or risking damage to the bolt carrier and rear trunion. Factory handguard has been modified to hold a Magpul AFG forward grip; I would suggest replacing this later on but not because it's an actual problem, the rail section is strong enough, it just looks ugly to me even though the AFG covers it. This shotgun also has a custom flash hider machined out of 01 tool steel and based on the Russian DTK-01-MIL muzzle brake. The walls aren't thick enough to actually work as a muzzle brake but it disperses flash well and it looks cool. I hate to see it go, but my current financial crisis doesn't allow for sentimentality. Also included are two AGP Gen 2 ten round magazines, one black and one painted red, and of course one five round factory magazine."
