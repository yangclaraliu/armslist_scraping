Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

The sale will include 5 OEM Sig Sauer 15 round magazines, retention holster, and magazine holder all purchased directly from the Sig Sauer store along with the Legion case and all original manuals and lock. The Legion series comes standard with Sig X-RAY night sights, steel guide rod, G-10 grips, low profile controls, and a SRT adjustable trigger which is in all honesty the nicest trigger I have ever used. Only selling because I use my PPQ (my nightstand gun) more often and the Sig has just been sitting in the safe not seeing much action. I’d prefer a sale in person to a SC resident but am open to discussing FFL options (buyer would be responsible for fees/shipping on both ends).

This machine rifle is similar in function to other related World War I automatic rifles used for assaulting the enemy.  The BAR was designed to be carried by infantrymen during an assault or advance while supported by the sling over the shoulder or fired from the hip. This is a concept called ""walking fire"" — thought to be necessary for the individual soldier during trench warfare. The BAR never entirely lived up to the original hopes of the War Department; being neither a rifle nor a machine gun.The US Army, in practice, used the BAR as a light machine gun (aka squad support weapon) often fired from a bipod (introduced on models after 1938). A variant of the original M1918 BAR, the Colt Monitor Machine Rifle, remains the lightest production automatic gun to fire the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, though the limited capacity of its standard 20-round magazine tended to hamper its utility in that role.Although the weapon did see some action in World War I, the BAR did not become standard issue in the U.S. Army until 1938, when it was issued to squads as a portable light machine gun. The BAR saw extensive service in both World War II and the Korean War and saw limited service in the Vietnam War."

There are many great handguns on the market today however; Glock is the benchmark in which all others strive to achieve. Glock pistols are renowned for their simplicity, accuracy, and rugged reliability; rightfully so given the fact that over 30 years Glock has been providing their Safe Action pistols to military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters all over the world. The Glock 30S was created to take a full capacity .45 ACP round count and place it in a smaller package. The Glock 30S is designed for optimal concealment without the bulk and weight of a full size pistol. Pick up a Glock today and you will see that there is no substitute for perfection.

PT 111 the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.Taurus Security System (TSS)sTaurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

The Finns stamped the ""SA"" (Suomen Armeija or People's Army) on the receiver, as almost seen in the fuzzy close-up.Kovrov SVTs are not found as often as others, they were only made in 1940 and 1941.Since the Finns captured and reworked Soviet rifles, non-matching parts are common and expected.This Tokarev rifle is in very good shape considering what it must have gone through.It has the original cleaning rod, one magazine, is fitted with the 6 baffle muzzle brake, and munted in a 1941 Tula stock. The bore is dark but looks decent.Must be 18 or over to purchase, all laws apply, thanks for looking."
