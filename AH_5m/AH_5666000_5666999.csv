I upgraded the gun before ever shooting it with a Tandemkross flat faced trigger with pretravel and overtravel adjustments. I also swapped out the hammer bushing which removes the magazine disconnect safety and allows the mags to drop freely when you push the release and I swapped out the front sight for a fiber optic. The green pipe is in there now but it comes with red and white as well if you want to swap out. Will also come with original trigger, bushing and front sight and all the Ruger factory stuff (removable picatinny rail, bag, lock, sticker, etc). Have shot it suppressed and unsuppressed and it's eaten everything I've fed it except it didn't seem to like Winchester Super X. All others good to go. Have about 150 rounds total through it."

I got the gun used so I don't know the total round count but the internals look to be in good shape with normal wear. This is a very unique hard to find gun. This is a Canadian made model which were believed to be better quality than the later American made. Includes original factory case and paperwork. 2 6 round mags and 1 Chip McCormick 7 rounder. The 7 round mag had trouble feeding the 7th round so I only load it with 6 and it ran great.  It's not often these come up for sale. Don't miss out on a great opportunity. This could be a awesome carry gun. Looks great and shoots reliably. $700 cash. All laws apply. Foid, ISP check and wait period required. Many more pics available!Text me: REDACTEDThanks"

I bought a left hand eject and disconnected the dust cover spring so the empty brass falls right where I can easily grab it with my non-firing hand after each shot at the range, rather than hunting for my brass 20 feet away. - Lower is a Surplus Ammo and Arms with a Rock River Arms 2 stage trigger kit, magpul grip, and magpul prs stock. The prs stock was added later and has seen very little use, essentially brand new. I had this rifle setup with a Leupold Mk AR scope and it worked great. The longer barrel really gets every little bit of velocity out of each round. I have personaly fired exactly 120 rounds through this rifle. I am only selling because I don't use it much and would like to put the money towards other tools. Rifle will come with 1 (25) round magazine, it has some slight wear but works great. Price is $1000I have 200 rounds of silver state armory 115gr OTM enhanced fragentation 6.8 spc ammo which will be available to purchase once the rifle is sold.

The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from high-quality aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.

The 22/45 utilizes Ruger's proven internal cylindrical bolt and fixed barrel design, that provides a higher accuracy potential over designs with a moving slide by ensuring the pistol's sights stay in permanent alignment. The 22/45 Target semi-automatic pistol comes with a precision rear target sight that's fully adjustable for windage and elevation. Vertical post, modified Patridge-style front sight; the sights are easy to see and allow for precise shooting at small targets.The weight of the barrel aids to hold the pistol steady, but a lightweight Zytel polymer grip frame makes it comfortable to carry in a field holster. The grip frame features a serrated front strap and backstrap, and integral contoured panels that provide a sure hold in any type of environment.The 22/45 has several safety features, making it one of the safest handguns on the market. A loaded chamber indicator on the side of the receiver indicates when the chamber is loaded by sight or touch. A manual thumb safety locks the sear, while allowing the pistol to be loaded and unloaded when engaged. A magazine disconnect prevents the pistol from firing once the magazine is removed."

This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. All upper assemblies are shipped with a recoil buffer and action spring. These components must be installed to ensure proper function of the SIG516 upper assembly on your AR-type lower receiver.""NO TRADES & LOCAL ONLY"

I had plans of refinishing stock and possibly adding muzzle break for my son to varmint hunt, but he (young teen) decided to shoot it first, before I did the work...recoil was a bit much for his liking, lol, and he now wants a different rifle. I prefer to trade for a nice varmint caliber rifle. Comes with 117 rounds - including 2 new factory boxes (Hornady 95 gr SST & Rem 100 gr Core-Lokt) and the rest are misc. older reloads (I shot a few - not great, but OK to target shoot).I also have a Browning BPS 12 ga listed as well in a seperate listing, and would trade this rifle and shotgun for a high quality rifle.

This revolver is chambered in 9mm.Because of the Titanium finish, it's in fantastic shape and shows minimal signs of wear. Also because of the limited dates of manufacturer and the fact that it's a hammerless variant, people on Taurus forums look at this as basically a collectors item. It comes with a new DeSantis Sof-tuk holster, 14 moon clips, the original factory grip, an aftermarket grip which I purchased, as well as the factory box and manuals. I purchased this gun used, and have put 70 rounds through it. It's accurate for the barrel length, however if you choose to fire 70 Federal HST's at once as I did, your hand will know it's been to the shooting range. What it lacks as a ""range gun"", it more than makes up for as a lightweight defensive weapon. Also, because of the hammerless design and the weight, it would make a perfect defensive carry for a woman.Sale price is firm."
