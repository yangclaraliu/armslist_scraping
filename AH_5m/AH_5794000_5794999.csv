Face to face deals only. Kentucky residents only, no shipping, and must have proof of ID (i.e., CCDW, Driver's License). I will check your ID, and you can check mine. I do have a CCDW. $750 cash. Trade value is $800. Cash price is firm so no low ball offers. I got more than $850 invested on the gun. I'm selling this gun cheaper than the gun shops around in Lexington (Buds sells the same gun or model for $879.99 + tax). Low ball offers and whiners will be ignored. And will not respond to ""call me, text me"" replies. I prefer to communicate via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. If the ad is up, the gun is still available. I'll take the ad down when the gun is sold. Thanks for looking."

Everything inside it is high quality, and the gun runs 100%.  This is a perfect training gun, shooter for those that like to actually run their rifles.  I wanna build something else, so this one is getting a new home.  Rifle started out as a complete factory Daniel Defense DDM4v1.  I have the box, shipping box, and documentation.  I bought the gun new.  Retail on the gun is $1800ishI had the front site post cut down and reblued by Claytons and had them install one of the original BCM KMR13 handrails.  The cut down front site post remains pinned to the barrel as it came from the DD factory, and I beleive this method is much stronger than low profile gasblocks that are held in with a small set screw.  This KMR rail is from when they were made from the Magnesium alloy, not the alluminium that they are made out of now (KMR-alphas).  This one is lighter, and is hard to get a hold of now.  Makes for a very light front end on the rifle, and its balance is excellent.  The BCG and Bolt remain the factory DD stuff, so is the barrel, gas system, and buffer/spring.  Daniel's factory guns run excellent, so there is no reason to mess with it.  Trigger is a geiselle super triconLantac Dragon Muzzle breakB5 Systems Sopmod stockUmbrello Corp (made by b5) grip, stippled.BCM angled foregrip and rail coversBCM charging handle.Inforce wml mounted at 12oclockMbus sightsMagpul bad leverThe gun's obviously been painted.  Old school krylon camo rattle can.  The paint is worn.  Easy enough to re-spray if you're so inclined, but personally I like my guns to show that they're actually used.  Rifle has about 1700 rounds through it.  Internals are clean and tidy.  Gun has stayed cleaned and well lubed."

It has been developed from thier highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
The PF-9 retains the best features from the P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

S&A magwell (flares the magazine well for ease of reloading magazines)8. I'll also include a new kydex holster and six (SIX!) Wilson Combat magazines.  The STI Lawman retails for right around $1,300 stock out of the box.  This does not include any of these add ons.  All of the original parts are included with the pistol.  One of the photos shows the receipt from JPL for the work done as shown above."

The wooden stock is in good condition, with some minor cosmetic defects. Butt pad is original hard plastic. Sling lugs are provided. Manufactured in 1949, this rifle predates the Gun Control Act of 1968, so it does not have a serial number. I have a receipt from the FFL seller to that effect. Rust is very minimal to non-existent on the barrel and receiver. The bluing is in good condition on the barrel and receiver as well, though it has worn off the magazine somewhat. The magazine spring is in good working order. Due to the rimmed nature of the .30-30 Winchester, the action does not prefer being slowly worked, though it functions satisfactorily at typical speeds. I have regularly cleaned and lubricated this rifle since I bought it last November for $250. More pictures available upon request.I have fired nearly two hundred rounds through this rifle at targets, mostly bargain-bin Serbian ammo. The Serbian ammo shot cleanly but occasionally got stuck in the chamber; a good shove back on the bolt sent the spent cartridge flying. I have never had an issue with Remington Corelokt. The sights need some adjustment, as the rifle shoots consistently high and to the right. The rifling appears to be in good condition. A side mount can be installed if a scope is desired. Once the rifle is zeroed, it will make a fine economy deer gun. Additionally, spitzer bullets can be safely loaded in this gun's box magazine, giving your .30-30 quite a bit more range. You could buy slightly more expensive ""Assembled in USA"" bolt action rifles with a generic plastic stock at Walmart, but why not own an all-American piece of history? $260 will get you the Stevens 325-B rifle with one original magazine, as well as three boxes of ammo. 20 rounds of Remington Core-lokt 150 grain (Made in USA), and 40 rounds of Herter's (Sellier & Belliot) Select 150 grain (Made in Czech Republic), all in original packaging. I am currently based in Grand Teton National Park but will drive down to Jackson for a sale. Thanks for reading."
