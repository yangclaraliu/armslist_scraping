Beavertail grip safety and undercut trigger guard for high grip. National Match barrel. Slim rosewood grips and commander style hammer. 2 mags and box included of course.

Its the Guide Stainless, short barrel, straight comb version. 6 shot tube I believe. Before you rag on the fact its a remington, which I bought knowing full and well it was, let me offer you this. Im familiar with all the issues that are plaguing these series, and there are good rifles out there that dont have any issues. Not every one was a POS. I searched for a good while for this one.   The good.... -Front sight is not crooked. Barrel was aligned straight. -Inside chamber is a little rough from machine marks but in not way affects funtion like a lot I have seen. It has already smooth out from the few rounds through it and will only get better with use. -The wood is not as nice as real marlin wood but is a pretty good fit to reciever. -Rifling is great, not marred or shallow -Reciever exterior was polished real good, no machine marks or marring. (Only marks are from me and from loading ammo) -Action IS a little gritty, but it was acceptable even before it was smoothed out some.  Now, for the extras. I have installed the XS rear peep and full rail and XS front white sight.  Action is smooth now and pulls smoothly and lock up is good. I have taken extremely good care of this rifle, as with all my guns. I had an Armor from Trailboss Guns & Gear in Sierra Vista, AZ touch up this lever. Gary Ross, owner at time I lived there, worked on this rifle for me, just to smooth it up a bit. Nothing ""custom"" has been done or altered. Round count is right at 66 rounds, TOTAL!. Its not much but I have a few Hornady Leverevolution rounds you can have.   So, this isnt a real nice OLDER Marlin, but its one of the better ones that RemIngton has put out. They are out there, just takes some patience and a little effort searching. This one is already to go though."
