Best Reasonable Offers ConsideredThe military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648-308 ACOG® reticle features a red chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 7.62mm M80 out to 1200 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming.

The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night.
The Sig P227 Equinox has an integral accessory rail and fits the same holsters designed for the P220R and P226R. The pistol holds 10+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip.

REDACTED.""The Glock 35 is what Glock refers to as its “Practical Tactical” model. It is at home as a tactical pistol as much as an IPSC Limited gun (non-Production class). The longer barrel puts more weight forward and will translate into less muzzle flip for rapid follow up shots, and the longer sight radius gives a better sight picture for accuracy. For those who like their full-size 1911, this is your Glock, because it handles like a 1911 with that long slide."""

It has the hard to find amber Birch stock that was only used a few years in manufacturing. It was always stored in a leather rifle case so NO RUST or Pitting just normal wear from hunting. The barrel bore is perfect and the magazine tube is spotless and operates freely. The rifle is ready to shoot and enjoy the quality of a real winchester from the past.

The SA rifle serial number dates to 1955 as well. That, along with like condition and Patina, suggests the barrel is original to the gun. The serial number will be given upon phone conversation only. There are no visible import marks. The stainless gas seal is the only area exhibiting any significant wear. Rust is non-existent, nor are there any signs of major battle scars. Normal wear is minimal for the time frame. There is evidence of a faint ordnance cartouche stamp on the stock just below the left side of receiver.  The barrel is shiny and remains accurate. The rifle functions wonderfully and is accompanied by 5 en bloc clips.  The rifle wears an OD nylon sling, befitting of the time period in both use and appearance. The weapon has the normal matching of the major US manufacturers parts of that time:Receiver- SABarrel- SA 4-1955Trigger Group- International Harvester Op Rod- SA Bolt- Harrington and RichardsonSights (SA). The sights are in excellent mechanical condition and show minimal wear. They remain audible, tactile and precise on the firing line.This Garand is an excellent example of American Ingenuity.

Bipod set is later pattern Belgian and is FN proofed; this is not a cheap Argentine set. Blue Monster wood set. Very good buttplate. Finish is semi gloss baking enamel over fresh manganese phosphate parkerizing. This build is only a couple months old and has less than 100 rounds on it.   The only note is that there are some marks on the front of the stock from travel rub. The rifle was transported in a soft gun sock and the corresponding holes in the gun sock make it appear that the rifle rubbed something during transit. Perhaps oil would make the marks go away, I have not tried. It is the only flaw in an otherwise perfect rifle. FTF In Columbus area or Zanesville.  Possibly Cleveland area as well, ask.  Shipping to an individual OK in Ohio, out of state OK as long as I ship to an FFL.  Shipping is flat fee of $50.  Payment by cash or CC; CC +3%.  Lots more pictures, but I can only post one here...  just ask and I'll email you more.  Thanks"
