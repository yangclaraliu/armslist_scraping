This is one of several revolvers I bought brand new a few years ago around 2013 / 2014 primarily for my wife, who at the time was already comfortable with revolvers, but not yet very comfortable or proficient with my semi-auto Glocks (she tended to limp wrist and jam them.)  So in order to have some  guns around the home I knew that SHE could operate under duress if need be, I bought several versions of these simple but very sturdy Ruger revolvers for her to place around the home. With the exception of me test firing them once for functionality upon acquiring them (maybe 5 or 10 rounds each, that's it), they have all sat in drawers, or been hiding on shelves, or placed under beds, etc etc.  The point is that they are essentially brand new, with no wear, they were never holstered or even carried outside the home, they were test fired only once with less than 10 rounds,  and otherwise never used.  My wife has since become very proficient with my Glock semi-autos over the last few years (I'm a good teacher :) and is finally very comfortable with them as a go-to gun / crisis- in- the- house gun, so we don't see the need keeping all these revolvers around anymore.  So we have several revolvers like this to cut loose.  We've sold a few already, and have just a few more to unload.  These MSRP at over $800, they  retail in the brick and mortar stores in the high 600's to low 700's, and sell online anywhere from  600 to 625, plus shipping, CC fees, and FFL transfer agent fees.  We would let this go for $575 and eat the loss.  Even compared to an online Seller like on GB where prices tend to be cheapest, a local person who can buy from us locally here, will save about 80-100 on the gun alone, plus save another 50 in FFL transfer fees, save 20-30 in shipping,  save 30-40 in taxes, and save on 3% credit card fees which are typically imposed by online sellers, for a total of close to 200 savings on an essentially brand new gun.  I have the original gray, hard plastic Ruger box and original paperwork"

$1,000 obo. cash.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades considered would be, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns in this order.  A few things I can think of now on trades:  
Stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers, will consider all brands, depending on your value, lower parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles as well, depending on the value placed on it as I like to build lowers/rifles with quality parts and can do it much cheaper than buying them complete.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 models with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace/stabilizer"", ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I might consider other similar firearms. 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle or similar 1-6x.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $45 more, since it will have to be overnighted to your FFL.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This is one of several revolvers I bought brand new a few years ago around 2013 / 2014 primarily for my wife, who at the time was already comfortable with revolvers, but not yet very comfortable or proficient with my semi-auto Glocks (she tended to limp wrist and jam them.)  So in order to have some  guns around the home I knew that SHE could operate under duress if need be, I bought several versions of these simple but very sturdy Ruger revolvers for her to place around the home. With the exception of me test firing them once for functionality upon acquiring them (maybe 5 or 10 rounds each, that's it), they have all sat in drawers, or been hiding on shelves, or placed under beds, etc etc.  The point is that they are essentially brand new, with no wear, they were never holstered or even carried outside the home, they were test fired only once with less than 10 rounds,  and otherwise never used.  My wife has since become very proficient with my Glock semi-autos over the last few years (I'm a good teacher :) and is finally very comfortable with them as a go-to gun / crisis- in- the- house gun, so we don't see the need keeping all these revolvers around anymore.  So we have several revolvers like this to cut loose.  We've sold a few already, and have just a few more to unload.  These MSRP at over $700, they  retail in the brick and mortar stores in the low to mid 600's, and sell online anywhere from 550 to 585, plus shipping, CC fees, and FFL transfer agent fees.  We would let this go for $475 and eat the loss.  Even compared to an online Seller like on GB where prices tend to be cheapest, a local person who can buy from us locally here, will save about 100 on the gun alone, plus save another 50 in FFL transfer fees, save 20-30 in shipping,  save 30-40 in taxes, and save on 3% credit card fees which are typically imposed by online sellers, for a total of close to 200 savings on an essentially brand new gun.  I have the original gray, hard plastic case and original paperwork that came with the gun."

$600 firm in cash.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades considered would be, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns in this order.  A few things I can think of now on trades:  
Stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers, will consider all brands, depending on your value, lower parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles as well, depending on the value placed on it as I like to build lowers/rifles with quality parts and can do it much cheaper than buying them complete.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 models with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace/stabilizer"", ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I might consider other similar firearms. 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle or similar 1-6x.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $45 more, since it will have to be overnighted to your FFL.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

This gun has 500 rounds through it so far with absolutely no hiccups (consider that a break in). Very accurate. I bought the gun as a shooter but havent touched it much lately. Has very minimal wear (just a few tiny scratches here and there) but the parkerization is still in excellent shape. Gun has not been abused. Cleaned after every shoot. This would make a great first 1911 or a beater gun while you baby the safe queens.

Original cardboard box
Floral design leather OWB holster
6 eight round ACT mags (very reliable mags in my experience)

$380 cash only. Price is firm. No shipping. Lower offers will be ignored, as I don't need to sell this gun. Will not part out.

$600 in cash.
Prefer cash, but might consider trades, depending.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades considered would be, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns in this order.  A few things I can think of now on trades:  
Stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers, will consider all brands, depending on your value, lower parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  FosTech Echo trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles as well, depending on the value placed on it as I like to build lowers/rifles with quality parts and can do it much cheaper than buying them complete.
Quality stamped AK-47 with side rail for optic mount, preferably with a nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock would be a plus.  I really like the RAS47 models with the nicer trigger groups and Zhukov furniture, but I've read about too many problems with their cast trunnions an bad/faulty rivets.
A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Maybe a quality 9mm or 45ACP pistol with ""arm brace/stabilizer"", ideally a good deal on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding arm brace, so I can change out the trigger easily, I like nice triggers, otherwise, I might consider other similar firearms. 
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56, Federal preferred.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifier, maybe two Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle and 1-2 with 7.62x39 reticle or similar 1-6x.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship for $45 more, since it will have to be overnighted to your FFL.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Well you polish the barrel so you can rack the first chamber with ease. You replace the pins with solid steel to make it more durable. You stipple the gun so you will not lose your grip when the handgun is wet. You upgrade the trigger spring and other internal springs to make the trigger and action oh so sweet. You modify the trigger guard to allow both hands to hold the gun with comfort. This allows you to control the recoil. You install magpull to the mags so you can change the mags quicker than ever. I pity the person who dares break in the house with this beauty. Their is a reason military units are going to the glock gun. All item included as described above and with factory items just encase you want to go back to factory. It also comes with a mag full of hollow points. It has a metal tool that was bought to replace the pins.

She has put no more than 200 rounds through it and never been outside the sillouette once. The only reason she is considering trading/selling her baby is she needs a CCW for her purse or IWB. Looking for Glock 19, Glock 43, Glock 26, or any Glock or other CCW of like value and quality. It has been cared for like her baby, never holstered and deadly accurate. Being she is moving to a smaller frame I would prefer a smaller caliber. Preferably a 9mm but open to a Glock 42 with the right kicker.

I literally pulled it out of my pocket with all its built up pocket lint  and dust and fingerprints, and just snapped a quick pic, thinking this was probably just a $200 used gun.  But amazingly,  these things routinely sell for over $ 1,000 I've since learned.  Funny thing is I've always had a love hate relationship with this thing.  What I loved was that it was SUPERLIGHT thanks to the titanium cylinder, and carried 6 shots instead of 5, and was a nice smooth low recoil shooter.  What annoyed me was that sometimes spent cases tend to stick, and you have to poke them out with a pen or something.  SO anyway, Ive had this for all this time, it probably looks a bit rougher than it is bc I didn't bother to pretty it up at all before photographing it.  But it's actually seen very little actual use and has been shot not that much, it's just been carried a lot. Doubt if I have more than 250-300 rounds thru this thing, if that.  As for asking price, I'm going to wait until I hear from Smith and Wesson first on my purchase date, but I will entertain offers until then.  In the meantime, I'll wipe it down and take a cleaner pic."
