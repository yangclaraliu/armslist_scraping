The rifle is a single shot break over action. I think the finish is brushed nickel. The lock up is very tight  and the break open is very smooth. The bore is perfect as far as I can tell. The rifle also comes with a bushnell 3-9x scope that is in excellent condition. Also comes with a nice comfortable sling.The rifle does have some light speckles of surface rust on the outside of the barrel but nothing major and definitely nothing that will possibly affect function.Overall it is a surprisingly nice little rifle that would make a perfect first deer or coyote rifle. The trigger is single action and safely light and crisp. Great gun to teach marksmanship fundamentals. Would make a great rifle to graduate from rimfire to centerfire.I am asking 225 for this rifle which I believe to be fair but I would consider reasonable offers. Worst I will say is no.My number is REDACTED. You can call or text that number. If I don't answer during the week just leave a message and I'll get back to you after work.Thanks for reading and have a nice day."

The brass ramrod for the muzzleloader barrel has what appears to be surface rust from something but the barrel is rust free. Im not sure why but thats how it is. The rifle is in great to possibly excellent pre-owned condition. The lock up is extremely solid and the finish on all the metal is rust free. This rifle has only been shot a few times. The bore is in perfect condition. The wood on this rifle is a really pretty tiger stripe on the button stock portion and makes this rifle look very classy. The front isn't really Striped but it is the same color and matches nicely nonetheless. Overall the whole set up is in excellent pre-owned condition as far as I can tell. It really feels like a solid set up and with the extra barrels it adds a whole lot of versatility. I'm asking 275 but will consider reasonable offers. Worst I can say is no. Please no ridiculous low offers. I will work with you but I'm not giving it away.

The rifle was refurbished(I believe in Latvia), and the stock was installed during the refurbishment process(The Russians didnt start making the M38 laminated stocks until 1943 and were done so as prototypes for the M44 laminated stocks and not all that many were made). On a rarity scale, the M38's in correct laminated stocks are about a 7 or 8 out of 10(10 being very rare) so these are kind of hard to find. Numbers do match on the rifle with no force-matching. Bore is in great shape with strong lands and groves and is NOT counter-bored. The rifle shoots very well, with groups ranging at around 1.5-2in groups at 100 meters with surplus ammo and will consistently shoot 6-8 inch groups at 400 meters. Price for the rifle is 450 OBO. I am willing to meet FTF or ship to your preferred FFL, but buyer pays for the shipping(Usually around 25-30 dollars for a rifle of this weight).

Safety: Decocking Lever Safety Stop on Hammer Firing Pin Block Safety Loaded Chamber Indicator. The PCR name stands for �Police Czech Republic� the group for whom the model was originally designed. Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.SPECIFICATIONSFinish BlackType Semi-AutomaticAction Single/DoubleCaliber 9mmBarrel Length 3.8""Capacity 14 + 1Safety Safety/DecockerGrips BlackSights FixedWeight 1.71 lbs$500.00"

Imported by FIME Group and made compliant by Arsenal. Same gun as the SGL21 only with BHO latch added. There were fewer SGL26s imported than any other SGL series. Still have the yellow sleeve rifle was shipped in along with #s matching box both manuals sling butt stock cleaning kit and 10 round magazine. There will never be anymore of the SGLs imported. The circle 10 magazines do not come with the gun but can be added or purchased for right trade deal. Thanks for looking.

To my knowledge, this carbine is unfired. I cn sell just the 901 w/o the 5.56 upper making it a cheaper package. I will ship to a FFL after funds are cleared. Paypal is preferred but the buyer must pay the fees. Shipping will be charged to the purchaser, package is heavy so expect to pay over $100."
