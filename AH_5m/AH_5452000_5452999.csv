The Viking, gladius (hoplite) and Arab (could not find a proper name) swords are all sharp.  Viking, spear and gladius have sheaths / scabbards.  Asking 350 for the pile, that's $50 an item which is a steal! The sword shop suggested I price them at $100 each & that's about right, however I figured I'd give a hell of a deal to someone wanting to get into swords. These would be good beginer / mid level blades. As long as you don't do any of those coldsteel mall ninja sword tests these will do fine for cutting water bottles or tatami mats, wet newspaper ect. If you pay the asking price I will toss in a stand for practice cutting as well. These look equally good on the wall, which is what I've mostly done with them."

Though I don't think this has ever been fired, if it has the round count would certainly be below 100 rounds.  This is an awesome handgun and has been the crown of my 1911 collection.  It has a flush cut reverse crowned barrel which not only enhances accuracy but also gives the gun a very sharp look. The pictures also show the gun with both black G10 starburst grips and dark cocobolo starburst grips. Wilson's Supergrade class pistols are the finest the company makes and will please even the most discerning buyer. This pistol comes not only with a carry case, all original paperwork, and all the standard upgrades that come with the supergrade pistols but also includes a host of extra items that I've accumulated for this handgun. The quality and craftsmanship of this gun cannot be overstated.  Wilson has put out an unrivaled product with the Supergrade line of 1911s and this one in particular has recieved excellent care. This gun comes with a brand new WC extractor with serations on the back to match the back of the slide.  Also included are a WC bullet proof sear spring, 3 magazines, and a new WC Ejector.  The second pair of black G10 grips is also included.  Upgrades include the oversized magazine release, a flared magwell, and a flush cut and reverse crowned barrel. The gun also has a flush cut reverse crowned barrel for accuracy, fewer snags, and asthetics.  It also has a narrow full size guide rod and a flat wire recoil spring. This gun was completely hand fit and constructed by Wilson Combat in 1994.  My father was the origional owner and did not shoot any of his collectable firearms, and since he gave me this piece 8 years ago, I have kept the gun well cleaned and maintained but still have not fired the weapon.  Just to be on the safe side, I noted above  that the round count is 100 rounds or less.  Please let me know if you'd like more pictures or if you have any questions.  I'm happy to meet to let anyone interested take a look at the gun in person as well as the pictures really do not do it justice."

One hand removal in just seconds. No wobble, no seizing, no affected performance; just easy on, easy off, with minimal point of impact shift and no loss of precision. Hunting? Fighting? Competing? The Stellite® baffles are welded into a solid core for added strength and durability. An innovative 7.62 design first, the front cap is detachable and features an integrated flash hider. This affords better performance, particularly in low light conditions. The detachable front cap also provides some level of insurance should the Sandman-S™ get dropped or abused. This equals trouble free replacement in the field. Proudly made in the U.S.A. DEAD AIR ARMAMENT™ IS NEW, AND BETTER. It was founded by Mike Pappas, and if that name rings a bell, it’s because Mike co-founded another silencer company back in 2008. Among others, Mike is also teamed up with silencer designer Todd Magee. Mike and Todd have set out to build the best suppressors on the market. There is no substitute for experience. IT’S IN THE DESIGN. Look at any Dead Air Armament™ product and you’ll see attention to detail and aesthetic choices driven solely by engineering performance. No gimmicks or short cuts – just pure performance. As Mike puts it: “I’m finally building the no compromise suppressors that I’ve always wanted to make. No corporate bottom lines. The only thing that matters to me is how it sounds; And the Sandman™ sounds awesome…” IT’S IN THE MATERIALS. There is no substitute for materials and no shortcuts with Dead Air. Every Sandman™ baffle is 100% Stellite®. They cost three times more than stainless steel and they work better than Inconel® under the hardest use and conditions. As for the tubes, we could have used the material that most of our competitors use, but instead we went with high-performance precipitation hardened stainless steel because lightweight strength does not come cheap. Only with the Sandman Ti do we forgo the use of high-performance stainless steel and that’s because we use Grade #9 titanium. Why do we do it? Because our precision rifle direct thread suppressor is designed for professional law enforcement applications. The old adage “close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades” could not be truer when a professional has to make an accurate shot in difficult conditions. IT’S IN THE MANUFACTURING. Design and materials are part of the equation, but there is no substitute for thirty years of manufacturing excellence and that’s what BPI® brings to the product. Every Dead Air suppressor is manufactured in Lawrenceville, Georgia by highly trained Americans intent on manufacturing the best suppressor on the market. Our standards are simple, “good isn’t good enough” and if a product comes off the line not up to par, then the can gets canned. It’s that simple. Specifications:  Rating: Multi - Up to .300 Win Mag Length: 6.8” Weight: 18.5 oz. Diameter: 1.5” Finish: Cerakote body, Nitrided Muzzle Device Made in the U.S.A.    Please note that the sale of suppressors is restricted:  Suppressors must be picked up locally or shipped to a Licensed NFA/Class 3 Federal Firearms Dealer in your state of residence.

$400 firm in cash.I might consider trades, but not in need of anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.
A few things I would not mind having back-ups for or extras would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship insured for to your FFL for $40(handguns must be Overnight UPS) more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

A few things I would not mind having back-ups for right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area only.  I will ship, but it will run $20-$30 per container or probably around $40 for both.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

It is brand new, never fired. It comes with a shoulder holster, as well as 2 extra magazines and the original case and documents that came with it, as well as a box of 50 rounds.
I have owned 2 of these guns before, as a cheaper alternative to a Walther PPK, and I can definitely say that they are a blast and increadibly reliable. I never had an FTE or FTF with one. They make a great backup!
