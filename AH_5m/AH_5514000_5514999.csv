Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (model 8500 only), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. (Model 8500 only.)   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.     Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability."

The mag caddy is a double stack. I've only had this holster for a few months so it's like new still. It's black on black with all the hardware. I absolutely love this holster system, I'm getting a surefire tac light so and I originally had this holster set up without the space for it.The INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt."

I had this valued ($2000.00-$2200.00) and info received from the New Collector's Board. They say this pistol was imported into the U.S. in 1923 and the way Germany got around the Versaile Treaty was by switching the way they used the serial numbers. Please see photo's and make your own judgment. This pistol is in very good condition. It currently has an after market 9mm barrel installed for pleasure shooting with 2 metal 9mm clips. It also comes with the original (matching serial numbered) 32 caliber barrel along with a period 32 caliber clip with wooden grip on end.

Molded rubber Sure-Grip rail covers snap over the rail sections on the handguard to add ergonomic comfort and rail protection. The rear sight is a detachable dual- aperture B.M.A.S. flip-up unit with windage calibrated to 1/2-MOA. Front sight is a B.M.A.S. clamp-on that fits directly over the milled front gas block and folds down with the touch of a button to allow scope use. Ergonomic ambidextrous design pistol grip. Chrome-lined 16"" chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel is fluted for lighter weight and enhanced cooling, and includes an A2 ""birdcage"" flash suppressor."

VERY nice rifle. Full stock, peep sight. I've had it a month or so. I keep buying .22 rifles but keep forgetting I don't really like .22! Maybe I'll try a 10-22 next...who knows.Anyway, gun shoots perfectly. Extremely smooth, no issues with it. It's tube fed, holds 15 rounds. Rear peep site swivels out of the way to look down a scope, front sight has a cool 5-sight system where you can flip up multiple different front sight posts. The front posts are a bit worn out but at least 2 of them still lock into place. The stock has a small chunk missing off, looks like the previous owner glued it back on but it just fell off when I was firing it. Does NOT affect function, just cosmetic. All parts for this thing can be purchased very cheap from places like Numerich and Havlin sales. This also comes with a soft case, and a 100 round box of Remington Golden Bullets. Not the best .22 ammo by far, but that's all Cabela'ss had! Runs fine out of a bolt action.I'm asking [COLOR=""#008000""]$150[/COLOR] [COLOR=""#B22222""]FIRM[/COLOR] for this. From what I've seen them online go for lately, they sell usually over $325 in beat up condition plus shipping, FFL fees puts you at about $400, and that's without a case or ammo. Only listing low because of the slight stock damage and because I want to sell it fast to buy something else. Not interested in trades at this time.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED"

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5514729,"For Sale:  RCBS primer catcher - 3D printed, new & improved version!","North, but available for shipping..., Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 20,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 25, 2016",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One of the most annoying things with my Rock Chucker IV is the primer catch. Cumbersome to put on, not enough capacity and plenty primers don't even make it into the collector. I fixed this by improving an existing design for a new primer catcher design. Much, much better than what RCBS provides... There is one person on ebay selling those in a different (inferior) design - my version has a few significant improvements. The improvement are making it more stable on the press (smaller gaps between catcher and press) and a clamp on version versus the one that tries to lock the catcher down with a spent .22 case. The one I sell also comes with the tube. But, to set expectations - this is not coming out of a mold, it will have minor cosmetic imperfections (3D printing in the consumer market simply are limited in regards to resolution). It will be working perfectly fine and will fit your Rock Chucker IV as advertised. Have a look at the pictures and let me know if you have questions.  Price is $20 and includes shipping in the lower 48. Payment via money order, certified personal check, cash, 1oz silver and local pickup/cash only.  Also, if you got anything gun related you would like to trade, I am open for that as well. Also can add cash on my side (e.g. nice derringer or revolver or reloading powder, primers and so on...)"

I had this valued ($2000.00-$2200.00) and info received from the New Collector's Board. They say this pistol was imported into the U.S. in 1923 and the way Germany got around the Versaile Treaty was by switching the way they used the serial numbers. Please see photo's and make your own judgment. This pistol is in very good condition. It currently has an after market 9mm barrel installed for pleasure shooting with 2 metal 9mm clips. It also comes with the original (matching serial numbered) 32 caliber barrel along with a period 32 caliber clip with wooden grip on end.

Originally designed as a means for persons with limited mobility to operate and fire the AR-15 pistol, the custom adaptation of the Stabilizing Brace to the UZI PRO SB takes the application of large frame pistol control and stabilization to a new level. With the IWI brace’s unique sidefolding feature, the UZI PRO SB can be fired with or without the brace extended depending on the shooters need. With the brace in the folded position, storage space required in your safe or range bag is minimized. In all other respects, the UZI PRO UPP9SB is identical to the UPP9S, a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states where these magazine capacities are permitted. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard. Available late 2015.
