Its a cased single gun made by Uberti but not marked with any Italian names or even proof marks, it has them marked under the ejector rod housing. It has ""Shootist Edition"" Engraved on top of the 4 3/4's inch barrel, its marked 1 of 1,000 on the left side of the frame, and its engraved Phil Spangenberger on the back strap. Its got beautiful Nickle finish on the metal and the grips are nice looking 1 piece wood, correct for a black powder frame era gun which this is a replica of. It has the correct ""Bullseye"" ejector rod and of course the screw retainer for the cylinder base pin.In the presentation case are 33-45 Colt caliber cartridges, made by Winchester and an antique looking picture of Phil holding one of these guns, its autographed and dated 1987. There is also a poker card that's been shot 3 times and its autographed by Phil as well and dated 6/15/1987. Phil told me there was supposed to be 1000 sets of the single gun made up but the guy in charge had his wife pass away from cancer at the time of this and was so distraught that they quit the project. Phil also talked of sets with 2 guns that were engraved and with genuine pearl grips,he has a set of those, he stated they were beautiful, numbered 2 & 3 I think, sounds like quite a set, these engraved sets were originally slated for 100 sets to be made but they probably only made 20 or so. Mine is a cased single gun from the standard non engraved series and its serial numbered PS0039, so the 39th gun made, the compartment-ed case is what looks like oak wood with green billiard cloth lining. On top of the case is one of Phils favorite saying engraved on a brass plaque that states ""Always be sure to aim, and always aim to be sure"" gotta like all of this, a quality package to be sure. This gun is in excellent to new condition and the case is excellent plus. The picture and card are excellent and there is also a gold seal with the name of ""Texas Gunfighters"" and the date of 1987. Phil was very kind and sent me a copy of the article in Guns & Ammo magazine from 1988 and I have added a copy of that with this set. Phil's partner in the ""Texas Gunslingers was also very kind and sent me a nice letter that I will include a copy of too. If interested I will send a letter from me stating all of this. I think this will all be a collectors item someday, as far as i'm concerned it's a collectors item right now and I'm OK to keep it,but I will sell it as I'm in the business of selling guns more than in the collectors business, some times you have to make that choice,"

Sniper central has a cool review of it you can find if you fire up your googler.

484,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5647484,"For Trade:  Spyderco Collectables... VERY rare LBK, Bug set, and Delica 1 thin clip for AR upper parts.","Kelso/ Longview, Southwest Washington, Washington",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, July 11, 2016",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I started an AR build with the intention of buying a piece here and there as $$ allowed but since I got the lower done my OCD is trumping my patients.... (I really wish that was a joke! )  Unfortunately I'm financially challenged, and it will take a few months to get the rest of the parts I need, so Ive been digging around looking for trade stock.  I really hate to do it, but I must put up some of my beloved Spyderco's for trade.  I just oust got a set of Spyderco Bug knives like the one pictured, all signed/engraved by Nutnfancy(YouTube gun/knife review celebrity) that I would be willing to sell or trade for the right stuff... If you are a Spydie fan like me you have a chance to own quite possibly one(or two) of only 3 Ladybug1's in extremely rare millitary ""LBK"" blister packs left in known existence.  I have searched and researched extensively since I found a year or so ago, and have yet to see another.  I was told by Sal Glesser(Spyderco owner/founder) via the Spyderco forum:""Welcome to our forum. Many years ago when we began selling our knives to the Military, our salesmanager at the time felt that soldiers would not be interested in a knife called a ""Ladybug"". So we called in a ""Little Big Knife"" (LBK) with special packaging.sal... "".   I've conversed with many of the long time Spyderco expert/collectors and none had ever seen one before.  I have 3 of them that were NOS at a local gun/pawn shop.  They spent over 20 years being shuffled from hooks to display cases but nobody in my town was willing to pay the high even at today's standards 1990 msrp for a tiny little knife they never heard of in an ugly plastic blister pack.  I'm told it was a very lucky find as they are worth 10x what I paid. Only minus is the plastic is old faded and cracking due to age etc. I'm keeping at least one for my collection, but you can have your choice of the other two or both... depending on what you have to trade.  I'm not sure of the value but I have a general idea and am open to reasonable offers.  I also have a C133 set.. you can still get the knives seperatly for around $60 or so, but the set was discontinued last year so it's worth more than the individual knives now(obviously) and an instant collectible. Lastly is a Delica 1 thin clip in G2 steel.  I believe it's the first version made in 1990. later Gen 1s had a thicker clip, and were made of AUS8.  It is used, with no box, but is in excellent condition and is razor sharp.  I hand tied a Sebenza style paracord  lanyard on it because I carry it occasionally and don't use the clip for fear of bending or breaking it.besides the knives I have .22 lr ammo in a plethora of varieties, and a Simmons 8-32 X 44 scope.What do you got? what do you want for it?"

552,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5647552,For Sale:   NFA Trust (Complete package including free assistance with ATF Forms),"Columbus, Ohio, United States",$ 199,"Listed On: Friday, June 1, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"100% Success rate. Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.  Attorney Christopher Gasper: 614-845-1923 or chris@gasperlegal.com  http://www.gasperlegal.com/nfa-trust/  What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.  As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!  This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.  I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.  Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.   What the Trust includes:  - The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages) - Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms) - Appointment of Trustee (1 Page) - Trustee resignation (1 Page)  I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.  Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***  Attorney Christopher Gasper www.gasperlegal.com chris@gasperlegal.com 614-845-1923  7652 Sawmill Road Suite #166 Dublin, Ohio 43016"

Item was opened and checked for fitment with an Armasight Spark Core NV Monocle. Have all packaging and contents included from manufacturer.The Armasight AIM PRO Advance Integrated Mount ANKI000032 lets you mount a standard 1x night vision monocular to your firearm, converting the NV device into a night vision rifle scope. Made to work with 1x magnification power Armasight NV scopes, this night vision mount presents a revolutionary new concept of night vision targeting. The Armasight Aim Pro Advanced Integrated Night Vision Mount allows the operator to convert his night vision monocular into a weapon sight. The Arma-Sight AIM Pro is incorporated into a low-profile housing that has an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail grabber mount on the underside and a dovetail mount on the top. By mounting AIM Pro onto your rifle and fitting it with either a night vision monocular or AIM Pro optional day optic, this mount can be bore-sighted to your rifle: the operator can switch between day and night modes as required without having to readjust. Unlike conventional systems that require the night vision unit to be mounted behind a day optic, the Armasight AIM Pro Integrated Advanced NV Riflescope Mount projects the reticle directly into the Night Vision monocular lens. In practice, what this means is that there is no longer a reduced field of view through the night vision device, or any shadowed area that is difficult to see through (caused by conventional red dot sights optics or outer edges). A small ""HUD""-type prism on the front of the Armasight Night Vision Riflescope AIM Pro Mount projects a 65MOA ""Circle"" and single 3.2MOA center aiming ""Dot"" directly into the night vision lens. The AIM Pro is MIL-STD-810G-compliant device. The adaptability of the Armasight AIM Pro NV Rifle Scope Mount to virtually any night vision monocular inherently makes it a ""critical need"" item for all law enforcement and military professionals, hunters, and professional shooters.Specifications: Specifications for Armasight Aim Pro Night Vision Scope Mount: Circle with Dot reticle size: 65A±2Adjustment Precision Range (deg. of arc): A±1.5Reticle Illumination Adjustments: DigitalLevels of Reticle Brightness: 11Battery Type: CR123A (3.0 V) Lithium; or Alkaline AA (1.5V)Battery Life (hours): up to 2000 (CR123A)Weapon Mount Type: Picatinny railStorage temperature (°С): - 50 to +50Operating temperature (°С): - 40 to +50MIL-STD-810G Compliant: yesImmersion: till 1 m for 30 minutesOverall Dimensions (mm): 169 x 87 x 42Weight (g): 180Features of Armasight AIM PRO NV Riflescope Mounting Kit - Picatinny:⦁ Converts standard Night Vision monoculars into passive Night Vision weapon sight ⦁ Rapid and easy target acquisition ⦁ AIM eliminates the need for infrared laser or co-witnessed red dot sight ⦁ No obstructing optics or parts in your field of view ⦁ The only solution providing 100% full field of view ⦁ Digital reticle brightness adjustment ⦁ Optional Red Dot and 3.5X Day-time Aiming Solutions ⦁ Fits any MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny or Weaver rails with adjustable, locking, quick-detach mountPackage Contents:⦁ Armasight Advance Integrated Mount Pro ANKI000032"
