You're a piece of shit for doing so. That ammo is no more than 5 cents a round. At least be honest.""Well, here's honesty--- I travel a lot, and picked up this ammo a box or two at a time ever since Obama was elected the second time, usually at twice or three times the normal cost. My kids grew up, they no longer care to shoot, and I just went back to work after a long stint of being unemployed (oilfield... enough said). THAT SAID, I'm also a Christian and don't care for my character, or that of the God I serve, to be thought of in this way over something as meaningless as a box of 22 shells. All I have is what's been provided for by Him in the first place.So, I'd rather just get rid of them and be done with it. If you want to give me some money for them, so be it. Otherwise they're FREE to the first person that emails me. HOWEVER, I won't travel, so you'll have to meet me, in Norman, Oklahoma. That's where I bought a lot of 'em.To RTLLMM@ gmail.. Prayin' for ya bro. To all the rest, don't judge people too harshly... we're not all crooks""My kids are grown up, I'm old, and I don't have time to gear up and go to the range like I used to. I'm selling half my stock of .22 ammo, 10,000 rounds of various brands of .22 ammo I picked up over the last year or two.-Ten Thousand rounds for $850. That's 8 1/2 cents a round, or 4.25 (no tax) for a box of 50. That's a fair price nowadays for new boxes of ammo, especially for a bulk of 10,000 rounds at one time. -There's around 4000+ rounds (525 packs) of Remington Golden, a couple of thousand rounds Winchester M-22, a thousand rounds CCI, and a few of others. - I'm selling them ALL IN ONE LOT, and will not trade.- IF there's any shipping: I require money up front, and buyer pays shipping costs- IF local, must pickup in Moore/Norman Oklahoma area"

It was purchased by myself. The rifle has only seen 40 rounds since I bought it. It is in very good condition, all parts including the bolt and wood (stock is laminated) are very very nice. The bore is a little dark, however, rifling is very sharp. When I purchased this rifle it had a semi dark bore, this is common for mosins. I did not want to sell but it just sits in the corner. I havent had the time to shoot as much as I would like. Anyway, I decided to downgrade some and this one is up for grabs. Prices have jumped on these and they are becoming much harder to find. Asking 170 dollars, which I think is fair since ones for sale now are higher and may possibly be in rough shape. Comes with sling already attached, pouches, and other accessories. Its really in great shape and it shot very well when I took it out to the range. It was cleaned and lubricated after shooting. Any questions feel free to Email me. (sorry for the bad pictures, had to use my computer camera as I dont own a smart phone or a nice camera, will send more detailed pictures to whoever is interested) Thanks!"

It has both the large loop and the small loop lever for it. I have polished all internals and the action is very smooth. It has a reduced power ejector spring so cases fall at your feet, not in the next county. Bolt safety removed and plug installed. Plastic mag follower has been replaced with a metal one. The Mag tube has been cross pinned at the barrel band, this was done to ensure there would be no mag tube creep when shooting very stout loads. This of course, as with all the mods can be undone if one wanted to including an extra brand new full length mag tube spring. Lyman 17A globe front sight with all aperatures, Marbles Improved tang sight with standard sight post for the rear. This is the rear sight with replaceable sight posts of varrying heights based on the type of shooting you want to do.
This particular .44 shoots jacketed of course, but shoots cast very well to boot. It cycles rounds as large as 1.710 OAL with no issues at all, so toss some 300+ grain flat nosed under a good dose of AA#9 and flatten that white tail like a pancake.Honestly, the only reason I am selling this is to fund a .444 marlin, and that would be the only trade I would consider. $700 firm, buyer covers FFL fees.

I prefer a face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you, no middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship.  I will also drive within a 100 mile radius of Jacksonville to meet you.
 
This is an AMT AUTOMAG III 30-Carbine, FACTORY NEW in BOX, NEVER FIRED!  Tell Dirty Harry to move over, you have this incredible Automag III!  To see a video of this hand-cannon in action, go to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1wqNZrwIJE
 
The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful (the .30-carbine goes through body armor, cracks engine blocks, etc), never rusts, and the gun with its 6.5 inch barrel is super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
 
My selling price of $1,550 is firm.  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than a used Automag!  
 
Hurry, this is an incredible bargain!  No Trades, and remember, my $1,550 selling price is firm (it is already over $1,000 below its market value)."

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories."

Ok so here is the deal, I accidently bid and won both of these on gunbroker, the price was low I was sure I would be outbid on one of them but somehow it slipped through and I won them both hahaha this is quite a deal for a FDE bren if you have been looking for it. It is brand new factory sealed and is being sold by a reputable gun store in Utah, you would not be buying it from me but from them. However since I won it on gunbroker and the price is tied to my name I would need to contact them and let them know that I am giving up my auction to whoever responds to this ad first.Do not contact Peakfirearms without speaking to me first you will not be getting it for $1675 any other way.
