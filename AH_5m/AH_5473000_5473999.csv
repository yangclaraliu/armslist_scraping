The EXP-556 utilizes a polymer lower which is mostly standard other than the buffer tube area which is solid and unthreaded compared to a standard lower. Other than the pins and springs the entire lower is comprised of polymer parts. The trigger is marketed as a 5.5lb trigger. In testing, the trigger is very good considering it is polymer. There’s no real takeup or slack and it breaks very crisply. The lower has an integrated winter trigger guard to ease gloved shooting. The pistol is shipped with one 30 round Tapco magazine.BoltAssembly The upper is also polymer and features a proprietary recoil spring system sitting over a somewhat familiar looking bolt assembly. Since it is spring dampened there isn’t a long bolt carrier like a standard AR, it’s carrier has an abbreviated length. The upper is also unique in that it features a reciprocating charging handle on the left side. There is no dust cover or forward assist on the right side of the upper.The front gas block has an integrated front sight post machined into it and the rear sight is a ghost ring fitted into a dovetail in the polymer top rail. Between the upper and gas block is a stabilizing rod which helps keep the upper aligned and supported.The 8.25” barrel features a very effective muzzle brake. The brake pushes the barrel length to 9.25” overall. Its so effective that when shooting, the gun actively pushes down and back against the shooter. This creates a flat shooting pistol with minimal recoil felt to the shooter. The flipside of this effective brake is an engulfing muzzle flash and a deafening concussion. This is definitely not a gun you would ever want to shoot without hearing protection.Features Lightest 5.56/.223 Pistol In The World Made In USA Compact Design With No Buffer Tube Ergonomic Pistol Grip Integrated MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny Rail For Easy Mounting Of Optics And Accessories Extremely Low Recoil – Can Be Held And Shot With One Hand With Virtually No Muzzle Climb Crisp Trigger Pull Of 5.5 Lbs Reversible Safety To Accommodate Left Hand Shooters Why Pay Extra For Parts?

Airgun writer Tom Gaylord tested this gun for the Pyramyd Air blog and got 755 fps when using extremely lightweight alloy (lead-free, 4.0 grains) pellets. If you use lightweight lead pellets (7.0 grains), your velocity will be around 560 to 580 fps.

The pistol was developed in the late 1950s at the Institute for Artillery Research, which later became the Military Institute of Armament Technology.  The P-64 is also known as the CZAK. The P-64 is a double-action blowback-operated pistol. It has a spring extractor mounted within the slide. The rotating slide catch, installed inside the pistol's frame, contains a protrusion which acts as an empty case ejector. The pistol's trigger mechanism includes a disconnector (which ensures semi-automatic-only fire); a double-action trigger (which allows the pistol to be both cocked and fired with one pull of the trigger); and an exposed hammer. The slide features a loaded chamber indicator (which, both visually and by feel, indicates the presence of a round in the chamber) and a manual safety lever that prevents the weapon from being accidentally discharged with the hammer either cocked or released. This feature also allows a round to be chambered with the safety engaged or toggled off. In the ""safe"" position, the firing pin is locked and the trigger bar is disconnected from the hammer notch. If the hammer is cocked and the safety is engaged, the safety will release the hammer. In the 1970s the trigger mechanism was slightly modified and the hammer spur was enlarged. The P-64 is fed from a 6-round single-stack box magazine. After the last round has been fired, the magazine follower lifts the slide catch, which locks the slide open. The slide can then be released by withdrawing the magazine a short distance and pulling the slide back. The pistol is equipped with a fixed front sight, and a dovetailed rear sight with a square notch. The sights are calibrated for firing at 50 m.  The all-steel P-64 is manufactured mainly by machine cutting. It was originally issued with a spare magazine, a leather holster (not included), and a cleaning kit (not included). This pistol has a harsh recoil caused by its relatively small size coupled with the potent 9x18mm Makarov round. Despite its similarity to the Walther PP, the P-64 is an original design, holding a Polish patent, number 54822. The patent applies to the unique disconnecter (an elongated plate sliding vertically inside the pistol's frame) which provides an internal safety, decocks the hammer when the safety is engaged, interrupts the weapon's cycle after every shot fired, and allows the weapon to be reloaded with the safety on.For more information or to buy click>>>Polish P64"

Details:Model - XDM-9, 5.25"" Competition Model;  Operation - Semi-Automatic Pistol;  Caliber - 9 mm;  Barrel - 5.25"" Match grade, with fully-supported chamber;  Finish - Black;  Grips - Integrated polymer; three inter-changeable back-strap pieces to adjust fit.  Extras - This model has the vented slide of the Competition models. Pelican-style hard case, tactical rail, two extra 19-round magazines (total of 3 mags!), mag loader, double mag carrier, holster. Fiber-optic front sight, grip and trigger safeties, loaded chamber and striker indicators, up-graded trigger system for shorter and smoother pull.  ""The XDM 5.25-inch Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XDM which maximizes accuracy, controllability, and sight radius. The fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for very fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass, which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XDM features like a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and ""mega-lock"" frame texture, and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to go.  ""In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XDM polymer pistol, they did just that:  ""Loaded Chamber Indicator: The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.  ""Striker Status Indicator: The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or by touch to verify that the striker is in the cocked position.  ""The 'Ultra Safety Assurance' trigger system guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, allowing it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.  ""The XDM pistol from Springfield Armory re-defines what a polymer pistol can be. The XDM has everything you want and need in a pistol -- superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XDM 5.25"" Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition."" (From Springfield-Armory.com)"

It is a 9-shot, double action revolver with a 2 1/2"" barrel, blue finish and wood grips.  It is in good to fair condition with light spotting all over the bluing and other minor, normal wear on it.  I have maybe put 200 rounds through it myself.  It's hard to tell as it is a really fun plinker at the range, so it's easy to run through some boxes.  Since it's a heavier gun for its size, it seems pretty accurate, but I never tried to shoot any groups with it.  I bought it years ago at a pawn shop who got it through an estate sale.  These are getting very hard to find.  Indiana state private sales laws apply.  Out of state add an additional $50 for shipping and transfer from my FFL to yours."
