The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.
Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp.
Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine."

Selling my Finnish M39 Mosin Nagant in 7.62x54r. It is a 1943 SAKO manufacture on a hex receiver with a wartime production stock (This is not a SKY-Civil Guard rifle). It is a formerly issued rifle but in good condition. Stock has dings all over but no wood chunks missing or anything. Bluing is worn but no rust and the bore is still very good. Cosmoline has been cleaned and I keep this rifle clean. It is in perfect working order and has been checked for headspacing. I acquired it recently and shot about 150 rounds through it. I'm a pretty novice shooter but was able to do 2""-3"" groups at 100 yards consistently at 6o'clock off a bench rest. I believe I am the second owner of this rifle since it was imported (This rifle is not from the recent Classic Firearms imports) Parts have non matching numbers, as common with the vast majority of M39's (They were assembled from mixed parts that were force matched).
I really like the rifle but am willing to part with it since it is not a very practical rifle for me and I can't shoot it as often as I originally intended to. This thing is really meant for outdoor shooting beyond 100 yards :)
 
Also comes with freebies:
Original military sling
40 rounds of Brown Bear ammo and whatever few rounds of Bulgarian surplus ammo I have left.
10 stripper clips (New production Chinese, but they work fine)
5 dummy rounds for training/dry firing.
Rothco slipon recoil pad.
Mosin Nagant ammo pouch.
Headspacing guages (No-Go & Field Guage)
I will also throw in a 52"" shotgun soft case.
 
$340 cash only. I cannot ship. Price is firm. Lower offers will be ignored as I am in no rush to sell this rifle. Only flat out trades I will consider is for a Norinco SKS in good condition & in stock form w/bayonet. No bubbafied/sporterized rifles. Please provide pics if wanting to trade.
 
I can meet weekday evenings around Saint Paul after 6pm. Weekends anytime before noon or by appointment. Serious buyers only. Please communicate.
 
Must show a valid PTP/PTC and ID to purchase. No exceptions. Thanks for looking."

Started with a standard M&P CORE Longslide(5"") and had the slide and barrel sent to magna-port to have it quadraported. The idea behind this, is that you have the effect of a compensator without the added length and weight. After that, I installed an Apex trigger spring and sear spring. This trigger is insane how light it is. I also have a storm lake barrel included, this barrel hasn't had a single round through it. The gun has had 100 rounds through it, cleaned properly and stored properly. The magazines have Taran-Tactical extensions on them. They were 17 round mags and now they are 23+1. The holster is competition ready, it's a comp-tac competition holster, very fast draw! Crazy accurate gun without the recoil, very fun to shoot. Comes with the box and the other grip sizes. Thanks for looking.I'll let the entire pistol go for 1100. With the RMR.Not really looking to trade right now unless you have a very good condition Atlas PSR bipod with the pic mount plus cash."

It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has wood grips with serial numbers that match the square butt frame.This thirty-six year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. It had 25 rounds fired through it by the previous owner, so it was not new in the box but oh so close. That gave me license to take it out this morning to the gun range to put 15 more rounds through it as I was firing my other .38 Special revolver.As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures.

$OLD - 1941 Finnish M39 finn matching.  Antique receiver. Can go straight to you. Definitely has seen some use. Good majority of bluing is gone. And several stock repairs. Rounded spliced stock. Great bore. Ok condition. Id say 7.5/10.
 
$425 - 1941 Fishing M39 finn matching including the bayonette lug thing. Bluing is 85-90%. Great bore. Tiny import mark on barrel.

$OLD - 1942 Tika M91. Finn matching. Tiny import mark on barrel. Bluing is 50-60%. Has seen hard use. Previous owner must have fired this and put it up for several months to year and never cleaned it. So bore is pitted. Howeverit has strong lands and groves so it will be a nice shooter grade m91. Id say a 6/10 and price reflects that.

Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.

First off, this is an amazing pistol! I have never had a more comfortable and secure grip which shows in your tight shot groups. The pistol is in mint condition. The pistol comes with everything that is in the pictures. Pistol, two H&K magazines, different grips for customization, H&K hard case and user manual.  
Description:
The VP9 was developed by Heckler & Koch to meet the need for a safe, robust, ergonomically enhanced, striker fired handgun.
Easily identify whether the firing pin is in the cocked or uncocked mode. Quickly view the amount of ammunition present. With slide releases present on both sides of the frame and a magazine release on the rear, bottom portion of the trigger guard, VP9 controls are completely ambidextrous.
The VP9’s high strength polymer frame includes a unique ergonomic handgun grip design consisting of interchangeable grip panels and backstraps, as well as a dustcover with a standard Picatinny rail interface. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The barrel — made from canon grade steel — ensures long service life.  The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into the VP9’s polymer frame can mount a wide variety of lights, laser aimers, and other accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces."
