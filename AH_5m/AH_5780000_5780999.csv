COYOTE TAN, BURNT BRONZE, OD GREEN, TACTICAL GRAY, FLAT DARK EARTH, PATRIOT BROWN,GRAPHITE BLACK, TITANIUM--Hand-built by master craftsmen, this is our workhouse rifle that has been designed from the ground up to function flawlessly inthe worst conditions.  There is no other gun on the market at this price with these features.Everything about this rifle is far from ""stock"".  The upper and lower receivers are hand sanded for an exact fit.  The bolt carrier groupand all internals are hand polished.  The barrels are hand cut for greater accuracy and precision. This gun (with a qualified shooter) will shoot 30 rounds at 100 yards all within a grouping the size of a quarter.  This gun has almost zero recoil.  The momentyou take this gun out of the case, it will outshoot any out of the box Daniel Defense, LWRC, Noveske and any other top names in the industry.All Hammer Arms Combat Carbines come with a lifetime warranty that follow the gun!This gun is an absolute steal at $1,275 and will be the last and ONLY AR you will ever need. -------Hammer Arms was founded in 2014 by two Special Forces veterans with a combined 40 years of military service and seven combat deployments.  That doesn’t make them the world’s foremost firearms experts, but it has taught them the importance of having an accurate and reliable weapons system: your life might very well depend on it.Although founded Hammer Arms in 2014, Hammer has more than two decades of experience in building and repairing AR-15 variants, with literally hundreds of custom builds to their credit. Along the way, they have learned that attention to the smallest details is what leads to absolute reliability.  Hammer is committed to producing the finest service rifles humanly possible. Hammer's primary goal is to achieve maximum reliability, accuracy, and durability in every weapon they produce.Focus on quality workmanship, efficient manufacturing processes, and careful integration of high-quality components to produce a precision weapons system at a fair price that is within reach of any hard-working American.At Hammer Arms, they refuse to compromise quality on any of their rifles, and all of their rifles are built to exacting standards that you just won’t find in a mass produced rifle.  Their upper and lower receivers are machined to more precise tolerances than MILSPEC, and then hand-fitted to ensure a tight, rattle-free fit.  All of their barrels come with a mid-length gas system that is tuned to provide the right amount of pressure to reliably cycle any ammunition without excess gas pressure.  Coupled with their custom tungsten heavy buffer, this results in almost no felt recoil under rapid fire conditions. To prevent any magazine malfunctions, all of our rifles come with a Lancer L5AWM magazine.  These are the best magazines in the business, and they are the only polymer magazine to pass all of the Army’s durability tests.Hammer painstakingly builds the bolt carrier groups as if their lives depended on it.  They start with a full auto MILSPEC bolt carrier group, then completely strip it to its smallest components. The bolt, bolt carrier, extractor, and cam pin are media blasted before coating in Cerakote’s Microslick for a friction-free heat resistant finish.  They inspect every gas ring, and install the SOPMOD bolt upgrade on all of their bolts.  This consists of a Crane O-ring, extractor insert, and a 5 coil extractor spring, which results in four times the extractor clamping power.  As a result, to borrow words from one of their customers, their rifles are “ridiculously reliable”.  And, thanks to the Microslick coating, cleanup is a breeze.None of their rifles are anodized. They individually media blast their rail systems, upper receivers, and lower receivers before coating them in Cerakote in the color of your choice.  This results in a high quality, long-lasting finish, with high corrosion protection and durability because of its unique ceramic backbone.  They are then oven-cured for the toughest possible finish, and assembled by hand.Hammer Arms stands behind their work.  They don’t claim perfection, but they do aspire to be good guys who make great guns.  If one of their guns ever fails, for whatever reason, they will repair or replace it at no charge.  But please, tell them how you broke it so they can make it even better.More than just selling you a rifle, we want to make sure you are comfortable with your decision to buy a Hammer now, and for years to come.  We want you to enjoy every aspect of your firearms experience.Ultimately, we want you to take your Hammer out of the box, install your optic of choice, and have a weapons system that exceeds your every expectation.  Unquestioned reliability, accuracy, and durability coupled with unmatched craftsmanship; you will own a gun that you love to shoot and are proud to show to your friends."

That doesn’t make them the world’s foremost firearms experts, but it has taught them the importance of having an accurate and reliable weapons system: your life might very well depend on it.Although founded Hammer Arms in 2014, Hammer has more than two decades of experience in building and repairing AR-15 variants, with literally hundreds of custom builds to their credit. Along the way, they have learned that attention to the smallest details is what leads to absolute reliability. Hammer is committed to producing the finest service rifles humanly possible. Hammer's primary goal is to achieve maximum reliability, accuracy, and durability in every weapon they produce.Focus on quality workmanship, efficient manufacturing processes, and careful integration of high-quality components to produce a precision weapons system at a fair price that is within reach of any hard-working American.At Hammer Arms, they refuse to compromise quality on any of their rifles, and all of their rifles are built to exacting standards that you just won’t find in a mass produced rifle. Their upper and lower receivers are machined to more precise tolerances than MILSPEC, and then hand-fitted to ensure a tight, rattle-free fit. All of their barrels come with a mid-length gas system that is tuned to provide the right amount of pressure to reliably cycle any ammunition without excess gas pressure. Coupled with their custom tungsten heavy buffer, this results in almost no felt recoil under rapid fire conditions. To prevent any magazine malfunctions, all of our rifles come with a Lancer L5AWM magazine. These are the best magazines in the business, and they are the only polymer magazine to pass all of the Army’s durability tests.Hammer painstakingly builds the bolt carrier groups as if their lives depended on it. They start with a full auto MILSPEC bolt carrier group, then completely strip it to its smallest components. The bolt, bolt carrier, extractor, and cam pin are media blasted before coating in Cerakote’s Microslick for a friction-free heat resistant finish. They inspect every gas ring, and install the SOPMOD bolt upgrade on all of their bolts. This consists of a Crane O-ring, extractor insert, and a 5 coil extractor spring, which results in four times the extractor clamping power. As a result, to borrow words from one of their customers, their rifles are “ridiculously reliable.” And thanks to the Microslick coating, cleanup is a breeze.None of their rifles are anodized. We individually media blast our rail systems, upper receivers, and lower receivers before coating them in Cerakote in the color of your choice. This results in a high quality, long-lasting finish, with high corrosion protection and durability because of its unique ceramic backbone. They are then oven-cured for the toughest possible finish, and assembled by hand.Hammer Arms stands behind their work. They don’t claim perfection, but they do aspire to be good guys who make great guns. If one of their guns ever fails, for whatever reason, they will repair or replace it at no charge. But please tell them how you broke it so they can make it even better.More than just selling you a rifle, we want to make sure you are comfortable with your decision to buy a Hammer now, and for years to come. We want you to enjoy every aspect of your firearms experience.Ultimately, we want you to take your Hammer out of the box, install your optic of choice, and have a weapons system that exceeds your every expectation. Unquestioned reliability, accuracy, and durability coupled with unmatched craftsmanship; you will own a gun that you love to shoot and are proud to show to your friends."
