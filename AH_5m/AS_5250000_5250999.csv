My father was the original owner of this gun and passed it on to me. Since I am not sure when he got it all I can say is that I have had it for 30+ years and I have only shot it once during that time. If you have any questions please email me. Sale price is $375 obo

We have developed a system that does not require the use of pins or limiters. We didn’t take our 30 round magazine and alter it we actually changed the internals to mimic a shorter 10 and 15 round magazine. The Patent Pending Hexmag True product line uses a riser and a shorter spring in place of our standard 30 round spring. Our system as shipped cannot be converted back to 30 rounds. Hexmag does not sell parts to convert our magazines to 10, 15 or 30 rounds due to state restrictions.FeaturesOur True Riser System works with our complete line of HexID System Accessories.Our System allows for normal disassembly and cleaning.A standard 30 round body looks natural in your AR rifle and is ammo pouch compatibleAdditional space on the riser………When we originally developed our True Riser we made an effort to incorporate storage in place of reduced capacity. After all why sell a product that is mostly empty space. Our riser system allows items to be wrapped around the riser and reinserted back into the magazine. The hexagon hole is not only a decorative feature but a place to secure line. So every Hexmag True 10 and 15 round magazine riser has some capacity for storage. Having the ability to carry around a short length of paracord is built right into the magazine. Hexmag 10 and 15 rd magazines are the magazines of choice for your survival gear."

The hammer has also been polished for a slightly better pull. It's a really fun gun to shoot and is a great plinking gun - really accurate!Here's the gun on Ruger's site:http://www.ruger.com/products/1022Carbine/specSheets/1103.html"

It makes the rifle run much cleaner without blowing burnt carbon into the upper receiver Group. The piston gas block is low profile and fits under most handguards in the market. It will fit with any barrel nut (if a gas tube fits, the piston rod will fit).  The Syrac Ordnance piston system has a gas adjustment screw that is accessed from the font of the gas block with a Allen Key (included). The gas screw is locked into position by a click adjustment. The gas adjustment screw allows you to adjust the amount of gas that enters the system to reduce recoil. You are able to fine turn your rifle based on the type of ammo you use and/or if you are using a silencer. You have the option of completely turning the gas off which causes the rifle to not cycle.  All parts, including the gas screw, are removable for cleaning purposes.   Specifications:  Firearm Type: AR15 Gas Length: Pistol Barrel Diameter: 0.750"" Weight: 12.6 oz.

The stock system is now formed with VLTOR’s proprietary mold and is manufactured with a proprietary carbon fiber and fiberglass composite. This makes the stock system stronger and lighter than ever before. The stock is adjustable for five lengths of pull and adjusts for elevation. In its lowest position the stock will allow for the use of iron sights or the stock can be raised up to 1.25″ higher for use with mounted optics. This stock system features an improved magwell relief that allows for easier operation of any M14/M1A magazine. The buttstock is slightly wider and longer at the toe than a regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready position feel more natural.
 
The M1-S Stock system includes a carbon fiber/fiberglass composite fore end, pistol grip assembly, buttstock adapter, and VLTOR EMOD buttstock.

It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop. It is possible to tell if there is a round chambered by looking at the ""view hole"" next to the extractor."

It has a 4"" barrel and 11 round double stack magazine. The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short crisp trigger pull on subsequent shots. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety. There is also a loaded chamber indicator.Construction is all stainless steel and they're frankly built like tanks. They became a huge hit with law enforcement throughout the 90's due to absolute dependability and the awesome stopping power of the round. In 1997, this Model 4006TSW was intoduced. It features a rail under the frame for light or laser sight attachment, thicker full length frame rails for enhanced accuracy, and delayed unlocking to reduce felt recoil. That and it's 37.8 oz. weight is why they're known as the softest shooting therefore most controllable pistols ever made to fire the normally snappy 40 S&W round.This later production pistol I have for sale was made 6/22/2001. I tuned it up with new factory Novak Lo-Mount 3 dot sights, a new recoil spring, and added Hogue rubber grips which make this tack driver a dream to shoot.It's been well cared for as you can see. The internals are excellent since you simply can't wear out a 3rd Gen Smith. I know since my collection has grown to 18 of them. I hate to sell it but I just don't need 2 of this model. Along with a factory magazine with the latest version blue follower, EXTRAS are included like an S&W case, a new box of 50 rounds with the popular Hornady Self Defense XTP hollow point 180 grain bullet, the original factory straight grips, and an optional factory curved grip some may prefer. No trades please. The cash price is firm."
