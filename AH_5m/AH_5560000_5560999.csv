(Grade 8 on the 54r.net chart). Comes complete with accessories.  A short and handy mosin.  Also open to trades.   History In accord with it's western counterparts, the Soviet Union followed the pattern of the United States, Britain, and Germany in discontinuing the production of a long infantry rifle in favor of a shortened all purpose weapon of an intermediate barrel length, usually a barrel length of 24 to 30 inches. The Russians also issued short carbines based on this intermediate length rifle to mounted troops, crew served weapons teams and general support troops. An exhaustive series of trials and field tests lasting almost eight years (1922-1930) were conducted concerning the adoption of a modernized infantry rifle based upon the basic design of the day- the m/91 Dragoon which was nothing more than a shortened m/1891. After the general testing of a short barreled version of the m/91-30, a carbine version was decided on in 1938. The weapon was submitted to the Defense Committee on the 26th of February 1939 for approval and was accepted. (2) The rifle differed only in barrel length, stock, and handguard length, a shorter cleaning rod and rear sight size. The new carbines shortened rear sight is graduated to only 1000 meters instead of the 91-30’s 2000-meter range. The front sight assembly differed slightly in that it was a pres fit sleeve that was retained by a pin while the m/91/30's was a soldered sight base that was part of the barrel. The m/38 was in all respects a slightly modified and shortened m/91-30. It was not intended to accept a bayonet. The weapon was put into immediate production at the Izhevsk weapons manufacturing plant and the first examples were issued to troops shortly there after. The year of design and submittal for testing was done in 1938 and the initial year of production taking place the following year in 1939."

FREE SHIPPINGALSO AVAILABLE ON GUNBROKER.COM, LISTING# 565340490I HAVE 3 YEARS OF 100% A+ FEEDBACK
The James River Armory ROCKOLA M14 is the truest representation of the original USGI M14 on the market today. This is not a cast receiver M1A. I ordered this gun built to be a full-fledged battle rifle using only the best, combat-proven USGI components. Not a single part of this rifle is cast steel. This is not a safe-queen, benchrest Madonna rifle; this was built to go through mud, blood, rocks and woods in a sustained-combat type scenario. However if you do decide to bench it, you will be VERY pleased with its accuracy.
The stock is an AG Composites Classic Carbon battle rifle stock, made of unbending, crush-proof carbon fiber that locks the receiver in tight as a drum and provides the utmost rigidity for far more accurate fire, all while weighing barely 2 lbs. If you youtube AG Composites you can view them driving over a Classic Carbon stock with an F250. Not a single millimeter of give or bend. Picatinny rails at 6 and 9 o'clock are easily removed in seconds if not wanted. Despite its indestructibility, it can be modded, sanded or drilled to the shooter's preference, for mounting of additional pic rails, weep holes, quick detach sling mounts, etc. IMPORTANT NOTE: Despite the 18.5"" barrel and the proximity of the rear of the bayonet lug to the opening of the gas tube, it has been professionally relieved slightly (it's virtually imperceptible) in order to allow removal of the gas piston for cleaning. You do NOT have to remove the flash hider assembly to remove the piston.18.5"" Criterion chrome-lined medium-weight barrelBula boltH&R trigger housingH&R hammerWinchester op-rod8620 forged receiverSEI gas plugSadlak Titanium Nitride pistonSadlak chrome-silicon recoil springShimmed Gas SystemUSGI Flash Hider with bayonet lugFactory-built at JRA January 2014Exactly 300 rounds fired, all brass-- PMC, LC 7.62, ADI GameKings
Rifle will ship in lockable hard case with Govt-issue 1957 M14 Field Manual, 1 20-round magazine.
Optics not included, used to showcase the ARMS#18 mount, which I will include, properly mounted according to factory specifications, for an additional 150.00 if wanted.
Titanium-nitride piston, chrome-silicon recoil spring, and AG Composites stock were all added in the last fifty rounds or so. Between the top-tier faithfulness to the M14 platform that James River Armory exhibits, and the $600.00+ virtually indestructible, featherweight stock, M14 people will understand the price tag. Lowball offers and parting out requests will be ignored. That said, I am open to all REASONABLE offers. Shoot me an email if you got one.
I accept USPS money orders, DISCREET PayPal (friend/gift option) and personal check. Personal checks WILL be held a full ten days to ensure clearance of funds before rifle is shipped. If you live in a ban state, don't bother. I will not ship to the commie states. If you live in an otherwise free state but have mag restrictions the rifle will ship without a mag; I have NO low-capacity mags to offer substitution with.

Due to the front trunnion having some threads already, these rivets would need to be larger than standard. This would also involve drilling the reciver for the front and rear trunnion. The receiver is a 100% unit, so I don't beleive their would be any legal issues.Alternatively to drift out the barrel pin, remove the front trunnion and thread it larger than 10-32.Let me know your fee, location, and a sample of past work would be appreciated as well."

It was a favorite of the range rider who could snatch it from his saddle scabbard and fire faster than prairie lightning. The Winchester Model 94 Short Rifle has a compact 20″ deeply-blued round barrel and a straight grip walnut stock. It has a rifle-style forearm, black grip cap and a full-length magazine. It’s drilled and tapped for scope mounts, and a hammer spur extension is included with the rifle. The sights are traditional with a semi-buckhorn rear and a Marble Arms gold bead at the muzzle. With the Short Rifle Model 94 there’s a lot of fun waiting in the saddle, in the field or at the range.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $979.

At the top of the line is the H&R Ultra Slug Hunter Deluxe in 20-gauge with a heavy-rifled 24"" barrel and 3"" chamber. It’s capable of shooting tight groups at 100 yards using sabot slugs. Comes complete with a Monte Carlo checkered laminate stock and forend, ventilated recoil pad, scope rail, sling swivels and a nylon sling. Added to this gun is a Hawke Sport Optics Deer PASS 3-9x40 EV Rifle Scope w/ Extreme View system.  This scope gives an additional 20% field of view, over standard riflescopes. This allows for quick and easy target acquisition, and a relaxed viewing experience. EV optics are the future of slug gun scopes! Just range your deer - then Point and Shoot.I've had this gun for 3 years and used it for only 2.  Last year I decided to try bow hunting and decided to pursue that instead.  The gun is every bit as accurate as the reviews say and it's perfect for shotgun only areas where rifles are not approved.  Lastly I encourage anyone to look up the ratings on this gun.  They are very high on most all websites.  It will serve you well for many years."
