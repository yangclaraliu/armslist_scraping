I received this beautiful Glock 26 Gen 4 9mm from Glock headquarters in mid-May of this year as a replacement for a Glock 19 Gen 4 I returned to them. They not only sent me a brand-new gun of my choosing, they installed factory Glock MH3 night sights for me as a surprise upgrade (case shows GNS on the label.).This Glock has only been fired at a gun range and was never carried or holstered. It is in excellent condition, having only two boxes of fifty round factory ammunition through it. Not a single failure to feed or fire and the shots downrange were right on target. Once I was satisfied with its performance, I cleaned, lightly lubed the recommended areas inside the gun, and applied a fine coat of protection to the exterior of the gun before safely storing it in a protective gun-friendly environment.This Glock has a great feel to it, is extremely accurate, and would make an exceptional carry and conceal or home protection pistol. This Gen 4 Glock 26 comes with factory installed night sights, three 10-round magazines, Glock protective case, modular back straps, lock, brush, tools, and paperwork.The Glock 26 Gen4 9mm pistol introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""baby Glock""—the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, but I'm sure it's a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less as you will not get a response.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.

The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.Model I-12Type ShotgunAction Semi-AutoGauge 12 Ga.Chamber 2-3/4"" & 3""Barrel Length 28""Weight 7.7 Lbs.Sights Red Bar Front SightChoke Screw-In Extended F/M/IM/C/ICSafety StandardCapacity 4 + 1"

After I buttoned that up, I installed a MagPul MOE K2 beaver tail grip and screwed in the Integrity Arms premium buffer tube kit with an ambi sling mount back plate and installed the spring and premium buffer. Capped the end of the tube with a MagPul MOE butt stock and called it done. The forward assist and new nickel boron coated MPI bolt were slid in with a red Strike Industies billet charging handle. I mounted a stainless steel Shilen match grade barrel with 5R rifling on the upper and installed the melonite gas block and tube. Once that was secured I wrapped the barrel in a nice rail from Integrity Arms with integrated full top rail and quad mounting on the end. I tossed on the MBUS flip ups from MagPul and finished the nose job with a Seekins (if I remember right) triple prong flash hider/break that seconds as a Mid Evil piercing weapon should you even run out of ammo while being attacked by whatever might attack you!

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, but I'm sure it's a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less as you will not get a response.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.

I have put two-hundred rounds of PMC M855 ball through the rifle as a preliminary break-in, and have since fired two-hundred rounds of Tula steel-cased .223 through the rifle with no malfunctions. There are no blemishes on the rifle except the expected wear patterns on the bolt and other internal parts of the reciever. I am very OCD about my rifles and clean them all once a week, as we live in a very humid environment. With the rifle I would also like to sell the four Hex-Mags (which I have found I prefer to the MagPul magazines) and the remaining 800 rounds of Tula .223, which has been surprisingly good ammunition. Also included is the Bushnell TRS-25 red dot, as espoused by one of my favorite YouTuber's, NutnFancy. This optic is currently mounted to the rifle, with co-witness iron sights (or in the case of the MBUS rear sight, polymer). I would also be willing to part with just the rifle and magazines for $750."
