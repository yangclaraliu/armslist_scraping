Engineered for performance and longevity, the MI-T556 dissipates heat at a remarkable rate while maintaining tremendous accuracy.

The MI-T556 features Magpul’s M-LOK system for quick and secure mounting of any MIL-STD-1913-based accessory. Ambidextrous functionality is retained in the upper, with the inclusion of the industry-leading AXTS Raptor charging handle.
Beneath the MI-T556’s foreend is a stainless steel Shilen 416R-derived, with a proprietary AXTS barrel contour 1:8 barrel chambered in .223 Wylde and fitted with the highest quality barrel extension, a hand polished crown, and polished feed ramps. Sub MOA performance with 55, 62, and 77 grain ammunition.

This piece was made in 1971 but I doubt that it had seen much service as it remains in 98% condition. It's an unusual pistol in that the slide does not have the signal pin loaded chamber indicator and there is a note in the lid of the original box advising the officer to whom the pistol was issued of that fact. The reason for the lack of the signal pin is that some of the slides on the pistols that were originally shipped to the Danish police cracked. Rather than selectively replacing the cracked slides, the Danes required that brand new slides be installed on all of the pistols. Walther replaced the slides but, rather than roll marking the slides with the serial numbers, the serial numbers were etched on the inside of the slides.  Included are a spare magazine, the original box, an owner's manual, a test target, and a metal cleaning rod. No shipping. Local sale only. Priced at $550.00 for the pistol alone.I also have 444 rounds of ammo that I would sell to the buyer of the pistol at a heavily discounted price."

The gun has an Italian M1891 action, modified to take a Mauser (Arisaka design) magazine chambered for the 6.5mmx50SR (SemiRimfire) Japanese cartridge. About 60,000 of these Italian rifles were ordered by Japan's navy in 1937 when all of Japan's Type 38 Arisaka rifles were reserved for the army. More than 60,000 Italian rifles were delivered but many were warehoused unused or were lost on IJN ships. Those captured or surrendered at the end of WW II were in very good condition. Produced primarily by Beretta, the rifle was designated by the Italians as the ""Beretta Fucile Tipo I per L'esportazione,"" which, roughly translated means ""Beretta Rifle Type I for Export."" The serial number of this particular gun is F7821, the F prefix identifying it as having been made by Beretta at Italy's Gardone Arsenal. Students of both Italian and Japanese World War II rifles have found much to admire in the Type I, noting that the chambers were cut to much closer tolerances, making the gun more accurate than the Japanese-made Arisaka. Another plus, the action is a full inch shorter and lighter than the Japanese adaptation of the Mauser design, with a fit and finish conforming to the highest standards of pre-war Beretta workmanship. This rifle does not have its original military stock but a sporterised one of quality wood with a recoil pad. It makes for a fine hunting rifle on deer-sized game. The gun comes with a complete set of RCBS reloading dies, including shell holder, and four boxes of ammo, two with 139gr Norma boattails and two with 140gr Hornady SP. Bullet weights for the 6.5mm (.264 inches) range from 120gr SP to Norma's 156gr round nose ""Alaska."" But most reloaders believe 156gr is too heavy for the 6.5mm round, favoring weights between 129-140 grains."

I would like to sell all items together, but I would entertain selling individual items/certain items if necessary. I am looking primarily for cash, but I would also entertain trades for other firearms or a trade including a vehicle, specifically a Mazda Miata.

This revolver reminds me of the Shay Model A convertibles that were sold in the 1980's through Ford dealers. They took modern mechanical features, and installed them in a 1920's looking Model A bodies. They were cool vintage looking cars, but with modern comfort and dependability (by 1980s standards). Rock Island has done basically the same trick with the M206 revolver. This revolver is HEAVILY inspired by the old Colt Detective revolvers that were the mainstay of undercover law enforcement through the 1970's. Gives you 6 shot capacity, and excepts Colt Detective speedloaders. features a ""floating"" frame mounted firing pin with a transfer bar safety similar to the Colt King Cobra. In the unlikely event the gun is dropped, this means it will not discharge until the trigger is squeezed. Other modern upgrades include replacing the Detective Special's leaf style hammer spring with a stronger coil spring. the frame is constructed out of 4140 ordnance grade steel. The double action trigger pull weight is fairly standard at 12- pounds, while single action breaks much lighter.A black oxide finish provides excellent durability and has been professionally applied.The M206 Spurless Revolver is ideal for self defense and concealed carry with a 2"" fully shrouded barrel and spurless hammer, fixed front sight, and smooth channel frame cut rear sight. Includes both wood and rubber grips.  It is backed by a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. Overall, the Rock Island 206 is a well priced, solidly built handgun designed to save your life in an emergency. Unloaded weight is 1.5lbs. rated for occassional + P use, but why would you use +p anyway? IMO much better gun then the offerings from Taurus and Rossi. I like it so much, I'm keeping one for myself.  Not quite the quality of a Smith and Wesson, but it doesn't cost anywhere near what a S&W will run you. Speed loaders are available for only $16.00, but only if purchased with the revolver.  Photo's look a little spotty due to thin coat of oil from the factory.  These are first quality guns.  All sales are final and ""as is"".  If you have any issue with the firearm you will need to address it with the manufacter/importer.  It is solely your responsibility to make certain that you can legally own the firearm where you reside.  All used/surplus firearms should be inspected by a gunsmith before firing."

The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.). The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.
