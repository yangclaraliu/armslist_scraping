All metal surfaces have been coated except for the bolt, chamber, and interior or the barrel. This was done to prevent rust. As you may know it holds five rounds in the magazine and is chambered in 7.62x54r. The barrel has not been counter-bored and the rifling is rather sharp but the action is stiff. It is missing the rear barrel band spring and the two rear sight pins but the sight is dovetailed into place and has been shot many times without the two pins and has stayed put. The inside of the reciever, towards the chamber where the locking lugs engage, has some surface rust but it is not deep at all. I have put aproximately 300 rounds through it but since it was a mil-surp I don't know much about it's previous use. The serial numbers match for all of the parts except for the bayonet. The serial number is in the 5000 range, so its farely low.It comes with the following accessories: Original sling2 original double compartment clip pouchesOriginal cleaining kitOriginal bayonet(non matching serial number)Original oil can20 modern production stripper clipsFeel free to contact me anytime.

Not only is the 85TSS series the most comprehensive line of target over & unders, SKB has also “raised the bar” on “out of the box” performance features.  You will discover that the new 85TSS series is simply the most technically advanced target model ever produced by SKB. The 85TSS series features a low profile box lock action fitted with a “competition barrel group”, a “tournament stock and forend”, and a “refined trigger group”.  These components are the fundamental elements which give the 85TSS its responsive handling, well balanced fit, fast sighting plane, crisp trigger, soft feel, and hard hitting attributes. The development and design of the 85TSS series is, in part, attributable to the comments and ideas received from a network of competitive shooters and customers throughout the United States and other countries.  Their suggestions provided the basis for design changes, technical refinements, and the inclusion of the specialized equipment developed by leading aftermarket manufacturers.  Special recognition goes to those industry professionals who provided technical assistance in the development of the new 85TSS series; Fred Wenig of Wenig Custom Gun Stocks, Mike Jordan former Winchester Pro-Staff shooter, Cliff Moller of Briley Manufacturing, Kent Heitz of HI-VIZ Sight Systems, Gary Phipps of GRACO Corporation, Rick Ranzinger of Pachmayr, and Ken Kelly of Mag-Na-Port International. For the past 150 years, SKB has produced high quality firearms in Japan with a tradition of handmade craftsmanship.  Over the past 36 years, SKB has provided the American target shooter and hunter with a variety of shotgun models, all produced in that same tradition.  Many of these shotguns have been passed from generation to generation and remain in service today.  As we approach our 150th Anniversary, the staffs of the New SKB Arms factory and G.U. Inc., the U.S. importer, have reaffirmed our commitment to excellence in the traditions of handmade craftsmanship.  We will continue to provide our customers with technically innovative products at affordable prices while offering the very best in personal customer service.ReceiverThe 85TSS receiver is produced in two sizes; a standard frame for twelve gauge models, and smaller frame for all 20, 28, and .410 gauge models.  The receiver is cut from a forged steel ingot by computerized CNC machines to precise dimensions measured in thousandths of an inch.  The final result is a low profile box lock receiver with a modified “Greener” style crossbolt locking mechanism inletted at the top of the receiver.  The strength of this design ensures that your SKB is capable of & providing a lifetime of shooting enjoyment.  The receiver is hand polished and enhanced with a rolled arabesque engraving pattern.  It is then protected by a silver nitride finish applied in super heated conditions that provides a corrosion resistant surface.MonoblocThe monobloc is also cut from a forged steel ingot by computerized CNC machines to similar precise dimensions.  The monobloc contains 2 locking lugs which engage the crossbolt, 2 integral shoulder lugs and a base lug which interlocks with the receiver as the action is closed.  This combination forms one of the strongest actions on the market.  The barrel tubes are seated and soldered into the monoblock to ensure the correct point of impact of both the top and bottom barrel.  Each side of the monoblock is precisely cut for a single piece ejector and the pivot seat.  The finished barrel group rotates at the pivot seat on two trunnions mounted through the sides of the receiver.  After years of use, the SKB action can be easily re-tightened if need be, ensuring that your shotgun maintains a tight fit for many more years of service.Trigger Group The non-detachable trigger system of the 85TSS has been improved with a design refinement to reduce engagement creep and over-travel.  This new tournament trigger allows the sear to disengage and drop with less pull weight.  The shooter feels a smooth and crisp trigger pull.  The hammers are powered by  “modified V” shaped springs that provide faster lock times than conventional coil springs.  The firing order of the barrels is determined by the position of the barrel selector.  The selector is located in the trigger blade keeping its operation separate from the tang mounted manual safety. The 85TSS Tournament Stocks are designed to provide the shooter with a quick handling, responsive fit.  A shotgun's ""fit"" is determined by the physical dimensions of the buttstock relative to the shooter's physique.  These dimensions determine how fast the shooter can mount and accurately point the shotgun at a moving target.  Stock dimensions affect how the shotgun is positioned in the shooter's hands and shoulder, against the shooter's cheek, and the alignment of the shooter's eye to the sighting plane.  Recognizing that each shotgun discipline has different requirements, and recognizing the need to ""fit"" our customers, tournament stocks are available in four styles; Sporting Clays, Skeet, Trap Standard and Trap Monte Carlo.  All are available with either a ""fixed comb"" or an ""adjustable comb"".  Also, a select number of models are available with High Grade Wood as an optional feature.  All 85TSS tournament stocks feature a forward sweeping pistol grip with a tight radius curve.  This places the shooter’s hand closer to the trigger and aligns the wrist in a more natural and comfortable position.  This enhances the shooter’s ability to swing and control the shotgun"

Custom rifle accuracy right out of the box.     The classic Browning A-Bolt (often referred to as the A-Bolt II) delivers dependable, pinpoint accuracy that exceeds the stringent standards of the modern rifleman. The renowned A-Bolt has been produced in popular chamberings, materials and finishes to satisfy your needs in any hunting or shooting situation.         Limited Distribution     A-Bolt II rifles are often more specialized than in the past and most are available only in limited distribution at a limited number of dealers, in special models only. But the features that made it famous for decades are still there. Have a look at A-Bolt II rifles and see for yourself why the A-Bolt II continues to lead in versatility and performance. Nothing hits the mark like a Browning A-Bolt.   A very sophisticated bolt action.     With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt II feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.     Barrel     The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.     Trigger     A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.     Magazine     Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine.     Magazine Capacity     For all A-Bolts except Micro Hunter — Magnum calibers, including WSM: Three in magazine, one in chamber. Standard calibers: Four in magazine, one in chamber. 223 Rem.: Five in magazine, one in chamber. For A-Bolt Micro Hunter only: Three in magazine, one in chamber."

When I bought it, I ran 10 rounds of every ammunition I had on hand and had no problems.

Stainless Steel slide & barrel with lightweight alloy frame, wraparound grips, and 8-shot magazine (plus one in the chamber). Configured with the white Delrin grips. In lightly used condition with no issues. Suitable either as a nice concealed carry piece or as an addition to your Smith collection. The Smith and Wesson 3913 is well known for accuracy and reliability. It has an ambidextrous, slide-mounted, de-cocking/safety lever with a hammer that decocks flush to the back of the slide, a slide release lever, a magazine release, and a magazine disconnect which disables the trigger when the magazine is removed. It is thin, at barely an inch wide, making it a favorite for concealed carry.One of the best semi-auto Smith & Wesson ever made. S&W calls the 3913 “traditional double-action” or TDA. In the TDA configuration, trigger pulls. The trigger is DA first shot with following shots SA. The difference between this pistol and others claiming to be double action is that the first shot is true double action. The hammer strikes every time the trigger is pulled just like a revolver. Trigger pull is very smooth with DA pull at about 10 lbs and SA pull at about 4 lbs. A short reset allows quick follow on shots.Novak dovetailed 3 dot low profile with white dots sights. It is a single-stack 9mm. It comes with two high quality magazines that have finger-rest bases, clearly numbered index holes, with a high-contrast, orange follower and an integrated light rail for a weapon mounted light. The 3913’s grip is very thin and nice looking plastic grips and just about 1 inch wide—quite comfortable. The slide is .9 inches across, increased slightly by the width of the slide-mounted safety lever.This S&W does not have a factory key-lock, appreciated by many. It has a “loaded chamber indicator”. The Manual, Registration & Warranty paperwork is also included. S&W 3913 Specs• Action: DA/SA• Capacity: 8+1• Weight empty: 24 oz• Overall length: 6.75″• Barrel length: 3.5″• Height: 5.0″• Grip thickness: 1.0″• Sight radius: 5.5″• Safety: External safety/de-cocker lever, Magazine disconnect"
