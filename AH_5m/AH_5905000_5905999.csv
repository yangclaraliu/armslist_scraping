Handguard flares forward (towards muzzle end) at the 3 and 9 O'clock positions approximately 1/4""Actual length when measured to flare is 10.5""   Mounting hardware, 2.2oz, for a total of 8.5oz on a 10” rail.   The KMR Alpha is hardcoat anodized for corrosion resistance as well as to maintain a non-reflective finish. The KeyMod™ interface system was developed by Eric Kincel (now the Director of BCMs' product development team) to work in parallel with the current picatinny system. In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system. The BCM KMR Alpha also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions. In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system.  *Includes BCM® KeyMod™ Sling Mount .     “Please note: Nylon/Polymer Picatinny rail sections are for NON-load bearing accessories only.

Below you will see the spec's on this AR. I have nearly $2,000 invested into this quality build. This rifle was sighted in at 150 yards, a real tack driver, used 110 grain match grade ammo. Also shot at 250 yards with 2 inch groupings. This rifle is the best of both worlds, can be used in close quarters weighing in at only 8.5 pounds, very easy to carry, then looks like and handles like a typical AR but shoots like a Ruger Gunscout or Mossberg MVP with distance shooting. Would make a great Coyote or Hog Rifle.

They not only sent me a brand-new gun of my choosing, they installed factory Glock MH3 night sights for me as a surprise upgrade (case shows GNS on the label.).This Glock has only been fired at a gun range and was never carried or holstered. It is in excellent condition, having only two boxes of fifty round factory ammunition through it. Not a single failure to feed or fire and the shots downrange were right on target. Once I was satisfied with its performance, I cleaned, lightly lubed the recommended areas inside the gun, and applied a fine coat of protection to the exterior of the gun before safely storing it in a protective gun-friendly environment.This Glock has a great feel to it, is extremely accurate, and would make an exceptional carry and conceal or home protection pistol. This Gen 4 Glock 26 comes with factory installed night sights, three 10-round magazines, Glock protective case, modular back straps, lock, brush, tools, and paperwork.The Glock 26 Gen4 9mm pistol introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""baby Glock""—the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

Sear geometry has not been changed from standard so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. The trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. The disconnector is 1070 high carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness. Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 chrome-moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver (both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated). Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5 pounds but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5 pounds (generally, the pull weight is about 6.0 pounds).

$380 firm cash or a little better in trade.  Was $499 plus tax from gun store, maybe a little cheaper than that online, so $380 is more than fair.  Several trade offers so far, but nothing yet I would want over the Henry, sorry if I'm picky.  Ftf from Rockwall to North Mesquite or I can meet at Firewheel off 190.
I will listen to trade offers if it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Could use several stripped AR lowers or will trade for 1,500rds. of Federal .223/5.56

GLOCK's new slimline pistol has taken the single stack 9mm segment by storm, outselling even the most popular contender. The new GLOCK 43 has transformed how shooters thought of single stack carry guns, no longer were they uncomfortable and hard to shoot. Now concealed carriers have the ability to practice with their carry gun without discomfort and an unpleasant shooting experience that some other single stack 9mm pistols offer. Shooters are flocking to the GLOCK 43 thanks to new and refined features like a finger groove-less grip perfect for all hand sizes and a reversible magazine catch coupled with the all too familiar GLOCK feel. Recoil is kept in check with a dual spring recoil system and the ever-present Safe-Action system ensures that the trigger feels just like the GLOCK 43's bigger brother. Thanks to the new one-inch wide design, the GLOCK 43 will disappear under clothing like it isn't even there.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing yet I would rather have over the Henry and not in need of anything, so sorry if I'm picky.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Looking for several AR stripped lowers or would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.

The improvements with the Gen 4 upgrade adds some welcome changes to the ultra reliable pistol. A new rough texture is applied to the grip of the pistol so that you will have a good grip on the pistol regardless of how slippery your hands are from sweat, mud or even blood.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but none I would rather have yet over the Henry, so sorry if I'm picky, I don't really need anything right now.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Could use several stripped AR lowers and would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.
Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.  Thanks"
