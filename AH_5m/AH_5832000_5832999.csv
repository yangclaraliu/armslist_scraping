He MUST ship to another FFL. You will need to send (or have your dealer send) a copy of the FFL along with payment. Payment can be USPS Money Order, or any other type of certified check or money order. $20 will mostly cover my costs for USPS Priority and FFL transfer fee - add $5 if you want the shipment insured. Once USPS tracking indicates the it has shipped, the gun is yours, so consider insurance carefully.If you live nearby, I will consider local pick-up. You will need to show a valid TX drivers license.

Combined with a mid-length gas system allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.

About the cartage
.300 Winchester Short Magnum (also known as .300 WSM) is a .30 caliber rebated rim bottlenecked centerfire short magnum cartridge that was introduced in 2001 by Winchester. The cartridge overall length is 72.64 mm, cartridge case is 53.34 mm in length and the bullet diameter is .308 in (7.62 mm), which is common to all U.S. .30 caliber cartridges. The principle at work in the short magnum cartridge is the advantage of fitting larger volumes of powder in closer proximity to the primer's flash hole, resulting in more uniform, consistent ignition. In field use, this round mirrors the performance of its older counterpart, the .300 Winchester Magnum, which is based on a modified .375 Holland & Holland belted magnum casing.
The advantage to this round is ballistics that are nearly identical to the .300 Winchester Magnum, but in a lighter rifle with a shorter action."

I also have a custom leather holster like new (paid $80 on ebay).  The holster will also fit a 4-inch 686, albeit a little snugger. I have a brand new soft-sided Smith and Wesson revolver case that was about $25 after tax and shipping.  This is a great case that is no longer being made by the Allen Company, Model #SW4293 (Revolvers up to 5 "").  I would also like to sell about 1400-1425 rounds of spare 22lr Ammunition.  1000 rounds of Winchester M22, 200 rounds of American Eagle High Velocity, 150 rounds of CCI Standard Velocity, and about 75-80 rounds of Remington Golden Bullet for $800. I really want to sell it all, but I may sell just the revolver some time after the listing for around $715.  Again it's brand new and unfired in the original case with all the normal S&W paperwork, and I have not registered it with Smith & Wesson.  It's just a financial luxury right now that I don't think I should have. I'll need to see a WI DL and ccw if you have it. If no ccw, you'll need to confirm you are allowed to own a firearm. Etc. I’ll be available to meet in western WI and near Madsion on occasion when I'm travelling.REGARDING TRADES:  The ONLY (sorry, but I won't even respond to other trade offers or inquiries) trade I may consider would be for a mint/like new (less than a year old under 500 rounds) CZ P-01 or PCR with a Cajun Gun Works Pro Package with all the verifiable paperwork/receipts."

So today, I'm selling my Mossberg model 88 12 Gauge Shotgun. I bought the Shotgun in December, thinking I would use it a whole lot more than I currently am now. Unfortunately, with school and work, I just dont have much time. Like I said, the Shotgun is roughly 8 months old, and I have only fired maybe 10-12 shells through it. One down-side to it, I had broken the original stock to it, so I ended up just throwing on a Pistol Grip for the time being. But you can purchase new stocks at Cabella's And Dance's Sporting Goods (just to name a few stores in the RVA.) Along with the shotgun, I will throw in 2 aftermarket chokes for Buckshot and slugs. Each one was $15. Also included, I will sell a box of Rio Target Loads, and 2-5 rnd. Boxes of federal slugs. My asking price is $280 for everything. (804) 943-99nine oneCall and Text.

Barrel is fully functional, but with a few minor scuffs.  It's a Mossberg.. You're not paying for good looks.  I had every intention of testing these rounds and using this as my primary deer gun last season, but plans and priorities have changed.  Barrel and Scope and Slugs - take it all for $300.  If you need a 500 to attach this to, I have one I'd be willing to part with.

This is a local only deal, I will not ship these. I will meet anywhere between Cabela's in Lacey and Sportsman's Warehouse in Federal Way.I'm selling a mixed lot of 20 gauge shotgun ammo. There are 147 rounds of #6 which includes 2 25 round boxes and 97 rounds in an MTM Case Guard box. The MTM box is included if you want it, but the latch on the box is broken which makes it ok for storage but pretty useless as a carry box. Also included are 9 rounds of 3/4 oz slugs, 8 rounds of #3 buck and 5 rounds of #7 1/2. All of the ammo is several years old, but it has been stored in a cool dry place. The price is negotiable if you don't make me drive too far to meet you. In other words, I'll probably let it go for $20 if you meet me at the Lakewood Cinema off 84th."

Also includes 60 rounds of 5.56/.223, two USGI mags and one P-Mag, good Bushnell 3-9x40mm scope and another cool item: a cut from an original Iraqi minefield warning tape from the Iraq War. Additinally, I am including the typical M4 Carbine rounded hand guard furniture, a castle nut wrench for removing or tightening the buffer tube, and an unused Ballisticker (pictured sitting on the stock) which can be put anywhere on the rifle and is used as a quick check for red dot range calibrations. I planned to get a B5 Sopmod style stock and put the Ballisticker on the the left side with the top of the sticker facing the forward toward the front of the rifle. I was styling the rifle after those M4's used in the film ""Lone Survivor"", and added a single thin coat of rustoleum (made for metal objects like boats) in order to demonstrate wear and so get that battlefield look.

First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy. The original Beretta Cougar was NATO qualified and boasted a long service-life of more than 30,000 9mm rounds. In its new incarnation, Beretta has developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the new Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail.  Low Recoil Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots.  Advanced Ergonomics for Easy Handling, Control, Concealment The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal.  Different Configurations to Suit Most Tactical Needs The Cougar L Type P is conceived to deliver high firepower in F or D (Double Action Only) operating systems. F models have the same safety features of the famous Beretta 92 FS pistol: external ambidextrous manual safety with decocking lever, trigger bar disconnect, rotating firing pin striker, firing pin block device and loaded-chamber indicator. The double-action-only D versions have the firing pin block device and the loaded-chamber indicator but no manual safety, thereby offering a super-smooth, exceptionally snag-free side. Both versions are manufactured in 9 mm or .40 caliber to satisfy the different needs of police officers and concealed-carry permit holders. The 8000 Cougar L 9mm pistol, available in F or D configurations, features the same rotating barrel system of the full-size Cougar L Type P; the difference is in the shortened grip frame that houses a 13-round, high-capacity double-stack magazine. The beveled slide and the reduced dimensions and weight also make this model ideal for undercover work."
