Mechanically in near perfect condition. The stock was coated in Dura Touch Armor coating. It is a protactive coating and has a tacky feel. The coating has degraded somewhat and is sticky mainly on the buttstock. I do not have time to mess with it, either removing the coating or replacing the stock. It is identical to the Browning Gold and the SLP model 1. Do your research. Thiis is an $800 shotgun. I want $445. It looks to be rarely used if at all. I purchased it with another rifle and I just don't have time to shoot what I have already.   Don REDACTED Youtube winchester sx2 to see this shotgun in action. I promised to sell it tomorrow. If he does not show up It will be available."

Have had it a little over ten years (bought it from the original owner and have kept it as a collector’s item ever since). It has been shot very little over all the years but has always been kept in great condition. Featuring excellent rifling, deep grooves, a flip-up sight for various ranges (in distances of yd. / ft.) and an easy-to-use smooth / tight Winchester straight pull-back bolt action. However, it does have some small blue-ing issues from over the years, but are very light.
Ammo Type: 7.62x51 (.308) – Very high knockdown caliber
It is a one of a kind rifle and has been well kept and cared for over the years. While it is a great hunting rifle and has rarely been used, it’s time it finds itself a new home with a caring owner.
(OPTIONAL): For $40 extra, I’ll even throw in a well-kept leather ammo belt + 20 rounds of unused Winchester .308’s
The rifle itself however is $400

The P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned Sig Sauer quality, performance, accuracy, and reliability into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full-sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers and, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes. With the 2Sum package, you're provided with a full-size P250, ideal for duty, home defense or sport, and all the components to rapidly convert it to the P250 Subcompact, a perfect conceal carry gun. The P250 2Sum holds 17 rounds of 9MM Luger ammo in full size configuration and 12 rounds when converted to sub-compact size.

This rifle has been converted from the sporter configuration back to AK spec. I planned on fully converting this with surplus barrel components, and purchased most of the parts to do so - they will all be included with the rifle (handguard retainer, gas block w/ bayonet lug, and new rear sight leaf). The only parts left for a full military conversion are the front sight block and cleaning rod (can be purchased on Apex or various surplus sites). I've also installed numerous upgrades and replacement parts (listed above), my favorite being the AKT trigger group - this trigger feels similar to some higher end AR triggers. It really changes the feel of the rifle. If you purchase the package, I will be including 1124 rounds of ammunition. The vast majority of it is M855 green tip 5.56, with a handful of .223 rounds that I had on hand. I've separated the ammo into 100rd baggies and stored it all in an ammo box (will be included with your purchase). I have a lot of money in this rifle and tried to be as fair as possible with the pricing for everything together. Thanks for looking - if you have any questions, feel free to ask!"
