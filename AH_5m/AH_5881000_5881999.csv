This is the cooler, more expensive bi-tone model, with the brushed stainless steel slide. (Up until this coming weekend) it's only had 220 rounds through it, and runs 100%, guaranteed. As always, I have no problems with a test fire if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot.The pistol is in virtually brand new condition. It has a light rail, all-steel dovetail sights, the front sight is hi-viz fiber optic. It comes with original factory case,mags,papers,lock, and some other little accessories (including 2 spare fiber optic sight replacements, red and green).It also comes with Talon grips installed, a very nice IWB kydex holster, and 2 more magazines  (total of 4 mags,  two 7-rd, and two 8-rd, and one of the 7-rd mags has a Pierce finger extension.)That's all the relevant info I can think of, feel free to contact me with further questions.Right now, I'm kinda hoping for a Ruger SP101, any barrel size, or maybe a Glock 17 (not interested in any Glock that isn't 9mm). And, unlike an ever-increasing number of inconsiderate jerks here on Armslist, I will politely respond to all serious offers, rather than just ignoring your message.Trader must be fully legal to own firearms, a legal Georgia resident, and over age 21, with valid ID. As always, I'll show my Ga. drivers license and Ga. carry permit.Also,  please respond with enough detail that I can tell you're a legitimate local buyer, and not another scammer phishing for contact info.

Blued finished with zero rust. The bore and action are in excellent condition, the factory magazine is included. The original box and owner’s manual are also included. FEATURES1. INCREASED ACCURACY OF FIRE: The barrel guide fitting the barrel into the receiver has been lengthened almost equaling that of the Beretta Olympic target pistol. This definitely increases the accuracy of fire at both short and long range.2. HIGH SPEED THUMB SAFETY: At last it has been possible to design a completely satisfactory safety lever, blocking both hammer and sear when the pistol is at full cock. The safety may be applied (UP) or released (DOWN) with lightening speed pushing the lever up or down with the side of the thumb.3. CRISP TRIGGER PULL: An improved sear release mechanism utilizing new steel alloys ensures a crisper and smoother trigger pull for more precise shooting.4. SPEEDY MAGAZINE RELEASE: New Beretta push button magazine release facilitates high speed insertion and extraction of the magazine.5. SUPERIOR POINTABILITY: The slanted pistol grip provides easier aiming. Newly designed stocks are both easier and faster to grip. Cartridges now enter the chamber with reduced loading angle.This Beretta will be a prized addition to any collectors, collection.

The rifle is more or less new, with only 40-50 rounds through it, so basically a new Remington 700 in .308. The rifle has a black synthetic stock with a basic scope mounted. It is in perfect condition with a red and black 550 cord woven sling on it. The rifle is only a few months old, and I got it on sale for 475, and after the fact I realized that to hunt I prefer Bow to rife. Yet I do collect older rifles again a trade for an old rifle or pistol I can do since i will likely be investing in an old Mauser.  The price of $460 includes 100 rounds of ammunition worth at the low end about 90$ value, a custom sling which costs $30, and a laser bore sight which costs 15-30 depending on where you buy it. The scope and rifle alone would be a cost of 430 new from a store generally speaking. Total cost to you from a store would be about $579 I am willing to take $450 without the sling and that’s still you winning. We can negotiate, make an offer also remember that it’s a more or less new rifle with as stated 40 rounds through it total. Lets make a deal.  If you're interested contact me via text, my number is REDACTED and my name is Ian Again TEXT is preferred, mainly because I either do not have good enough reception for calls or I am in a class. I can meet in the springs or even Denver for $25 more, mainly for gas. I am available any evening after 5, all Thursdays all day, most Mondays, ask and we can make a time that is best for you work for me.  You know you need a good rifle for this hunting season, with no need to buy ammo since enough to hunt and zero will be included.  SO go ahead, reach out. This is about the lowest price I can take, even if you're only planning on taking the receiver or anything like that, not my problem if you only want parts, and no I wont take 250 for a rifle that is like new with ammo and all the included items.  For the right price I can include a different scope, which is pretty nice to say the least."
