This gives the operator night vision capability from a standard day scope system. The AN/PVS-22 utilizes a fully Mil-Spec Gen 3 PINNACLE Auo-Gated image intensifier tube, a fast f/1.15 catadioptric lens for a brighter and sharper image in starlight, and patented permanent boresight alignment technology. The unit is installed, operated, and removed without tools and without affecting boresight (permanent boresight alignment). The PVS-22 can be mounted in front of a spotting scope for long range reconnaissance, hand held as a night observation device, or placed in front of a riflescope for sniper applications. The UNS is optimized for medium to long-range sniper weapons, rifles, and machine guns including the Mk11, Mk12, M-16A4, SCAR-H, M240, and M-24. OSTI’s patented Shock Mitigation System is specially designed to protect PINNACLE tubes from damage under heavy recoil. PINNACLE tubes are usually not intended for high caliber weapons, but they are perfectly secure with the AN/PVS-22.INTERESTED IN TRADES ONLY!

FACTORY NEW. Steyr AUG M3 A1 5.56mm The iconic bullpup-style Steyr AUG has been one of the most recognizable rifles in the world since its adoption by the Austrian army in 1977 and is now available for civilian use as the Steyr AUG A3 M1, a semi-convertible ambidextrous rifle platform with an adjustable short-stroke, gas-piston operation chambered for 5.56x45mm (.223 Remington) ammunition in stock 10-, 30- or 42-round magazines. The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.

It has been upgraded with TRP options (barell, trigger, hammer and fitment) so it is now the most accurate 9mm I've ever shot. Revolver accurate! It has adjustable rear sight and the trigger is now AMAZING!Comes with two magazines, box, lock, holster, etc, etc. that is came with.Between the gun purchase and the upgrades, there is over $1,000 into it. I will sell it outright for $750 or trade ($900 total value if trading) for a lower cost 9mm WITH CASH. Some of the 9mm's I like are Springfield, S&W M&P or SD9VE. Or Sig P2022. Sorry, but I'm not interested in any rifles, shotguns or pistols that are not 9mm and not wanting to do straight trades. Trades must be with cash. Please be fair with your trade offers as there is over $1,000 in this one when new and it's still like new. Thanks!Face to face sale/trade in Winter Park only. You must be legal to own a gun.

For hunting medium to large game, bullets in the 250 grain– 400 grain weight range possess devastating killing power. We have found that the .458 SOCOM offers peak downrange performance when firing the purpose built Barnes 300 grain TAC TX bullet in the 1750fps – 1800fps velocity range. The industry standard 1-14 twist barrels seem to be the best choice for over 350 grain bullets and/or subsonic loads and will shoot all suitable bullet weights acceptably well. We recommend this twist rate if you plan to use a suppressor to eliminate the chance of a baffle strike. The SOCOM is also capable of launching 500- 600 grain bullets at subsonic velocities for suppressed or tactical use.   Barrel Specifications:     Chamber  .458 SOCOM    Feed Ramps  Purpose Built .458 SOCOM Specific Barrel Extension    Finish  Matte Bead-Blasted Stainless    Gas Block Seat  .9375"" Diameter by .900"" Length - Dimpled for Set Screw    Gas System  Carbine Length    Length  16""    Material  Stainless Steel, Type 416R, Barrel Grade    Muzzle Threads  11/16"" x 24    Profile  Heavy Barrel    Rifling  1:14, RH, Six Groove, Precision Button Rifling    Weight  38.6 oz."

I am the second owner. Previous owner was TPD and purchased the rifle in anticipation of making SWAT but decided on another platform. Precise round count is unknown but the rifle shows very, very little use. I shot it a few rounds with my can on, a few more to zero the irons, and a few more to zero an optic.
Rifle has a Hogue grip, UTG Pro stock, Magpul MBUS sights and has had the following mods done:
ALG ACT trigger installedMidwest G2 Keymod forend installed
Rifle comes as shown with one exception: I will remove the Surefire 3-prong supressor adapter and replace it with an AR10 birdcage flash hider unless the buyer wants it. If you want the Surefire flash hider adapter left on, add $85 to the price shown below.
If you don't want the Surefire adapter, it will take a day or so for me to get it dropped off, swapped out and ready for you. Don't say you weren't warned ahead of time. If you want it right meow, the Surefire stays on, and you pay the extra $85 ($1,485.00 cash).
Rifle also comes with a factory 20-round mag, 20-round PMAG, and a 5-round mag.
I have not taken the stock, grip, RVG, trigger or extra mags into consideration on the price. I priced it based solely on the three lowest online retail prices for the stock rifle adjusted down for use, and 20% off the cost of the Midwest forend. Do your research before making an offer, please.I also have extra mags available on a first-come basis for the buyer only (Seriously, don't message me asking to buy mags). I have NIW 20s and 25s that were opened and never used."
