 85 Combat Style trigger with over travel adjustment helps to remove excess rearward trigger movement.
 Higher cuts beneath the trigger guard and beaver tail enable a higher grip on the gun, which helps to reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip.

The plates are IV AR500 with anti spalling coating on them. They are curved in order to fit the shooter comfortably. It comes with 2 double M4 mag pouches, 2 pistol mag pouches and a chest holster for a handgun. I am selling it because it is too big for me. Apparently it is a size M-XL but I feel like its more of a L-XL. (I might just not be as swole as I thought though)It was bought for 450 2 months ago so Ill let it go for 300 or OBO (reasonable). I will ship it if you like as long as you pay for shipping. Everything still has the tags attached to it. If you message me about trades I wont even respond. Honest opinion- Very good protection (steel is stronger than ceramic) and steel is lower profile. Steel is a little heavier than ceramic though. Ceramic plates on the private market tend to be about twice as expensive. Come try it on for yourself, im flexible with my time. Use google and feel free to ask me questions about it.

I couldn't find the original case it came with so the pistol only come with one magazine. Luckily picking up another mag isn't very expensive. So everything you see in the pictures is what you get. There is a very noticiable scratch next to the slide release lever. (I assume it was a noob move on my fathers part when he was trying to disassemble the weapon). Other than that the weapon is in very good condition. It is also by and far THE most accurate .45 I have ever fired in my life. It's a total nail driver.

Set up to load 45ACP has #9 powder bushing, see chart for powder loading data.
Very clean, comes with everything shown in the pictures, press, all dies, primer tubes, powder measure, powder bushing #9, all paper work that came with machine and original box.
 
The company CH is still in business and parts for the machine are still available. Machine can load other calibers I suggest you contact CH for that information.
 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION PLEASE READ: The warning that came with the machine suggest that only someone with experience in reloading purchase this machine. My two cents, this is not a first time reloader machine, while not rocket science once properly adjusted it is a bullet making machine. It is a straight line progressive machine.
 
I don't know how many of these are out there but for the company to still carry parts that says a lot, and when is the last time you saw one of these in this condition if at all.
Selling as is and suggest that purchaser have some reloading experience and set it up as it was never used, meaning its not set up to run right out of the box but what machine is? Call or text between 7AM and 7PM only please.
