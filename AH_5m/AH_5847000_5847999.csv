The M2 operates with Benelli's Inertia-Driven® System that has proven itself in the field to be ultra-reliable, cycling both 2-3/4"" field loads and 3"" magnums interchangeably without adjustments. The recoil operated Inertia-Driven System is the epitome of simplicity, with just 3 main parts, that operates cleaner than gas operated semi-automatic shotguns. The smaller mass of parts in the action, and no heavy gas operating components housed inside the forend, make the Montefeltro an extremely lightweight, fast handling upland bird gun made to shoulder in an instant and point naturally. Though the Montefeltro is lightweight, the rotating bolt head features steel locking lugs that lock into the steel barrel extension creating a steel-to-steel lock that becomes even tighter during firing. The Benelli Montefeltro is known to withstand hundreds of thousands of rounds with no failures, and is famous as an ultra-reliable semi-auto shotgun for high volume shooting sports. The M2 features a weather resistant synthetic stock with a Grip Tight® over-coating bonded to it that, together with a dimpled checkering pattern on the pistol grip and fore-end, provide an incredibly secure grip in wet or dry conditions. The buttstock utilizes Benelli's Comfor Tech® recoil reduction system that reduces recoil by as much as 48%, enabling shooters to stay on target for fast follow up shots. Benelli uses Crio® System barrels on their M2's that feature cryogenically treated barrels with an even-grained, slick surface that minimizes pellet deformation. The Crio® choke tubes are also cryogenically treated and extend into the barrel deeper than standard tubes, producing tight, uniform shot patterns that down birds at maximum shotgun range. The M2 Field has a matte black finished barrel with a lightweight ventilated stepped rib, and a red bar front sight and mid bead. The Benelli M2 Field is an outstanding Semi-Auto Shotgun for duck hunting, upland game hunting, or shooting anything that flies. Comes with 5 Crio choke tubes (C, IC, M, IM, F), wrench, and a hard gun case."

Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."

$1,000 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  At a few places I found this one still in stock, it was selling for $1,000-$1,100 before any other fees.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and the folding brace.  If you are looking for an M9 or 92FS to throw in the truck, this one may not be for you, so please make sure the value is there on any trade offers.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$1,080 in cash or a little better in trade value.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.

The markings on the side are completely worn off, so I can’t even tell if it’s a 67 or a 67a.  The barrel looks like someone either painted it, or a bluing gone bad.  The butt plate says Mod. 72 on the inside so I’m not sure it was the original for this rifle. The rear sight elevator is missing as well.   the rifle still functions well and the barrel lining is really good. this would make a good parts gun for someone trying to fix up a better condition model 67. or this could be a good project gun.  I have no real use for the rifle and thought I would see what is out there for trade.  If you have something interesting for trade then hit me up. I'm not expecting to come out on top of a trade, but if you have something that interest me then I’d be happy to swap with you.

Whether it's to improve your shooting form or just to save money on ammo, these easy-to-install .22 rimfire conversion kits from Kimber will let you get even more enjoyment from your 1911 pistol. Fits almost any brand of mil-spec. 1911 with single-stack magazines and non ramped barrels. Installation is as simple as field stripping. Changing from centerfire to rimfire can be completed in less than a minute. Includes one .22-caliber magazine. No modifications are necessary and you will not have to change mainsprings."

$700 cash or a little better on trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax and I'm sure it's a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price, please do not offer less as you will not get a response.
