The laser works and has been recently zeroed.  It comes with two magazines and the original case.I added high-friction grip  tape to the grip and slide, allowing for quick and sure handling, even when the gun is wet.  The tape is in good condition, and can be removed cleanly if you desire. I also added a rubber Hogue grip, which increases the size of the grip and helps control recoil.I'm interested in selling this gun, or trading it for a 20 Gauge shotgun (Rem. 870, Moss 500, etc).  In either case, come with a valid CCW permit and secondary ID (driver's license or US passport), or be willing to submit to a background check (and still have ID).  I do not wish to offend with this, it's not at all personal.  :-)"

The scope is in great condition and has seen under 500 rounds of 6.5 creedmoor, I have taken good care of it, however I ended up snapping the scope flip cap but they are easily replaced. This model is typically more expensive than MK4 scopes with tmr reticles and the M1 turrets. Other MK4s being sold are a combination of MOA adjustments with a mil reticle, or mil adjustments with an MOA reticle which can be a real pain. Having mil/mil adjustments with a mil reticle is very handy.It will come in the original box, but I have misplaced the manual that came with it so that may or may not be included.I’m going a different route which is why I am selling. The scope has zero issues. Also, realize that the image quality of the in-field shot is due to my camera phone - optical transmission is amazing on this scope and is not represented fairly in that picture.$1400.

I'm not hurting for cash but do have something else on my mind. I'll sell the package for $500. By buying this rifle package from me you can save probably $25-$50 over buying it new online. I know it's not the deal of a lifetime, but money is money. All items are brand new except for one of the factory 25rd mags. It is used but looks and works great. I'll require proof of NC residency and a complete bill of sale. I'll gladly meet a SC buyer at a local FFL to do a legal transfer as well. No shipping. I'm not looking to split it up. I will consider trading it toward a Kahr PM9 in black with the newer style slide, Springfield XDS 45 3.3 in black, or a Smith and Wesson M&P 340. Possibly a 9mm M&P Shield plus cash or extras on your end. Cash price is $500obo. Cash takes priority.Here are the details. - Brand new in the box (with all paperwork) M&P 15-22 Sport rifle. The Sport has the slim Magpul M-Lok forend and Magpul Gen 2 MBUS flip up sights.- I added a Magpul MOE pistol grip, Magpul MOE stock, and KNS Precision Anti-Rotation trigger/hammer pins. I no longer have the factory pistol grip or stock.- Also included is a brand new in the box Black Dog Manufacturing 50rd drum magazine and three 25rd S&W factory magazines. Two of the S&W mags are brand new (one still factory sealed) and the other is gently used from another rifle.I will not respond to any messages simply asking ""still available"" or ""I'm interested"". If you're interested, at least send me a complete sentence with your name and number so I can contact you. These one liners are considered spam and/or scams and will not get a response from me.
