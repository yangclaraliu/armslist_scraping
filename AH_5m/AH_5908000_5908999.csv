It comes new in the hard shell carry case with the full set of choke tubes, stock tool , but pad, oil, and all factory papers. The futuristic Beretta 692 competition over-under shotgun falls right in between our vault-like DT10 and the trimmer 680 series. At its core is a 1.6”-wide receiver designed to give superior balance and stability as well as intuitive shouldering and fast target acquisition by placing more weight between the hands. Also, the action is engineered to withstand the rigors of tens of thousands of rounds of serious training and competition, with its two huge locking lugs and replaceable barrel shoulders. And giving you adjustable trigger, adjustable ejection-extraction, adjustable balance and (optional) adjustable comb, the 692 can truly become an extension of your body. Out of the box, the 692 offers you an adjustable single-selective trigger, so that you can customize the length to fit your preferences and shooting style, as well as adjustable ejection or extraction. Also standard on all models is adjustable balance, which is achieved by means of weighted wads that you can insert in the buttstock--thereby letting you tweak the point of balance to your ideal without any perceptible alteration to the overall weight. Must ship to an FFL. No international or California sales. Visa, Mastercard, and Discover are ok with additional charge.Beretta 692 Sporting 12 ga."

It has a custom 24 inch barrel NP3 internals and Rogaurd externals meaning it will not rust.

It has been sitting inside my safe since I bought it a year ago I cannot find a range to stretch this thing out to the 1000 yards it needs to show what it can do. I added a Wegatinny 20 MOA sloped picatinny rail on top so it is ready to add optics. It will also come with Ruger rings if that is your preference for some reason. Buyer pays actual shipping.

This comes with the box, lock, pistol, case, paperwork, and box of ammo. This is a fantastic holdout pistol and little carry pistol that I would keep, but its not terribly practical for me.  Mainly looking for cash for bills, so not really looking for trades on this, but may consider some if they interest me. Would consider a PLR16, 4 or 6 inch 38/357 mag revolvers. Rugers, Smiths, etc. Maybe even a new full set of 17 inch AT tires (265/70/17 or very close to) Also would take very partial trade for Stripped Metal Ar lowers.

This is a Uberti 1873 Cattleman Bisley 5.5 357/38 SPL revolver. This is a fantastic SA revolver that is like new. This has less than 100rds though her and is one of the highest quality Uberti’s I have ever handled. This comes with the factory box, the pistol, and a Leather handmade Viking leather holster. This pistol is an amazing modern retake on the classic 1873 design. The lockup and timing of this pistol is great. I would keep this, but I already have a full size 357 magnum revolver.  Mainly looking for cash for bills, so not really looking for trades on this, but may consider some if they interest me. Would consider a PLR16, 4 or 6 inch 38/357 mag revolvers. Rugers, Smiths, etc. Maybe even a new full set of 17 inch AT tires (265/70/17 or very close to) Also would take very partial trade for Stripped Metal Ar lowers. Most trades will need boot on your end, but for the right deal i may consider it on my end. Need to meet in Norman on this."

As you can see in the pictures, it's in perfect condition and the bore and feed ramp are still perfectly polished. No corrosion of any kind anywhere (internal or external). It shoots beautifully, and I'd estimate it's probably had 500-1000 rounds through it. I'm only asking $375, because I cannot include the magazines in the sale (they're 16 round). However, I am including all of the original accessories (holster, flashlight, magazine holster, magazine loader, and case), plus a nice IWB leather holster made to fit the XD9 specifically, and a cleaning kit.The sale will need to be done through a gun store, of course.

It has been rebarreled with a 26"" target crowned criterion barrel with just under 1000 rounds fired through the barrel. Stock has been bedded as well. Rifle shoots half moa groups all day and i have load data for it. I have been having great results with 40 gr blitzkings and it would make a very accurate varmint rifle. 55 grain bullets didnt shoot so well but 52gr and 62gr did great. I have a 308 and. 6.5 creedmoor and i just dont shoot this anymore. I would like to get a nice ar set up for 3 gun instead of keeping this rifle.price is 875 for the rifle and scope bases.1350 fr rifle, scope, bases, rings, butler creek caps, and everything the scope comes with new, including the box. Scope is a vortex viper hs 6-24x50 with vplex reticle. In brand new condition. Not that round count matters, but its been on the rifle for about 300 rounds.i also have some reloading components available including a few boxes of 40gr blitzkings, some twice fired lapua brass, once fired norma brass, 8 pounds of benchmark powder, and i might have a die set available.. Have to dig it up to be sure though.only trades i would be interested in are an upper/ lower billet receiver matched set for an a r15, new stainless 1:8 twist 18"" ar barrel in 223 wylde, and other stuff i could use to build up an ar. Already have a trigger group, stock, and grip. Im more than willing to let you shoot this before buying if you know a range around here we could go to. Will trade for:No shotguns, pistols, bows, boats, or anything else other than high quality ar15 parts to build up a 3 gun ar.. Mainly a billet upper/ lower receiver set, new 18"" stainless 1:8 twist barrel, lightweight bcg and bolt.. Stuff like that."
