Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design. The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect. If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™.

The gun ships with one magazine, including two interchangeable base pads—one that fits flush with the frame, and the other (fitted to the magazine from the factory) that provides a grip extension of about 0.5 inches (13 mm).[1] The Ruger LC9 was chosen as the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence's Handgun of the Year in 2011."

We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice. Easy Accessorization and Maintenance The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit. Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable Magazines Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance.    Absolutely Reliable, Designed to Last The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features. This pistol is also available in .40 S&W as the 96A1 and in 9x21mm as the 98A1.    FAMILY:92 Pistol Series  MODEL:92A1  TYPE:Semi-Auto Pistol  ACTION:Double / Single Action  FINISH:Matte Blue  STOCK/FRAME:Alloy Frame  STOCK/GRIPS:Black Polymer  WEIGHT:34.4 oz.      CALIBER/GAUGE:9mm  CAPACITY:17+1  # OF MAGS:3  MAGAZINE DESC:17 rd.  BARREL:4.9""  OVERALL LENGTH:8.5""      SIGHTS:Removable Front Sight  SAFETY:Slide Mounted Manual/Decocker  ADDL INFO:Picatinny Rail  ADDL INFO:Rounded Trigger Guard  ADDL INFO:Internal Frame Recoil Buffer  GUN CASE:Plastic"

It is the raptor 2 from kimber. I'm looking to trade for multi gun deals. I'm interested in cheap 5-600 dollar ars no carbon lowers, glocks, sig 938, nice smith or ruger revolvers.I want to answer some of the most common questions I've been getting. First, I cannot trade even for 2 glocks. This offer has come up 4 or 5 times in a week. I'd need lots of extras to trade for 2 glocks and being a 29 or 40 would help.Second, people keep asking is this 45; yes it is 45! Third, people are asking if this is stainless. This raptor 2 is black not stainless but it has high polished flats so it shines similar to stainless. If anyone has any other questions feel free to email. I'm a nice guy and will answer all. I do not want to sell for cash. Ideal trades would be a glock and ar. a ar and sig 938 or something similar. I know I'm not going to get a high end ar. I'm thinking psa upper and lower  maybe a psa ar pistol with sig base something like that. My raptor is like new other than one little mark from the take down pin. This is very common on all polished 1911s. The spring is super tight and sites are super bright but i cannot give an accurate round count."

The Registered Magnum morphed into the Model 27. Law enforcement agencies favored the Model 27, but its high-polish finish and labor-intensive topstrap checkering added expense with no added utility for a police carry gun. The Model 28 is unusual in that Smith & Wesson removed, rather than added, features to the Model 27 to create it, in order to reduce production costs with no reduction in utility. A classic N frame revolver, the Highway Patrolman is blued, but it is not polished, saving labor costs. The top strap and frame rounds are bead blasted to achieve a matte appearance. By the early 1950s Smith & Wesson returned to manufacturing many of its pre-World War II models, including the .357 Magnum, the descendant of the famous Registered Magnum. However, the .357 Magnum was more costly than the standard .38 special revolver of the time. In the late 1940s and the first part of the 1950s Smith & Wesson was the only American gun company manufacturing a .357 magnum revolver. Since this relatively deluxe model was the only revolver available for this cartridge at the time, police departments, as well as individual officers and private shooters, requested from Smith & Wesson a more strictly utilitarian ""budget"" .357 magnum revolver. S&W responded with the Highway Patrolman (later renamed the Model 28 in 1957). The manufacturing changes made for a more affordable revolver, though mechanically the Highway Patrolman is the same as the more ornate Model 27.The Model 28 was in production from 1954 through 1986. For most of its production run it was a steady seller with both police officers and civilian shooters."
