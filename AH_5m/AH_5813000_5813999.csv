It has matching serial numbers on the receiver, magazine, forearm and bolt. It has an excellent 25 inch 5 grooved bore with bright and sharp lands. The headspace is good on a 0.067"" armourers gauge with a No '3' bolt head. The firing pin protrusion is 0.045 inch. The action is very good, tight and clean. The metal shows 99% of the blue finish with a little wear on the edges. It has a good BLO finish to the walnut stock with no cracks or major dings. The butt stock is stamped with the serial number of the scope it was set up with (1890 over another which is illegible). The scope mounts are original with no indications of the screws being re-locked (piened). The scope was produced by REL (Research Enterprises Ltd) with excellent optics and adjustments, complete with original leather lens cover with the broad arrow marking (maybe British as most Canadian equipment was marked C broad arrow). This appears to have been refurbished. Some witness marks of usage on the tube from the leather scope cups are present. The REL scopes were thought by some to be superior quality to the British scopes. The Brits may be excused as they were being bombed during production by the Germans. The wood forearm and hand guards are dark walnut wood. The rear hand guard has a arsenal repair applied at the rear. The butt stock is lighter in color and is stamped and painted with numerous numbers. The cheek piece appears to be of oak wood. This rifle has seen service in the Far East WWII theatre (India) from little patches of green paint on the metal which they used as a secondary protective. It has a serialized standard ten round magazine. This excellent condition is commensurate with one of the WW II Enfields' which has seventy years service. This will complete a collection with a rare Long Branch sniper."

No paperwork, no background check, and no forms needed, as long as you are at least 18, I can sell this hand-cannon to you!
 
I prefer face-to-face sale, but I will ship in-state directly to you this Automag III.  No middleman, no FLL dealer required!  However, the money must be in my hands before I will ship. 
 
The Automag III is also called the “flame thrower” for the fire that comes out of the barrel when you shoot!  No potmetal, no zinc, no polymers, just solid stainless steel!  I have another one of these hand-cannons that I shoot and keep for self-defense – it is an awesome weapon, never jams, extremely powerful, never rusts, and super accurate!  Try a hollow point or soft point 30-carbine load, it packs a wallop!  But, then it should, this is rifle ammunition in a pistol. Go ahead, make Dirty Harry’s day, buy this hand-cannon.
 
My selling price is $1,450, which is an incredible bargain!  In fact, my selling price for a FACTORY NEW, NEVER FIRED AMT AUTOMAG III is less than a used Automag!

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.  When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

$600 in cash.  Looking for Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.  I can add??
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$600 in cash.  Looking for a Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.  I can add??
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$1,000 obo. cash.  Looking for Sig MPX Gen 2 pistol with mags and folding brace.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
