Never taken to the range. Striker-fired Kahr PM9s are known for their incredible reliability, smooth non-stacking double action trigger, diminutive size, and surprising accuracy (as they should be, given the high retail price point). You do NOT need to use the slide release to chamber a round (although you can), an authoritative slide rack does the job just fine.The forged barrel is polygonal for increased velocity and accuracy. I'd much rather trade, but I'll sell at a very cheap $625."

The L-Frame Smith & The 686 Plus features a 7-round cylinder, giving you one extra shot over a conventional 6-shooter. A full-length ejector rod shroud puts extra weight out front to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster sight acquisition on follow up shots. The single-action trigger pull on the 686 Plus is light and crisp for precise shooting; the double-action pull cycles the cylinder smoothly for rapid fire. The red-ramp front sight is pinned into an integral sight ramp, and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation.Comes with a box of Hornady .357 hollow point. Unfortunately I'm selling my favorite gun because I'm moving out of the country and it needs a home, approximately 56 rounds of .357 sent down the barrel. I will not ship and no low ballers, I paid full retail for this piece."

For sale is a vending machine converted into a hidden gun safe. I built this myself several years back and have used it as a ""hide in plain sight"" safety measure. I am only selling it because it just barely too big (1/2 inch) to fit through the front door at our new house, and I don't want to move it a third time since we're planning on only being in this house for a few years. I also don't want to store my firearms on the front porch. :)It fits about ten or so long guns. I was able to cram about twelve in it at one time. There is room for a handgun stand with the long guns in there, and I once had about a half-dozen pistols in that space. There is also a space under the main area to store documents and accessories. You can also store accessories in the door, as you can see in the photos.Obviously, I have the key. Everything works (except for the actual vending part). The very bottom is rusted (not the bottom where the guns would be), but it has little effect on the machine itself. If nothing else, it's great decoration! I've gotten many compliments on it over the years. I'm asking about $250, which is already less than I put into it. I figure that the Coke sign at the top is worth a decent amount by itself. I wouldn't get rid of it if I didn't have to.One final note: this thing is HEAVY! I'm a pretty strong guy, but there's no way I can lift it by myself. I can move it, but not far. It is doable with two strong men, better with three. I am willing to help you load it. I'm guessing that it's somewhere around 300-400 lbs."
