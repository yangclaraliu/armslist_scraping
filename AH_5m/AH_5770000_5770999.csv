This is a fastback 1911 with a stainless 5"" barrel and Nitron coated frame. These come equipped from the factory with Tritium night sights and they are still very bright.This gun is a 9.8/10. I bought it new in late 2013 and it has been babied ever since. I have only fired it at an indoor range and have always cleaned/lubed it as soon as I got home. You can see for yourself in the pics that I have recorded the number of rounds fired during each trip. This 1911 is barely broken in with only 450 rounds fired through it. She runs very well!When I purchased this gun I had been lusting over it for months. I swore I would never sell it. The precise machining and exact fitment of every detail in this gun reveres that of a custom, hand built 1911. The quality is unprecedented for a production firearm. I often refer to this as my Cadillac because runs so smooth. Firing this pistol is an effortless joy that brings pleasure to all who have done so. I will be sad to see it go but I am currently in greater need of the cash and, as you can see, I'm just not using it enough to justify keeping it.I am not willing to move much on the price so don't bother with low ball offers. This firearm retails for $1,000+ and tax in Kansas will cost you another $100. Cash only, Kansas DL minimum (21+, prefer CCH) or you pay FFL fees. Face to face in public meeting place.

Please don't simply go by the picture -- it's VERY HARD to get a great pic of this fine firearm... The thing is, if you use the flash, you can wind up with a blurry pic or a pic that's shiny in some areas and off-colored in other areas- almost too vivid, and little bits of light, shadow, shine, etc. can look like imperfections or problems in the gun..  If you DON'T use the flash, it looks like it's faded or terrible condition or 100 years old.  I did the best I could with my smartphone but it's a great looking gun.  I'm told you could use Mother's car polish (or other Mother's products, like the Mag Wheels product or super shine stuff) to polish this up to a parade gloss.This is an amazing firearm -- it's damn nice and amazingly accurate - really impressive for a .45 ACP 30-year-old autoloader.  This is a traditional Smith and Wesson action that is DA/SA - double action with a Decocker/safety lever.  I added brand-new Hogue hardwood grips for nearly $75+ bucks.  These go for $700 all day long regardless of condition, I just want the $650 I spent on it (and I'll take the hit I spent on the $75 grips) ... I am consolidating calibers.   The serial # indicates it was made in 1986.  These are widely considered not only perhaps the finest firearm Smith and Wesson ever made, (with the time-era this was produced coinciding with the golden age of Smith and Wesson's semi-auto production, the best of the best they made) but some of the finest firearms you could own and carry.      The stainless-alloy steel that Smith and Wesson used in the production of the 645s were hardened to absolutely ridiculous levels that near tool-steel hardness ratings.  These are not just built to last, they are quite literally BUILT TO LAST."

The 'Extreme' model features a Nitron coated stainless slide on an anodized frame along with Hogue grips. Additionally, this pistol is equipped with full size SigLite Night Sights for quick target acquisition and an extended 7 round magazine. The extended magazine provides extra grip length that enhances the control of the gun considerably. The flush-mounted 6 round magazine is included for extra concealability as well. If you aren't familiar with the P938, this is a very small pistol that still handles and shoots like a tack driver. The 938 model is a slightly larger 9mm version of the popular P238 (.380). It operates as a single action, external hammer, ambidextrous thumb safety pistol that is similar to a 1911 in design. The magazines are single stack as well. This gun IS remarkably small, excellent for concealed carry, but still fills in the hand nicely and instills confidence in the shooter.This gun has seen a fair amount of use and daily carry but doesn't show as heavily worn and still operates reliably. The night sights are still plenty visible in the dark as well. I always clean my guns the same day that they are fired at the range and regularly cycle magazines, ammunition, etc. I am including 3 holsters: 1 DeSantis with a single under-the-belt clip, 1 no-name leather holster with an over-the-belt clip, and 1 Sticky holster (no clip necessary).The gun comes with the original hardshell case, 1 extended (7 rd) magazine, 1 flush (6 rd) magazine, and 3 holsters.Cash only, no trades.

This is from Raven Concealment’s website “The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged. Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians. The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.”
The dual magazine holder can adjust retention on the magazines. The dual mag holder is worn on the left side with the orientation of the bullets forward.
Check out Raven Concealment’s website for any questions on the holster and mag holder.

The reason they made these revolvers was for law enforcement, the New York State Police used the Model 10-6, barreled for 357 magnum, so the Model 13-1 was made immediately after the Model 10-6 and the first production of them went to law enforcement.
