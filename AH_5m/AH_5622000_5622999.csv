It'll also come with a cleaning kit and a s&k scope mount that easily mounts in the rear sight.  It's 85 bucks on its own. There's also some brass to go with it if you reload.  I'm asking 325 for the lot. I would like to keep it but I'm selling some non essentials to fund an ar or ak. I'd also listen to some trades for military or surplus pistols such as a Makarov or tokarev or hi power clones and the such. If you are interested feel free to call me or text at REDACTED.

This is the 9E not to be confused with the SR9 there are subtle differences like less machaning, one magazine instead of two, no loaded chamber indicator and the sight Grove for both the rear and front sight are smaller so you can't use SR9 sights on this model buy you can use every other accessorie. I still have the cardboard box and all the original paperwork for the firearm and the gun lock. I have purchased a few extra parts for this firearm and they are as listed: stainless  steel guide rod and recoil assemble (because the original was cheap plastic) from Galloway precision, an extra magazine(17 round capacity) from Brownell made by ruger both of these are included and (both were around 40 dollars in price) a rubber grip for the model.  I am also including 53 round of defense ammo 18 rounds of Winchester white box 115 grain JHP and 35 rounds of Hornady critical defense also 115 grain JHP."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4″ up to the 3″.This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Features:Gauge: 12 GACapacity: 6Barrel Length: 18.5""Finish: Tactical GrayAction: Semi-AutomaticHeight: 7""Chamber: 3"""

So here's the deal: if anyone has a pair of ivory grips for a Colt Mustang (elephant, mammoth, walrus, or hippo doesn't matter), I'll trade you my pair for a Colt Gov .380. Technically, it might be considered a net gain for you at least as far as sheer volume in that you'd end up with about a half inch more ivory total.I know. Long shot.
