For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****      The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Kryptek Typhon Finish.

A semiauto shotgun that shoots any type of 12-ga shell? can fire 4 shots in less than one second.soft-recoiling and leaves your shoulder feeling perfectly comfortable even after a marathon duck-hunting session in the marshes or a long day at the clay range.The A400 Xtreme Bottomland Camo does this and much more. Add its superior resistance to salt spray, flawless fit and finish and the best materials in the world--and see why this shotgun is the definitive choice for the serious waterfowl hunter. Versatile-Fast-Low-Profile-ActionVersatile, Fast, Low-Profile Action The A400 action is truly revolutionary in the history of the semiautomatic shotgun. Thanks to the proprietary Blink technology, it shoots 36% faster than any other system, meaning that your follow-up shots will always be faster than any high-flying duck, goose or clay target. It is low-profile and light weight (while being super-durable), giving you superior natural pointability. It has built-in rails, so that you can easily equip it with the optics of your choice for turkey season. And its reliable feeding of any type of 12-gauge shell—lead or steel, mild 2 ¾” to hard-hitting 3 ½” magnums—gives the A400 the versatility of a do-it-all shotgun. Low Recoil (70% Recoil Reduction)Low-Recoil The A400 Xtreme Bottomland features not one, but several of today’s most advanced recoil reduction systems right out of the box. All these systems work together to minimize not only the recoil from the cartridge ignition and firing, but also from the backward-movement of the bolt. Also, the A400 Xtreme Bottomland is designed to recoil parallel to the cheek mount, which also reduces felt kick while giving you faster follow-up shots. Altogether, these recoil-reduction devices decrease felt recoil by 70%, meaning that you can enjoy a longer day at water’s edge or at the range without any discomfort. Flawless, Durable, Corrosion-Resistant Finish Something else that won’t fail to impress you about the A400 Xtreme Bottomland Camo is its finish. The camo pattern is flawless and covers even the corners and recesses that would be left out in a lesser shotgun. But what’s even more impressive is that, thanks to Aqua technology, the steel parts of the A400 Xtreme are highly resistant to corrosion, water and salt-spray, which make this shotgun a champion of durability even in the most extreme hunting conditions.

This is the rifle the range riders of the 1800's would have loved to have had close at hand for picking off varmints or just plinking at whiskey bottles. But, since the .17HMR didn't hit the market until 2002, it will be up to you to make it a legend. Our Henry Varmint Express packs eleven .17HMR rounds in its tubular magazine. It features a 20"" barrel and comes with a cantilever scope mount and checkered American walnut Monte Carlo stock. Like all lever action Henrys, the action is incredibly smooth from the very first shot. It will enable small game and varmint hunters to take full advantage of the .17HMR with regard to velocity, trajectory, wind drift, ricochet resistance, quietness, and accuracy. Already considered by many to be the most accurate rimfire cartridge ever produced, the .17HMR incorporates a .17 caliber bullet into a necked-down .22 Magnum case. This high-powered combination produces a sizzlin' muzzle velocity of up to 2,550 feet per second, and the laser-flat trajectory makes it lethal for long-range shots on woodchucks, prairie dogs, foxes and other small varmints. Henry's take on this revolutionary caliber, the Varmint Express, has a 20"" barrel that delivers dead-on accuracy. Just like all Henry rifles, it's handcrafted in the United States, using only high grade components, such as a checkered American walnut stock, Williams Fire sights, and, of course, it's outfitted with that legendary, smooth-operating lever action that sets a Henry rifle apart from all the imitators. Specifications and Features: Henry Repeating Arms Model H001V Lever Action Rimfire Rifle .17 HMR 20"" blued barrel 11 round tube magazine Single stage trigger Hammer safety Side ejectionBlued steel receiver with grooves for supplied scope mount Williams Fire Sights Deluxe, checkered American walnut stock with straight grip 37.5"" overall length 5.75 lbs unloaded Made in the USA"

This particular rifle was produced in 2001, just a few years before Marlin was bought out by remington. It's equiped with see-through scope rings, as well as a ghost ring sight, a really nice setup for quick close range shots. It comes with the scope pictured, an older Simmons whitetail 2-10x40, holds zero just fine. Only about 100 rounds through this rifle, but it has been hunted with so there are some light marks on the stock and barrel. Only selling because I have three lever action 30-30's and I only need one. This rifle setup is great for NW deer hunting, allowing both quick target aquisition throught open sights and longer range shots using the scope. Get it in time for deer season.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719.
New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change.
