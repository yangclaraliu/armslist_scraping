Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-shot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver.The AUG A3 M1 boasts an overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG's matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions.The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger.The AUG A3 M1 Stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.

The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb. The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system and is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the KRISS Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterparts and is civilian legal in most states.

The 1944 M1 carbine has the same features as the 1945 M1 carbine but with a Type 2 barrel band and 10-round magazine. This model is made available for sale in most states with magazine and bayonet lug restrictions. Like the 1945 model, the 1944 features adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and ""low wood"" walnut stock. In 1941, with the US being pulled into one of the greatest conflicts in world history, a division of General Motors was tasked to support the war effort. The result was firearm history with Inland Manufacturing becoming one of the largest gun manufacturers in the US, producing nearly 3 million firearms in less than 5 years. The most notable of Inland's firearm production was the .30 Caliber M1 carbine and the folding stock variant, the M1A1 Paratrooper model. Dayton, Ohio was home for the original Inland company, and is now the home of the new Inland Manufacturing located just two miles from the original facility. Today's Inland Manufacturing is now producing a new line of .30 caliber M1 carbines and 1911 style pistols.

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb. The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector CRB Enhanced is Cerakoted in Combat Grey and comes fully loaded with accessories such as the KRISS M4 stock adaptor, DEFIANCE M4 stock, and an enhanced square barrel shroud. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, Magpul RVG, Hand stop, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB Enhanced is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states.

That's the definitive Black Powder Proof mark used after 1893. Next the 12 over C in a diamond is the gauge designation for the black powder proof and a note that the barrel is ""choked"" Next are two stamps on top of one another. The top one, a piller over Steps, is the Perron, and is the mark of the gun being made in Liege. Under the Perron, and up and to the right of it, is a poor stamping that REALLY is a star, the letters E L and G in an oval that is a ""double proof mark"" required by French law beginning in 1810. Then, we have a star over the letter K that's the inspector's mark, but no way to link them to the actual inspector now. There's a cursive E and a cursive L intertwined. That's a provisional proof mark.18.0, the bore diameter in mm C:12 -- which clearly talks about 12 gauge, but I have no idea what it ""means."" The usual marks for Janssen are on here (most notably JF) and I can tell you that there is no ""Smokeless"" powder proof anywhere. These are black powder only barrels. As to date, post 1893, pre-1924. Shotgun sell requires a FTF, cash only.  Asking $150 OBO."

I like this gun a lot, but I decided to go back to 9mm handguns. But I'm not desperate to get rid of this gun, or not going to give it away either. Must meet around Lexington or Nicholasville only. Face to face deals only. Kentucky residents only, no shipping, and must have proof of ID (i.e., CCDW, Driver's License). I will check your ID, and you can check mine. I do have a CCDW. $750. Cash only, no trades. Cash price is FIRM so no low ball offers. I'm selling this gun cheaper than the gun shops around here in Lexington (Buds sells the same gun or model for $879.99 + tax). Low ball offers and whiners will be ignored. And will not respond to ""call me, text me"" replies. I prefer to communicate via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. Thanks for looking."

I am more of a gun collector then a gun user. I thought this would be my carry gun but I have found I like another gun for the fit in my hand and this one just doesn't get taken along. This Ruger LCP has had four magazines of 380 ammo fired through it so it is in like new condition and I can tell you it works correctly. I added the Hogue grip and I can assure you if you buy someone else's LCP- add the Hogue Grip it allows you to grip this gun about 80% better. All Ruger LCP's have a lot of snap and kick back without the Hogue Grip because these guns are so light. I have the original 6 round Ruger magazine and I bought a Ruger name brand 7 round magazine also. Each magazine has been emptied twice. The magazines work correctly. This handgun comes with the soft case, the card board box, a gun lock, and all the paper work. In like new condition and I cleaned it after the 4 mags I ran through the gun. Great gun I just have dozens of guns and I realize I can part with a few. Sorry I couldn't get this listing to add another picture showing the original box, gun lock, paperwork etc. But you will get everything this pistil came with.This gun is about 9.75 ounces unloaded and is a great size and weight for carrying and concealing this pistol. Loaded you can come in around a pound. Its a very comfortable gun for weight and size if you carry.Must have permit to purchase or permit to carry. I will take pictures of your driver's license, your permit to carry or permit to purchase, and you can photograph my info. A permit to purchase is free from your city.  $450 with a box of 50 practice bullets of 380 ammo and one box of 380 home defensive hollow point ammo. Text me at REDACTED Kevin"
