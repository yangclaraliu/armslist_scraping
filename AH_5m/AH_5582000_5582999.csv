The rifle has finish wear and the stock has dings and scratches.  There is a tight hairline crack on the left side of the stock just foreard of the armorers stamp.  A previous owner lightly electro-stenciled his name into the side of the magazine and the stock.  It's not very deep and is old, so it doesn't jump out at you, but if you look for it you can see it.  I have a lot of pictures of the rifle if you are interested I will email them directly to you.  The rifle shoots great.  I've only put around 40 rounds through it in the years I have had it and had no failures what so ever. I will ship but must go to type 01 or 03 FFL.  Shipping and insurance will be added to sale price if shipped. For local sale a FL DL and firearm bill of sale will be required. Not interested in any trades.  Thanks"
