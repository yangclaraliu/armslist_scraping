This was not a kits part but an assembled and tested rifle by the factory. Everything is made to Mil-Specs or better and has higher end Magpul Furniture. Only thing I have done is clean it and oiled it with Hoppes Elite oil. Below is a list of most specs, I can send you more info as well as a link to with a ton of pictures since I can only post three on Armslist. Only selling as I am reducing my collection due to business expense. LowerStock:Magpul CTR Stock. This stock is in another class than the typical Magpul MOE stock. It slides using one lever which is more than enough to lock into place but then uses another lever to lock it down. There is zero movement once locked by both levers and to move it you simply squeeze the main lever and it unlocks both and the can slide smoothly to the next position. Magpul Pistol grip that fits nicely in hand with a very good grip. Bottom of grip has a flush door that opens to store batteries, spare parts, etc. Also has oversized Magpul trigger guardPremium internal lower parts, all mil-spec with a measured 6lb trigger pull.

Not only are the parts excellent, it's the overall build quality that makes the rifle. Its just one of the most solidly built ARs I have seen and with the Magpul furniture it's looks great but adds to the quality and feel of the rifle. Once it's in your hands and you charge it, you immediately can feel and see what I'm trying to describe. When I received it, my FFL which I have used for single firearm I've ever bought, was very impressed and said he would sell it for $1150 and if it was a big box manufacturing the MSRP would be around $1500. I am selling the complete rifle with the padded box, Magpul Gen 2 rear flip up sight, SightMark 5.56 Bore Sighter, and (1) 30 rd brand new in bag Magpul Pmag Gen 2 Magazine. Thanks, Mike"

132,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5860132,For Sale:  Liberty Mystic X,"Elma, Olympic Peninsula, Washington",$ 750,"Listed On: Sunday, January 28, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"East County Guns | 309 W Main Street | P O Box 757 |  Elma, Washington | 98541          Liberty Mystic X Specifications: Length: 8”Diameter: 1.375”Weight: 10.5 oz.Core – Stainless steelTube – TitaniumTube Retaining Ring – Alloy steelFinish: Type C High Temp Cerakote™ In Graphite BlackMounting via: Numerous types specific to each platform.Aprox. Sound Reduction: 33dB – 38dB across several platforms.   The first true multipurpose suppressor, the Mystic, set the bar high for a multipurpose design. Now the Mystic X has improved upon that ground breaking technology.   Born out of a need for a suppressor that exemplifies versatility, the Mystic X is equally at home on rifles, pistols, centerfire, or rimfire. Rated for a full 52 calibers, this suppressor can handle anything from 17 HMR all the way up to 7.62x39mm. and with Dual Arc Baffle Technology, 7 of those calibers are even full auto rated. The Mystic X tips the scales at 13.9oz with any of the several booster options available, and slightly less with one of the Fixed Barrel Adaptor variants. Keeping with the theme of simplicity, the the stainless steel core can be removed from the titanium tube to be cleaned in any method you choose; dipped, ultrasonic, media blasted, or soaked in solvents. The Mystic X is our most popular can and is an excellent choice for the first time suppressor buyer due to it’s versatility and ease of use and maintenance. Designed with Dual Arc Baffle technology, the Mystic X is incredibly quiet for a centerfire monolithic core suppressor. Although the real treat is the Mystic X performs really well on so many centerfire rifle and handgun calibers. The 7.62 x 39 and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but many rifle calibers are also rated for supersonic speeds as well. 38 Special, 357 Magnum, 357 Maximum or 9×25 Dillon? No problem! The Mystic X loves all these rounds and many more! Being takedown in design, this suppressor is a favorite of people using cast lead bullets. It is well known that lead buildup in the 9mm and 22LR suppressors is a reality and the Mystic X is perfectly suited for this application. We also performed an accuracy test to see how it would affect performance on a 300 Blackout bolt rifle (a nice little handy hunting rig) Group size without the suppressor averaged right at .75″ at 50 yards with 208 AMAX subsonic loads, and shot exactly the same with the Mystic X mounted, with no perceptible point of impact shift either. We like a 50 yard zero as this gives a PBR of about 150 yards with the 208 sub loads, so that is what we chose to test at as well."

I paid $160 brand new for all of it but am only looking to get $50 for the entire package.Tags: concealed carry bag - Bug out bag - Range bag - EDC Every day carry bag"

Optional Equipment 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel      MSRP  $1,999     The story of IWI US begins more than 80 years ago when Israel Military Industries (IMI) Ltd. began firearms production in Israel under the British Mandate in 1933. In the late 1950’s, IMI began collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with the goal of developing the most technologically advanced small arms systems based upon the demands of troops fighting in urban areas and harsh environments.  The unique combat conditions experienced by the IDF required a new paradigm in firearms development. The results included the most innovative and legendary firearm brands used by militaries, law enforcement agencies and security personnel around the world; UZI®, GALIL®, TAVOR®, X95®, NEGEV® and JERICHO®. In 2005 the Israeli government decided to spin off and privatize the small arms division of IMI and the new owners christened the new company Israel Weapon Industries (IWI) Ltd. The joint Research & Development (R&D) team of IWI and the IDF continue to develop small arms based upon the dynamic changes in real-world applications due to the ongoing threat of global terrorism. The intensive and continuous use of IWI’s product by the IDF and worldwide militaries such as Chile, Colombia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Georgia, Ukraine, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Nigeria and many more, enable the company to continue to innovate and optimize existing and new products. All of our weapon systems are in compliance with the most stringent military (MIL-STD) and ISO 9000.2008 standards.    IWI US, Inc., launched in 2012, brought the first civilian commercial versions of the Tavor SAR to the United States in the Spring of 2013. The Tavor achieved immediate acclaim, winning the prestigious ""Rifle of the Year"" award from American Rifleman Magazine. IWI US was also honored by the NASGW (National Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers) as inaugural winner of the 2014 Importer of the Year award and The Truth About Guns 2013 Rifle of the Year.  2014 brought the launch IWI US's Law Enforcement Division in the US and saw the adoption of the TAVOR SAR by the first US Law Enforcement agencies. 2015 brings the legendary Galil ACE pistols and rifles, UZI Pro pistols and Jericho pistols to the US civilian market along with the Negev LMG, UZI Pro SMG, CTAR and X95 for LE departments and agencies, greatly expanding the presence and commitment of IWI US to the American firearms marketplace. IWI US, Inc. is a member of the SK Group, a leading group of global Defense and Security companies that includes: Israel Weapons Industries, (IWI) Ltd.; IWI US, Inc.; Meprolight Ltd. (electro-optical systems); Camero Ltd.  (through-the-wall sensing systems), Israel Shipyards Ltd.  (ship manufacturing and repair); SIO LLC (armored vehicle sighting systems); Uni-scope Ltd.  (Optical periscopes, riflescopes and binoculars); and many more.  Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."

I recomend anyone who buys this firearm to replace the stock if possible (not a hard thing to do). Manufacture date: 1943. Drilled and tapped to accept a scope mount.

This is a 70's vintage shotgun, originally owned by my grandfather. It's been very well kept. When I got it about 20 years ago, I put the synthetic stock on it, and packed up the vented rib barrel, the removable chokes and the beautiful wood stock. Comes with both barrels, both stocks, chokes and a soft case. The gun has been used a bit, but it's never been abused and it's in incredible shape. I'd like to sell, but I'd entertain offers for a Ruger LC9s. I live in Port Orchard and work in Everett, so either location is fine with me. REDACTEDPlease don't contact me if you're a flake. *UPDATE* I had this gun sold for full price to a person claiming to be from Conneticut, named Eugene Turchin (Turchin Eugene 08 at outlook) however he seemed a little too shifty in his email communication and offered a money order. I initially suspected it was a scam, because an 870 isn't that rare, and no reason he needed to shop all the way in WA for a very common item. A quick Google search revealed several warnings about his name being involved in scams and it appears he may have a forged FFL. Seller beware."

This rifle was purchased in 1982 by my father (who's asked me to sell it for him), has only ever had a few hunded rounds down the barrel, and has been well taken care of its entire life.
The stock cover has been on the rifle most its life, and as a result, the stock is in mint/near mint condition.
This rifle comes with about 120 rounds of ammo, 4 30 round magazines, one 5 round magazine, a sling, and the stock cover.
This rifle is in excellent condition, and definitely aging better than most things from 1982.
Asking price is $1000. Contact me (Levi) through email. I will take down your driver license information just for personal record keeping, so you must be fine with that.Here is a link to a larger photo album of this rifle, since Armslist will only allow 4MB of pictures. http://imgur.com/gallery/vJU7n/comment/718270724/1?lr=REDACTED
