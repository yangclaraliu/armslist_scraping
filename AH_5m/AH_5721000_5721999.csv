Putting together a heavier bullet, a cleaner powder, a premium lube on the lead round nose projectile gives consistent velocities and harder hitting performance at subsonic, suppressor-friendly speed. The 42 grain lead round nose bullet is heavier than traditionally available rounds, but isn't so heavy as to cause instability. While ""harder hitting"" and .""22lr"" aren't usually associated together, steel silhouette shooters will appreciate the difference between a knockdown and a wobbling target that stays up!A designed velocity of 1020 feet per second ensures the heavier projectile remains at subsonic speed in most all firearms without resorting to anemic velocities. Their testing indicates that the ballistic coefficient for the 42gr GEMTECH bullet is approximately .125.Manufactured by CCI.500 Round Brick.YOU CAN BUY IT HERE:http://shop.redcircletactical.com/manufacturer.gemtech FOLLOW US:   FACEBOOK TWITTER GOOGLE+ YOUTUBEINSTAGRAM PINTEREST BLOGWEBSITE"

The factory letter states that it was shipped to the Canadian Government in June 1916 make this piece just over 100 years old. The letter shows that it came with checkered walnut gold medallion grips and a butt swivel. The letter will of course come with the gun. All the serial numbers match but the penciled serial number on the grips are no longer present after 100 years. I do believe they are original per the letter and how they fit to the gun. The gun probably spent most of its life in a holster and because of this the finish has a fair amount of wear and patina but no pitting or rust. The gun looks like the old war horse that it is. The timing and lock up are solid and would make a great addition to anyone's collection. $950 OBO

I am a disabled veteran who doesn't work. My $600 cost includes the shipping to you unless you live in Alaska or Hawaii, and then it's an extra $50 more. Mine is in a true museum quailty frame in perfect condition.  DISREGARD WHERE THE AD SAYS SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED. THE SHIPPING IS INCLUDED IN THE PRICE, and just 50 more if you are in AK or HI.As you may know, Major Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington was the Marine Corps top ace of World War II with 28 confirmed kills, and flew in the Pacific Theater of Operations.There were only 1,000 of these prints ever made,and you had to get one at an air show if you wanted his autographed signature, as Major Boyington signed these at the air shows he attended. These prints came out around 1980, and are signed by World War II U.S. Marine Corps Ace Major Greggory ""Pappy"" Boyington of the infamous ""Black Sheep Squadron"" of the Pacific Theater of Operations during WW II.  Major Boyington was the commanding officer of the VMF-214 in the Solomon Islands. He also became  the USMC's top fighter pilot with 28 confirmed kills. This print is from 1980. Boyington, born in Coeur D' Alene, Idaho in 1912, and died in 1988.   The VMF-214 shot down more enemy planes than any other US squadron in the south Pacific during  WW II. They were a force to be reckoned with.You might remember the television series called Black Sheep Squadron starring Robert Conrad as ""Pappy""  Boyington. It was a very popular show from 1976 - 1978, and Greggory ""Pappy"" Boyington was a technical advisor for this series, aiding Robert Conrad's role. He described the series as ""fiction based on reality"".  Subsequent networks picked up the series after 1978 and kept it on television through the mid 1980's. This print is most elegantly encased in a $400 museum quality frame and the paint matches the color of the fighter plane.  The last print that I am aware of sold for $450 just for the print only, not framed. These these prints increase in value over time, especially with Major Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington passing away in 1988. There's only a limited number of his autographs out there, and this is one of the very last ones that he ever signed. And not all the 1,000 prints ever got signed. The print is worth $850 plus shipping, however, I will take first offer of $600 or more.  That will give you some equity in the purchase, and these collectibles tend to grow in value over time.  And the frame is gorgeous, matching the plane, and the print is protected, by glass (or poly sheet covering).  I already have it boxed and ready to ship.  . Feel free to call or text me at REDACTED with questions. We'll work something out. ."

Since Im not in a big hurry to get rid of it, Im just trying to see what kind of trade deal I might be able to make. Im interested in 1911s, high quality 9mm, 300 BLK, Glocks, etc... Ill take a look at pretty much anything. I may even consider half trade half cash for the right deal. The pistol is in excellent condition and still has everything it came with new. I recently put a Hogue rubber grip on it, which feels awesome in the hand! Im also including a set of custom made american elk stag grips with brass hardware. Not only do they look cool, but theyre tough enough for everyday use. Im putting a fair trade value of $1,200 on the package. I may be somewhat flexible on trade value depending what you are offering. I will travel within the greater Jacksonville area and prefer trades with a ccw lisence holder (which I am).
