Just trying to trim down my collection, and while this is a cool historic gun, I don't really like shooting it. These rifles are getting harder and harder to come by, and keep going up in price with declining supply, so this is your opprotunity to get a highly sought after historical rifle that has the potential to increase in value. This is a very accurate gun even when shooting surplus ammo. Gun has been cleaned after every time it has been shot, and has a little wear and scratches that would be expected on a gun of this age. All serial numbers on the receiver, magazine, bolt, and butt plate are matching. It has probably had 100 or so rounds put through it, and never had any issues. Included in the sale is a hard case, bayonet, accessory pack with cleaning tools and oil can, and around 350 rounds of surplus ammo in a spam can. Cash only, not interested in trades, face to face, CWP preferred but not required, will not part out ammo and gun. This is a fair price if you look around at popular online dealers, or big box stores, and take into account there is no FFL transfer fee or tax, and you are getting a lot of ammo. Located in downtown Greenville.

Honor defense has put together one of the optimal configurations for concealed carry. The pistol holds 8+1 rounds in one magazine + 7 + 1 in the flush fitting magazine which I have added a Pearce grip extension. Also the pistol was just purchased within the last 3 months I had purchased two of them at that time because there was two different frames the regular which is the one you're looking at and the longer fist frame which was the initial one I wanted that is the one I am keeping for now and this one which only has 250 rounds through it is for sale or trade. Serious offers will be considered all others will be ignored. Contact me via email and I will expect photos with your offer if it is a trade. Depending on what you're offering I can add cash if it is a similar single stack pistol expect an even trade this is a high-quality firearms with a retail of $499 and I paid close to that retail price. If you have a Smith & Wesson Shield 9 millimeter I have an Apex Trigger to go with it that I would like to drop in so I will do an even trade on a Smith & Wesson Shield be it a regular model I already have the performance center so I do not need that. With this pistol the design speaks for itself it's similar to a Smith & Wesson Shield frame with a much more enhanced slide that is much smoother I must admit it seems like it runs on ball bearings the way the slide racks also it has a full Factory stippled frame and a cerakote job on the slide that is flawless also a polished Barrel to add a little bling done at Ramsdell Tactical.

So if you'd be interested in buying both the 870 and the 700 w/all the accessories below I'm asking $1200.00 (Cash only - Please read my terms below!) I have everything that came with both guns except their cardboard boxes, but have nice plano carry cases for each of them.  I also have a new never used herter's cleaning kit, cleaning patches, rem oil, and ammo for both guns.  (100 rounds of 7 1/2 shot for the Shotgun of Herter's Dove and Quail 25 Shotshells for 12 gauge and 60 rounds of Federal centerfire catridges for the rifle that are 150 grain).  Additionally I have some new never used snap caps for both the shotgun and the rifle as well to practice loading and unloading.  This could be a nice starter setup for you or something you know.  It also might make a nice discounted gift before hunting season hits.The reason I'm selling both is that I'm moving and need the money fast.  I didn't grow up using guns or hunting, but respect the culture of hunting and strongly believe in the right to bear arms.  Recently I took a firearm safety course and was planning to possibly joining a trap league at the gun club near where I live and took the safety course.  Unfortunately I'll be moving and simply need cash fast.  So the guns need to be sold to help with the move.When I purchased everything back in Feb. from Cabela's I spent just over $1800.  I know I'm not going to get new prices here.  What I'm asking is more than fair.Whomever buys the guns must have either a conceal and carry permit or a permit to purchase within the past year.  I will write up an itemized bill of sale for you to sign.  I'll also want to take photos of your license and your permit at the time of the sale.  That is non negotiable.  No permit and id = no saleI've never sold a gun before (and hope I never have to again) and just want to make sure I'm not selling to someone who is restricted from buying them.Once again Cash only.  As long as you have a valid id and either a conceal and carry permit or purchase to permit within the past year I can take a photo of and money we're in business."

The reason I'm selling both is that I'm moving and need the money fast.  I didn't grow up using guns or hunting, but respect the culture of hunting and strongly believe in the right to bear arms.  Recently I took a firearm safety course and was planning to possibly joining a trap league at the gun club near where I live and took the safety course.  Unfortunately I'll be moving and simply need cash fast.  So the guns need to be sold to help with the move.  When I purchased everything back in Feb. from Cabela's I spent just over $1800.  I know I'm not going to get new prices here.  What I'm asking is more than fair.  Whomever buys the guns must have either a conceal and carry permit or a permit to purchase within the past year.    I will write up an itemized bill of sale for you to sign.  I'll also want to take photos of your license and your permit at the time of the sale.  That is non negotiable.  No permit and id = no sale  I've never sold a gun before (and hope I never have to again) and just want to make sure I'm not selling to someone who is restricted from buying them.  Once again Cash only.  As long as you have a valid id and either a conceal and carry permit or purchase to permit within the past year I can take a photo of and money we're in business."

Currently theres an AK pistol listed in the state that has a front handgrip on the rail.........illegal........don't believe go by the local BATFE office and show it and ask if they like it2). The word is intent.  If you have an AR15 pistol upper and an AR 15 lower listed in the same listing or separate listings, just because the upper and lower are not attached doesn't make it legal 3). Read what the legal barrel lengths are for rifles and shotguns.  I saw an AR 15 with an advertised 14.5"" barrel stating the flash hider made it a legal 16"".  Well the flash hider was screwed on only.  An extension making a barrel the legal length has to be either welded 50% or more around the circumference or blind pinned and welded4). If your hobby is building rifles (or any firearm) cheap to sell for a profit you are selling in violation of federal law.  Some people sell an awful lot of ""custom"" AR15's aka I assembled it in my garage.Keep this in mind, if the BATFE ever decides to start cracking down some of you will need to lawyer up."

This has 20 rounds down the pipe. Had it two months. I've simply not found enough time to get out and do long range shooting. Perfect shape. Even still has the sticker on the stock. Is is currently outfitted with a vortex viper pst 6-24x50 FFP scope which is absolutely awesome. Month and a half old. Has an atlas bt10 bipod on it. Swivel stud/rail adapter. Will come with 20 once fired brass. Ive got $3100 total into the build. Cash price is $2500. I would consider selling without the scope. If interested. Ill hear out some partial trades. A higher end ar and cash or a marlin 1895 stainless and cash are most preferable. Can text me at REDACTED
