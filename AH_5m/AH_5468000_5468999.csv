Grip was not stippled.  Selling for $525 which is the value of the gun without the improvements.   Only reason Im selling is to fund a different project.  Sells with 3 mags in case.  Open to trades but only open to Upgraded M&P or XDM.

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date. Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. May ship with or without a lanyard loop.            SPECIFICATION     Chambering 9 mm Luger Magazine Capacity 10 Magazine Type Double Stack Frame Gray Polymer Grips Stippled Trigger Mech DA/SA Sights Fixed Three-Dot Barrel Cold Hammer Forged Barrel Length 3.8 in Weight 1.7 lbs Overall Length 7.2 in Height 5.3 in Safety Interchangeable Ambidextrous, Decocker/Manual Safety"
