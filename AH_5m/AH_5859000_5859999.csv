Gen2 is a dual ejector bolt, improved BCG( better balance for anti-tilt), new SIG logo on magwell, polished feed ramps, 4-way adjustable gas block, thicker straight .750"" barrel for accuracy, and tension screw in lower. Never a problem with this rifle and shoots really good and reliable, regardless of ammo used from 125gr SST Hornady Custom Lite my fiancé shot till felt recoil wasn't bad, and up to 180gr SP hunting ammo.     Selling it to build a rifle for F-class, PRS, BR, and other long range matches. Here's a list of everything I added and upgraded to that will go with the Sig716. Please no low ballers, and serious inquires only please. The rifle itself bone stock cost $1,900 plus tax.            ---Rifle cost $2,000+ tax alone! Added Lantac Dragon Muzzle break-($150)- properly timed by gunsmith-($25)- for correct recoil reduction and impulse. MagPul Enhanced Trigger guard -($15)-. Has Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40mm with BDC reticle-($185-$200)- for 308Win ballistics mounted in Nikon P-series rings-($50)- and is accurate. Hunted with it many times in 17-90 degrees and never fogged up. As to accuracy of BDC reticle, zeroed at 100 and killed a 275lb Boar with 1 shot and dropped where it stood at 135-140yards. Placed reticle a lil above the 200 circle and lil below the crosshair. Used 150gr BTHP ammo, cut open and heart was jello. The reticle has circles for 200, 300, 400, 500, & 600 & notches between circles for 250, 350, 450, & 550. Comes with a 2 sided 2 rifle guncase Pillar system by Plano-($50-$60)-, Butler Creek flip up scope covers-($25-$30)-, 3 Ergo rubber ladders-($40)- for rail when not using light & etc. for better grip and 1913 won't snag on anything. I cut out the area on them where QD points r so can use sling with them on & can't tell been cut out. MagPul AFG2 grip in FDE-($35)-, 1 or 2 20rnd Pmags & 4 10rnd Pmags-($15-$18 each)-, 3-5 boxes of 7.62x51 ammo-($50-$80)- & 3-4 boxes of mixed 308win amo like Hornady American Whitetail and some others-($55-$80)-, has flip up iron sights, sling that is 2-1 point changeable, will throw in a Mil-Comm cleaning kit i got since Sig recommends u use TW25b grease(what military use on HK416 & HK716) for the guns pistion system, buffer system, & other fast moving parts and use TW2500 oil for the trigger group, safety, and mag release-(cost me $60)-. I have used the Mpro7 grease and their CLP-X when forgot Mil-Comm and never had issues, in fact I've never had any issues from the gun and love it.     Again only selling to build a custom rifle in 6.5X47L. I'm also Selling a Patriot Ordinance Factory(POF) P415 with custom Cerakote camo job bcuz of that if looking for a 5.56x45(223Rem) pistion gun instead of 7.62x51(308win).      I'm asking $1,750 for everything and when u add it all up its about $2,750-$3,000 of stuff, so feel it's a fair price. I have more pictures if u r serious and want too see certain things.    I usually check my email but if u are serious about getting either rifle u can text me at REDACTED. I may not b able to text back right away because I'm looking for houses with fiancé who is also pregnant, but will get back asap. Thanks"

I paid $435 before tax for just the gun and sling. Will come with the nice sling and 25 rds of ammo. Less than 250rds through it. Very little wear and has a very nice recoil pad.
 
Has a 26 inch vent rib barrel with screw in choke system (i only have the choke that's in it) takes 2.75, 3, and 3.5in shells.  Text me at REDACTED $320, sorry no trades!"
