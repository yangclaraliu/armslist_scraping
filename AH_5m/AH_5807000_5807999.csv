Clean and in very good condition, not cobbled together from a box full of mismatched parts and a fake receiver. All receiver rivets are in excellent condition. Only 250-300 rounds fired. Shown with brand new UTG 4-16x40 scope. Model#: SCP-U4161AORGW Brand new condition, never been used, includes original box and everything that came in it. All numbers on the rifle match. Mags and scope numbers do NOT match, which is typical. Includes everything in the picture plus original LPS 4x6 scope and cover (no rubber eye boot), extra mag, soft case and approximately 500 rounds of 7.62x54R surplus ammo. These rifles are no longer imported and becoming increasingly rare and more expensive and this is one of the better ones. I hate to sell it but I need the money and $1,100 is a paltry sum for a rifle that averages in the $1,500 range and climbing.Be aware:* The UTG scope may or may not work with this rifle due to the generic mount positioning it slightly right of center. A proper mount designed specifically for PSLs is available from Kalinka if you want to use the scope on this rifle. This scope is included only because I have no use for it. Use it on this rifle or another one. It's pictured on the rifle because it's the picture I have.* Original LPS scope is missing one lockdown screw, which should be easily replaced at any hardware store, and may be rolling around in my bag of tricks but still locks down fine since each adjustment uses two lockdown screws.* Stock painted because the factory varnish-dunking method looks atrocious. Sanded, primed, sprayed, sealed and never fired since. Looks very good.$1,100 is already priced to sell and not negotiable under ANY circumstances. Cash only, no trades, will not separate, will not sell you just the ammunition, will not ship and you have to come and get it in Richmond County."

This is an NFA Device and requires a $200 Tax Stamp.  Stop by our store and we'll walk you through the process!  We will transfer this NFA Device anywhere in the country where it is legal.  Call us for more information.From Daniel Defense website:   The Daniel Defense DDM4ISR is our Integrally Suppressed Weapon System optimized for the .300 Blackout cartridge. Built around a 9”, Cold Hammer Forged barrel that is fluted along with a target crown and a standard pistol-length gas system, this versatile, high-performance rifle is the complete package, accurately delivering both subsonic and supersonic projectiles downrange with unrelenting reliability. Because the suppressor is an integral part of the barrel, this weapon system is ready for service right out of the box. There’s no attaching a suppressor and wondering if it’s mounted correctly and/or properly aligned. There’s no re-zeroing for suppressed vs. unsuppressed fire.  The DDM4ISR’s integral suppressor extends the barrel to an NFA-required 16 inches in length, so this platform is not classified as a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR) and therefore only requires a single tax stamp (for the suppressor). The suppressor’s lightweight outer tube is constructed of durable, heat-resistant metal alloys and coated with a protective high-temperature Cerakote-C finish, which is able of withstanding extreme temperatures and harsh environments. The suppressor is also user-serviceable, so its baffle core can be easily removed for periodic cleaning in order to maintain peak performance.   The DDM4ISR comes standard with Daniel Defense’s MFR XL 15.0 modular handguard, which features a continuous 1913 Picatinny rail on its top, for the mounting of iron sights or optics, and Keymod attachment points at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. This longer, multi-functional handguard, in conjunction with a Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip, make the DDM4ISR as ergonomic and maneuverable as it is versatile. A resilient, attractive Mil Spec + Cerakote finish not only protects this weapon system from the elements, it also adds to its overall aesthetics—so while you’re sending rounds down range; you’ll also turn a few heads.

Standard build features our extended-length MK10 handguard, which is made of G10 composite material and vented to aid barrel cooling with the top vents offset from the sight line to minimize mirage. Direct impingement operating system. The handguard features a removable, top-mounted Picatinny rail section measuring 14 inches long, which spans the length of the handguard to achieve a virtually seamless top rail from the back of the receiver to the front of the handguard. Furniture color is olive drab. Both barrel length options feature a 1:8.75 twist. GDMR weapons are tested for accuracy and perform at 1.0 MOA or better at 100 yards before being sold. This upper receiver assembly comes with one 10-round magazine. This unit is 100% complete and is compatible with any standard-specification lower receiver (no modifications required). With the addition of the 6.5 Grendel to the product line-up at Alexander Arms® in 2004, the history of no compromise design, engineering, and innovation continues. The 6.5 Grendel provides an extreme range capability for hunting, competition and tactical applications. These ranges are far beyond those previously achievable with the AR-15 style weapon. The 6.5 Grendel has the flexibility to move from lightweight varmint bullets in the 90-grain class, which offer superb accuracy for competition and small game shooting, to mid-weight, 108- to 120-grain competition bullets, and then on to 130- and 140-grain bullets, ideal for longer range, tactical shooting. The origin of the 6.5 Grendel may be traced back to the Soviet 7.62x39. This was modified for European competition, being necked down to form the 220 Russian. From here, Dr. Lou Palmisano and Ferris Pindel took the case and blew out the shoulder to create the 22 PPC and the 6mm PPC, which currently dominate bench rest competitions. In designing the 6.5 Grendel, the starting position was the PPC design, but it quickly became apparent that the caliber of the PPC was not as flexible as was needed. Early research with a wildcat 6.5 PPC also showed that the case lacked powder capacity, which, in turn, created pressure problems. The final 6.5 Grendel design draws on the PPC, but it is very much its own cartridge. The internal capacity was expanded by shifting the shoulder forward and the wall thicknesses in the neck and shoulder were increased to provide a more robust case capable of being fed within a semi-automatic rifle. Finally, the external taper of the case was adjusted for reliable feed in the magazine. The 6.5 Grendel is challenging the status quo in military and law enforcement units around the world. First unveiled in May 2003 at the Blackwater Training facility in North Carolina, the 6.5 Grendel out-shot the 7.62 NATO at range with half the recoil. Still supersonic at 1,200 yards, the 6.5 Grendel delivered superior external ballistics to the 7.62 NATO. Utter reliability, superior external and terminal ballistics than the current state of the art, outstanding accuracy in a lightweight M16/AR-15 platform it is what appears to be the pinnacle for what may be achieved in the M16/AR-15 chassis. The 6.5 Grendel is not a series of compromises, but rather the perfect marriage of mechanical function, internal, external and terminal ballistics all working in harmony. Shooting a 123-grain Lapua Scenar with a ballistic coefficient of .547 and a muzzle velocity of 2,600 FPS delivers outstanding accuracy out to 1,200 yards. At 600 yards, tennis ball size targets are no match for this flat-shooting round. For extreme accuracy, formidable terminal ballistics and long range applications, the 6.5 Grendel from Alexander Arms is unbeatable. Compared to the 5.56 NATO, the 6.5 Grendel, with roughly twice the lead mass, gives you the potential for twice the mass of fragments. If maximum fragmentation is coincident with maximum temporary cavity, the terminal ballistics are quite convincing, all in a package that shoots flatter with 50% less felt recoil than 7.62 NATO M80 ball."

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front as it makes it alot easier, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??   Trades in order, semi-auto rifles, pistols, revolvers, tactical shotguns, lever guns and bolt-guns.  Trades:  
Stripped AR lowers in all brands, depending on your value, parts kits(no std. triggers needed), nice triggers, buffers, tubes, springs, stocks and rails.  FosTech Echo or maybe the Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger.  Will consider complete lowers and rifles too, depending, I can usually build nicer ones much cheaper.
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $30 more.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
