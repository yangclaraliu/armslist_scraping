It has a 3"" barrel with a full underlug and extractor rod shroud. It wears a factory Uncle Mikes Combat Grip with round butt, which makes for excellent ergonomics, lower felt recoil, and enhanced concealability. Red ramp front sight, white outline adjustable rear sight, and smooth combat trigger. SA trigger is glass rod crisp, and DA trigger pull is very, very smooth. Manufactured from 1997 to 2002, the 696 ""no dash"" was the first iteration, with hammer mounted firing pin (changed to frame mounted on the 696-1), no dreaded S&W frame lock (added with the 696-2), case hardened trigger and hammer (changed to MIM later). Thus, this first, no-dash model is most desirable for shooters and collectors alike, the trigger is excellent? Weight unloaded is 36 ounces. For me, 696 felt recoil is way better than with an L-frame .357 magnum. This is a fantastic and powerful concealed or open carry handgun that should last several lifetimes.

I just started to an ar build so I'm getting rid of this because I don't have any need or room for two rifles, this ak shoots great and has given me no problems, on top of that it's practically brand new, it only has 200 rounds thru it and I have another 400 rounds of wolf 762x39 that will go with it. The bipod is also included and will also come with a front sight adjustment tool, I'm asking 850obo which is about 150 less than I bought it for just 5ish months ago and I have about another 200 in parts between the master mount and bipod/mlok rail.i can only post one picture so if you'd like more just text me REDACTED5"

I think it came off a Mossberg cantilever 12ga 500. The scope is in good shape and has had only light use, probably about 5 slugs shot using it. Still alot of life left in it so it would be a shame and wasteful to throw it out or forget about it. It appears to be waterproof and maybe light fog too. The scope looks new, it has clear clean glass, and all functions work. It comes with rings and lens covers. I guess it has what I'd call a field or ringed duplex reticle. It would be a good light use slug gun scope, a .22 scope, or great for a young shooter.The only catch is its first come first serve and it must be picked up from me in Monroe."
