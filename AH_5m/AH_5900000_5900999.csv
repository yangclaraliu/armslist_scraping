Only 2 owners in 42 years, it was 21 years old when I bought it from the original owner and I've had it for 21 years now. It's a super smooth target pistol that has been used for Bullseye and Falling Plates and most recently for my sister in law to practice for her concealed carry permit. It's impossible to say how many rounds have gone through it, but you can tell it's been loved and respected. It looks great and works as smoothly as 2 pieces of glass with a thin layer of oil between them. In the 21 years I've owned it, I've used MANY different brands of ammo and NEVER found it to be finicky, unlike the fancy models often are. If you want a QUALITY CLASSIC that you can shoot as well as display, this one will be easier to maintain in the very nice condition it's in than the Rugers, Brownings, and Colts that often require a trip to the shop to get back together and functioning properly IF you clean them. This can be stripped, cleaned and put back together before a Ruger AMT, or Browning can be taken apart ! The PRICE IS FIRM.

Fires great and was serviced by a gunsmith shortly after I purchased it years ago to maintain and ensure it was in working order. Fires 5.45x39 ammo, a smaller Russian round. But don't let that fool you. These rounds are sharp tipped, light weight, and high velocity developed for the AK-74 platform.

This in uncomfortable for some but makes a for very quick draw. This is a strong gun but light for the caliber making it easy to carry but stiff on the recoil. The recoil is manageable, however, if you keep the bullet weights at 200 grains or less. CCI-Speer and I believe Hornady make premium grade defensive ammo suitable for this gun in 200 grain and 165 grain jacketed hollow point respectively. I carried the CCI because they come in the ""short barrel"" design, using a special propellant which burns more efficiently than standard canister powders out of a short barreled handgun.

I've had it for a while and I've carried it maybe a handful of times. It's been in the safe for the past 4 months as I still use a 1991 for my EDC so i figured I'd sell it to fund another SBR build.The gun looks brand new, no scratches or dings.

Optics Description (Leupold Mark AR MOD 1 3-9x40mm)
            The Leupold® Mil Dot and Tactical Milling Reticle (TMR®) employ a system based on the subtension of one milliradian (mil) from the center of one dot (Mil Dot) or full hash mark (TMR) to the center of the next dot or full hash mark. This subtension also applies from the center of the reticle to the center of the first dot or full hash mark in any direction. The TMR reticle offers areas of .2 mil subdivisions to precisely measure the common one-meter target quickly from 500 to 1,000 meters and beyond. When the illumination is activated, portions of the reticle will illuminate to provide better contrast in poorly lighted conditions between the target and the precise position of the aiming point."
