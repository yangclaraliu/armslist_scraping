Built from the ground up, this rifle has been engineered to help you harvest that trophy with the precision and dependability you expect from Daniel Defense.   At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. The Ambush is fed with an optimized bolt carrier group featuring a redesigned geometry and a new extremely slick, low-friction coating to ensure smooth, reliable feeding. As a sportsman, you have an obligation to take clean shots on your game, and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger gives you the advantage you need to deliver a precise, on-target shot that’ll bring down that elusive trophy you worked so hard to get in your sights.  All Daniel Defense products carry a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects in original materials and workmanship. If your Daniel Defense product shows evidence of such defects, Daniel Defense will make every accommodation to fix, repair, or replace your product in the most expeditious manner possible. Daniel Defense does not warranty products or damage caused to our products by the correct or incorrect installation of other manufacturer’s products.

Blue with uncheckered wood stock, it has a scope mount but the scope has been misplaced or sold. I probably shot a couple of boxes of ammo through it, but I doubt that it's seen 150 rounds. Condition is like new, the box is gone. Ready to shoot now or spend some $$ and build yourself a custom rig. Paint it black and call it ""tactical"" or pink and call it ""sweet"".

I have a used and weathered 94 for trade. Now since everyone seems to be new to all of this here goes. This gun has not been someone's safe queen. It is rough with some scratches and pitting. This was someone's  hunting rifle or truck gun. She isn't a pretty one. You don't have to worry about leaving marks on her when you take her with you for whatever it is you need to do. The action is smooth and everything works as it should. The rifling looks as it should. There isn't any damage to the barrel. There is water and rust damaged to the buttstock. You can get new ones on line but really who cares. Just throw some kind of recoil pad on the end and no one will ever see it. Not with all that being said please don't ask for a picture then tell me it looks like shit or it is to rough. This is a work gun not a trophy to just look at. Also I say trade I don't need your money.
