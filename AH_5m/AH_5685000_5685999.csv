This is a Marlin mid 19th century remake of the classic and iconic M1 Carbine! Chambered in 22lr this gun was produced for commercial and training use situations but posted near perfect size and operation comparison to its similar larger caliber modeled after counterpart. This gun was in very bad shape when I bought it and went through heavy cleaned,wood working, and re-staining, etc so that it could be turned back into its former glory. This is a Frankenstein(frankengun) Gun when it comes to its assembly! The upper bolt,barrel and stock are from the Marlin Model 99m1 and lower breach/bolt, and magazines come from a model 989m2. The 989m2 was box feed where in that the 99m1 was tube fed, causing the mag well to have been manually cut. The gun has been safety checked by a certified gunsmith prior to firing. Comes with WW2 era tan Sling, Faux Fur lined era carrying bag, and double ammo butt stock pouch! With an original style M1 oiling tool to boot. This gun works like a charm!
