I'm somebody, I'm somewhere, and to answer that question its the venerable Mossberg 500 chambered to accept 3.5"" shells. A little about this badboy: 28"" barrel so you can eliminate the threat from a distance. How far? SO many yards. More yards than an 18"" barrel. This beast has taken literally POUNDS of dove. I've never had the pleasure of using this glorious thunderstick against a gobbler, but I did get to use it to scare a jive turkey out of my garage.A little about this bad boy: - HiViz orange fiber optic front with brass bead rear for tactical fowl acquisition and elimination - Nickel bolt slide and brass trigger so you can look good while providing for your family - Elastic shotshell saddle because frugal and practical go hand in hand - Much like that freaky girlfriend you had in college(the kind of ugly one you didn't tell anyone about), you can choke it and squeeze a hot load through a tight holeIts as clean as a truck gun can be. No major dents/dings/scratches, and bluing is in good shape. Mossberg went all out and outfitted it with the least flashy walnut available. Its a Mossberg thru and thru so its kind of finnicky with ammo, particularly Winchester black box(I've fed her a diet of Fiocchi and she loves it). I'm open to all manner of trades, I also happen to like money."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! 6 1/2 inch barrel Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolverComes with both the 22lr and 22magnum cylinders.  Also comes with a leather holster."

It has a 16"" cryogenically treated barrel, upgraded ambi safety, winter trigger guard, and a Rock River 2 stage Trigger. It has approx. 300 rounds through it. It is the Monolithic Rail Platform, and is has a piston driven bolt. It comes with the torque wrench and socket used for the quick change barrel. This weapon can be changed to several different calibers by removing one bolt, and loosening one other to remove the barrel.  It is very accurate, and operates flawlessly. I'm only selling because I coyote hunt, and have decided to go to a longer barrel AR, better suited for hunting. I also have the factory iron sights and owners manual. The scope currently on the gun is a Leupold VX-R 1.25-4 fire-dot reticle on a Leupold mount. I'll sell it either way, with or without. Without the scope, $2000, with the scope $2400. I believe I also have the original box. The bi-pod is not included. You can text me @ 440-666-895o, or call and leave a message. I have more pics of the gun and some targets. Text me for more pics. Will consider trades or partial trades, but please understand that I don't shoot junk. Thanks for looking."

Though I don't think this has ever been fired, if it has the round count would certainly be below 100 rounds.  This is an awesome handgun and has been the crown of my 1911 collection.  It has a flush cut reverse crowned barrel which not only enhances accuracy but also gives the gun a very sharp look. The pictures also show the gun with both black G10 starburst grips and dark cocobolo starburst grips. Wilson's Supergrade class pistols are the finest the company makes and will please even the most discerning buyer. This pistol comes not only with a carry case, all original paperwork, and all the standard upgrades that come with the supergrade pistols but also includes a host of extra items that I've accumulated for this handgun. The quality and craftsmanship of this gun cannot be overstated.  Wilson has put out an unrivaled product with the Supergrade line of 1911s and this one in particular has recieved excellent care. This gun comes with a brand new WC extractor with serations on the back to match the back of the slide.  Also included are a WC bullet proof sear spring, 3 magazines, and a new WC Ejector.  The second pair of black G10 grips is also included.  Upgrades include the oversized magazine release, a flared magwell, and a flush cut and reverse crowned barrel. The gun also has a flush cut reverse crowned barrel for accuracy, fewer snags, and asthetics.  It also has a narrow full size guide rod and a flat wire recoil spring. This gun was completely hand fit and constructed by Wilson Combat in 1994.  My father was the origional owner and did not shoot any of his collectable firearms, and since he gave me this piece 8 years ago, I have kept the gun well cleaned and maintained but still have not fired the weapon.  Just to be on the safe side, I noted above  that the round count is 100 rounds or less.  Please let me know if you'd like more pictures or if you have any questions.  I'm happy to meet to let anyone interested take a look at the gun in person as well as the pictures really do not do it justice."

I am throwing in a tactical case as well.Since this is made from CMMG parts and Anderson, I listed this as a CMMG model.I do have one issue with it though. When I sold my other 556 AR I realized I had the enhanced firing pin in it when it belonged to this one. So it will need an enhanced firing pin which is longer so that you can shoot the hard primer Tula steel case ammo out of it. That firing pin is less than 15.00 So brass ammo is what it will shoot currently."
