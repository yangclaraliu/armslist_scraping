Not sure what that would be until I see it. But 1st the disclaimer: Trade value is going to be $800ish. Before you gasp, and say 'WTF""? do some research. Sure it's only an SKS, but this isn't a typical SKS. Navy Arms imported SKS rifles back in the day from Norinco. They configured them for commercial use, targeting hunters, ranch foks etc. They introduced their models accordingly. This one was what they called the ""Cowboy Companion"". Their target audience was the Ranch owners to use as a Coyote ranch rifle. They shortened them to the Para length, clipped the bayo and filled the bayo slot, mounted a unique scope mount on them and offered them with or without a scope. They also offered an optional 5 round magazine. The 5 round magazine was not a very popular option resulting in a pretty rare option on them these days. This one has that rare 5 round optional magazine. The Scope mount on these are very rare because many took them off and put on a better scope, and tossed the original, resulting in a very rare mount system today. This mount would cost you almost as much as a standard SKS assuming you can even find one. The scope, not ""as"" rare as the mount, is also a sought collector scope in it's own right. Basically, this mount and scope would cost north of $400 on it's own. The rifle, alone between $400-$500. Finding them together as a correct package is a rarity today. If you do the research, you will find that $800 although nuts, isn't a stretch for a clean, correct, with correct scope and mount Cowboy Companion Navy Arms SKS variant. This is an investment rifle. Now, that said, don't believe what I am typing, go do the research and the math. It is, what it is. ;)"

I didn't go overboard, but I certainly chose to go light when the option was there. When holding other AR's that my buddies have, this thing feels like a toy by comparison. This is still a solid rifle. I picked up a polymer lower to accomodate my objective, but also picked up a complete aluminum lower in case I was dissatisfied with the poly lower. So far, I have zero complaints about the polymer lower. The fit between the upper and the lower is tight, no wiggle when reefed on. This deal will come with both lowers. Below is a parts list and links to all the hardware on the sites from which they came. All in all, I am finding that I am just not the AR type. I am more of an AK guy.
