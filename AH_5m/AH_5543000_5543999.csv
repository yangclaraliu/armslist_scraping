Ad will be taken down once sold.I recently aquired a P938 (9mm) so this P238 (.380 ACP) has to go! It is in excellent shape with approx 50 rounds through it. Shoots softer than the average plastic framed .380's. True night sights (tritium & fiber optic combined) that glow BRIGHT with no light source needed. These P238's have features that most pocket .380's don't, like last round hold open, thumb safety and a short, crisp, single action (sweet!) trigger just like a 1911 has. You can carry it ""cocked and locked"". The extended magazine allows for a total capacity of 8 rounds and lets you get a full grip!Will trade WITH CASH FROM YOU for a 9mm pistol or a 1911 in 9mm or .45. Will also respong to cash offers that are not low ball. This is not a Ruger LCP or other lower end .380, so please consider that when making an offer.If trading, your trade must include at least $100 cash with it. Sorry, but not interested in rifles, shotguns, Taurus, Canik. Only 9mm pistols or 1911's. Thanks!By the way, the gun, one magazine and a hard case are all that is included. No papers, extra mags or anything else included. Thanks!"

The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state. REDACTEDKristi"

The upper is on a DPMS lower with a Magpul STR stock, factory installed JP Enterprises (sent to them, one of the top dogs in 3 gun competition) single stage 3.5# trigger, Magpul grip, and Magpul BAD lever, and Magpul sling mount.Advanced Armament has a PDF that wouldn't attach here listing the life of components of their upper. It lists the barrel life at 20,000 rounds for military and 35,000 for hard abuse or competition. Recreational, which 98% of us are, is 50,000 rounds. This upper has about 400 rounds through it. That is less than 1% of it's barrel life. AAC uppers command a premium for a reason. The only reason I'm selling this rifle is to fund an AAC 300 BLK SBR rifle. This AAC upper is amazing. It has a KAC URX 3.1 rail, NiB bolt carrier group, and 16"" nitride barrel. It is not a franken upper, it is a complete upper from AAC. Extras included in the price are 2 pmags (your choice of FDE or black 30 round) and 2 boxes of Remington 125 Match ammo. (more is available for purchase, I just don't need it as I handload) Also included is the Magpul RSA sling mount. I'm into this rifle over $1700 (without scope and mount). I'll take $1200 for the entire rifle and Midwest Industries flip up sights (coated FDE with Alumahyde ii) and extras mentioned above.  That's $90 in extras for ammo and magazines. In the picture, there are other extras that are not included but if you really want it kept as pictured, we can make a deal. The reason these are not included are because I want them for the new rifle and if sold, I would have to replace for full value so there is no point taking a loss on these extras just to buy them again. These extras, NOT INCLUDED, is the KAC panel kit for the URX 3.1 rail, KAC vertical grip, American Defense 30mm scope mount and Primary Arms 1-6 power scope. THE STREAMLIGHT TLR WEAPON LIGHT AND FLASH HIDER ARE NOT FOR SALE, IT IS A SUPPRESSOR MOUNT FOR MY CAN. Threads are 5/8x24 which is what .30 cal muzzle devices are threaded for.

Limited production model, 3,000 rifles and 3,000 carbines were made in 1986 and 1987. This carbines serial number is 011xxPR6C7. It was made in 1987 (PR date code). The finish and wood are 99% condition. One small scuff on the clear coat on the right rear of stock (see picture). It does not have a tang safety. The gun appeared unfired when examined, but the bore had some spots of green copper fouling so it was cleaned. After cleaning there is some discoloration of the bore and very minor pitting in the grooves towards the end of the barrel. I would rate the bore a 8.5 out of 10 (on a 0 to 10 scale, 10 being perfect, 0 being unserviceable). There also is a tiny spot of discoloration on the bottom of the chamber. See pictures for details. We check our guns carefully and do our very best to grade our guns honestly. This gun would be perfect for someone who wants to shoot or hunt with one of these finely made firearms but doesn't want to pay the new in box price.

These projectiles are capable of going through 3/8 inch steel at 300 yards! Regular green tip penetrator ammo is only capable of going through 3/8 inch steel at 100 yards. As you can see in the picture the actual steel penetrator is massive compared to the M855 green tip. By weight, the penetrator steel core is nearly double as compared to the green tip. These bullets are pulled with no pull marks and are overall in great shape. These have not been available to the civilan market and they are still not for sale. A few years back I was able to buy some and have since decided to sell a portion of them. These are $4 per projectile as you cannot find them anywhere and they are never expected to be sold to the public. $3 a piece if you buy 50 or more.This is just the projectile NOT loaded ammo.Please search Youtube for what this ammo does to level III body armor. It blows right through it unlike regular green tip. This is the real deal."

Whoever Sporterized this rifle seems to have done a nice job and in some of the reading that I have done Sears Sporterized some of these Rifles pre WWII.
