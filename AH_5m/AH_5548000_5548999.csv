The Jump Stimulation* is a great feature for training methods that involve jumping frequently between two different stimulation levels. As before, you can set a level of intensity to the Nick or Continuous Stimulation buttons that is appropriate for training your dog. The Jump Stimulation button allows you to set a second, self-programmed stimulation level higher or lower than your normal intensity level setting. Applying a correction at the right intensity level quickly and timely is paramount in dog training with e-collars. With the Jump Stimulation feature, you won't have to have to fumble around with the stimulation setting at the time that the correction is needed, so the chances of applying a stimulation too late or at the wrong intensity level are virtually eliminated. The Jump Stimulation is also useful in emergency or dangerous situations when your dog is excited and not responding to the normal stimulation level. If you do not have time to increase the intensity level in these situations, the Jump Stimulation is a fast and convenient way to get your dog's attention before the situation gets out of hand. Another great feature is Rise Stimulation*. The Rise Stimulation button continuously increases the stimulation level until the button is released. This allows you to hold the Rise button until you notice a response from the dog, essentially allowing the dog to choose the appropriate level of stimulation. Prior to the Rise Stimulation, dog trainers had to guess at the correct stimulation level for individual dogs. With Rise Stimulation, the dog responds to a level that matches his temperament. All SPT 2400 series have completely waterproof and rechargeable (Ni-MH batteries) transmitter and collar units, an easy-to-read LCD screen with a low battery indicator, and a 2400 yard (1.3 mile) range. Also included on all SPT 2400 series are the Jump, Rise, Nick, and Continuous Stimulations, as well as Vibration. The SPT 2430 and 2432 (2-dog system) add a beeper/trainer to the already feature-loaded SPT 2400 series.

Now I've been on armslist for a long time so I fully expected the usual lowballing, bashing and just general assholery that comes along with it. Whats most disheartening about this last experience is this. I'm a III%er. I was selling this to fund true battle grade up grades for my duty arm. The difference would have been used to donate water for the kids in Flint MI who truely need pure clean drinking water, and food for local homeless vets that are on hard times. The upgrades for the weapon would have been used to protect you and your family as well as my own. We have no outside funding, no colledge funds, no recgonition whatsoever. Not that that's why I do it. What have my efforts gotten me? Low balled, talked to with extreme disrespect, and one flat out no show. It's all good though. If I recgonize you when the promised attacks begin from the IS begin, you had better hope I don't recognize you while they behead you, take your son for slave labor and rape your wife and daughter, because I'll let them finish before I stop them from doing the same to your neighbor. I'm sure you bunch dripping twats will flag this before morning but I hope this is read by enough i f you to realize one thing. Not everyone is here for the purposes of greed. The projects some of us speak of as the reason for selling our arms are to benifit others, not total self centered interest. I really believe most of you on this site have become nothng more than total self absorbed trash. If that weren't true I'd have met at least one person with some integrety but that has not happenend in years. I was never so sure that the fate of this country was nothing less than doomed before I dealt with people here since the Sandy Hook tragety. People talk about how the leftists exploited that situation, their efforts pale in comparison to the way you snakes have acted."

I purchased this handguard brand new from Joe Bob Outfitters and have only been to the range three times since it's installation. When installing the rail, the anti-rotation tabs that fit between the points of the barrel nut bent slightly. After researching, I've found that this is a common problem when you torque the handguard past 35 inch pounds. This does not affect the integrity or function of the rail. The picatinny lines up perfectly with the top of the receiver. I have had zero issues with this rail. Included with the rail is the barrel nut, the barrel nut wrench, and the paper insert that came in the original packaging.

Perfect sized gun to carry unbelievable how big of a caliber can run through this gun without any problems. Springfield Armory won last years longevity competition over every gun that wanted to try to compete including glock, I will buy Springfield everyday over glock It is the best manufactured pistol in the worl in my opinion and look it for yourself and you will understand why. Ive always owned springfields best grip, Safety on back of the grip is best design I could think of and look at the insides of this gun compared to a glock and you will see the difference in the reason at 1200 continuos rounds why the glock melted inside and this gun carried itself to well over 2200 because the slide and spring rod are made of steal in the XDS and the glock is all polymer which is good stuff but will give out and start to melt before steal. Just a few reasons why if your looking for a carry gun that has the most stopping if not reversing power of a 45 acp here it is 3.3 inch barrel and will fit in your back pocket.

This is an all factory original machine gun that was built by Colt in Hartford, CT in the late 1970's. This was sold to the Federal Government, and the widely accepted story is that these were issued to the Department of Energy (DOE) to protect nuke sites across the country. A small number of these were sold to civilians in the late 1980's.As you can see, this was a carried weapon and has some great patina and lots of character. It is so hard to find a M16 with honest wear - it is actually much harder than finding a new one. This rifle mechanically is in excellent condition including the bore. It appears to have been fired very little. One of the things that attracts me to this rifle is with the US Property markings, it is 'the very thing' for so many different military builds that you could do, like a MK18 Mod 0 build, or a MK12 SPR build, this is the exact lower - it wouldn't even be a clone."

I want to fund a couple of fairly expensive projects (Larue OBR 308), so I have decided to thin out my collection a bit.The rifle accepts a lot of standard AR-15 ugrades such as triggers, grips, stocks, and anything keymod for the rails. Complete rifle disassembly is nearly identical to an AR-15 or AR-10, and thus is very easy to clean and maintain. The barrel has a low-pro gas block and free-floating hand-guard for improved accuracy (and it looks good). Additional details from the CMMG website:The Mk47 MUTANT is a new platform for 2015, combining the accuracy and modularity of the AR-15 with the reliability of the AK47. The Mk47 features all new mid-sized receivers based on our Mk3 platform carved from billet 7075-T6 aluminum. The Mk47 was designed to harness the power and reliability of the 7.62x39mm cartridge utilizing a robust bolt also based off our Mk3.

This is the 2 1/4"" barrel version. The cylinder capacity is five rounds. This is a handy little snub nose that conceals very well, and has enough weight to handle full power .357 rounds. The gun does have some cosmetic wear from carry use.The grip was replaced with a wood Hogue grip, which has added a little extra length, making the revolver more comfortable to fire in my opinion. I still have the factory grip as well. They are easily swapped out if you would like to go back to the factory grip.
Included with the purchase is a Theis IWB holster made from horse hide. The holster is extremely comfortable, I'd highly recommend Theis holsters to anyone. Also included is a HKS speedloader.
The only reason I am selling is that this gun has become a bit of a range toy, so I would like to finance another purchase with it. I'm not interested in trades. I am selling everything for $515. Buyer must show vaild TN DL on purchase and be willing to sign Bill of Sale. Thanks for your interest."
