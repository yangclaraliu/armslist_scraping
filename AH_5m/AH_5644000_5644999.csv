It's probably the best all around pistol to have if you can only have one. However, I've decided to get a full-sized 1911 for the range and carry something smaller for convience. It's been meticulously maintained and will come with original Glock case, mag loader, etc. It has three factory 15-round magazines and one Magpul 17-round magazine. I would prefer to trade for a 1911 or a Glock 43, but will sell for $650 or best offer. CCW guys/gals prefered, must be legally allowed to purchase a handgun in the state of Ohio. Thank you."

It was manufactured by Walther/Ulm but stamped and assembled by Manurhin in Bourzwiller/France. Beacause of post WWII/Cold War laws, West Berlin Police were not allowed to purchase ""German"" weapons, hence the ""diversion"" via Manurhin. It carrys the West/Berlin police stamp (a ""rosette"") on the lhs of the triggerguard. It also carrys another stamp (""crossed cannons"") on the rhs of the slide. The meaning of that stamp is unknown - maybe Portuguese? This P1 was sold in between 1983 and 1987 on the commercial market."

They went to great lengths too. Mailed me a phoney check from Maryland via Priority Mail. (But said they resided in Florida) On a credit union in Pennsylvania. The check looked real, but was bogus. (My bank called the credit union) They started texting me from Minnesota. Offered me an extra $100 to hold the rifle for them. Said their FFL would come pick the gun up for them. The check was for much more than the agreed price, so I could pay their FFL for his trouble. Then wanted me to send the balance via Western Union to a woman in Washington State. (Their FFl was now a woman) The Washington Zip Code was actually in Mexico. They wanted me to wire the money via the 10 min. transfer process. (they would cover the fee) They then panicked when I told them I had used the proper zip code for the city in Washington. and had lost the receipt with the code needed to pick up the funds from Western Union, but that they could just show their ID. ( I was having a little fun at this point) Finally, I confessed that I was screwing with them, we exchanged a few ""well wishs"" which ended with an implied threat of death in my sleep. This time they were in Alabama, but couldn't do a FTF transfer. Their inital contact e-mail was virtually identical to the first. I knew who I was dealing with this time, so we only exchanged a few ""pleasantries""    Follow Armslists advice and do Face to Face transfers of weapons only.    Most folks are good, but there are some real crooks out there these days.    I've sent some parts and other things as far west as California before.    But heck, I know I can trust me.    Use your common sense, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.    Happy 4th of July!"

This is gear that I don’t Have to get rid of, I’m just trying to thin out a little and I am willing to trade for the items listed below. I am by no means desperate to get rid of this gear, so please keep that in mind when making offers or suggesting “alternate” trade items. The backpacks alone would sell for over $400 without pouches or any extras, so I feel as if I am well below market pricing in my asking price.
Possible Trades
