I'm selling only because I have some expenses I have to meet.  My price is firm at $500 , which is a good price for this shotgun.  (I'm just trying to break even).  I have more photos saved in my computer and can email them if requested."

I did try CCI 29 grain HV 22 lr, but it caused FTE's and ""stove pipes"", so I stuck with 40 grain only. Taurus does not recommend ""hyper velocity"" so I NEVER PUT THAT AMMO through this pistol. The sights on these pistols are low so there is difficulty adjusting for elevation, but after a few rounds through it, you'll get familiar how to aim on target. Its a great ""pocket pistol"" for secondary backup. I bought the pistol new and it came with one magazine and security key. I'm including a second 8-round magazine and a pocket holster. Its in great condition. I always cleaned and lubricated after each use. I'm selling this to get a compact 9 mm for CCW. Bill of sale with valid TDL and over 21  years of age required.

Cold Hammer forging significantly increases the barrel life and rigidity, makes the metal more dense, and realigns the structure of the metal around the twist of the barrel. This causes the zero to wander less when the barrel is hot, so don't be afraid to do some mag dumps. BCM is a fantastic company, if youre not familiar with them then spend 5 minutes on google. Barrel has had max 500 rounds through it, then I built another and stopped taking this one to the range. It has been painted, but you or I could strip the paint very easily with Acetone. Already drilled for taper pinsAny questions just ask!"
