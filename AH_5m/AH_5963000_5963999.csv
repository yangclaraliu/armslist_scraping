Easy fix, part number 83710-17150 costs around $70. Because of this the speedometer stopped counting the miles so it still reads 133,*** but in fact its closer to 135-140K. The speedo will start counting again when the cable is replaced. There is a walkthrough online of how to fix it but armslist won't let me put the website in my ad so you can find it looking at my craigslist ad or contact me for the link. -driver's seat has a tear in the fabric on the left side. -T-Tops have a slow leak. -Could use a new shift boot -door key wholes are stiff, could use servicing/lubricating -air conditioning needs to be recharged"

I assembled this item with a 55 gallon drum, 3 legs, internal funnel, a solar panel, 12 volt battery, and motor. This unit includes a varmint guard. The unit is in very good to excellent condition. Included are some pins to anchor it to the ground. I can not say how they hold up to wild hogs pushing on it. I used this feeder for some protein pellet prototype work. The unit comes complete ready to fill with feed and start broadcasting. I'll be glad to show you it operates prior to disassembly. All components were purchased from West Texas Feeder Supply and features there timer called ""The Timer."" It is a very nice, easy to set up timer. Will dispense multiple times a day. For more timer info go to their website. I can be reached at 405 455 nine zero nine eight, $100.00 Firm. Thanks for looking"

Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18""
Quality stamped AK47 with side mount, nicer trigger than the G2 and the Zhukov folding stock is a plus.   
Maybe a 16"" .223/5.56 or 7.62x39 with folding stock or 7.62x39 pistol(10""+/- barrel) with folding arm brace. Tavor maybe, but prefer one with upgraded trigger.  A couple Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" models only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber, can always use more 5.56 Federal.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Value needs to equal cash price.Aimpoint, EoTech G33 or Vortex magnifiers, 2-PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 reticle, 7.62x39 or similar 1-6x.Ftf in Garland area, will ship for $45 more overnight to your FFL.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"
