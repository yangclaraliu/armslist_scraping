300 BLK Ballistic Reticle w/ Thumb Screw Mount
The Trijicon 1-6x24 VCOG (Variable Combat Optical Gunsight) is a rugged variable powered riflescope that accommodates close quarter battle (CQB) and long distance marksmanship. It features superior glass quality and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The bullet drop compensating and ranging reticles allow for the shooter to quickly and accurately estimate range and apply the correct hold. The first focal plane reticle allows the subtensions and drops to remain true at any magnification. With a forged 7075-T6 aircraft-aluminum-alloy housing, the VCOG is an exceptionally durable and nearly indestructible sighting system. Robust enough for any application, the VCOG utilizes a single AA battery, commonly found across the globe and offers 6 adjustable brightness settings for the LED reticle. When powered by a lithium AA battery (like the one provided), it boasts a considerable battery life of 700 hours at setting 4 (constant on). An integrated dial fin allows easy rotation through the magnification range and a constant eye relief means no head or stock position adjustments are needed. Waterproof to 20 meters (66 ft.)."

From the legendary ACOG® family of products, the LED ACOG is the first to offer user-selectable brightness controls. Users can select from six adjustable brightness levels with an ""off"" between each setting, allowing the operator to determine how much to illuminate the reticle - even in transitional lighting. Powered by a single AA battery, the LED ACOG can run for over 12,000 continuous hours (on setting #4). The body has been optimized by moving the RMR mount forward to maximize its performance in conjunction with the ACOG. Like all ACOG models, it is forged from rugged 7075-T6 aircraft-aluminum, resulting in a nearly indestructible sighting system and electronics that offer outstanding reliability. Fully night vision device compatible, the Trijicon 4x32 LED ACOG is also compatible with most other 4x32 ACOG accessories available.
 

The 300 blackout reticle with merged aiming points has been optimized for simplicity and efficiency. It allows the user to instantly switch between supersonic and subsonic ammunition without having to re-zero the weapon. The supersonic BDC (out to 600 yds.) has been merged with the subsonic BDC (out to 200 yds.) to provide one set of aiming points for both types of ammunition. The reticle drops are based on an average of commonly available off-the-shelf subsonic and supersonic ammunition. This BDC reticle is not limited to one or two specific bullets: a majority of commonly available ammunition will fall within the 2 MOA diamond aiming points. The 2 MOA diamonds offer a balance of speed and versatility based on the unique performance of the 300 Blackout caliber. The drops for each aiming point are provided for users who wish to develop their own handloads, or for those who wish to deviate from the recommended zero distances.""

The Silver Pigeon II is also as beautiful to the eye as it is to the touch, caress and fondle. The oil finished stock is select walnut with a traditional Schnabel fore-end; bold game-scene engraving separates it from other shotguns. This over-under field model also enjoys the Beretta’s legendary pointability, thanks to the 680 series low-profile receiver. Furthermore, the absolute strength of the unique locking system provides for years of trouble-free use. This field model shotgun comes with the factory case, 5 chokes, choke wrench, gun oil, and an limbsaver recoil pad. Has around 2 cases of shells through it, and is the unholy bringer of death and destruction to quail and pheasants!!!"

I did not receive the little envelope with a spent shell casing from Ruger when I bought the gun, so there is not one included.  I asked about this when I bought it, and I found that it’s common for the manufacturer to omit the spent shell casing when shipping to many states, including Ohio.
This gun has never been fired or modified in any way.  It’s brand new in the box.  I am the original owner.
I am not a gun dealer.  I’m an Ohio resident with a valid Ohio CCW permit.  I will sell this gun in a legal manner to an Ohio resident, with a proper bill-of-sale.  Ohio CCW holders go to the front of the line, but without a CCW permit, a valid Ohio driver’s license will be required to establish Ohio residency.  I prefer to meet and conduct the transaction in cash.  I am not interested in trades.  I’m a good guy, and I will only deal with other good guys and gals.

I AM OFFERING THIS WEAPON LIGHT AT A CONSIDERABLE DISCOUNT TO THE BUYER.  THIS IS AN AUTJENTIC, HARD USE PROVEN, COMBAT SEAPON LIGHT. THESE ARE NOT CHEAP, ALTHOUGH THIS OFFERING WILL HURT YOUR WALLET A BIT LESS THAN A BRAND NEW ONE. For sale is a LIKE NEW, without box, SUREFIRE M720v dual spectrum weapon light in Desert Sand. It comes with the SUREFIRE dual pressure switch with 7 inch cord for constant or momentary on functions. This is the model with the locking quick detach Surefire M93 picatinny rail mount.  This light was installed on a rifle for dos play purposes only and has no signs of use or wear.  The only markings on it are on the underneath side where I had marked them with a paint pen with a cataloging number as a matched set for inventory purposes.  Light comes with battery.  This is the dual illumination model with both white and IR capabilities, changed back and forth with only the wrist of the spring loaded bezel.  It also has a DISABLE bezel position to insure against breaking light discipline or neglegent light discharge. The white light has a lever adjustable high/medium/low and strobe setting. The IR light has a lever adjustable high/medium/low setting. As with all SUREFIRE products, the company warranties these against failure for the life of the item regardless of proof of purchase or if you are the original owner of not. Below are the specs from TNVC's website, the place from which it was originally purchased.M720VSurefire M720V RAID6-Volt Dual Spectrum LED Weapon Light The variable-output M720V RAID WeaponLight produces brilliant 150-lumen white light or 240 milliwatts of infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply push and twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between white light or IR illumination—or select the “disable” setting to prevent accidental discharges. In either spectrum mode, the M720V’s TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications with sufficient peripheral illumination for situational awareness. The highly efficient LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there’s no filament to burn out or break. It comes with a pressure-activated SR07-M720V tape switch (with a 7″ cable) that can be positioned where you choose. If your remote switch becomes damaged or disconnected, rotate your RAID WeaponLight’s white-light selector switch to “;flashlight” mode and activate it directly via its integral pushbutton dome switch. (This same pushbutton switch provides low navigational white light when “flashlight” mode is not selected.) This selector switch also lets you choose three different white-light output settings: high, medium, or strobe. The IR selector switch, located on opposite side, offers high-, medium-, and low-output settings when IR mode is selected on head. The M720V attaches solidly to your Picatinny rail via our Swing-Lever™ clamp, which self-adjusts to out-of-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from recoil or impact. Built to withstand the rigors of combat, the M720V is constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission. It’s also O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture.The M720V RAID is the ultimate weapon light. Hands down, we have never used a light with so many useful features. It is obvious that Surefire was listening to the feedback of their customers when they designed the M720V. Let’s start with the output. The RAID light features several different output modes for both white and IR light. The application of these modes is obvious. Operators can choose the desired light level based on the situation. The controls are intuitive and take little time to master. The RAID comes with a special partitioned pressure pad that clips directly to the rail, giving the operator the choice of momentary or constant-on activation. The main body housing also has an integral “fire” button that is easy to access in the even the pressure pad fails. The new strobe feature is an excellent addition. Quickly strobing white light is extremely disorienting to an enemy combatant. The M720V’s strobe is finely tuned and had us seeing spots for almost 15 minutes during trials.The IR mode is upgraded from previous V-Series offerings and now boasts 240 mW output in high setting. This is a welcome addition as we were able to get an increased range of IR illumination out to about 200 yards. The ability to dial it down to a low setting is great for indoor applications because the light is less likely to produce as much splash-back in an operator’s NVG’s when searching small rooms.The M720V’s housing is a huge departure from legacy V-Series lights. It looks like an X300 on steroids. The batteries are situated next to each other rather than inline, so even though the technical footprint of the M93 throw lever base is the same as other lights, the length of the actual light is much shorter. This allows you more active real estate on your hand guards for situating all the necessary accessories of the modern Warfighter. We are also very happy to see Surefire adopting a tactile indicator for spectrum choice on the bezel. The M720V features a raised ridge on both the housing and the bezel. When they are lined up, the operator knows the light is set to “IR Mode” by feel. When they are apart, the light is either set to “system disable” or “white light.”FeaturesVirtually indestructible white and IR LEDs regulated to maximize light output and runtimeSwitches—Momentary/constant-on SR07-M720V tape switch (7″ cable), momentary/constant-on pushbutton dome switchMounting system—Integral Swing-Lever™ clamp for Picatinny railsConstruction—High-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec anodizing; coated, tempered windowWeatherproof—O-ring and gasket sealedIncludes high-energy 123A batteries with 10-year shelf lifeAvailable in Black (BK) or Desert Sand (TN) This Item is ITAR controlled and cannot be shipped or carried outside the United States without express written permission from the United States Department of State.

DDI has built a reputation of excellent quality AK rifles at a reasonable price, and this rifle is no exception. American made 5,45x39 rifles have had a checkered past, and DDI worked hard to ensure they did not suffer from the same pitfalls later era Waffen Werks rifles suffered from.
DDI constructed these rifles under contract from Classic Firearms late last year. They are made from Bulgarian AK74M parts kits with 922(r) compliance. The trigger group, hand guard, stock, and pistol grip are US made. Everything else is Bulgarian made. This rifle comes with a Phoenix stock, a Hogue hand guard, and a Magpul AK pistol grip. I had purchased, and promptly misplaced, a Bulgarian hand guard set and the Hogue pistol grip that came with the rifle. If I find them, I will include them free with the rifle. Please do not expect them.
 
I am sure you have some questions about the rifle, so here is a quick FAQ:
 
Do I get anything else with the rifle?
Yes! For the price, you will also get two K-VAR M-74B ((10)) 30 round magazines. Other than the rounds I have shot through the rifle, these magazines are new. I am taking a hit on these in terms of their value, but a quality rifle deserves quality magazines.
 
How many rounds have you shot through it?
This rifle has had 90 rounds shot through it. All Monarch 5,45x39. The rifle fired everything we put through it without issue.
 
Why are you selling it?
At the time of purchase, I was heavily involved in AK pattern rifles. While I am still interested in them, I am more interested in consolidating my collection into a smaller variety of cartridges. If it were not for this, I would happily keep it.
 
Anything wrong with the rifle?
The muzzle brake is slightly loose and has a tendency to rattle if you shake the rifle with force. It is retained properly and will not come off during shooting. If you have any portion of the rifle you would like to see in detail, I will happily provide you pictures.
 
How can I get in contact with you?
You can use the contact system here on Armslist or you can call or text me at REDACTED. If you get in contact with me after 9 PM, please text instead of call. If I do not answer, leave a voicemail and I will get back to you as quick as I can.
 
Will I trade or negotiate?
Maybe. I would prefer cash. I would take an AR-15 of similar or equivalent value in unfired/similar round count to this AK 74. I understand that it is impossible to exactly match value when trading and would have some leeway.
I am open to offers other than the listed price, but please be reasonable. I reserve the right to deny offers lower than what I am asking.
 
Misc:
I will not ship the rifle. We will have to meet face to face. I live in Greenville, and while I am willing to travel a short distance, don't purchase the rifle unless you are willing to pick it up. Please have a valid Texas driver's license or carry permit. If you are from a state other than Texas, a carry permit from your state would be fine. We will fill out a bill of sale at the time of purchase."

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so I'm firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing yet I would rather have over the Henry and not in need of anything, so sorry if I'm picky.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Looking for several AR stripped lowers or would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.

$700 cash or a little better in trade.  Was $850 from gun store plus tax, probably a little cheaper online, but I think $700 is fair, so firm on price.  Lots of trade offers so far, but none I would rather have yet over the Henry, so sorry if I'm picky, I don't really need anything right now.
I will listen to trade offers as long as it's a good/fair deal, but not currently looking for anything right now, so just let me know the details, worst I can say is no thanks.  Could use several stripped AR lowers and would trade for 2,500rds. of Federal 5.56.

Because it has the lowest bore axis in its class, its intuitive accuracy is unrivaled. The low bore axis also reduces muzzle rise by 25% for faster recovery between shots. Its Pederson block design and optimized grip angle work together to dramatically diminish felt recoil. With a 3.4” barrel and smooth, rounded edges, it conceals easily and deploys like lightning. And it all comes with a confidence-boosting 7+1 rounds of 9mm Luger.
