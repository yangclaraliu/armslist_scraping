I'm wanting to sell this tonight. call/text me at 314 nine 74 8051 or email. first come first served.  I will start by saying this gun shoots great! I took it out just a few days ago and it shoots tight groups. Ejects the shells and locks up tight. Very simple to operate and the ammo sleve on stock is handy. This Would make a great home defense/project gun to practice blueing or shorting the barrel/hunting gun for youth/ a beater you don't have to worry about while out in the field. Now the bad is there are many scratches in the metal, rusting on the metal and some pitting. These are all cosmetic things and do not affect the function of shotgun. Also there is no front bead sight installed. Let's get this to a new home! Only $45 dollars if you can drive to me and pick up. If you need me to meet up with you somewhere it will most likely be an extra $5-10.  ThanksAlso gave a good amount of heavy loaded #4 shot golden pheasant ammo that I would sell with for a low price."

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.9MM 14 + 1 FMKPOWELL OHIO REDACTEDWILL SHIP ANYWHERE BUYER PAYS COSTSCC ADD 3%M/C VISA DISCOVER AMEXDEALER TRANSACTION, NICS CHECK & OHIO SALES TAXANY QUESTIONS CALL REDACTED"

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.9MM 14 + 1 FMKPOWELL OHIO REDACTEDWILL SHIP ANYWHERE BUYER PAYS COSTSCC ADD 3%M/C VISA DISCOVER AMEXDEALER TRANSACTION, NICS CHECK & OHIO SALES TAXANY QUESTIONS CALL REDACTED"

By McSwain413 from North Carolina, USA         I used used the Sparc II this year on my Benali Nova 12ga turkey gun this year. The clarity was outstanding, and dead on. I went through about 25 rounds sighting it in with different shells, and it took the punishment. It was about three weeks later that this bird came walking in and it was still dead on.

Quality build, simple controls, good battery life, water/fog proof, crisp bright dot, quick zero that holds, multiple mounting options included, and not to mention the Vortex VIP Warranty...all at a fraction of the price of some other well known brands...and trust me, being in the military, I have used them all, and the SPARC II is easily on par with them.

Comes with a new Galco holster. The Seecamp pistols have set the standard for small carry pistols. They are crafted from stainless steel and build to last a lifetime. This Seecamp was built in the Milford, CT shop. I have added a short history, courtesy of Ammoland.com, for your review.LW SEECAMPThe pistol was the brain child of Ludwig Wilhelm Seecamp who began his career in the firearms industry in the early 1970s as a gunsmith who was dead set on converting the Model 1911 into a double action pistol. In 1980 he set out to build the perfect pocket pistol. The first pistol which bore his name was chambered in 25 ACP and called the LWS 25. This double action, stainless steel pocket rocket had no sights and would evolve into the Seecamp LWS 32. Much like the A-10 warthog being a plane designed around a gun, the LWS 32 was designed around a particular type of ammunition: Winchester’s 32 ACP Silvertip ( http://goo.gl/WHkkWa ) . At the time it was the most potent cartridge developed for the 32 ACP. Before the end of the 1980s, the Seecamp was on a 3-5 year back order. By the mid 1990s, shooters were paying 3 to 5 times the MSRP to have a Seecamp and avoid the wait as concealed carry reform began to sweep the nation.

This is an early Berryhill, number 0064, built as a MEU-SOC .45. MEU - Marine Expeditionary Unit - SOC Special Operations Capable was a Dave Berryhill specialty. You will see that all Berryhill 1911's had two serial numbers, the factory frame number, in this case number 34912 and Dave's custom number which is 0064 on this pistol. Mr. Berryhill has passed away but his gunsmithing legacy lives on in his custom 1911's. 0064 is in great condition with only minor handling marks. The grips and trigger are not original to the pistol but could easily be replaced if desired. 0064 was built on a Springfield frame and slide with a Wilson Combat NM Barrel and a Wilson Combat barrel retention ring. 0064's action is smooth as butter. If you are not familiar with Dave Berryhill and are interested in this pistol you can find several articles on him on the web. If you have any questions just let me know."
