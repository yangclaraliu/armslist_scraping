These ""New England"" or ""Massachusetts"" militia muskets were built to be dual purpose arms to serve minutemen both at home and on the field. Their design shares attributes from standard military muskets of the day as well as civilian fowling pieces. This example was constructed with the Brown Bess pattern in mind and even utilizes several resourced Brown Bess parts. The barrel measures 38 1/2"" long and may have started life on a Brown Bess. It is unmarked and features a small dovetailed brass blade front sight with a bayonet lug mounted under the muzzle. The engraved lock is a trade piece marked ""SAMUEL MOORE / WARRANTED"". Overall the metal has a very pleasing dark plum patina. The stock features a slight flare just behind the ramrod entry pipe which is distinctive of a Brown Bess. The wood has an attractive, dark untouched patina overall with surprisingly no chips, cracks, or repairs whatsoever. A thin coat of varnish has been added long ago, much of which has since worn away. Brass buttplate, lock screw escutcheons, triggerguard, and ramrod pipes all retain a dark mellowed patina. The pipes are no doubt taken from a Brown Bess. The very tip of the entry pipe is broken away. Original iron ramrod appears to be blacksmith made. The action is crisp and functions perfectly while the frizzen snaps shut and springs forward securely. This is a fantastic example of a scarce Brown Bess inspired militia musket. No FFL required on pre-1899 firearms or contemporary muzzleloaders.fedex, ups  Shipping cost $30."

It's in fantastic condition, with only some paint  wear on hard use surfaces such as the focusing ring. Other than that the field of view is crystal clear and the body of the scope is just fine, and operates perfectly. I only have the scope and the bag, no manuals unfortunately. But it's a fairly straightforward design and user friendly.
RAPTOR 4X FEATURES:
 
 * 4X Magnification, 8.3˚FOV
 * Common AA Battery Operation
 * 12"" x 3.75"" x 3.5"" and Weighs 3lbs 6oz
 * Shock Protected Optics that are Combat Proven
 * High Resolution 64lp/mm Minimum
 * Bright Source Protection
 * One Year Warranty
 
       The 4X RAPTOR® is a State-of-the-Art, GEN 3 Night Vision Weapon sight, utilizing the latest Ultra military image tube providing 21st Century technology. Rugged yet lightweight construction makes the 4X RAPTOR® very reliable and is the most accurate imaging device designed to withstand the rigors of combat use.
 
 
 
 
      Originally designed for military and professional demands for extreme long range accuracy, the 4X RAPTOR® can easily be mounted on almost any weapon system including military .50 cal sniper rifles. Optional mount adapters are available for specific mounting needs.
 
      Sighting is accomplished with a variable illuminated red crosshair ballistic reticle. The reticle is fully adjustable for bore sighting and has a separate control for optimal reticle brightness and contrast for all lighting conditions. The reticle offers 0.2 Mil Elevation and Windage adjustments.
 
 
RAPTOR 4X APPLICATIONS:
 
 * Snipers and Professional Shooters
 * Corn Farmers with Feral Hog Problems
 * Ranchers with Coyotes and Varmint Problems
     A daylight cover protects the objective lens, as well as the image tube, against accidental exposure to bright light. This daylight cover can be utilized for training and bore sighting during low-light conditions such as dawn, dusk or overcast days. A pressure operated rubber eye guard provides operator protection from recoil and prevents light scatter.

I just bought it a year ago in May from Sportsman's Warehouse in Ankeny, IA. I paid over $1900 for it (I have the receipt.) I took it out twice to shoot and it shot really well with jams. I only put a total of 60 rounds through it and then cleaned it, oiled it and then wiped the oil off like the manual says to do. I kept it stored in my safe inside my bedroom. It has never been dropped or damaged in any way and I have always taken care of it. I like this gun a lot but it is not for me. The pictures shown are of the actual gun, so what you see for options is what you get.
