We currently have no other firearms of any kind because we both just got discharged from the Navy in September.
She was robbed while in Kansas City about 2 weeks ago, the guy sucker punched her across the jaw and now she's afraid to go anywhere.
Our anniversary is coming up and would like to get her a handgun as a gift, she said she has been wanting one very badly since she was robbed.

Missouri laws state that you CAN own a handgun before the age of 21, you can store it with the magazine separated from the gun in the glove box of your car or it can reside within your home as a defensive weapon, so don't try to tell me it's illegal, please, I have better things to waste my time on than arguing with people on the internet, if you don't believe me, look it up, but please don't waste my time.

I'm really worried about my girl, I love her very much and if anything ever happened to her I don't know what I'd do, having a handgun would put both of our minds at ease when she goes back and forth to work or the store or whatever.
She's 5'6 and 120 pounds, she isn't very big and people could easily take advantage of her.

I have about 600 dollars, I'll take anything 9mm or bigger, would highly prefer a Sig P226 or similar.

HL1-D-TN
This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three yellow-green LEDs, two infrared LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The yellow-green primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination;; the infrared secondary LEDs are for use with night vision devices (NVDs) and provide an invisible light signature when viewed by the naked eye. 

The Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body that comes in tan. It attaches via a special mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) by means of two socket-head machinescrews. Once the mount is attached, the light can be easily slid onto the mount, where it locks in place; depressing a small lever slides it right off, so the Helmet Light can be quickly removed for servicing or transport onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest. 
Features 
•Made of durable glass-filled nylon polymer and neoprene
•O-ring sealed, watertight body 
•Two toggle switches and a pressure switch for total control 
•Yellow-green and infrared LEDs and infrared IFF LED beacon 
•Long runtime from a single 123A battery with 10-year shelf life 
•Easily removable for servicing or transfer to other helmets 
•Size: 2.2 W x 2.6 H x 1.3 thick including mount 
•Weight: 3.1 oz. with battery and mount 
•Output/Runtime: 
Yellow-green High: 19.2 lumens/6 hrs
Infrared High: 2.5 lumens/20 hrs
Yellow-green Med: 5.0 lumens/28 hrs

Helmet Light MOLLE Clip

The Helmet Light MOLLE clip lets you enjoy hands-free lighting from any SureFire Helmet Light without attaching the light to a helmet. The clip securely attaches to the webbing of any MOLLE or ALICE vest and features a ratcheting swivel arm that orients the Helmet Light in any of five positions from 0° to approximately 110°. Helmet Light slides onto the clip's mount and locks in place in seconds; slides off just as easily once the lock-release button has been depressed. Leave the clip permanently attached to your vest for quick transfers of your Helmet Light between your helmet and service vest, or attach to your vest as needed. 
Features 
•Constructed from durable, lightweight polymer 
•Quickly & securely attaches to vest webbing; detaches in seconds 
•Ratcheting swing arm enables five (5) different light positions

Finding a good home is much more important to us than selling them.  The Mother shows very good hunting skills (never formaly trained in hunting she is not gun shy)  Father is a little gun shy.  No hunting gaurentees.

The archangel kit essenially turns this into an AR-15 look-alike, and has a six position retracting stock (looks similar to a Magpul style M4 stock) The kit encases the reciever of the rifle in very tough lightweight polymer, and has a full length rail on the top, and another on the bottom of the handgaurd. It also came with a rather cheesy mock bayonet that mounts on the gun... (included if you really want it) The original OD green stock comes with too.

This rifle is only about five months old, and had the bolt replaced under warranty about two months ago due to a faulty extractor. I still have all the paper work. This rifle cycles flawlessly with 40 Grain Remington ""Thunderbolt"" rounds. I baby my guns, and I'm sure you'll that notice that when you see this in person.

Included is the original box, trigger lock, paper work and FOUR MAGAZINES. (2 10rd, 2 30 rd) I'll even throw in some ammo to get you started. The accessories pictured aren't included, but if you want them we can work out a fair price.

Very good rifle for the price. I will not go any lower in the price, unless you throw in something to sweeten the deal. I'm selling this rifle, but I would consider trading for a handgun. It can be an old one as long as it's worth around $300. I have been looking for a Colt Cattleman style revolver. I don't care if it's a Ruger Vaquero, Ubertti, Cimarron, etc. I just want a slingle action frontier style handgun chambered in any caliber (just not .22). If you have anything like that or any other handgun you would like to trade (Beretta, Glock, etc.) let me know and we can swap pictures and make a deal. I want to keep the deal local.

This is a 9mm SA/DA pistol with mJanual safety/decocker - great gun to carry one in the pipe while not cocked and still have a safety engaged.

Not looking for trades.

I traded for this & it's a very clean good running rifle. It's an early model Sig 556, and has a collapsable stock. This is a stainless steel receiver & a chrome lined, chromolly barrel. It has a fishgill forearm, with pic rails & a top pic rail with an integrated BUIS. This rifle uses ar/m4 mags but is built nothing like an AR platform. It uses a piston to run the action. & is about as close to 100% reliable as you can get. My other one (I own 2) has had about 1500 rounds through it & not a single malfunction. $900 is a BARGAIN. If you find it cheaper, buy 2.

Nice & clean. About 50 rounds fired. Very accurate. Early striker-fire action. $550 (the 2 extra mags. cost $35 each IF you can find them)

NOT A CHEAP EBAY SWORD…

I bought this at a gun shop a few years ago, very nice compared to many I have seen.  I had an expert look at it and it is NOT a folded blade, however, much higher quality than the typical cheap ebay or pawn shop sword.  Little skulls and dragons as decoration.  Excellent condition and comes with cleaning kit.  54”+ overall in wooden scabbard and 37”+ blade so it works very well for a tall person (I’m 6’3”)

Remove the handle and it says the maker was Minamoto Yamayasushiyo, 
Sword owner was Yamagata Yazou (translated on the paper by my Japanese Doctor friend)

There are hints throughout to make learning easy and you can learn at your own pace with plenty of practice of each new point. It is a friendly introduction to the language which should help you to understand and speak German sufficiently well to function effectively in basic everyday situations, both business and social. The course also offers an insight into German culture. The book consists of 20 graded units introducing you to the basic structures and grammatical points you'll need in everyday situations, such as booking a hotel, shopping, eating and traveling. New language is introduced through short dialogues and text which are also on the accompanying recording and there are plenty of exercises to practice each new point as it is introduced.There is a special section on pronunciation at the beginning of the book to get you started and a revision section at the end of the first ten units so that you can check your progress and review any areas of difficulty."

 I have some Armor - Dillo TS-1 pads . They are the best thing I have ever used to restore the color to the dark trim and running boards on my GMC Yukon. The black trim returned to a deep dark like new appearance. NOT SLICK NOR GREASY!!  FOR DARK TRIM ONLY!!!

This stuff was originally created to solve the streaking and chalking problems on Chevy Avalanche cladding and is the GM warranty approved solution for this problem.

The finish is dry not slick like armor all and lasts a long time. The company says between 3-6 months.

Just wipes on and is then activated by wiping with a damp cloth. I know, sounds crazy but this stuff works! MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW BY WIPING WITH A DAMP CLOTH!!

Armor Dillo says it takes 1 pad to do the average car and that A chevy Avalanche takes 4-6 pads depending on the amount of cladding. 

I did my Yukon with 2 pads, but barely. 3 would have been easier,better.

$9.00 per pad shipped. I'll take check, money order, Paypal + 4%.

I paid $299 plus tax for it, Price tag on case says $399. Trades are welcome not really looking for anything in particular. Mainly shoot pistols but im also a fan of certain rifles and shotguns.

Board Info:

Made by Burton Snowboards for the Sierra Community as a special Mid Season Release. The top sheet and base where designed by the Sierra team and community members. We recommend the Sierra Reverse Crew for speed demons, powder hounds and especially guys who are skeptical of rockered snowboards! Since the evolution of reverse camber snowboards, the snowboard industry has debated the pros and cons, advantages, and riding styles of these boards. The Sierra Reverse Crew turns this debate on its head because it offers the same aggressive turn initiation and stability of a cambered board, speed of a race board, ollie power of a freestyle board and playfulness of rockered snowboard. A stiffer board than the Sierrascope, we recommend that you ride the Sierra Reverse Crew with the Union Sierra Contact SL Binding.

- Directional Twin Shape is the most universal.
- Biaxial Fiberglass with Carbon is stable and snappy.
- Engineered Core Construction - More efficient energy transfer edge to edge
- Sintered Base

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additi­onal ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage.

 Traditional Double Action with an Anti-Stress Mode As the first pistol equipped with a firing pin lock, the P99 AS combines the advantages of the traditional Double Action System with Single Action Anti-Stress trigger. The P99 provides the shooter with a user-friendliness previously found only in hammer fired pistols. Traditional Double Action The anti-stress trigger makes the P99 one of the world's safest firearms by preventing unintentional ""reflex"" firing in stressful situations. The decisive innovation: When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot; not only in the double action trigger mode, but also in the single action mode. The trigger travel is .551"" long in the anti-stress mode (at 4.4 lbs. trigger force), preventing inadvertent firing. On all subsequent shots, the trigger travel is reduced to .314"" (at the same trigger force) and this permits firing in rapid sequence, due to the quick reset of the P99 trigger. Enhanced Safety The P99 AS is equipped with a decocking button to safely decock the striker. It acts as an automatic safety and is integrated directly into the slide to prevent snagging on clothing even if the gun is drawn quickly."

At one time someone painted it silver. Most of the silver paint is off. The bluing in fair. Good in most places, but thin on the barrel in a couple of spots. Some B12 or brake cleaner will clean off the rest of the paint.
The bad news. Something makes the trigger hang up. It might come free for a while, but then hangs again. Some one who knows a little about guns may be able to fix it. Its not pretty, but its cheap. I will take $50.00 obo. I would like to sale this this evening. FTF in Yukon or west OKC. I will take offers, but will respond to someone who offers $50.00 first. I might trade for AR Pmags, 223 or 9mm ammo, or for another old 22.
 This is an old gun with silver paint on it. It is not a beauty queen, but might make a good plinker with a little tlc.

I love Montes but i really have no need for it so here it is

81 Monte Carlo, Clear title that i havent even signed my name on yet but im going to put my name on it when my 30 day tag expires which is in a little over a week.. So if sold and title isn't back i will sell with bill of sale and send or deliver title.
SBC mild 355
Headers, Street Dominator Intake, Mild cam smooth idle, Duel Exhaust, Accell super coil, Accell HEI distributor, Holley 650 vaccum secondary carburetor, Accel 8MM plug wires, TH350 with shift kit, K&N air filter.  Cherry Bomb mufflers, B&M shifter, Automeater (Auto Gage) Tach, Water temp & Oil Pressure gauges.
Interior is good but not perfect, no rips in the interior, Door panels show some age, Dash cracked but has a dash mat and the interior trim is cracked in some spots. Kenwood CD player but the speakers are not real impressive.
Old Camaro Ralley wheels with BFGs, 80 percent tread
Only has a couple of VERY SMALL dents. There are a few small rust spots were it is starting to show through the paint. Stock rear end with stock gears and with the foot through the floor you shift out of second at about 110 mph..
The car has 41000 original miles on the car and approximately 6000 on the motor and tranny.  I have drove it for the last few weeks and the car is sound.  I put the stereo in correctly but due to no company's making instillation kits for this year i had to use a universal.  Looks 10 times better then the stereo sitting in a big hole.  I put the new spedo cable in  but the speedo gear in the tranny must be messed up.  Spinning the cable with a drill and the speedo works fine but hooked to the tranny just doesn't work.  You can find one for nothing out of a junk tranny but im not going to mess with it.  It also comes with a GPS that tells you your speed so its all good.  I also put the new weather stripping on the lower doors this weekend. The car runs like a champ..No Studders, No Dead spots and has plenty of power under the hood.   Motor runs 190 temp holding 50PSI oil at idle and has plenty of go!!  I  am needing to sell this car because i need the money to fix my wife's burban and help my grand mother who is sick.    Im open to partial trades but needing a 1000+ cash with the trades.   I need this car gone quick  Cash is king i just need it gone.  Feel free to text or email offers to me even if its not on the list. Text or call at REDACTED or email me at rickyc  REDACTED if your interested.  I will answer any questions you may have.  $3,000 but will negotiate but please be reasonable with offers.  Definitely worth the money.  Unfortunately i need cash soon due to problems coming up and that's why i need partial trades. Thanks for looking and God Bless!!"
