It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

Like new - Glock 29 10mm.

I love this pistol but I just don't use it.  Pearce Extension grips and original magazine plates come with it.  I also have a ""Tuff Grip"" I used on it if you want that.   You can have whatever ammo I have left with it (around 60 or so rounds) If and when I can find it :)

You must have a CPL or valid pistol purchase permit.

The award-winning Springfield XD is engineered to work with your body to help you reach your full potential as a shooter. Pick up an XD for the first time, raise it to eye level, point at a target and you’ll likely be looking right down the sights. The XD’s Point & Shoot Ergonomics™ make it feel more like an extension of your body than an object in your hand. Fully hammer-forged barrels with precision rifling enhance accuracy. All critical internal parts are forged and precisely machined from billet for durability. Steel slides are mated to super-tough, all-weather polymer frames. Tough, corrosion-resistant finishes keep them looking great. Stainless steel magazines drop free when the release is activated. Easy, no-tool disassembly makes routine maintenance a snap. Standard features on all models include a striker status indicator, grip safety, loaded-chamber indicator, Ultra Safety Assurance™ trigger system, ambidextrous magazine release and accessory rail. Every XD pistol in this line comes with a package that includes two magazines, a magazine loader, a magazine pouch, a holster and a hard-plastic carry case.
XD .45 Compact – A .45 ACP semiautomatic with a 4"" barrel and shortened grip for easier carry. It comes with two magazines – a 10-round compact magazine and a 13-round Service Model magazine equipped with a XD Gear X-Tension™. This lets you convert from a Compact Model to a Service Model simply by swapping out magazines. Three-dot fixed sights. All-black model."

I just put a new trigger group in the gun because the old trigger guard broke(plastic) .  Rhe new one is plastic too though.  A couple of the screws were meased up sonI replaced them too so it would look nice. 

This model 60 has a nice stock and the metal is in good shape .  There are a couple small surface rust spots on the barrel- they are hard to see but I tried to photo them.  

Its a nice plinker but not perfect.  Nothing on it that wouldnt be there after a few months of use.  Anyway i dont need it cause I picked up a 10/22.

Other than that the only thing you will need to reload is a way to separate the brass from the media in the tumbler.  They have commercially produced devices for this but I just used a spaghetti strainer and a big bowl.  If you have never reloaded and have any questions I'd be happy to explain anything. I'd like to sell all at once and that is how you will get the best deal.  I am open to offers on individual items. Have to sell because I need the space this is taking up a whole bedroom.

Front sight is integrated with gas block; Rear sight includes “RPK” style windage adjustment; Features factory installed UTG Picatinny handguard rail; M+M Chaos billet flash hider / muzzle brake; Factory side rail mount; Tapco G-2 trigger and retaining plate; Hogue pistol grip. One of the first things I noticed about the M10 when I picked it up was that it’s fairly light for an AK. The rifle weighs in at only 7.3 pounds. The overall length of the gun is 36″ with the fixed “Warsaw Pact” length stock. Unlike a lot of the AKs on the market these days, the M+M M10 isn’t a parts kit gun. Rather, it’s made from all new parts. The M10 includes a UTG quad rail. Although I generally believe UTG products provide a lot of value for the buck. The M10-762 features a new, Romanian-made, cold-hammer forged, chrome-lined 16.25″ barrel. The rear sight is probably one of the best features on the M+M. On most AK variants, the rear sight is adjustable for elevation only, using a sliding “ramp.” (above right). The M+M has that same feature – in this case graduated to 1000 meters in 100 meter increments – but it also adds an RPK-type rear sight, which is adjustable for windage another feature on the M10-762 is the front sight, which is integrated with the gas block . According to M+M, the M10-762 is manufactured out of brand new high quality parts  everything is newly manufactured to be US 922(r) compliant. The receiver and major parts are made in Romania by F.A. Cugir, the main military arsenal in Romania. However I modified my M10 and put on the slide fire stock making it a legal functioning fully automatic rifle once you learn how to use it. There are a lot of youtube videos showing how to use it, it was a $300 add on. I have also added a detachable with quick release 2.5-10x40 duel Illuminated scope with a gree laser, another $150 add on, plus full size heavy duty 7'' to 11'' bipod, another $50 add on, also comes with 4-30rd tapco mags another $40 add on and a $20 AK cleaning kit. My total amount invested is $1260.00 Plus I have 900 rds of Brown Bear hp ammo that I will through in for $150 if you want it. As the photo shows I still have the original stock plus another aftermarket stock im throwin in with the deal, and can't forget about the speed loader im throwing in with it also. If you want everything pictured i'll take $1350, if you just want what is pictured without the ammo i'll take $1200. Contact Dave at nine three seven four zero two four six three six."

This gun has a Lifetime Replacement Warranty.  This is not a repair warranty, this is a replacement with a new, not refurbished gun.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

This rifle has a really pretty wood stock, but has a few scratches and dents from an elk hunt in North Dakota. It has a fantastic factory trigger that breaks crisply at 3.5lbs; probably the best factory R700 trigger I've felt. It's a fairly rare ""DM"" model, which denotes that it feeds from a detachable box magazines and 2 are included in the sale. It has a Limbsaver recoil pad installed which allows you to shoot it all day without a sore shoulder. It also comes with 2pc scope mounts, 1"" rings, and a box of Remington Core Lokt ammo.

The only reason I'm selling it is because it has sat in the safe for well over a year without being touched. I hate to have a gun sitting around that doesn't get used and I've got another project on my mind.

This would make a great hunting gun for someone who likes magnum caliber rifles.

The 835 Turkey Thug is one of 21 Mossberg 835 Ulti-Mag Pump-Action variants. Features common to the 835 Ulti-Mag series includes over-bored barrels, meaning all barrels are bored to 10 gauge size lieu of the standard 12 gauge bore. Mossberg claims that the over-bored barrel reduces felt recoil and improves pattern performance. All 835 Ulti-Mags also include ported barrels (8 holes) for reduced recoil and minimal muzzle-jump. This shotgun retails for $642, but I have it converted to a home defense shotgun street sweeper out of hunting season with a 20'' smooth bore barrel not even a year old, plus a Scorpian pistol grip. It shoots 2 1/2 to 3 1/4 inch shells and is a great dear gun and can be used to hunt small game as well. It also comes with a 25 round sling. I have $525 inmvested because I bought it used from a friend a couple years ago. So if your looking for a multi purpose shotgun for hunting and a home defense shotgun as well this is the shot gun for you. For home defense I use 000 3 inch Winchester shells, for hunting just whatever my game calls for shot size wise. Will sell it all as pictured for $500.00, of yes I forgot I also put a heat shield on the gun which is another $35 add on. Call Dave at nine three seven four zero two four six three six."

The U.S. 44 .22 caliber rifle manufactured by Mossberg for the U.S. Military. It is similar to the M42 and M44 commercial rifles and many parts are interchangeable. With the proper magazine, you can use .22 short, .22 long, and .22 LR in this rifle. Without the magazine, you can use it as a single-shot rifle, the magazine holds seven (7) rounds. The rifle has a bull barrel with recessed muzzle; the trigger is not adjustable, the front sight is fixed. The barrel is ""lead-lapped"" which is a process that fills in the micro-cracks in the metal producing a very smooth surface with very little variance or imperfections. It is also very labor intensive and, as a result, expensive. The process is only applied to the most expensive target rifles these days. The rifles were manufactured 1943-1946. 



Trigger guard has some minor damage, missing the red & green fire & safe indicators.
