Position reporting lets you send your exact location to other Rino users in your group so that everyone can see your position on the map page.

I never cared for shooting .40 and this is the only one I ever owned. You seriously won't find a nicer G22 on Armslist. There isn't a spec of carbon or the tiniest of scratch on the entire gun and has been sitting in my Liberty since 2014. I am the original owner.The gun has the original box, paperwork, cleaning rod, 2 backstraps (before they included 4), six magazines with Pearce Gen 4 textured extensions on all of them (they were $11 each but if that isn't your thing baseplates are dirt cheap to swap), factory mag loader, Pearce grip plug ($6), Glock extended slide release ($15), and a Ghost 3.5 connector ($20). The gun has not been modified or tampered with in any way aside from the connector swap. Again, if the lighter connector isn't your thing a new one can be had for as low as $15. As it sits everything would be around $750 retail.The gun is mint. If you were to purchase it from a shop in its current conditon you would pay around $30 less than the price of a brand new one. Probably a lot more with all of the mags and features.I am firm on $450. I will not respond to low-balls. No trades at this time.Buyer must be an Ohio resident or pay $35 in shipping to an FFL.I live in Central Ohio but travel to Toledo often. I would be willing to drive a maximum of 30 minutes outside of my way to meet up.Thanks for looking!"

This is the Italian made model with the railed dust cover. This has had its trigger replaced with a Beretta metal trigger, the trigger spring replaced with the Wolff TCU from Wilson Combat, and some nice G10 grips. I have also replaced the recoil spring and guide rod with a flat-wire recoil spring and a fluted guide rod that holds lube a lot better. This thing is very accurate and pleasant to shoot. I have fired 200rds through it since I've owned it and kept it meticulously clean and in good condition. I am asking for $700 for the pistol and one 10rd magazine plus 2 pre-ban magazines, and have 15rd pre-bans available for $50 each. I will do a transfer at the cost of the buyer ($25) at a shop in the Worcester area. I don't have anymore transfers for the year. I will sell this stock with one 10rd magazine for $500 as well."

The letters/numbers MAK-90 stand for Modified AK-1990.  The MAK-90 is a Chinese factory built AK model exported to the USA from China from 1990 through 1994 by two Chinese export companies: Norinco and PolyTech. Following the import ban in 1989, the Chinese developed an AK which met the ""sporting purposes"" clause. (The earlier AKs were banned because of their ""evil"" features: pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets.) The new model was basically an AK with a wood thumb-hole stock and no bayonet lug (although you do sometimes see MAK-90 receivers with under-folder holes drilled and filled). Around a million MAK-90s were exported to the USA in the early 90s. According to ""JA,"" of AK47.net, more MAK-90 rifles were imported from China than any other model of semi automatic AK type rifle from any other country. MAK-90s were made to shoot 7.62x39 or .223 caliber ammunition. A very few were made to shoot 5.45 x 39 ammo. The later MAK-90s imported after 1990 had the threads on the muzzle actually turned off, and a 2 digit year of import stamped in front of or in back of the serial number (for example 91, 92, 93, 94). Some have a space or dash between the serial number and 2 digit year of import stamping. No MAK-90s were exported to the USA after 1994, however some Poly Tech rifles that were sitting in warehouses were finally released to their importers in 1996."
