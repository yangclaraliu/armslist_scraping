With the challenges of law enforcement and military in mind, these sights have a green photoluminescent paint outline and tall blade on the front sight to increase visibility and quicken sight acquisition. Additionally, the front surface is steeply hooked to assist in emergency one-handed slide operation. It also comes with 3 magazines, lock, cleaning brush, and hard case.Considered one of the best service pistols, the GLOCK design turned the semi-auto pistol market upside down when it was introduced in 1982. Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain acceptance worldwide with consumers in both professional and civilian circles. The GLOCK 23 Gen 3 has become one of the most popular duty and concealed carry pistols ever produced.Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 23 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. Featuring a large 13 round magazine capacity that offers more than enough large caliber firepower when it is needed most. Specifications and Features:13 Round MagazinePolymer FrameGLOCK Weapon Rail5.5 Pound Trigger Pull Striker FiredBlack FinishThe GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol."

There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are a small handful of shallow nicks, but that is it! This shotgun features two 7-round, twin tubes that automatically feed into the shotgun's receiver. There is a selector switch set on the back of the tubes, which will allow you to select which tube you're firing from, or you can set it to automatically feed. This shotgun also features a side-mounted tactical LED flashlight, as well as a rubberized buttstock designed to absorb more recoil. This shotgun also features a pair of iron sights. This shotgun comes in EXCELLENT condition, and is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection."

These WASR 10-63s were made in Romania using cold hammer forged barrels. They were imported to the US by Century International Arms (CAI) either as kits or as sporting arms.
This rifle was amongst those subsequently sold en masse to SOC, a US contractor, who provided security services in Iraq for US installations.
SOC hired primarily Ugandans, many of whom, had been in the Ugandan Army and who were familiar with the AK-47. Take a look at the photos here. Due to Iraqi law, these paramilitary forces were not authorized fully automatic weapons. As a result, they were issued these WASRs, some Romanian semi auto RPKs; plus some AR-15 semiautomatics. These Ugandan men guarded the outer perimeter and other inner perimeter areas thereby freeing US personal to take the fight outside the wire. Though not a glamorous duty some contract guards came under fire and some were killed by suicide bombers.This rifle was hardly fired and nothing was wiped off just as it came back from Century including the dust from the desert.

For over 50 years, more Model 700s have been sold than any other bolt-action rifle before or since. The legendary strength of its 3-rings-of-steel receiver paired with a hammer-forged barrel, combine to yield the most popular bolt-action rifle in history. Top choice of elite military snipers, the Model 700 is unequalled in tactical precision. Whether defending freedom or pursuing big game, its out-of-the-box accuracy is unmatched.Because of its flat shooting nature and the relatively tolerable recoil, the 7mm Remington Magnum is especially popular for Western plains use in the United States, as well as for use on plains game in Africa. It has also been chambered in sniper rifles as the US Secret Service counter-sniper team has deployed this cartridge in urban areas, Popular online gun author Chuck Hawks calls the 7mm Remington ""one of the great all-around rifle cartridges."""
