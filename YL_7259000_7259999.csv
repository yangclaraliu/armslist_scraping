((Manufactured in Spain by Jukar (Dikar) for the CVA. Now it is made by Ardesa for Traditions))   It was built by my father in 1980. It has never been fired.  However, it could fire. Everything was done properly. Barrel was heat treated etc. This rifle was used since day one as a wall hanger for decoration in his office.  Only taken down to wipe down every once in a while.  Never seen direct sunlight.  It has never been fired. But I took it to a gunsmith and had him look it over. He said it's ready to fire and should do just fine.  It is a 45cal black powder muzzleloader. It has the octagon barrel. And has never been fired. So rifling is as it should be.  I don't have a use for this. And it deserves someone that will use it, collect it, or hang it on their wall.  Rather than packed away in a case under a bed.  I have more photos available of it.  Just ask.   Also will take any specific photos a serious buyer would want.  Contact me to see it in person.  For more photos.  Or to make a cash offer. Copy and paste this Video link in your browser to see a short video of the rifle :https://youtu.be/QflUcoBj1ZIEmail or TEXT 513-708-428two Thanks"

Kimber Custom TLE II

Today, law enforcement officers around the country, including such elite units as LAPD SWAT, carry Kimber Customs. Military units with the option to chose pistols that can actually do the job trust Kimber with their lives. American shooters have made Kimber the best selling brand of 1911 by a huge margin.

 

The pistol carried by LAPD SWAT

The Kimber Custom TLE II .45 ACP is virtually identical to the pistol carried by LAPD SWAT since 2002. Important upgrades from the Kimber Custom Shop such as Meprolight night sights and 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap are also included. Based on the Kimber Custom II model, it has standard features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the authority of the great .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom TLE II could well be the best choice for duty, concealed carry or personal defense.

 

Kimber Custom TLE II

 Kimber Custom 2 Sights        Kimber Custom TLE II Frame

 Low profile night sights are mounted in machined dovetails for strength and have rounded edges that will not snag   Full-size frame is machined from solid stainless steel for strength and long life

594,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7259594,For Sale:  VEPR 12,"Peonia/Hotchkiss/, Western Slope, Colorado","$ 1,150","Listed On: Monday, October 2, 2017",Shotguns,Saiga                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Shotgun,"VEPR 12 with hand polished Bolt Carrier Group (BCG), hand polished BCG interior Guide Rails, and hand profiled and polished Hammer. This polishing work was professionally done with a selection of hand files and the correct sequence of sanding/polishing grit sand paper and sponge type sand papers to a very fine polish, NOT USING A DREMEL TOOL! Don't try this at home folks ... or follow some of the youtube videos that suggest using dremels!! If you try that and don't get everything exactly right you could end up with a non-functional firearm, a long wait and expense for the right parts, and more expense (around $250 or more) to have a professional do the job correctly, if you can find one!. 
For those of you unfamiliar with the VEPR 12 most of them DO NOT run all kinds of 12 Ga. ammo right out of the box. You must have the BCG, BCG Guide rails, and Hammer polished and correctly profiled. You can find V12’s for less money on Gunbroker or even Armslist etc. but they won’t have the needed work done, or done Correctly ... Plus you need to factor the additional work and parts that this one has had completed. Yes you might save some money but what is that worth if you need the V12 in a self defense situation and it fails to run? Yes, you can buy less for less, or less for more ... but you can't buy more for less.
Now this VEPR 12 runs any type of ammo, or combination of ammo, as fast as you can pull the trigger. It comes with a four position cheek weld and I also added two HK type custom cut and fitted rails on the Russian forearm, a five position folding and contoured forward handle, and a nice custom beavertail to the Russian Handle. This firearm is all Russian. Comes as shown with only 10 rounds through it, fired for full function. Priced below market, in consideration of the extra work, the fact that these are not illegal but just banned with recent sanctions, and the fact that my original retail cost just before the election and pre-polishing etc. was $1799 plus tax, FFL, and shipping.Buyer or seller pays BC for buyer, TBD. This was listed with Saiga as maker since AL doesn't have Molot as an option when listing. I have previously owned top of the line Saiga's for three gun competition etc. but the VEPR 12 is much, much better all round. I'm open to considering partial trades including certain firearms, cash/gold/silver/ and/or CCW. I have listed the V12 for the next week (10/2/17-10/10/17) at $1150 cash only, reduced from $1545 for a quick sale. If I don't sell it this week I will either withdraw the listing or raise it back up to its true value.*Update 10.4.17. Reports show less than 80 New VEPR 12 Shotguns remain available in the US through the exclusive US dealer. After they are gone there are no more available, and none available in the foreseeable future without a change in US politics. Owners Manual and extra factory issued firing pin included in the package. You Can Call Me at seven two zero, 301.5583."

This is the Deluxe model, 24"" barrel, short tang, checkered grip and forearm, factory sling swivels, factory Lyman 56W receiver sight, pistol grip butt plate and stock butt plate. The rifle was appraised today in excellent condition, FMV of $3,500. The rifle was used very little for hunting deer/elk in the '50's, but has been in the gun safe since I was born in 1957. The lettering and engraving are still sharp and legible, the checkering is sharp and unblemished. The blueing is in good condition, faded slightly in some places like the barrel end and sharp edges, and there a couple of very small impressions (dings) in the stock, but overall a very nice looking piece. No repairs, no re-blueing or wood refinishing, no broken or missing parts. I'm willing to ship, buyer pays all fees. Feel free to contact me with questions. Paypal or cash only. No checks, money orders, no trades. I'm in no hurry to sell, so I won't respond to low-ball offers. Thanks for reading."

The Taurus PT 709 Slim is a semi-automatic small-frame pistol chambered for 9mm. The 709 Slim is part of the Slim series and has is very similar to the 740 Slim  Named “Slim” because it is 1.04″ wide—that’s about 0.1″ to 0.2″ smaller than most other small-frame pistols.
Features include three safeties. The first is a trigger safety that prevents the firing pin from punching forward unless the trigger is actually pulled, so if it’s dropped no accidental discharge. A safety switch, just in case, and a lock safety that renders it functionless with a turn of a key. It has an interesting ergonomic design with a thumb and index finger groove on both sides. There is a thumb indent for the action-hand’s grip and a finger groove along the frame just below the slide to place the passive hand’s index finger. And, it has “strike two” capabilities, which means if there is a dud primer just yank back the slide, eject the round and the trigger will maintain trigger pull."
