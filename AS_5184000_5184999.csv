The sights are very easy to pick up and the rifle is just packed with desirable features.My lrice is $700 obo.  I dont really want to budge too much but feel free to negotiate with me.If the side folding stock isnt important to you i can take a few dollars off.  If you only need 2 magazines i can take a few dollars off. If you dont want the angle foregrip or rail covers i can take a little off.Let me know what you want to do.Emails or texts will work better as i work a lot and often cannot answer my phone as im at work.(5ZO) 272-O22OIf you want more pics or more info feel free to ask.  Im not looking for trades but if you really insist i can consider partial trades... but its a real long shot as im really just needing cash.Im already taking a loss on this with the upgrades and magazines and ammo.  So be gentle.

FLIR internals and like I said American made!  The ATN Thor is a piece of junk compared to this.  Also includes sling/molly military grade case and a DVR to record your thermal shoots.  I never used to DVR but it is all there.  The Thermal Scope is MILSPEC and waterproof to a reasonable distance.  The DVR is water resisant.Don't bother trying to scam me.  Cash only.  Will consider partial trades.This will fit any AR-15, AR-10, SCAR, Tavor, bushmaster, colt, HK rifle with picatinny rails."

This is an excellent night vision setup. as you can see in the picture all that's required to mount it is an upside down scope ring so it can be moved from one rifle to another rifle in a matter of minutes with all components mounted on the rail . Even though this is a DIY set up don't be fooled it does better then a lot of unit costing a lot more and one nice thing about it is that you can remove it in the daytime and still have your scope zeroed in as it normally is. this price is for the illuminator shown which will reach out to 150 - 250 yards depending on the light gathering properties of your scope, so obviously a 44 millimeter objective lens is going to do better than a 28 millimeter ect. this setup will outdo the Photron scopes. This setup has been tested and will stay illuminated for four and three quarters hours continuously comes with charger and battery and a battery and chargers for the system and the illuminator.  I have 2 other size illuminators not as powerful but less money and a x2.2 lens for illuminator shown that is twice as powerful and would cost $25 extra ,but other illuminators will cost less ,so you have different options depending on your needs.

Willing to ship to your FFL.Factory Description:Nighthawk Custom is excited not only about the Model T4 for what we designed it as but what the response has been from the consumer market. The 9mm cartridge in a 1911 designed for concealed carry may be the best of both worlds when it comes to muzzle controllability and magazine capacity in a 1911. The T4 contains some of the most evolutionary features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a 3.8” barrel platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8” Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5” or shorter barrel. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast® Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawks popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and recessed with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by Nighthawk. Grips are like the T3 and are thinned for less bulk.-Stainless Steel Frame Standard-Black Nitride Finish-Tritium Dot Front Night Sight-Heine Slant Pro Straight Eight Rear Night Sight-Bull BarrelGo to Nighthawk Custom website and check out the T4.Thank you for looking . . . not wanting any trades."

All used firearms should be inspected by a professional gunsmith for proper and safe function prior to shooting.Our listed 1896/11s are already packaged and ready to go. If you have a question about the condition of the rifle please see the photos in the auction.The Model 1896/11 was a rifle of the 1911 pattern built from an earlier Model 1896. Barrels and sights were replaced and a pistol grip mated to the stock (or a new stock provided) along with a new 6-round magazine and appropriate trigger guard. If the pistol grip is not an obvious add-on an 1896/11 can still be identified by having a serial number under 350,000; all Model 1911 long rifles begin at 355,000.SERIAL NUMBERS WERE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT YEAR THE RIFLE IS (IF THE YEAR HAPPENS TO BE NOTED IN THIS AUCTION). SERIAL NUMBERS WERE ENTERED INTO THE WEBSITE SWISS WAFFEN .COM.The Schmidt - Rubin 1896/11 Rifle or the Model 96/11 was Switzerland's effort to upgrade their 1896 rifles. The original model 1896 fired a black powder propellent cartridge and was chambered in 7.5x53.The upgrades brought this rifle into the 20th century.One of the more popular aspects of these rifles is that they often have a handwritten 'troop tag' hidden under the butt plate made out with the information of the last Swiss Army trooper to have been issued the gun. PLEASE REVIEW THE PICTURES BELOW TO SEE IF THIS RIFLE HAS ONE. These tags were identification tags, placed there by the soldiers who carried the rifles.The standard format for the tags is:Top Line: Name (last,first) & year of birthMiddle Line: Unit designationBottom Line: Place of ResidenceHowever, many variations exist and this format is not necessarily standard for all Troop Tags.We do not claim to be experts regarding the markings and/or stamps associated with these rifles, but from our understanding, a ""P"" stamped by itself or with a 2 digit number underneath it mean the rifle was ""Privatized"" after military service. If it has a two digit number under the P that would be the year it was privatized. Some rifles will have an uppercase P either after or below the serial number. Upon retirement from active duty, the retiring Swiss soldier was given the opportunity to keep his service rifle. Rifles so obtained were stamped with the uppercase P near the serial number, and should not be confused with the ""Private"" series of rifles. The ""Private"" series of rifles were manufactured to fill special orders with the factory (such as for export).
