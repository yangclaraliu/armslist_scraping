I purchased this 442 airweight on Sunday July 16th and fired a box of 50 through it that day. The little snubby sat on my dresser for two weeks before I carried it Saturday for the first time. I always carried a glock on my hip or a plastic 380 in my pocket and my new revolver just didn't seem to ""fit"" me. This was my first ever revolver and apparently I'm not the revolver type. It comes with everything it was born with. Somebody needs to give this little guy a home. I spent $450 out the door and I'm losing a little money as always but I'm letting it go. Make me an offer."

Bought from Budk about 6 months ago for 300 bucks plus shipping, selling it because I don't really use it anymore, so my loss your gain. Would prefer to do a face-to-face transaction in a gun store even though this isn't a gun, I just feel better doing exchanges in gun stores. I'd be willing to trade this for cheap guns, though I'm liable to say no. Prefer face-to-face, shipping I'll want 300 dollars.Comes with sword, scabbard, and sword bag."

SA/DA action - you can just ""point & click"" like a revolver.Now, these guns weren't range toys; they were workhorses.  But I suspect this one may not have, unless it was thoroughly re-arsenaled.  Take a look @ the pics & see what I mean.Beautiful little pistol, but I found some other shiny thing I want, am kinda' short on cash & this one's the third one in the family......so adoption is available for $245.  Interested parties please contact me through the Armslist system, or via text at 206-718-BILL (that's '2455 in #s)Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"
