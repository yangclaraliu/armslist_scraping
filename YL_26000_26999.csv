FROM SIGSAUER.COM--
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

on 1/3/2010 Amazing Scope This is an amazing scope. The glass is great, adjustment are perfect. Very durable and well built without being too heavy or large. FFP with Mil adjustments make for a great combination. Great scope for tactical or hunting applications. For the price, this is one of the best FFP deals around. 

by Urimaginaryfrnd 
on 12/17/2009 Incredible + On a scale of one to five this rates at least a six. There simply is nothing like it in even double its price range. Built solid. First Focal Plane. Tenth mil clicks. This has been reviewed by some of the best shooters I know and it is AWESOME. You simply can't go wrong with this scope if you can work with a top power of 9x. This is a great hunting scope a great tactical scope a great patrol rifle scope. Fairly compact and easy to use. You won't be disappointed in the value you get with this scope, nothing else comes close.

on 12/8/2009 Best deal going! Would rate it higher than ""5"" if I could. Best value going in a medium-powered FFP scope. Tracking is perfect, glass is very good, controls are where they should be, scope is very well built but not bulky or unnecessarily heavy, reticle is entirely usable at both ends of the power range (not true of many - if not most - FFP optics.) Great scope for medium-weight tactical or hunting rifle. For the price, nothing beats it. Would like illumination.

Minor holster wear, as I carried this for 2 years.

The only modification I have done is replaced the mainspring with the 'Delta' model spring. That means the double action and single action trigger pulls have been reduced! Cut off about 3 lbs on double and 1.5 lbs on the single, respectively. The original mainspring comes with the package, although I'd advise to never put it back in. Much easier to shoot the way I have it now.

If all this was factory new. Retail rate would be pushing 900 to 1000 bucks. I'm starting at $625 or OBO. Ammo is not included but I will throw it in for 25 bucks. Normal box of Rangers in a 50 count would push $35.

8 round cylinder, target sights, ported barrel, heavyweight X-frame.

UGLY gun. Previous owner took it on camping trips in the mountains and fired hot handloads out of it. It is beat to hell. Then he did a botched cold bluing job to cover up some of the scratches and scuffs. It is UGLY and it is loose but it is safe to shoot and incredibly accurate. I've fired 150 rounds with no issues whatsoever.

Timing is perfect. Lockup at full cock is solid. Forcing cone looks fine. Outstanding DA trigger pull. Great sights. Heavy frame and ported barrel means minimal recoil.

I bought this piece last year for $300. I am asking 275 and will throw in a brand new shoulder holster (left handed) and 265 rounds of factory .357 FREE.

Ammo is: 10 rds of Black Talon
25 rds Hornaday 140 gr FTX
20 rds 158 gr Speer Gold Dot
10 rds 125 gr Hydra Shok
50 rds Federal 125 gr Hi-Shok
100 rds Winchester 158 gr JHP
50 rds Federal truncated lead (Luballoy coated)

Taurus 608 has a 4"" ported barrel and target sights.

Well over $200 worth of US factory manufactured ammunition included for FREE.

The Taurus is beat to hell, but the frame is not cracked or bent and the timing is fine. I can put all 8 rounds in a playing card at 30 feet, and I'm a lousy shot. Shoots tight groups. I fired 100 rounds of full strength 357 ammo through it and it did not misfire, spit lead, or blow up so I am presenting it as safe to fire.

The rubber monogrip is a little loose. There is some cylinder play but it is not excessive.  Forcing cone is intact. Star is a little worn. This is a great BEATER gun to leave in your cabin, camper, or truck. It is reliable, and it does not matter if it gets dinged up. I do not know how much life is left in it, but it is probably fine for another 300+ rounds. This is a BEATER backup gun for you to stow somewhere and forget about until it is needed. Too damn heavy to carry, in my opinion.

Will swap for a Makarov or a Star 9mm.

Stainless steel Colt Officers ACP with black walnut grips.

45 ACP -- the stainless version can fire +P ammunition, although it is not recommended.

Stock -- no modifications.

This is probably my favorite pistol, but it is not lefty-friendly, it is heavier than I like, and the recoil out of the 3.5"" barrel is more than I care for. Love this pistol, but it does not suit me well enough so it is up for sale.

Also included are 6 magazines, several sets of grips, assorted replacement parts, and a LOT of quality ammunition.

1 Colt 6rd mag
2 Mecgar 6 rd mags
2 Wilson Combat 7 rd low profile mags
1 Wilson Combat 7 rd standard mag
Wilson Combat also makes an 8 rd mag for the OM.
Standard 1911 mags will fit and function in the OM, but you should never use them as it can potentially damage the ejector.

2 sets of stag grips and 1 set of synthetic pearl grips are included.

Replacement recoil system and bushing are included, as are a variety of springs and spare parts.

5 A-Zoom Snap Caps

50 rds Winchester SXZ Personal Protection Lubalox HP
20 rds +P Pow'R Ball 165 gr


This Stainless Officers Model is in excellent condition, and I've fired about 200 rounds of assorted ammo with only a single FTF, which was a Speer Gold Dot HP with exposed soft lead at the tip, so don't carry it with Gold Dots. Golden Sabers run great.

Prior owner purchased this new in 1984, fired a single box of ammo through it, and left it in his nightstand for the next 25 years. Unfortunately, he failed to wipe it down first, so there is some faint pitting on the upper portion of the grip safety. There is a tiny ding on the side of the front sight. Also, when I removed the original grips to put on the stag one of the bushings came out and is stuck in the grip. Internet told me it is a PITA to remove the bushing from the grip without damaging it, so I just bought a new set of bushings and screws. Original grips can be put back on easily enough by unscrewing the replacement grip bushing, and that is what I'll probably do prior to sale. Aside from that, it is in excellent condition.

I'm asking $850 FIRM for the OM, mags, grips, spare parts, and 500+ rounds of ammo (in a 50 caliber ammo can). CASH ONLY. FTF in the Denver Metro area.

This pistol was bought new by my grandmother in the 1970s and kept under her pillow for years.  I don't think that she ever fired it.  It came to me and I cleaned it well and have used it for target plinking.  It is a really great gun. This gun consistently shot very tight groups.

Problem with this gun.  
On my last time shooting this pistol, I could not find normal .22 ammunition and bought a brand name high-power load.  I cleaned the gun well, and the first 20 shots or so were perfect, but then it was not so perfect. 

To the best of my understanding of the incident (last month), the round did not fully seat (maybe the shell casing was oversize?), preventing the action from locking down fully. The result was an open breach detonation of the cartridge. This does happen with hand loaded rounds, but seldom with new factory rounds.  

I had the gun inspected by a gunsmith and he recommended changing the barrel, because it may be out of spec and that is why the shell would not lock down. There was no damage to the shooter, but the incident was a shock.  
The gun is intact, with no broken parts or visible metal damage, but I am selling it for repair or parts only.  Warning:  this gun had a mis-fire shell in it and is not guaranteed to be in perfect working condition.

Included: ERMA RX-22, one magazine, an Iver Johnson TP-22 user manual.
Price:  $75.00. Local pickup in Alabama unless by personal arrangement, such as shipping via FFL.

These are de-milled bullets, so I can't insure that they will all light.  When I bought them, I didn't think that they would light unless you loaded them hot, but I've had 90%+ of them light beyond 100 yards using a modest load of WC844T.

The gun has about 700-800 rounds through it, mostly from CCW training.  It was a daily carry piece until about a year ago when I changed jobs and the dress code wasn't conducive to carrying a larger compact concealed.

The picture is a stock photo, not the actual gun for sale here but mine is identical.  Black polymer frame with matte stainless slide.  The gun is in perfect condition, the only wear is very slight on the side of the breach block which is normal for a USP with a few hundred rounds through it.  Everything else on the gun looks and works like new, it's built like a tank and has never jammed, misfired or been anything other than 100% reliable.

We can meet at the FFL of your choice if you're local or I can ship to your FFL, in which case you will be responsible for the actual shipping fees and all FFL fees.

Please make an offer but be reasonable.  If you don't know what these guns are worth, check out GunBroker for prices on used USP Compacts.  I'm not looking to get rich, just make enough to buy a subcompact replacement.  I will consider a trade for Kahr PM9 or P380."
