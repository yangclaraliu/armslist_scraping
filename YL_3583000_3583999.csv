Will consider trades, but rather sell.  This is a rarely seen version of the Glock 22 that was manufactured in late December 2008 and has only seen 600 rounds through it since new when it was issued to me personally when I was attached to a local PD prior to returning to the USMC.  These were essentially GIVEN AWAY to us when fat cops complained about them causing damage to their FAT uniforms because of the rough texture (like stipling).  Feel free to email offers, and all trades considered."

Has rubber molded pistol grip with full length stock, metal fully adjustable ghost ring sights, sight rail, red bright fiber optic guarded front sight, 20 inch barrel, barrel is threaded to accept Berretta style choke tubes, sling swivels, and has a magazine tube extension to bring it's capacity up to 8 rounds.

If you're looking for a tactical shotgun this is it.

The 20 inch barrel is only 2 inches longer than an 18 inch barrel so it can still be easily used for home defense.  Perfectly reliable as a pump action shotgun.  It has less than a case of ammo through it, but has had absolutely no issues at all and feels very solid and operates smoothly.  Doesn't have the wobbly feel that many other shotguns have when operating the pump.

What initially lead me to buy this shotgun was that it has a 20 inch barrel threaded to accept choke tubes.  It comes with a cylinder choke muzzle break/breaching break, but I bought a flush mount cylinder choke and a modified choke tube for it.  All 3 chokes come with it.  The 20 inch barrel gives much better velocity and patterning compared to an 18 inch barrel.  I patterned it side by side with a Remington 870 with a modified choke in an 18 inch barrel and this Tristar held a much better pattern out to 40 yards.  I have used it to shoot a round of sporting clays and the gun did not struggle at all when put to the challenge (would have done much better if the person behind it wasn't such a bad shot).

Looking to sell it with the red dot that's mounted on it, with the 3 choke tubes, and the magazine extension.  I know you can buy a Chinese made shotgun for $200 bucks, but it's not going to be as nicely made as this one.  Once you pick up the shotgun and feel how sturdy it is in your hands you'll understand why I'm asking $350 for the shotgun and everything that comes with it.

I have a nice 6x Springfield Armory Government scope with bubble level and rangefinder reticle. No box but i have the book. I have a Springfield Armory gen 3 scope mount. The original receiver mount screw stripped but they sent me a new one for it and it works great. Lastly is a 30rd M1A magazine. I do not know the maker but it is well made and looks identical to the 20rd mags except its longer. All these parts work well. I just decided the gun was way too heavy with these parts on it. The scope and mount put is around 12 lbs with a 20 rd mag. And a 30 is even worse of course. I have these priced very cheap compared to what they would actually cost. The mount alone sells for $125-$175 depending. The scopes were very expensive at the time and are made in Japan and have good light gathering ability. The mags are all over the place on price. The rings do not go with this. I need them for another rifle. Feel free to ask any questions. Call 479-530- 5 nine 4 one before 10 pm or text any time. Thanks for looking.

Had this gun since I was a kid, it just feels right, it's light and well balanced.  shot my first bear with it when I was 10 years old.  This gun was given to me by my step dad who used it as a big game guide in Alaska.  This gun has seen some action, it's 100% reliable and the action is smooth as butter.  Has the bullet counter, lever action safety and desired pre 1 million serial.  Also has the typical behind the Tang hairline crack in the stock but I had it professionally repaired.  Bluing is in decent condition not great but not bad.  gun has a wonderful patina to it,  a real gem.  Sadly I don't hunt anymore so I'd like to pass it on to someone else to enjoy.  Leupold scope is a 3x9 and is included.

ssberg Model 190 - A Shotgun that can Kick Chuck Norris' Ass



Mossberg, vintage, bolt-action, shotgun, 1950s, Michigan Upland Hunting, 
Mossberg's amazing arm-lengthening Model 190
It's not often that a product comes along that is completely ground-breaking in its technology, and when it does, it draws attention. Sort of like everyone admiring an iPhone5, hunters constantly point towards my shotgun and say, ""What the heck is that thing?""

""Why, it's a Mossberg model 190,"" I answer. ""Thank you for asking.""

It's hard to decide where to begin describing the many innovative features of the Mossberg model 190. From muzzle to butt, it screams ""1950.""  Actually, it was made from 1950 to 1955.

Let's start at the butt.  The butt of the beautifully matte-finished genuine walnut Monte Carlo one-piece pistol grip stock of this beauty is capped with a non-recoil-absorbing piece of the hardest plastic I've ever seen; quite possibly that 1950's miracle of polymerization, Bakelite.

The stock itself has such a plain finish that even dings, chips, or scratches do not diminish it. They only add to the gun's individuality.

Then there's the action. The engineers at Mossberg thought long and hard about how to improve a hunter's marksmanship before they decided that a bolt-action was the ticket. After all, since a bolt-action is so slow there's no chance for a second shot, you bet a hunter's going to try his best to make the first shot count. Now that's innovation. However, just in case you are hunting three-toed sloth, and do have time for a follow-up shot, the Model 190 comes with a two-round box magazine.

The gun comes chambered for the awesomely powerful 16 gauge 2 3/4"" shot shells, or if the hunter wants even less power, it will accept 2"" or 2 1/4 inch ammunition.


Mossberg, vintage, bot-action, shotgun, 1950s, Michigan Upland Hunting, 
Innovative vice-grip operated choke
At the other end of the 26"" barrel is the variable C-Lect-Choke that allows the hunter to change the choke from Improved Cylinder to Full Choke with just a few twists of the wrist (or vice-grips if you're not Chuck Norris). This adjustable choke is so far ahead of its time there isn't another gun manufacturer that uses it. Well, actually, Mossberg stopped using it sometime in the 1960s, too, I think.

But perhaps the most innovative feature of this gun is its weight. While original company advertising materials claim it weighs a mere 6 1/4 lbs., that is at the beginning of the day. This gun has the amazing ability to get heavier as the day goes on. This feature is especially handy (pardon the pun) to hunters with freakishly short arms, as after carrying this gun a couple days, their arms will be measureably longer. Normal hunters, however, may need to buy shoes with thicker soles to keep their knuckles from dragging"

Basically it’s like two rifles in one - you can have one that completely stores in the stock of the rifle and you can carry in a backpack and even floats or you can put it together as a lightweight and very accurate rifle oriented toward range shooting or carrying assembled in the woods.  

Note that you can get a new AR-7 with an MSRP of $290 and likely on sale for $250.  However finding all of the parts to make it in the configuration I am offering adds up significantly and takes time.  I’d be happy to share a price break down, but the right buyer for this understands it is at the right price for what they are getting.

I special ordered the gun new & I'm the only owner . The round count is less than 300 I'm sure & you can't find a single scratch in the gun yet not even the deflector . These guns are made up of Billet Titanium & Carbon Fiber . The gun is only about 7.2 lbs & is the lightest AR platform 308 on the market that I am aware of . Watch Nutnfancy's review on YouTube and you will see .5 MOA or less accuracy out of it . The upper & lower receivers are made from Billet Titanium & the barrel is 416 R Stainless Steel with Carbon Fiber Wrap Shilen Barrel . The gun came factory with a $195 Billet Titanium Flashider on it & I also bought there $195 Billet Titanium Muzzle Brake for it so it comes with both . I also special ordered it with Tungsten Finish on the upper & lower receivers & 13"" Carbon Fiber Rails . The gun was $3,300 plus tax which made it over $3,550 new . With all of the extras listed I easily have $4500 or so in this gun .I will sell the gun put back to factory for $2750 or I will sell it with everything except the J.P Silent Capture Spring & Diamondhead BattleSite's for $3,000 or i will include everything for $3250 . This Gun hasn't had more than 300 rounds ran threw it & you can tell the moment you see it . There's not a scratch on it & it's as clean as new .  There is absolutely no way you could get a gun this nice for less so I don't want to listen to low ball offers . This is a serious gun for serious buyers . The gun is as light as a little High End .223 AR15 & more beautiful than anything you have ever seen . I'm not really interested in trades so if you have a offer it better be very good . About the only guns I can think of off the top of my head I might consider are a very nice Wilson Combat 1911 or J.P Enterprise AR or PWS AR15.

It has been very well cared for and is a very nice upper for precision work.

Everything else is unchanged from the original factory upper.

The overall condition of the upper is very good and only has some small blemishes to the finish from handling/installing accessories. Can easily be touched up with alumi black.

Second is a slightly smaller skinner model. The blade measures 3.5"" and is 6.25"" overall. This is an original made by Rudy as well, but it looks brand new. I don't believe it has ever even been sharpened except from the factory. Asking $500 shipped"

Will throw in 140 rounds of ammo (100 FMJ and 40 rnds of Hornady JHP) for an extra $75. No, I'm not selling the ammo by itself unless the gun sells first - if the gun doesn't sell I still need ammo for it.


Prices are firm - will not dicker, will not drop. NO TRADES.

First come first served, no holds. Face to face with Oregon residents 21 years old (yes I know the law allows 18 for private sale, but *I* am only comfortable selling to 21+) only, I'll ask to see your ID. As usual no felons, no wife beaters, no one crazier than me. Not really willing to drive far for this sale - I'm using up almost all available daylight to get the damn boat and trailer finished before the monsoons come.

593,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3583593,For Sale/Trade:  Custom CZ-52 w/ Novak Target Sights and ammo,"Arlington, Seattle, Washington",$ 400,"Listed On: Monday, October 20, 2014",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"PRICE DROP for quick sale. Will be put back in the safe after Friday if not sold. This fine single-action handgun was made in 1954 and imported in the early 90's (no import marks). Included are three magazines with aftermarket extended floorplates for fast reloads, the original holster, and the option to include 520 rounds of ammo. The CZ-52 is widely accepted to be a more robust design than the TT-33, utilizing the roller delayed-blowback action like the MG-42, HK G3, and MP5. The original rollers have been replaced with new hardened steel ones. The original firing pin has also been replaced with a hardened steel model that won't break when dry fired. The original tiny fixed sights were milled off and 1911 style Novak adjustable target sights installed- the difference is amazing compared to the factory sights. The original Bakelite grips were sealed and then painted black. The parkerized finish on the frame is in 90%+ original  condition and the slide has been coated in Dark Parkerizing Gray Alumahyde II rustproof gun coating (properly cured) so it can be carried IWB without worrying about rusting from sweat. Function wise, I have never had any malfunction in 500 rounds. The decocker/safety works properly and the hammer does not contact the firing pin when decocking.

It fires the potent 7.62x25mm tokarev round which will defeat both sides of a threat level IIa bullet proof vest or one side of a level II vest with normal target grade FMJ's. The now banned 320 (of 520) hardened steel core AP rounds I am including will defeat all soft body armor up to level III. These rounds are legal to own in all 50 states, they can just no longer be imported into the country or manufactured.

The gun has a very thin profile and can be concealed as easily and sometimes better than a 1911. If you're expecting bad guys with body armor and want better penetration than a .357 SIG, this is the gun for you. Would make a perfect glove box gun to shoot through glass and sheet metal if needed to. Hollow points are available online if you are concerned about over-penetration.

The ammo available is:
100 rounds of banned Norinco mild steel core non-corrosive FMJ
100 rounds of S&B indoor range safe new production non-corrosive reloadable FMJ
320 rounds of mixed Hintenberger and another European manufacture 1955 and 1962 production hardened steel core AP. The finest 7.62 ammo ever available to civilians, last available in 1990. This ammo is mildly corrosive like most surplus stuff. It is very clean brass cased and berdan primed. I have shot through 1/4"" steel plate like it wasn't there, and I have seen it shred Kevlar helmets.

Besides defense, this is one heck of a fun gun to shoot. It sounds like a .44 magnum going off, and it has the recoil of a .45 1911. Minute of bad guy accuracy out to 150 yards from a bench, and very flat shooting. 9mm luger drop-in conversion barrels are available online.

I'm looking for a new toy, so this one has to go. 

$400 cash for the pistol and three mags and holster.
$600 cash OBO for the above plus all the ammo.

Ammo is not for sale without the gun.

The sights, modern steel upgrades, and magazines are worth $400 alone.

I am open to trades and trades plus cash for firearms and military related equipment, silver, cool stuff etc. What do you have? Worst I can say is no thanks. I am NOT interested in your used SCUBA gear, marijuana grow lights, or fish tanks.

If you are reading this, it's still for sale. 

Will meet at the Tulalip Cabelas in Marysville, WA only. Will ship overnight to your FFL at your expense for $50. Ammo ships separately for $20. 

I am a CPL holder and will only sell to US citizens 18 and older with valid ID and bill of sale. If you have a CPL or WAC card, no bill of sale is necessary.

PSB-AR-FDE Pistol Stabilizing Brace
****** Color is Flat Dark Earth / FDE ********** 

SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter's aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols. 

This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. 

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter. 

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator's forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. 

A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user. 

* ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control. 

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of every SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace goes to support the veterans of HAVA (Honored American Veterans Afield).

My cameras. If you cannot travel to this place, there will be no deal. Not being rude and if we talk you will perfectly understand why I am doing this and there MAY even be something in it for the buyer also. * update* Due to some hateful emails and other hateful contacts, I will say that one of the reasons I will only meet in this manner is because I had an anti gun group attempt to purchase a handgun from me using a convicted felon as the buyer. I only caught on because after I checked his TN DL  he asked me ""how are you going to check to make sure I'm not a felon?"" The only reason to ask was for a microphone. Upon refusal to sell he left in a hurry along with another vehicle that was at the meet place before I arrived. I recognized one of the passengers as one of the I-teams cameramen. Didn't want to have to add all that but people are calling me all kinds of names without even giving me a chance to explain the situation. There are many other examples. Armslist is NOT what it used to be. In some ways it is worse than craigslist. The only major difference I see is people 90% of people on armslist are asking at or above what it cost NEW and there are many firearms on here I have been seeing for over 2 years.  Thanks"

One of the new features includes the introduction of our new one-piece fully machined mainspring / magwell combination cut from a 2 ½"" block of tool steel. Rather than coming to a sharp point at the base of the grip, the integrated mainspring housing / magwell is rounded for comfort while not sacrificing any grip length. It assists in reducing print through clothing while carrying concealed. You will not find a stronger part.Sights are the new Heinie Straight 8 which also allows the rear sight to be used to cycle the slide with one hand should the need arise. The front sight is the popular Tritium night sight, for the ""figure 8"" sight picture in low light situations.Three ball-radius cuts run the full length of the slide top to direct your eyes quickly to the front sight.The rear cocking serrations are a series of eight ball radius cuts per side instead of our normal serration pattern. The rear of the slide is hand-serrated at 40lpi which matches the rear of the Heinie Sight. The barrel bushing is chamfered around the edges. The front of the slide has been recessed where the front cocking serrations would normally be and the barrel crowned to complete the custom look.
Grips are the impressive Coco Bolo Nighthawk Raptor laser-etched logo.

Look no further. Up for sale is my Sig P238 Nitron .380ACP

Everyone is pretty familiar with the P238s, they are based on Colts design, in fact it IS Colts design but was sold to SIG. They are available with regular sights or night sights, and this particular pistol does have the SIGLITE night sights. The ""Nitron"" name is not just a fancy name for an all black pistol, but rather Nitron is the name of Sigs proprietary finish that is on this model. It is an ion bonding finish which means it actually chemically bonds to the metals, it does not just coat them like a Cerakote or Duracoat. This makes it more durable, and nearly impossible to simply scratch. This finish will hold up for years, even with every day carry.
This particular gun has had just enough rounds through it to break it in an ensure its reliability. Around 200 or so. Runs like a top, absolutely no issues.

Includes factory 6 round SIG mag, Sig Extreme 7 round mag with pinky extension ($40), kydex holster, factory hard case, and paperwork.

It has been in the climate-controlled gun safe it's whole life, with no wear or damage.  This is the short barreled carbine with the saddle ring and deluxe walnut stock.  I would call it 99%+, with no damage, dings, dents or anything bad that I can see.  It has always been wrapped in a gun sock, and never left dirty to corrode.  The gun is completely stock, with no modifications.  This is the AE series, angle eject, so you can mount a scope on it.  The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope rings, with the mounting holes still retaining the threaded ""plugs"".  Also comes with the original manual and a schematic/parts catalog.  I believe the carbine is as close to ""new"" as you would be likely to find!  I have fired it a few times over the years, probably under 150 rounds.  It shoots .44 special as well, with almost no felt recoil. It is really fun to shoot and just feels really solid in your hands.  It's all steel, no cheap aluminum in the receivers like the some of the reproduction 94's.  And best of all it's made in the USA!  

Some attributes of the Winchester 1894:

- The Winchester Model 1894 was the first commercial repeating rifle built to be used with smokeless powder.  The action is inherently strong, smooth and dependable.

- The Winchester 1894 holds the record for best-selling high-powered rifle in U.S. history.

- Lots of steel and wood. It's just made the old fashioned way. Lots of durable steel parts that feel solid and reliable.

- Incredible design. John Moses Browning really outdid himself when he designed the Model 94. The mechanism is smooth and precise. The ergonomics are practically perfect. The action is strong and simply not prone to wearing out.

- Solid lockup. The John Browning design was created to handle the newest type of ammunition in the world at the time: smokeless powder loads. And it is still handling them. The Model 94 has been chambered in some of the meanest calibers ever developed for fast action in brusy conditions.

- It's a lifetime gun. Some rifles come and go, but a Model 94 just builds a lifetime of memories. It is one gun that your family will appreciate long after you are gone. It's a gun your great grandson will learn to shoot with. Timeless.  

- Unfortunately, after 112 years, production ceased in 2006.

Please e-mail me with your phone number if you want to come take a look. I'm located in North Skagit County, but I travel south to Seattle from time to time. I'm going to want to see a CWP and ID for the private transfer.

I'm not really looking for any trades at this time, but it never hurts to ask! Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

I have for sale an Arsenal/FIME SGL 21-61 in 7.62x39 that has black poly furniture (fixed stock)

These are made on Russian receivers converted by FIME, who now does all of the Russian rifles for Arsenal due to political reasons. (Google for more info)

The rifle has approximately 600 rounds through it and is still in great condition minus the usual wear from use. 

I lost the crappy 5 round mag it came with so I will include 1 Tapco 30rd Mag. I will also throw in 60rds of Wolf Ammo so you can try it out ASAP!

As you probably know these have been banned and I have seen people asking for ridiculous prices for these rifles. I'm looking to get some money to put into a different AK so if you have an Arsenal SLR-107FR or an Arsenal SLR-107CR I would be interested in trading. 

I am asking $1250 cash. please send me an email anytime if you wish to know more.

Just got it last week and have only put 80 rounds through it. This is the new version that came out this year without the laser. Has real usable sights unlike msot handguns of this type and a slide stop, totally reliable even with steel cased ammo. Smooth trigger, easily pocket carriable but its a bit too small for my hands, so I'd like to trade it for something a bit bigger. Comes with its box and everything it came with, two 6 round magazines, and for the right trade I can include the remainder of the .380 I have left, around 150 rounds.

Primarily looking for a Ruger SR9c or LC9, or a S&W J Frame, particularly a 638, maybe an M&P Shield, but I'm open to similar guns. Prefer 9mm but might consider .40 as well. Can add a little cash depending on what you have. No Kel Tecs please, or rifles or shotguns.

It is in 98% condition as you can see in the detailed pics (tiny little gouge on the raised thumb rest on the grips). The bluing is in EXCELLENT condition, mirror like if i may.
Some info on the handgun:
-They are a variant of the Walther PPK, with some changes to the safeties and an aluminum frame.
-Chambered in 9x18 Makarov, 6+1 capacity
-They are the smallest pistol chambered in 9x18 MAK imported into the US
-Pretty much the same design as the FEG PA-63s that are available, but with a shorter barrel and a shorter grip.
-It is a more recent production of the FEG RK-59.
-Very few of these were imported into the states

In the pics, I have it next to a M&P9 Shield to compare the size. This is most definitely a pocket carry gun.

Not looking to sell, just looking what people have to offer in a trade, I'm perfectly fine with keeping the firearm if nothing really comes my way.

Comes with 2 6rd mags, original box and paperwork, and 50rds of Tula 94gr FMJ.
