46,http://www.armslist.com/posts/18046,For Sale:  WTS: Pre-ban Colt / Univ Simmonds AR15 20 round mags / clips,"All, New York, United States",$ 20,"Listed On: Friday, January 1, 2010",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Yes I know they are magazines ( not clips ) 

I have for sale: true preban factory Colt AR-15 mags and Univ / Simmonds Ind mags with absolutely no dates or restriction ( LEO / military etc ) stamped on them.

20 round mags are more rare than 30 rounders and are much better at the range / shooting from a bench etc etc. These will function just fine in any Rock River Arms - BushMaster - Colt - Olympic Arms - DPMS etc etc ...

They are in good- used condition ( see pics below ) no dents and the feed lips are all fine, just finish wear on the outside of the mag body itself ( common with these ). I function tested 20-30 random mags in a Colt M4 LE6920 and all performed flawless. Most are Colt mfg mags, some are Adventure Line / or other manuf. All are true mil-spec USGI preban magazines.

I have approx 20 Colt mags left and approx 50 Simmonds / Universal mags left ( same exact pre-ban mag as the Colt's and made on the same exact tooling ) All orders from today forward will be a 4-1 ratio on the mags. Orders of 5 which seem to be the most popular with everyone will be 4 Simmonds / Universal mags and 1 Colt mag. As stated - they are the exact same mag and look identical in everyway ( except the base plate stamp says Simmonds - Universal vs Colt ). If you are wanting 10 or 20 mags .... the same 4 to 1 ratio applies: 8 Simmonds / 2 Colts ( order of 10 ) or 16 Simmonds / 4 Colts ( order of 20 ). The Simmonds mags are actually more rare than the Colts and are actually worth more and far more desirable to collectors. The price stays the same at $20ea mag.


Yes I am from WA state and yes I am familiar w/ firearm laws and know that NY - MA / other New England area residents have to use preban mags manuf'd prior to '94 I believe ( basically pre- assault weapons ban era )

My price is $20ea.

I will check to see how many fits in a USPS flat rate Priority mail box ( I am guessing around 25 or so ). Possible $ discount for buying more than 20 mags.

Buyer ( you ) covers the shipping costs and payment is via USPS money order only. No PayPal and no personal checks.

I found these mags locally via an estate sale and figured I would offer them for sale here.

E-mail me at REDACTED and please include a contact phone number in your reply.

edited to add: All buyers need to be in compliance with your district / state laws regarding high-capacity mags.

Here is the list of what it comes with. 

1. The rifle itself is a Ruger black synthetic semi-automatic Carbine with a Black Matte finish. 
2. One standard Ruger 10 round rotary clip 
MSRP is $277.00
http://www.ruger-firearms.com/products/1022Carbine/specSheets/1151.html

3. One 25 round Banana plastic Hot-lips clip (clear color).
MSRP is $19.97
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/MAG412-36.html

4. Two 10 round Steel-lipped Hot-lips clips (clear color). 
MSRP is $16.12 + 16.12 = 32.24
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/23973-36.html

5. Two 30 round regular clips. (smoke color)(These are okay but are NOT the best clips available). 
MSRP is $13.99 + 13.99 = 27.98
http://www.cactustactical.com/osc/eagle-international-round-1022-magazine-p-1826.html

6. Hot-lips speed loader. (It is a little fussy with the 30 round clips but it does work). 
MSRP is $24.59
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/23975-1.html

7. Double-Muzzle Brake and Flash hider. This thing is always on backorder it seems and it took me about four months to get a hold of one that didn't cost more then 25 bucks. I'm only charging $19.97 like they sell it for. 
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/RGR041-1.html

8. Leapers Tactical Quad Rail. 
MSRP is $39.97
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/RGR020-1.html

9. RedHead Pursuit Deluxe Red Dot Sights with Multiple Reticle feature. There are four sight types; 5 MOA, 10 MOA, Cross Hair, and Circle X. I am not charging what this scope is worth because I bought it with a discount because the circle-x feature doesn't work. (For some reason it has completely filled with what ever light that the scope uses so there is no open space in the circle. The rest of the features work fine though, and have been for the past year. I never use any but the smallest dot anyway because if it's any bigger it becomes distracting and takes your eye off the target.) 
MSRP is $99.99
http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_64993_425001003_425000000_425001000_425-1-3

10. Leapers UGT Multi Function Universal Folding Bipod. I am leaving the adaptor on my 30-06 so just the bi-pod comes with the 22. Because of that, I'm taking $10.00 off the price.
MSRP is $29.97
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/BIPOD102-1.html

11. Coleman flashlight that I mounted with weaver rails. (It shines at 115 Lumens and is made with an Aerospace grade aluminum body so it is light weight. It also runs off of AA Batteries so you don't need to buy those really expensive ones.) 
MSRP is $24.97 for flashlight plus $10.00 for weaver rails. 
http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=13029914

12. Vertical Handrail (I have the bi-pod on it in the picture but I can put one with it.)
MSRP is $19.97
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/ARR190-7.html

13. A soft Read Head rifle case with a side pocket for gear. This thing is big enough to 
pack all the range gear you could ever need for a 22 rifle. I can't find it online but I know that I bought in at Walmart on sale for $15.00. It was regularly $25.00. I am selling it for $15.00. If you don't want it then I'll keep it and take $15.00 off of the price.

14. A swinging target system that resets itself, so no more getting up and taping more paper targets. That was always a real buzz kill for me! 
MSRP is $10.47
https://www.huntingfishingdirect.com/do-all-outdoors-.22-caliber-spinner.html

15. Ruger pistol speed loader. I bought this thinking it would work with my Dads 22 pistol but I had forgotten that his is a compact so it won't work. It's brand new!!!
MSRP is $24.97
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/GNS127-1.html

 If you are local I'll give you a really good deal on some 22 ammo too. Price is FIRM! So DON""T lowball me! As you can see, there is $692.09 worth of gear. I'm not charging for the amount of time it took to get all of this stuff and install it. I am also taking off $92.09 because it is very slightly used. I've put less then 2,000 rounds through it and have cleaned it every time I brought it back from the range. If you want it, I'll throw in the rods and tips for cleaning it for an extra 5 bucks. I have too much time, effort, and money invested in this to give it away at some ridiculously low price. It is a reliable weapon that is worth every penny that was put into it. If I can't get back out of it what I put into it then I won't sell it. I know that a lot of people say bigger is better in weapon size but with the current political situation who knows when it will become illegal to own those ""big"" guns. This type of rifle is a small enough caliber that it will be legal long after any other weapon. Thus, it is the perfect small game and survival gun. 
I reserve the right to close the sale at any time.
The buyer is responsible for all FFL fees and shipping fees.
If anybody is looking to trade, I am interested in AK's but will consider any weapon. 

Thank you for looking!!!"

Walther PPS - More Conceal, Less Carry

The Walther Police Pistol Slim (PPS) model narrows the margin between concealment and confidence by packing Walther innovation into an unbelievable 1.04 inch profile. It's amazing how much professional-grade design actually fits into this lightweight sub-compact. Available in either 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS packs in more power. All in all, the PPS embodies both the legendary quality and tradition of innovation that make it not just a great pistol - but a great Walther pistol.

PPS Power - Small Frame, Large Caliber

In 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS has several notable features aimed at better fit and safe performance in its narrow dimensions. From your choice of perfect-fitting backstrap (small or large) to our patented QuickSafeT innovation, no one packs in the power and features like Walther:

* Ambidextrous Magazine Release
* Includes 1 Magazine
* Loaded Chamber & Cocking Indicators
* Small & Large Backstrap
* Trigger Safety
* Internal Striker Safety
* Walther QuickSafeT Safety

9mm Caliber
7 Round Magazine Included (6 and 8 Round Mags Available)

.40S&W Caliber
6 Round Magazine Included (5 and 7 Round Mags Available)

PPS Attraction - Flat Out Better Features

Walther QuickSafeT
Simply remove the QuickSafeT backstrap - without it the pistol cannot be fired. Walther QuickSafeT is maximum security made easy.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast.  Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling and A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment. Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564).  Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

Just spent $144.00 at a gunsmith making sure this is in excellent working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube. I also run some 120 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

Let me know what you have and I'll see if we can come to an agreement."

It is my understanding that these are all the parts you can get from SA, last time I checked, you can't buy the extractor yet.  The numbers correspond to the part # in the XD manual, if you don't have one handy, you can check out the diagram at http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/FIREARMS/springfieldarmory_xd.pdf.

Unfortunately, I had to sell my pistol earlier this year and am hoping to find a good home for these brand new parts.  These are great to have on hand for backup for a competition or HD pistol (don't want to have to wait for parts) or as a complete set of what's available from SA for a preparedness-minded individual.

FROM SIGSAUER.COM--
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This is a huge weapon, when I got it I realized that I bit off more than I could chew. I took it out a couple of times and I really loved it but, I need the money now more than the rifle. So if you are serious about buying this rifle please send me an email with your phone number, I will call you and we can set up a time to meet at ATP and transfer this over to you.

So, if you have been waiting for a good deal wait no more because it is right here. I look forward to meeting a happy buyer. *EDIT* In the first picture it looks like there are scratches on the gun, this is just oil. I didn't notice it until I posted this picture. This rifle has no scratches on it, the oil rubbed right off. You will be able to see that there are no scratches on it before you buy it. I'm not trying to screw anyone, this is alot of money for this rifle and you will be able to see it before you pay for it. I am not lying, it's only oil and it rubbed right off. When I first saw the pic after I posted it I was like WTF? Then I saw that it was just oil from last time it was cleaned. Whew, relief."

This gun has two safeties built into it. it has a trigger safety just like the Glock has. plus it also has a grip safety making it even safer than a Glock.. this gun conceals incredibly well for concealed carry. it has a front rail if you want to mount a light or a laser.
I will only do the transaction selling this gun to somebody in a gun store that will record the sale of the gun... in less that person has a ((concealed carry permit)) then I will do transaction privately with a signed bill of sale with carry permit numbers"
