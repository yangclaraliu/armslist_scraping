Here is a description from the manufacturer's website:

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  five great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

It comes with an Osprey 13.5x1LH piston. From what I understand, it is the same piston system as the SWR Octane, so you are able to run this on that suppressor if you wish. This is a direct drop in to a P226 9mm, and will work on a .45, .40 or 9mm suppressor. The price is $240 shipped via paypal gift or MO. 

I know someone is going to ask how many rounds have been through this setup but to be honest, I don't know. Let's say 5000 but it doesn't really matter. You can get 100,000 rounds out of a 9mm barrel, so the round count is irrelevant."

If you're not familiar with this pistol, here's some info...

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

It is probably safe to say more big game has been taken with H4831 than any other powder. Bruce Hodgdon was the first supplier to introduce this popular burning rate in 1950. Since that time it has become a favorite for cartridges like the 270 Winchester, 25-06 Remington, 280 Remington and 300 Winchester Magnum. As an Extreme Extruded propellant it shares the fine quality of insensitivity to hot/cold temperatures, as well as superb uniformity from lot to lot.

Let me finish by stating that these guns routinely go for 1300-1500 stock on gunbroker. And no they don't just sit on there. People who recognize their value actually buy them.  Don't compare them to mak-90s as they are not the same. These are ban era guns  imported from 1994 to 2004.  Maks came after and in much larger quantities, hence the price difference.    And as far as NHMs go, Mine is not a beat up old shooter.  Very well taken care of and let's face it, 200 rounds for a ak is barely a dent in its life. I know the values of my gun and my price is fair, so don't try and convince me otherwise.  You can also power search armslist and you'll see that only 3 are listed and all for the same price. Free free to ask questions. And thanks  for looking."

Google Gun Review:
The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

I have everything needed to shoot this for ~50 rounds (percussion caps are a little low).

It's had 4 cylinders put through it and worked flawlessly(was cleaned after shooting).  I'm interested in a compact or subcompact handgun in .380 or 9mm (caliber really doesn't matter) like a Ruger LCP or S&W bodyguard. Manufacturer doesn't really matter. I'm also interested in an entry level bolt gun in .223 or 7.62x39. All trades will be considered.

Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.

This is the ultimate tactical style 22, it blows away the S&W MP15-22, and all others. If you are not familiar with these check out the link below. MSRP on it is $650 from Ruger and they are hard to come by. This one will hold its value and no 10/22 collection is complete without one. All factory built with standard 10/22 reliability inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis. Super accurate rifle, with a true free floated heavy barrel straight from Ruger. This is the better model with the threaded barrel and collapsable stock (not the California legal version). Also has Ruger brand flip-up sights. Never been fired, comes brand new in box with everything, and still in the plastic. Takes all 10/22 mags and even internal upgrades, because it has all standard 10/22 internal components. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for a high end handgun for it, but I will consider all offers for any other cool/interesting trades that you may have.

Comes with  tactical sling with GG&G mount. Cosmetically  its got scuffs and some scratches but it was a police issued 590 A1. This thing is a beast of a machine and is being adopted by law enforcement and military nationally. It is one of the most durable guns I've ever owned. Definitely not a safe queen.
It has a hefty adjustable ghost ring battle rear sight and a front post sight as well that can be changed for after market sights,(not a cheap bead sight) Its 8 +1 if you use low brass 2 3/4.
 It has the speed feed stock that stores 4 additional shells. 
If you don't want to pay retail+shipping+FFL fees+ tax then you understand this is a bargain. 
  I can send more pics upon request. Must be willing to sign firearm bill of sale that I will bring.
