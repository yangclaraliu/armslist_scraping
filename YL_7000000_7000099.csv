The MDE is extremely well made, and the fit and finish is right up there with Seecamp, in my opinion.  The felt recoil is really light compared to other pocket .380's, and it's extremely accurate for such a small pistol.  These were not mass produced like the LCP, TCP and others, and therefore are somewhat rare...those who own them seem to keep them.  Cash only please, show Missouri ID and sign my bill of sale.  Please feel free to email me with questions, or for additional images.  Thanks for looking."
