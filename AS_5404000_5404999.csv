The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (model 8500 only), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. (Model 8500 only.)   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.     Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®   Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this gun online at www.copsgunshop.net!"

All matching serial nubers except the magazine, a proper blue finish sheet steel variation with aluminum bottom. The right side of the receiver is stamped four times. The metal finish shows high point holster wear. Mechanically fine. The bore shows some light wear but minimal or no corrosion. The name Nick is very lighly rubbed into the metal handle, and written behind the wooden handle.  The last name of Nick is so faint it cannot be read, except under the grip.  I have not removed the grip to read the last name.  Perhaps it is not a last name, it could be a military company nick was in, and i dont even know if Nick was a German Nick, or an American Nick.  I do not know the history of this gun, as i inherited it from my grandfather who was a bomber in WWII.  If the buyer finds out, i would be interested in knowing some of the history.  The only two ways to get a hold of me are calling REDACTED or Email emcdonnel at yahoo dot com."

Has been fired approximately 500 rounds. Comes with many extras. The follow is included: Benelli M1 Super 90 Tactical (sells on gunbroker for $1000 stock), Surefire DSF Shotgun forend/light with box (MSRP $375), 8 shot magizane tube, Pistol grip stock, Mesa Tactical 4 shot holder on stock (MSRP $55), Mesa Tactical 6 shot side saddle with hardware (currently not installed) (MSRP $75), GG&G Tactical charging handle (MSRP $26) and factory charging handle, Carlson's Tactical Breacher Choke Tube (MSRP $55), 3 factory choke tubes Choke tube removal tool extra factory recoil spring, GG&G tactical single point sling (MSRP $30), Magizane barrel clamp with sling attachment point, two point sling, and owners manual.Sorry no trades nor can I sell just the shotgun without the accessories. Buyer must have CCW permit so I can verify you past a back ground check.
The Benelli M1 semi-automatic shotgun based on the proprietary Benelli system, which utilizes the gun recoil and inertia of the moving parts to operate the action. This system was developed by Benelli by the mid-1980s, and is simple and reliable in operation. System utilizes the rotating bolt head with two locking lugs that lock into the barrel extension. The bolt is mounted inside the massive bolt body (bolt carrier), and fixed to it by the locking pin, which allows the bolt head to move slightly forward and back and rotate simultaneously within the bolt body. The massive inertia spring is interposed between the boldbody and head, and separate recoil spring is located in the buttstock, pressing the bolt body forward via the link at its rear. When bolt is in the battery, the locking lugs of the bolt head are engaged with the barrel and locked it. Inertiaspring, pressing on the both bolt body and head, holds the head in the forward position relative to the body. When gun is fired, it recoils and moves backslightly against shoulder of the shooter. Due to the inertia of the bolt body,it resists the initial recoil movement, so the bolt head, locked rigidly with the barrel and the rest of the gun, moves back relative to the bolt body,compressing the inertia spring and rotating itself to unlock due to the headlocking pin being encaged in the cam slot in the bolt body. As soon as the rotation of the head is enough to unlock the bolt head from the barrel, the residual pressure of the barrel pushes the bolt head back, and this, in turn,pushes the bolt body against the recoil spring, overcoming the bolt body inertial and commencing the reloading cycle (ejection of the spent case and feeding and chambering of the fresh round). As soon as the bolt group returns into the battery, the pressure of the compressed inertia spring pushes the bolt body slightly back against the bolt head, causing the bolt head to rotate and lock into the barrel. Now, gun is ready for the next shot. This sounds quite complicated, but the whole system is mechanically very simple and has few moving parts, resulting in high reliability and easy production and maintenance.
The Benelli M1 shotgun is no more than the system described above, built inside the aluminum alloy receiver and  mated with conventional under barrel tube magazine and polymer stock, which is available with semi-pistol or pistol grip. Sights options are traditional shotgun sights,rifle type open sights or ghost-ring (diopter) sights. Mounts for laser pointers, tactical flashlights and red dot scopes also available on the market. 
Overall, the Benelli M1 is a high-quality shotgun, available in numerous versions for both civilian, law enforcement and military use."

The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.
Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.
Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.
The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.In like new condition with only about 100 rounds down the pipe. Comes with two 6 round magazines and a galco iwb holster. Will throw in a box of 50 124 grain Speer Gold Dots if full sales price is met."

Also, you will only get one medium back strap, so it will not have the rest of the backs trap additions (This set up should fit most hands, which is why I can't find the others).If you are looking for the competition pistol of choice this is it. This is a great opportunity to pick up a competition level firearm for a very generous price. Please note this you will need to complete this purchase via paypal.

 “Sniper Rifle”   I went to see the Chris Kyle movie yesterday, and now my Savage Axis rifle has a 3 X 9 Tasco scope on it.
 
“Selling to Fund Another Project”   One of my 9 monthly child support payments is due, so I must sell my Jennings .22 to pay it.
 “Custom Build”   I tried to assemble an AR-15 myself, and it will not fire 2 consecutive rounds without jamming.   So, I plan to sell it to some unsuspecting fool on ARMSLIST.
 
“Great Deal – Price Drop”   My gun is still priced too high, but not quite as high as it was a couple of days ago.
 “Final Price Drop”   My gun has been priced too high several times now, but now I have lowered the price to only $100 more than it is worth.
 
“Up for Grabs”   Even though hundreds of you want to buy my knock-off Korean Glock mag, only one of you will be so lucky.
 “Need to Make Room in the Safe”   I am selling my only brick of .22 LR ammo to make room in my imaginary safe for my imaginary belt-fed M-60.
 
“Multiple Items for Sale”   I need to get rid of my dirty Highpoint magazine with a broken follower, and a $5 plastic pistol case.
 “Don’t Waste My Time with Lowball Offers”   Don’t waste my time with reasonable offers.
“Tec-9 For Sale”   I bought this gun recently to prove that I know absolutely nothing about firearms.
 “Tec-22 For Sale”   I bought this gun recently to prove that I know even less about firearms than that ^ guy.
 
“FDE – Flat Dark Earth”   Brown (but I can’t say ‘brown’ and have overweight chicks think I am cool, so I say “FDE).
 “Make Offer”   Whatever you want to pay will not be enough, because I am delusional.
 
“If Ad is Still Posted, Gun is Still for Sale”   If ad is still posted, gun is still priced to high.
 ""Wife Says Sell""  My 300 pound wife with a moustache kicked my A$$ and told me to sell this gun.
 
“Zombie”   I had the word ‘Zombie’ engraved on my gun to make myself seem cool.   Now nobody wants to buy it.
 “Will Demonstrate at the Range if You Provide the Ammo and Pay the Range Fees”   I have never had any ammo for this gun nor have I fired it, and I do not have an extra $5 to go to the range.
 
“Custom Ruger 10/22”   I put $500 worth of useless accessories on my 10/22 and now it is worth $175.
 “Tack Driver”   I fired 100 rounds through this gun, and one of them hit the edge of the target.
 
“Highly Sought After”   Anyone with $300 already has one.
 “Rarely Available”   Readily available, but at a price much lower than mine.
 
“Custom Cerakote Finish.”   I tried to do this myself, and I might as well have used a can of spray paint.
 “In Good Shape”   Pretend you cannot see the rust and pitting in the photos I posted.
“Combat”   I played a lot of video games.   In fact, I am 58 years old, and I am still playing a lot of video games.
 “I Am Not Hurting for Money”   I am hurting for money.
 
“Trade Value”   $200 more than my gun is worth..
 “Need to Sell”   I need money, but I am not going to get any because my guns are priced to high.
 
“Need to Sale”   Same as above, but I did not attend school past the 5th grade.
 “Cleaning Out the Safe”   I do not own a safe, and here is a list of overpriced garbage I want to sell.
 
“Want to Buy”   I cannot afford to buy what I am looking for, but have no problem wasting your time with countless email exchanges while I pretend I can.
 “Pre-Ban”   A 20 year old rifle with a flash suppresser, identical to the same gun manufactured today.
 
“Battle Rifle”   Neither I nor this rifle have ever seen a battle.
 “Kept in Safe Since New.”   I have never owned a safe.
 
“Mint Condition”   I have not dropped this one on the concrete steps of my mobile home yet.
 “My Favorite Gun to Shoot”   This gun is .22 caliber, and the only one I can afford to shoot.
 
“Nice AR-15 Pistol”   I thought I would be able to hit a 5 foot diameter target at 10 feet.   I was wrong.
 “Recently Appraised”   I made up a dollar amount to put in this ad so I can justify my high price.
 
“$___ Worth of Options”   I bought a bunch of stupid crap to put on my gun, and there is no way I am ever going to recoup that money.
 “Fun Gun to Shoot”   The people at the range laughed at my pink frame Kel Tec, so I have to get something else.
 
“Excellent Home Defense Weapon”   I have a shotgun for sale.
 “Remarkably Accurate”   I tried to hit the State of Florida from 50 yards, and I missed.
 
“Low Round Count”   My gun looks good, and there is no way you can tell how much I shot it.
 “Getting Hard to Find”   There are 67 of this same model advertised on Gunbroker for half the price I am asking.
 
“Price is Firm”   I will not be selling this gun because it is priced too high.
 “No Trades”   My welfare check has not arrived, and I need cash for beer.
 
“On the List to be Banned”   I have a 7 th grade education and live in a double-wide trailer in Lake County, but I am the guy who has access to the BATF ‘list’ of guns to banned.
 “No Low Ball Offers”  I am going to be disgusted with you if you offer me $200 for my $175 gun that I have advertised for $400. 
 
“Furniture”  The stocks on my rifle, but I want to sound like I am a gun expert of sorts.    
 “Rare”   Seller’s Ruger 10/22 with birch stock and Uncle Mike’s $4 sling is somehow worth $100 more than a new one from Wal-Mart. 
“Unfired”  Gun has been shot, but cleaned very well. 
 ""Tactical""   My High Point Carbine has a 30 round magazine.
 
“Won’t Last Long at this Price”  I’ll still have this gun for sale 6 months from now.
 “BNIB”  Advertising your gun as BRAND new in box makes it worth at least $200 more than one that is just NIB.
 
""Going Back in the Safe""  ""This price is only good for 2 days, then the gun is going back in my safe.""  So I guess I better hurry up and give you the $850 for your Glock 19 before I miss out on this bargain of a life time, right?
 Idiots."

This is a factory new Nighthawk Custom 1911 T3 stainless.The Ultimate Concealed Carry Pistol: We designed this little pistol to allow users to pack the powerful 45acp in a small package, but due to its popularity we now offer it in 9mm and 40 S&W. A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options, we find that most customers want it just the way it is.When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds.The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes.

This is a super high quality Perazzi MX16 Game Gun. A 12-gauge with 2-3/4"" chambers, it wears 28-3/8"" barrels and is choked Modified over Improved Cylinder (see note below). It has a tapered rib (7/16"" to 9/32""), white front bead & gold mid-bead. This gun features a single selective trigger (selector is located on the upper tang), automatic ejectors, and leaf mainsprings. The MX16 is the only Perazzi model that features the non-detachable triggers in combination with the leaf mainsprings and it is said to be the strongest yet trimmest frame in the Perazzi line. Not a common model, the MX16 was a limited production item produced in the 1990's. The blued receiver is unadorned and simply marked ""Perazzi MX16"" on the left side. The stocks show beautiful figure. The English straight grip buttstock features a leather covered pad. The LOP measures 14-1/2""; Drop @ Heel is 2-3/16""; Drop @ Comb is 1-5/16""; cast is neutral. Weight is 7-pounds, 4.5-ounces. Note: The barrels are marked ** (Improved Modified) over **** (Improved Cylinder) however the previous owner had the upper barrel opened to Modified (.019"" measured constriction) while the bottom barrel remains unaltered IC (.010"" measured constriction). Condition is excellent, not far from new, and it appears that this gun has seen only light use since new in 1997. It locks up like a bank vault and the top lever is well right of center...the gun isn't even broken in! The original blue finish rates 98% with almost no wear aside from a couple of tiny handling marks and the usual rubbing around the selector on the upper tang. There is no rust or any pitting. The stocks are also in very fine condition showing just a couple of very light, very minor handling marks. There are no cracks, chips, large dings, or ugly scratches...I'd grade the wood at about 97% overall. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bores are mirror bright. It comes in the original high quality combination lockable Perazzi case with owner's manual, Perazzi snap caps, and a kit containing tools, extra mainsprings & firing pins. An incredibly well-built shotgun, the quality is immediately apparent when you handle it. Made to endure a lifetime of steady shooting, you're going to wear out before this shotgun will!Buyer pays $30.00 shipping."

Featuring the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry.From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry.- See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-mod-2-3-sub-compact-45acp/#sthash.cOBmODKh.dpufWill consider trades-Glock 19 Gen 4-Glock 26 Gen 4-XD Mod 2 9mm-Commander or officer sized 1911s"
