No trades. http://oldmilitarymarkings.com/japanese_markings.htmlThe Japanese manufactured over 6.4 million rifles and carbines in the 40 years from 1906 to 1945. Most of these rifles were still in use during the Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and the Pacific War of the 1940s. During the war and subsequent American occupation of Japan, thousands of these rifles found their way to the United States as war souvenirs, making them one of the most common foreign military firearms available in the country.The Arisaka rifles are named for Colonel Nariaki Nariakira Arisaka, who headed a commission during the 1890s which was charged with developing a new rifle to replace the earlier models such as the Murata. The Arisaka rifles were designated with the year of the current emperor's reign. Thus, the Type 38 rifle was designed in the 38th year of the reign of Emperor Meiji (1905), and the Type 44 carbine was adopted in the 44th year of his reign (1911). During the reign of Hirohito, rifles were designated by the last one or two digits of the adoption year according to the standard Japanese calendar. Thus, the Type 99 rifle was adopted in Japanese calendar year 2599 (1939), and the Type 2 paratroop rifle was adopted in calendar year 2602 (1942).A chrysanthemum with 16 petals (the symbol of the Japanese Emperor) was usually stamped on the receiver of rifles manufactured for the Imperial Japanese Army, indicating that the rifle belonged to the Emperor."

No trades. http://oldmilitarymarkings.com/japanese_markings.htmlThe Japanese manufactured over 6.4 million rifles and carbines in the 40 years from 1906 to 1945. Most of these rifles were still in use during the Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and the Pacific War of the 1940s. During the war and subsequent American occupation of Japan, thousands of these rifles found their way to the United States as war souvenirs, making them one of the most common foreign military firearms available in the country.The Arisaka rifles are named for Colonel Nariaki Nariakira Arisaka, who headed a commission during the 1890s which was charged with developing a new rifle to replace the earlier models such as the Murata. The Arisaka rifles were designated with the year of the current emperor's reign. Thus, the Type 38 rifle was designed in the 38th year of the reign of Emperor Meiji (1905), and the Type 44 carbine was adopted in the 44th year of his reign (1911). During the reign of Hirohito, rifles were designated by the last one or two digits of the adoption year according to the standard Japanese calendar. Thus, the Type 99 rifle was adopted in Japanese calendar year 2599 (1939), and the Type 2 paratroop rifle was adopted in calendar year 2602 (1942).A chrysanthemum with 16 petals (the symbol of the Japanese Emperor) was usually stamped on the receiver of rifles manufactured for the Imperial Japanese Army, indicating that the rifle belonged to the Emperor."

If you don't know much about these guns, they are some of the better AKs ever imported into America. Thicker receiver and barrel means more accuracy and better sustained fire, along with generally being more robust and harder to break. The gun has had about 1000 rounds down the barrel; nothing corrosive and a vast majority of it being Golden Tiger. All parts on the gun are original and all serial numbers are matching. Bolt, Bolt carrier, and piston are all in the white, as factory. This gun was imported with a 20 inch RPK profile barrel, Chrome lined and cold hammer forged. I'm not sure 7.62 x 39 benefits tons from the extra barrel length, however if you were looking to build this into an RPK or other DMR roll AK, the longer barrel will be critical- if not, there is some velocity gained by the extra 4 inches. Or cut it down and make it 16, who the hell cares. It's your gun! Right now the gun is sporting a set of Bulgarian furniture, minus the handguard which is a Romanian dong. I planned on keeping the dong and selling with a regular Bulgy hand guard... unless otherwise per$uaded. Original furniture and sling will be included, as will a 30 round surplus Euro magazine. These guns are phenomenal collector pieces; assuming you were the kind Collector who also enjoys shooting their hardware ;D i'm looking to either get cash plus a trade or a straight across trade (any gun valued ~950.) I can make up the difference should you want to trade something worth more as well. I'm open to literally ANY fire arms trades, rifle, pistol, multi gun, etc. I'm not an asshole so don't be one either! Thank you!!"
