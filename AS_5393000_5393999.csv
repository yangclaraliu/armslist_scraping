It's in good shape for its age. I don't really want to sell it, but I have to in order to come up with some money for my surgery.The upper is a retro A1 type upper, A1 style rear sight, early slim 6 hole handguards, no case deflector and large, early style round forward assist. The lower is likely a pre-86 manufactured lower since many of the Sendra lowers were built to be legally converted to full-auto and marked ""Safe, Semi"" rather than ""Safe, Fire""The barrel is I believe a 10.5"" (maybe 11.5"") with a permanently attached 5.5"" CAR type flash hider to meet legal min length requirement. Shoots great with 55gr FMJ rounds. Has a CAR style stock with rubber pad that increases length of pull a little bit. Comes with 2 20 round USGI surplus magazines and a 30 rounder.(this is not a Bushmaster as the post may say for manufacturer.. There's just no option for Sendra)."

This was such an early model that the McMillan stock originally didn't have the thumb screws (or the holes drilled for them) to lock the cheek piece or much clearance in the cheek piece inlet before it bottomed out on the bolt. I sent the stock back to McMillan to add the thumb screws and deepen the cheek piece inlet (see picture of McMillan receipt) and they did a fantastic job. It came with some old 30mm dove tail rings that I replaced with a Ken Farrell 0 MOA base.I bought this to turn into a hunting rig and rebarrel it in one of the 7mm calibers to take advantage of the huge magazine length. But this thing is just so clean and unique that I can't bring myself to do it. So I'm posting it here for someone that can really appreciate it.$2300 plus shipping and insurance. It will ship in a hard case. Bipod not included. This is cross posted. First I'll take it wins.

15 out of the 16 are full with 20 rounds.  One box is shy by fourteen shells with only six inside.  Goes without saying, but I have to state that these are not live rounds, the shells have been spent, there is nothing to “go boom” when the trigger is pulled.  The brass still has the spent primers, but the brass appears to be good should one want to reload.  I believe most, if not all have already been reloaded.  The boxes are very cool in and of themselves.  None are in “perfect” condition, some have unglued on the sides, some have torn tops, etc… if you are looking for pristine boxes for your collection, please keep looking.  However, if you want some cool ammo boxes to add to your collection, then these are for you.
Sold as one lot, I’m not going to split them… they came in together and I’m sure some of the boxes have become friends and I don’t want to upset them. <grinz>
Please ask any questions prior to purchase.  Price includes shipping to your door.

This is a very unique mauser Its a small ring reciver in a large ring caliber and action. I have done some homework on this rifle and I believe it was originally a K98a or k98az of the First World War. The receiver was scrubbed but I can still make out three stamps on the right side that match Imperial German k98s. Also underneath the bolt handle there is an Imperial German eagle stamp. Most of the numbers on the bolt match. It appears that the original stock was cut down and had a cheek rest installed. The Stock modifications were done tastefully and still look great. This Rifle has a double trigger; one “sets” the trigger and the other fires. The double trigger is a hair trigger. The sights are standard rifle sights but the rear has leafs that flip up for different ranges. The Mauser still retains its original five round internal magazine. This Mauser has had some serious weight loss, it weighs about five pounds original a little over nine. I put about 40 rounds down range and this rifle shoots very well. The sporterized modifications make it easy to assassinate bowling pins at 100 yards. This Mauser is truly unique and as custom sporter it is one of one. It hard to find a value for something so unique so im open to offers and trades. call or text REDACTED. I reply to texts faster. SHIPPING is possible."
