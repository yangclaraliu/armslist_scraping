Dated 1961 on the slide.  Barrel is newer than the pistol and it has a trigger job.  This has the nicest trigger on any hi power I have ever handles.  But the grips and the sights are not original.  There is alot of finish wear and it's obvious that the pistol was in a holster for years.  No rust that I can see.  Slide is very tight and it shoots very well.  The finish condition and the swapped grips and sights make this pistol a non collector.  But it is a great shooter and about half of what you would pay for a belgian browning hi power.

Website with specs for 686SSR
Retails for $1090 as you can see.

Selling to fund my dream 1911 (and I already have a 686-3:).  Low round count, not many magnums fired through it, fresh clean bore.  Was sent back to S&W Performance Center for some custom trigger tuning and fiber optic sight installment.  The [B]trigger[/B] on this 686SSR in particular is the nicest revolver trigger I've ever felt, and I have a 686-3 to compare.  The double-action is smooth and easy, the single-action is light and crisp enough for a fly to pull.  Internally and functionally 120% (since it got sent to S&W for some tuning), cosmetically I'd put it at 90% due to some minor scuffs.  If you're concerned about the finish, you can always bead blast it again for cheap. I honestly would if I was concerned about the finish.  After all it is designed for combat and competition.  It's a no BS combat tool.  

I prefer a Face-to-face sale so you can FEEL the trigger for yourself, I can't stress enough how nice of a trigger this gun has.

This thing is great even for big hands and practically disappears into a pocket when you put it in a pocket holster.  The only reason I'm selling is I went back to wheelguns (going through a cowboy phase).  This one has two 7 round mags because I bought an extra aftermarket magazine (like 30 bucks).  It's the best, smallest, lightest CCW auto in 9mm I've ever had.  Again, only reason I decided to sell was I got back into revolvers."

This remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 

The brass for this ammunition will have various headstamps and may be brass or nickel-plated brass.

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world's best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is ""precision"" remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit.

I paid $1,735 for everything and bought it brand new in the box. I only have fired 320 rounds through it. These rifles are going for $1,500 as Arsenal Arms did a limited production and no longer makes this model and is soon becoming a hard to get collectors item. These are considered some of the best made AK-47's on the market and manufactured in the USA. This rifle is considered the glock of rifles, burry it in mud, snow, sand, run over it with a car an it still will shoot true every time. This rifle is Milled instead of stamped like the original Russian, Romanian and Chinese models; This makes the rifle much more durable with the finish of a AR-15. The barrel is chrome lined 1/24 twist which makes it much more accurate than its foreign counterparts. This gun will shoot shot for shot with a full 20"" AR-15 in 2"" groups but with a much more effective round. I am asking $1,200 for everything.

***SUPER SPECIAL PRICING UNTIL 6/18/2010***

Military Ballistics Industries (MBI) specializes in custom ammunition and ordinance products for use by the military, law enforcement agencies, and training facilities in the United States.

This remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 


The brass for this ammunition will have various headstamps and may be brass or nickel-plated brass.

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world's best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is ""precision"" remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit.

here is some info on .357 sig

Developed in 1994, the new cartridge was named ""357"" to highlight its purpose: to duplicate the performance of 125-grain (8.1 g) .357 Magnum loads fired from 4-inch (100 mm) barreled revolvers, in a cartridge designed to be used in a semi-automatic pistol. Performance is similar to the 9x23mm Winchester.

The .357 SIG provided a self-defense cartridge close in performance to a 125 gr .357 Magnum, but from a smaller and more concealable semi-automatic pistol.

The .357 SIG was the first modern bottleneck commercial handgun cartridge since the early 1960s, when Remington introduced the unsuccessful .22 Remington Jet (1961), which necked a .357 Magnum case down to a .22 caliber bullet, and the .221 Remington Fireball (1963). Soon after the .357 SIG, other bottleneck commercial handgun cartridges appeared: the .400 Corbon (1996), necking the .45 ACP down to .40 caliber; the .440 Corbon (1998), necking down the .50 AE to .44 caliber, the .25 NAA (1999), necking the .32 ACP down to .25 caliber; and the .32 NAA (2002), necking the .380 ACP down to .32 caliber.

Overall condition of the gun is very good with some light staining of the finish on the metal (brownish looking stain on the safety lever doesnt look like rust though so idk). Round count through the gun is looking like around 600 rounds but the bore is strong and chrome lined as well as the chamber. This is the newer model offered by century with the better barrels so it wont ""keyhole"" through the target and twist rate is better than the old ones. My phone number is 522-5498 and can reach me at anytime just tell me when i answer that ur intrested in the ak 74 so there wont be confusion lol. The only possible trades im looking for are possibly a quality full ar-15 upper ( cmmg, stag, bushmaster, etc) or a quality full lower with cash. Im building a m4 type rifle so 14.7-16 inch type barrel length ( 14.7 with perm comp that is) and a lower with collapsible style buttstock. Anything 5.56/.223 ammo related or ar parts are possible as well.

Guns shoots very well and only had a few FTFs in the first 100 rounds or so.  Has run 100% for me since then (I've about 300 through it, and been well cleaned).  Very accurate, I can easily put a mag full into one ragged hole at 7/10 yards without taking much time in between shots

Has some holster wear/light scratches on the slide, and a small area where it seems some of the finish has decided to come off.  I can't tell if it's surface rust or not, but since this was a ""beater carry gun"" and not a BBQ gun safe queen, I didn't really worry about it too much.  You can see it in picture 4

Springfield Armory 40S&W XD M Factor/4.5 Barrel/Black Finish & Special Package

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

Although parts may not be correct for the era of the receiver the rifle has many original  WWII parts  as can be seen in the pictures.
The wood has no stampings and is likely a replacement. What is strange is to have a rifle that went through a rebuild but have so many WWII parts and not been reparked. Receiver has a original  gray /green look while the parts that would get heavy wear are just about bare of finish as the trigger assembly, buttplate,gas cylinder
I always liked this rifle becuase it isnt your ordinary reparked rebuild.
Rifle has been checked over, gas cylinder and Op Rod  are in spec, Op Rod spring replaced with one from Orion 7.
Stock has no cracks but does have that been there done that look.
Muzzle Wear is 2.75 and TW- 3 , bore is clean with no pitting. If you are looking for a Garand with alot of WWII parts that will make a good shooter this is it.

There are a few very minor imperfections (not the picture of the front strap), but at a glance, this pistol is in almost new condition. Comes with box and one 7 round blued magazine. This gun is unmolested and has a beautiful trigger with about a 4 lb. pull and very little if any take up. One of the nicest factory set triggers you will ever find. Round count is unknown as I bought the gun used, but I would say by the condition of the pistol that it is well under 500. After looking closer, I can't say it's even had a box through it. Come look at it, and you decide. Look at the pictures of the barrel. Buyer must fill out a 4473 form. Price is $800 FIRM FIRM FIRM ftf in Norman. Remember, this is a Series I, NOT a Series II."

This is a polish PPS-43 SMG kit. it is demilled and not shootable. It also has a 75% reciever that needs to be finished, drilled and welded. You do not need to have an FFL to finish this gun, just finish it fill out the form send in a 200 dollar check and you have a nice carbine or pistol (depends how you build it)



this shoots the 7.62x25 round (1260 surplus rounds costs anywhere from 100-120)

It needs a trunion and a trunion plate and reciever finished to be shootable and complete. But unless you are a 07 AND 02 SOT holder you must convert it to semi auto or you will be in violation of the NFA.

To make semi auto all it needs is a FCG that has a disconnector, and a safety. A floating firing pin (right now it works off a closed bolt), slot the bolt and add a groove or pin in the ID of the reciever. You are done!

The ""Astra"" trademark belongs to the ""Societa Unceta and compania"" company (current name Astra-Unceta y Cia) , located in the Guernica, Spain. The Astra mod. 400 pistol first appeared in the early 1920s and had been adopted by the Spain Military in 1921. This pistol was also widely exported to many countries, includint the Hitlers' Germany, that purchased the mod. 400 pistols for its army. During the World War 2 German troops encountered several problems with mod.400 pistols, loaded with 9x19mm ammunition, so Germany requested the company do tevelop dedicated version of the mod.400, chambered in 9x19mm only. In 1943, Astra mod. 600 appeared, being chambered for 9mm Luger cartridge only and also having shorter barrel and slide, than mod.400. This model also had been used by Wehrmacht (German army) and exported across the world. The even more compact version of the mod.400, chambered for 9x17mm Browning short (.380ACP) or 7.65x17mm (.32ACP) cartridges, had been manufactured under the designation mod. 300. The production of the mod.400 had been completed in 1950. 

Technically, the mod.400 is a blowback operated"

The only way of knowing is by some small nicks along the corners of the protective sight hood.  Other than this it is in great shape.  Included is original box, and two sets of batteries.  If you are unfamiliar with EoTech, they are a holographic sight made for use with any picatinny rail interface system.  They will work on anything from a pellet rifle to a large-bore, and are sturdy enough to be issued by a lot of military units or bought by servicemembers for use overseas.  The reticle is a 1 MOA dot circled by a 65 MOA circle for fast target aquisition, and features several quick adjusting brighteness settings for everything from extremely low-light to very bright sunlight.  This has been an excellent optic, and has improved my shooting speed.  The only reason for a sale is because I am looking to go to a magnified optic.

P.S.:  Only the optic and box are for sale, the top picture is for illustrative purposes only.  It should go without saying the rifle isn't included in the sale, but it is worth mentioning as someone will no doubt ask.  Have an excellent day."

The second picture will give you a rough idea of what it will look like when mounted to your AK, this optic will greatly increase hit probability within 300 meters, decrease aiming time, and substantially increase weapon effectiveness in low-light/no-light conditions when compared to standard AK sights."

The person that I bought it from did not know if  it has a USGI bolt/op rod so I will say it doesnt. I have shot about 100rnds through it without a single malfunction, and yes I know that for every person that tells you these are great rifles there will be another that says they are junk so with that said I cannot say enough good things about this rifle. I paid $850 for the rifle bought a sling,scope mount and it comes with one 20rnd mag and hard case. So with that said I want $825 for the rifle and I also have approx 350+ rounds of 762x51 brass cases(308 win) that come with the for an additional $125 so that makes the total $950. Anyone is more than welcome to come and shoot it at my gun club but it will cost them $10 to get a guest pass to shoot and you would also have to provide your own ammo. Trades that I am interested in are 1911's or an OD green Glock 19 no shotguns or bolt rifles please. Must be 18yrs of age and show valid ID to prove Ohio residence."
