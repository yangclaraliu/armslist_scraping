Before you ask, yes, I am on the Texas County approved instructor list, so no worries there.

I am an instructor with Canovi and Associates in the Springfield area and will be in the Houston, Mo. area over Christmas and New Year's weekends. Christmas weekend I can either work a course in a 2-day format or a 1-day format, New Year's will be a 1- day format. Mr. Canovi has given the go-ahead to hold a class on those date-frames, but they will not be on the Canovi schedule if you check their webpage.

The class meets the standards required by Missouri Statute and is an 8 hour course. You will need NO less than 70 rounds (25 familiarization for revolver, 25 familiarization for semiautomatic, and 20 to qualify). Rentals will not be available for these dates, so if you need a revolver or semiauto please borrow one or buddy up with someone prior to.

Reserve quickly so I can guarantee that we will have a facility, which has already been approved, I just need to confirm if a class is going to be held for the owners. Do not worry if you cannot attend either of those time frames, you can always come to the Springfield area and take a course or ask when I can be in the area again for a course...groups make it easier to teach a course, but if I'm already in the area and get just 1 student I will still teach the course.

Reservations require:
Full Name
Mailing Address
Contact Phone Number
Preference of 1 or 2 day course and what dates would work best on Christmas or New Year's (Thurs-Sat on either)
Do you own a semiautomatic AND a revoler? If not, can you obtain both for class?

Payment: Payment will be taken day-of, please bring exact change as I will not be able to provide change that day.

Canovi's Books and DVD's: If you are interested in purchasing Matt Canovi's REAL Defensive System book or the DVD's, please express that with your course reservation so I can obtain the needed copies for you to purchase that day.

**Concealed Carry Plus - This course is designed to provide folks who carry some advanced skills beyond the very basics that are needed to survive a gunfight. You'll learn front sight shooting, point shooting, multiple shots for stopping power, low light techniques, and single hand shooting techniques. This portion adds approximately 1 hour to the 8 hour course and will require 20-30 rounds of ammo. If you already have a CCW class and want to take the Plus portion, please contact me as well. I can work those individuals in. Just know that the $15 difference ONLY applies to those attending both classes.

Fees:
$75 for the Missouri Concealed Carry course (certificate provided at the end of the course)
$90 for the Missouri Concealed Carry course and the CC Plus.
$24 for just the Plus portion"

I have a used Glock 27 that I'm looking to sell or trade. I've had this gun for four months. In that time, I have put between 100 and 150 rounds through it. I bought the gun used, but it looked nearly brand new. I doubt the original owner put more than 200 through it. The barrel has no almost no wear at all. For reference, I have a Glock 19 that I purchased brand new, and with 500 rounds through it, this used Glock 27 has less barrel wear. The Glock 27 has functioned absolutely flawlessly. As you might expect, it's got quite a kick for a .40 subcompact and it's loud! But it should make the perfect CCW gun.

This gun has a Trijicon night sight on the front sight. The rear sights are standard Glock sights.

It will come with the standard (1) 9 round magazine, (1) 9 round magazine with Pearce grip extension, and (1) 13 round Glock 23 magazine. Unfortunately, the gun does not come with a Glock box.

I'm selling the gun because I'm looking to consolidate calibers.

I will throw in a 20-round box of .40 S&W 155gr. Speer Gold Dot Hollowpoints for free for your time coming to meet me (these retail for $25-30 at brick and mortar stores, and $20 plus shipping online).

I'm looking to get $425 for the gun with 3 magazines, FTF only. I live in Burlington but can meet you anywhere between Raleigh and Greensboro.

The trades that I am currently looking for include (will add cash if necessary):

Glock 26 OD
Glock 33 (OD or regular)
SP2022 (9mm or .357 SIG)
SIG P229R (.357 SIG)
H&K USP Compact (.45)
Or anything else interesting (make an offer)

Thank you for looking. Pictures will be available on request after the weekend once I've had time to take them. PM with additional offers. I'd like to hear other trade offers, if you've got them. Buyers should have a pistol permit or CCW permit."

THE GOOD: I have 3 mags and a threaded barrel attachment to mount a suppressor. Original front sight and back strap adjustments included. 200 rounds of CCI Mini Mag ammo also included.

THE BAD: Over the years it has become very picky about the ammo it likes to shoot. CCI Mini Mags are the only thing I can get it to shoot with any reliability. A tune up by a gunsmith might make it more reliable with a wider range of ammo makers.

I have a T/C Encore, stainless frame with 7mm-08 pistol barrel and T/C 2-7x pistol scope, holster and both wood and synthetic grip/foreend
It also comes with a 24"" .243 rifle barrel and wood rifle stock/foreend. This is in great shape and if bought new would cost over $1800, so please be serious with your trade proposals, looking for about $1250 value (used..not what it'd cost new). For the right deal, I'd consider leaving the 4.5-14x Burris Fullfield 2 on the rifle barrel. 

I also have a Marlin 1895G Guide Gun in .45/70 with scope base (no rear sight now, I had a  Ghost ring on it, then put the scope on, and the rear sight went MIA somewhere along the way.  (for the right deal, I could include the Leupold Vari X II 2-7x compact, or a Bushnell 3-9x)  I have dies, brass and  several HOT 440 grain hardcast loads (1875 fps) for this.  They penetrated over 10"" of wet, compacted riverbank sand. I got this one for grizzly protection in Alaska.  Looking for $600 in value for the rifle, ammo and dies, $800 with the Leupold

The other is a Huglu 12 ga over/under.  The guy I got it from got it in Turkey from the factory.  It comes with a couple choke tubes and a browning hardside (leather or leather-look) case.  Looking for about $600 value for this one."

These are the M98 action rifles with straight bolts. Commonly referred to as one of the ""large ring"" actions.
I have not fired this weapon since I bought it; I have simply cleaned the cosmoline off and tested the bolt.
The bluing is fantastic, the crown and bore are very good, but not perfect, as is to be expected with a surplus rifle that is 60+ years old.
Rifle is chambered for 7.92x57mm or what is commonly known as 8mm. I have 100 rounds of Yugo surplus ammo I will throw in.
The butt plate is Nazi-marked with a Waffenamt stamp. The receiver carries the Yugo communist government crest. The floor plate of the magazine is a strike-through, which is pretty common for these rifles.

I built this gun for carry but I found a commander I want more, so this one needs to go. 

Ill take $600.00 OBRO. I have wiggle room in the price but not much. I believe it would be hard to find a Made in USA 1911 like this one for this price but I will Neg. the price as I realize my idea of a good carry is not every body's idea of one."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Mag is still very new. Only fired 9  times.

  A  couple  things  to  note  about  this  rifle.  First; this  model  does  not  have  the  accu-trigger. Second; the  scope  included  is  the  original  “stock”  scope,  and isn't very good. This  rifle  is  certainly  worthy  of  a  good  scope  and  you'll  want  to  invest  in  one  if  you  plan  on  doing  any  long  range  shooting.

Concerning  the  trigger  heres  something  I  think  people  should  know,  and  I  speak  with  experience  as  a  former  Marine  who  has  had  much  formal  marksmanship  training  when  I  say  this....while  it's  true  that  this  stock  111  trigger  is  not  the  greatest  thing  savage  ever  designed,  I  can  tell  you  that  as  long  as  you  understand  and  are  employing  the  basic  principles  of  marksmanship  such  as  a  slow  steady  trigger  squeeze,  breath  control,  and  aren't  anticipating  the  shot,  this  is  still  a  very  accurate  rifle  even  with  the  stock  trigger. Right  out  of  the  box  and  with  the freebie scope I  shot  1”  groups  at  100  yards  effortlessly.  You  also  should  know  that  for  much  less  than  the  difference  in  cost  of  an  accu-trigger  model  you  can  purchase  a  “rifle  basix”  trigger  for  the  savage  111  (around  $89)  which  is  widely  considered  to  be  even  better  than  the  accu-trigger  if  you  want  to  do  some  serious  500  yard+  shooting.

Still in Box...price tag says $399.99. You're  also  saving all the  sales  tax, (approx. $25)  getting  a  butt-stock  cartridge  sleeve  ($10),  and  20  rounds  of  150gr  soft  points ($24.97).

$340 is the bottom line price and it's FIRM. I will not respond to offers for less. I'm already in the hole at this price. I've had 3 offers for less, and right here it still sits...not in a hurry. Besides, it's freakin awesome to shoot and ridiculously powerful so I don't mind keeping it awhile longer!

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds of Ammo,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger."

Springfield XD9 Service Model Stainless. It is the 4 inch model with the stainless steel slide and black polymer frame.

I am the original first owner and I only fired 50 rounds with it. It is cleaned, lubed, and stored in my safe.

I bought it to be my alternate conceal carry gun but I prefer to keep carrying my Glock 19. 

Its just as accurate at my Glock 19, shoots within the 9 and 10 ring, very low recoil because of the dual captive guide rod.

It comes with original box, all the papers, 3 - 16 round magazines, cleaning brush, lock, and of course all the usual XD gear (holster, speed loader, mag holster).

I bought it new for $550 with tax. I will sell for $500 cash (that was the trade-in value offer at my local gun store) or will trade for Desert Eagle 1911, Glock 17 - 3rd Gen, Beretta 90-Two, Springfield XD Tactical in 9mm or 45 ACP, Revolvers chambered for .38 spl or 357 Magnum (no Taurus, Armscor, Rossi, or any other cheap brands), and of course other firearms.

I didn't post any pictures because the gun is just as good as new, no wear or tear at all being only shot 50 rounds.

Designed around our DCM Competition Barrel, in a 24"" Fluted, Extra
Heavy Profile – machined to SAAMI specification tolerances of 4150
ChromeMoly Vanadium steel. Full length fluting reduces weight and
increases barrel cooling. Barrel Is a full 1"" diameter under the Forend,
and has an 11° Competition Crowned Muzzle. 

Bushmaster Two Stage Competition Trigger with 3.5 lb. pull 1st stage and 1 lb. let-off (2nd stage)

vents in the Forend increase barrel heat dissipation.

of most bipods or a sling swivel.

Ambidextrous, Ergonomically Designed Pistol Grip is included

AR15 / M16 A3 Complete Parts kit LESS lower receiver, with 16""; inch M4 contour barrel and A3 Upper receiver. Item # AR-RKM4A3. This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports M4 contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of Mil-spec M4 contour (.750 under the front sight base) complete with the M203 groove in the front. This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights. The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A3 upper receiver with built in Mil-spec M1913 Picatinny accessory rail, with the correct rail numbers engraved, made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover. The buttstock is the heavier wall, stronger (1.160"" OD) M4 buttstock (not the cheaper carbine buttstock). This buttstock features 6 positions for maximum shooter comfort, reinforced honeycomb design for heavy duty use, and the correct M4 lock nut. All semi auto lower receiver parts are INCLUDED as well as semi auto bolt, carrier, and charging handle. The upper is COMPLETELY ASSEMBLED. Each and every part to the gun is included EXCEPT the stripped lower receiver! (A complete firearm is pictured, the lower receiver and magazine, even though shown in the picture, are NOT included).

I have several of these kits I took on trade. They are in Brand New condition. You can buy stripped lowers for $65 -$100 and have a complete rifle for cheap. I will ship if you pay co it and take paypal if you add on 2.9%.

Edit: I am 18 so  by Tennessee Law I am permitted to purchase a any firearm. I am bringing this up because it has come to my attention that Many people prefer not to sell to anyone with out a CCW or being at least 21. 

The best way I was explained the law is as followed ""An 18 year old non-felon is allowed, in TN, to purchase a handgun, from anyone who's legally entitled to possess and dispose of one. The FFL is prohibited from selling a handgun to persons under the age of 21 years. It is a federal restriction upon the FFL, not upon the 18 year old adult. """

 All rounds are hollow points except for the 200 rounds of PMJ's, there's nearly $170 worth of ammo alone and another 37 bucks for a like new BlackHawk paddle holster thats just 3 weeks old. I'm asking $645 for all and am pretty firm on price and will not seperate anything, AMMO ONLY sells with the pistol and will not be sold seperately. All sales are final and will have to be done FTF with buyer having a valid Ohio DL or ID and preferably posses an Ohio CCW license. Will meet half way on sales if necessary and will deliver to you for a small fee but only if i get my asking price of $625 plus some cash to at least cover my gas. Not really interested in trades but would consider a Desert Eagle .44, Ruger 480 polished with possibly some cash my way depending on the condition of the 480, and finally the last trade i would consider is a Colt or S&W 500 with either a 2.5in. or a 8in barrel. Those are pretty much the only trades i would consider and cash is always good! Either email me or you can contact me at REDACTED by text or call anytime between 9am-midnight.

""The P-32 is a 7 round double action only semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.

Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. 

You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you're a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA.
