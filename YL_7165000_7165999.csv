The oversized, built in trigger guard allows the use of a thick winter glove. The magazine release area has been designed to allow quick and easy access to the release button from any position. Also, the mag well is wider and elongated in the front for a sure grip as well as having a large beveled opening for fast, smooth mag changes. An upper receiver tensioning screw is located under the grip, and it also includes a captive detent spring to retain the rear takedown pin. The Gen 2 Lower features an ambidextrous bolt release (Pre-installed) Because of the rear take down captive screw, the detent spring will need to be trimmed down."

Essentially there was a special order run of CZs that was canceled and so they brought them to the US last year. Only 1400 were imported. It is not in the catalog but CZ Custom lists it as a 75B Compact RAIL SA/DA Compact Steel Frame. It has been discussed extensively online as a ""SP-01 compact"" or a steel framed P-01. It is DA/SA and has an ambi safety. I think it is resembles a SP-01 compact though it has the same dimensions as a P-01. This isn't a light weight pistol. Being all steel it weighs in at 38 ounces. 38oz and 9mm makes for light shooting.Comes with two 14 round mags and the box and papers. Has had about 400 rounds through it and not a scratch. I bought it to Canjunize it. According to the interwebs the results that have been achieved with some drop in parts have been phenomenal with DA pulls of 7lbs and SA pulls to 2lbs if you want it that light. You can even convert it to SA only. This is stock so you can buy the parts and do with it as you please. Plenty accurate and serviceable as is. Not looking for trades at the moment. I probably should keep this and may change my mind. Buyer pays transfer."

These pistols were entire mirror-images of their right-handed counterparts, including the reversal of twist in the rifling from the left-to-right in the right-handed guns to right-to-left in the left-handed guns.What the Randall Company did was to make the entire breadth of its line available to southpaws in left-hand configuration. All left-handed Randall’s are considered to be extremely desirable and highly collectible, due to the fact that only 7.4% of total production was in the form of left-handed guns.In order to make this truly left-handed handgun, it was necessary to re-tool for 17 major parts changes. This even meant that special left-handed magazines needed to be produced.First among the lefties was the Service Model B111, which was a full-size government model with five-inch, 10-groove barrel and round-top slide with fixed sights. There were 297 pistols of this model made, with a serial number range of RF02100C to RF03092C. The first Model B111 was made on May 17, 1984, and the last one came off the line September 7th of that same year.Next was the B121, which sported a flat top slide and fixed sights. Otherwise, it was the same as the B111, and it differed from the right-handed A121 in that Pachmayr did not make left-handed grips, so it lacked the rubber grips of the right-handed counterpart. Randall produced 110 B121 pistols with a serial number range of RF02132C to RF03078C. The B131 was essentially the same as the B121, except that it was furnished with a Millett Model 100 adjustable rear sight. There were 225 of the B131 pistols produced in a serial number range of RF02110C through RF03092C. The first B121 was made on May 17, 1984, and the last one was completed August 28, 1984. The first B131 was made on May 24, 1984, and the last one was completed August 28, 1984."
