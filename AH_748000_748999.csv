Have over $700 just in parts on the shotgun not counting the shotgun itself. A full length stock bolt for traditional stocks is included.

MAKE AN OFFER! Willing to negotiate, willing to sell outright or do partial trade/cash. All reasonable offers entertained. $600 is the bottom end for trade value, will take $550 cash, but these prices will last only a short while and then I'm going to raise them. $550 is enough to cover the cost of a new .20 ga 870, the buffer tube and Mako stock and that's it. Recreating this shotgun new would cost you about $975-1000 for the shotgun and parts--then there would be the costs of having the modifications done. I'm offering a huge discount where everyone else has inflated prices out of fear of a gun grab. 

Has a no-bind modification on the trigger housing to ensure a blow to the action release or sand/dirt won't make the release inoperable. Barrel sits just a bit behind the end of the magazine tube, to protect it from dings. Finished in Matte Black Alumahyde. Has a simple OD green quick adjust sling that is included. Recoil reducing GL-Shock stock makes even buckshot and slugs comfortable to shoot allows quicker follow-up shots than a .12 gauge. The shell latches should probably be re-staked eventually. Doesn't affect the operation of the gun (they are held in place by the trigger plate assembly pins), just adds a step in reassembly from a complete tear-down. A shell latch staking tool runs $35 and it's a simple operation.

From Brownells Website:
The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in tandard military Gray."

COMES OFF THE MARKET THIS WEEK AND WILL RETURN WHEN THE BAN TAKES EFFECT. (You know its coming, don't lie to yourself)

Straight talk, real talk. Prices are still going up. This will not last at this price. If you are sitting on the fence I suggest you decide before the next round of increases. The $2000 guns from last week are bringing $3000. They are expensive but available now; better than totally unavailable later. Or the prices may drop as fast as they rose. I don't know. You roll the dice.

I wish I had bought gold at $300/ounce. I did not and the price went up to current market values. I have always maintained that the price of these Colt's with restricted roll marks would sky rocket but no one believed me and yet here is the proof. Type in ""colt restricted"" in the search block to see current market prices. I am not asking top dollar but current market value.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a good deal in today's market.

I deal in cash, FTF, and require a Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit, NC ID and a signed Bill of Sale.

This same rifle, in the same pre-owned condition, without the removable carrying handle, was selling for $1029 plus tax ($1100) at Gander Mountain prior to the recent price increases.

That is a $1400 value; and yes I expect to make a profit as well.
WILL NOT SPLIT UP PACKAGE

This was not and is not a safe queen. This is a working man's gun. As such it has scratches and signs of use (but not abuse). While it is collectible because it has LEO restricted roll marks, it would be on the lower end on the collectible scale because it has been used. If you need a New In Box model, this is not for you. If you you want a great reliable firearm that has a proven history and track record, one you can rely on to accurately shoot rounds down range, this gun is for you.


The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement."

457,http://www.armslist.com/posts/748457,"For Sale:  1910 Double Barrel Shotgun ""Baker Batavia Leader""","Bloomington - Normal, Bloomington, Illinois",$ 300,"Listed On: Monday, December 24, 2012",Shotguns,no type,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Break Open                                                                                ,Shotgun,"$300 FTF in Illinois with valid FOID.    
This is a BAKER BATAVIA LEADER double-barrel shotgun.
This was made between 1909 and 1919 for sure, I believe in about 1910.
This was made in Batavia, New York.   
The Baker Gun & Forging Co. had a line of double barrel shotguns, sidelocks, called Batavia guns in 1903. They had, in 1909, ""The Baker Gunner,""  the ""Batavia Leader"" with twist barrels at $25, the ""Batavia Special"" with steel barrels at $21.75, the ""Batavia Damascus"" at $28, the ""Batavia Brush"" at $24, the ""Batavia Ejector"" at $35.   This gun in the pics is the BATAVIA LEADER as you can see.

The Batavia line did not have the ""firing pin block safety"" or the ""draw block"" which passes through the barrel lug and into the frame. 

The sidelock ""Black Beauty"" replaced the Batavia Special, Leader, and Damascus guns about 1916.

The Batavia Leader number series were from 75,000 to about 106,000.  This one is 786XX, which puts it in the early days.  That's why I think it was made in about 1910.

Baker Gun & Forging sold the business to H.& D. Folsom in 1919 and then the guns were marked ""Baker Gun Co.""  This is earlier than that.  

Baker also then did offer a ""Batavia Leader"" however.  Grades for these Folsom owned Baker Guns were the  ""Batavia Leader,""  ""Black Beauty Special,""  ""Paragon,"" ""Expert,"" and  ""DeLuxe."" 

Folsom listed the Black Beauty Special for $62 -$77 with ejectors, the Paragon  $100 -$115, the Expert for $215, and the DeLuxe for $385. Folsom era Bakers usually have an F before or after the serial numbers 1- about 14,000 so again, I believe this one is before that.

H & D Folsom Arms Co. catalogs No. 23, 25, and 31 (1929-1930) only list the Batavia Leader and Black Beauty Special. By 1932 they had no more Baker Guns.

Baker Gun Co. was closed in 1930 and the factory started making car parts. About 150,000 Baker guns were produced prior to the Folsom ownership.

So based on the above, I believe this is a 1909 - 1919 gun.

This gun has plenty of wear, and a light patina, and a few little rust spots in the one photo near the forearm.   It has some small chips to the wood near the trigger guard.  This has a chip to the lower portion of the buttplate and the wood (toe?) at that point of the stock.

This is OLD, and and the info I have found on the internet says that you don't want to shoot a gun this old unless checked by a gunsmith first...an expert gunsmith who knows these old guns and can tell you if it is safe.

We have not shot it and don't intend to. See the pictures for more detail.   I believe you can scroll through my PHOTOBUCKET album to see all 21 pics of the gun.  You can do this by following this link, and then changing the last 2 numbers from ""03"" to anything from ""01"" to ""21"":

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”  All models are available in tandard military Gray."

Special Features


	Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
	Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.
	Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic

Shop more RCBS products The RCBS ChargeMaster Combo takes the accurate ChargeMaster Scale and Charge Master Dispenser and combines them into one unit.

The layout of the unit gives reloaders easy access to the scale pan by either right or left handed reloaders and the clear cover helps to eliminate fluctuations in weighting caused by air currents without obscuring the view of the powder being dispensed.
