What makes this pistol rare even among the RZMs is that it has the serial number 841287 stamped under the muzzle ring and the last 3 digits of the serial number engraved on the inside of the slide.
Acording to researcher John Pearson and his research of the Red Booklet, there are 4 variations of the Walther PPK and 1 variation of the Walther PP RSHA/SS Pistols. This Walther PPK falls under the 1st variation.
From what I understand these RZM PPK's apparently are in the range of around 84000 - 841500. The Red Booklet supposedly lists about 16 of these RZM PPKs and this particular serial number is not listed in the booklet even though it falls within the range listed. Here's a link to one that's valued at $8k - $14k and has more info listed.

If you know anything about this model, you'll know it's an amazing gun, probably in the top 3 for pocket pistols. Excellent trigger, one of the smallest and lightest .380s. However it is still in its break-in period, and I need the money. So if you've got the time to invest to put a couple of boxes through this little gun, youll have a light, balanced, very diminuitively sized and yet hard hitting gun for years to come. With XTP rounds, the 380 actually meets the fbi standards for penetration, while still running hollowpoints. Comes with original hardcase, two mags, trigger lock, and a box of self-defence rounds.text: (8 fifty) - 42O - 9 four 4 seven"
