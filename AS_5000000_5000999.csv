Looking to move out of the .223/5.56 realm and would like to move into the .308 world. Or perhaps 7.62x39
Problem is I have no 308 ammo or 7.62 and about 500 or so rounds of .223 fmj ammo and about 11 or 12 ar mags that I would be willing to traid for said .308 or 7.62 ammo and mags. A fair traid of course.  So I what I'm looking for In guns are:

AR platform in 308 
Decent 308 bolt gun
Maybe m1 style or FN FNAR 

I would also be interested in something in 7.62x39

AR platform, something like the mutant. 
Decent AK 47 

My budget is around $1,100

Would be interested in less expensive gun and hand gun combination. I have a kimber ultra carry II, so I already have .45 ammo. 
I like Hk's
1911's
Maybe a Glock 34
Other .45
9mm

Not looking for ar pistols or ak pistols. Looking for long guns. 

Preferably for a bolt gun i'd like a scope with it but that's not a huge deal. 

Pictures please. 
You can text me at REDACTED. That would be fastest. 

I have a ruger 10/22 tactical with a BX 2x25 mag that I would be willing to trade for a scope/optic or to trade+cash. It's new. Taken it to the range twice and put a total of about 100 rounds thought it. Works perfectly!! It's a $275 gun and the mag is $50. So maybe a low end used eotech if you have one with some cash on my end.

All parts were purchased new. 

This rifle has all the things you'd want in a midlength gun. The Aero Precision lower receiver is controlled by a Strike Industries Enhanced grip with a Core 15 Enhanced Slotted Trigger Guard.  The lower parts kit is made up of an Ares Armor fire control group that has been mirror polished to aid in a smooth trigger pull.  The Gavel safety selector is short throw and ambidextrous that makes for quick safe to fire transition from either side.  The bolt is held by a Strike Industries Enhanced bolt catch. A Strike Industries Ambidextrous QD end plate and a Mission First Tactical Battlelink stock rounds out the lower.  The Aero Precision upper is sporting an 18"" .223 Wylde barrel (shoot .223 Rem or 5.56) with a 1:7 twist. The flash hider is a Strike Industries J Comp.  An adjustable gas block that has been tuned with 55gr. ammo and the recoil is very light.  The 15"" CBC key mod rail is a free float system with a very slim profile and infinite possibilities with key mod add ons.  The BCG is nitride coated and the charging handle has an oversized latch for ease of operation.  I'll also be throwing in a couple boxes of ammo. Trades considered but I'm rather picky. Thanks for looking."

This made the action noticeably smoother to operate and has been retained to the present day. A steel floorplate and stainless magazine follower were introduced, partially revoking changes introduced in the 1964 model. The alloy trigger guard was retained.""

New, this gun was over $800. I just checked as I made this listing and found another here on Armslist for $700 that comes with less than mine. Mine comes with the original 6 round magazine, plus 2 additional 6 round magazines, plus an 8 round magazine. All 4 magazines are original Kimber (no aftermarket cheapies). It also comes with the factory Kimber softcase, a brand new Kimber gun lock, manual, and the original box it came in. I got this Kimber to conceal carry because my HK P30 was just a little too big. It did a great job and I could even carry this with just a t-shirt on. The only reason I am parting with it is that I got another HK, the new P30SK sub compact version for Christmas.  I have been using it long enough that I have determined it is just small enough compared to my regular P30 to carry in place of the Kimber, along with the added benefit that I can use my regular P30 magazines in my P30SK. So it just makes sense to sell the Kimber and put the money towards a new Daniel Defense MK18.

Here is some info from the Kimber website:
With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the double action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

We are a brand new, but established holster manufacturing company in the Tampa Bay area. We specialize in designing and manufacturing custom KYDEX holsters for all makes and models of hand guns. We are proud to manufacture product on par with industry leaders such as Raven Concealment Systems and Bravo Concealment. 
As I stated before we are proud to manufacture product on par with industry leaders. Our designs offer the same stability and functionality as Bravo Concealments BCA and RTT holster, as well as the Raven Concealment System’s Phantom Modular Holster. While we do boast the same quality of these products we offer our products at ¾ of the price of Bravo Concealment and 1/2 of the price of Raven Concealment. We believe that a gun owner should not have to pay such a high price to have a quality holster, when in fact the process behind the manufacturing is quite easy. 

To further emphasize this HUGE price disparity Raven concealment’s base holster retails for $104 and you would be hard pressed to find any quality differences between Tampa Bay Holsters and Raven concealment.
