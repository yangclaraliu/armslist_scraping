Browning Hi-power rifle (Safari grade) chambered in  .222 Rem. Sako short action. Bolt gun with a heavy barrel and open sights (no base/rings). FN Manufactured in Finland and Belgium in 1969. The bluing is good - rich and deep. The stock has excellent lines throughout and a high gloss finish with a couple minor nicks. Overall the gun is in very good condition, considering it turns 50 in a year and a half. I'll throw in a couple boxes of Hornady V-max with the sale. Splatter groundhogs and cut holes in coyotes with this classic!$1300 OBO2.) Browning BLR Lightweight '81 chambered in .270 WSM. There isn't a mark on this gun - it's flawless - like new. Sitting up top is a gloss black Leupold VX- III adjustable power 3.5-10x 40. Drop deer in their tracks. The .270 WSM hits deer HARD!$1100 OBO**Will not separate scope from lever gun**3.) Browning A5 Magnum Twelve. Vent rib barrel with Imvector choke system. It was manufactured in '89 I believe, which makes it a Miroku model. Has the desired round knob grip and the classic ""humpback."" The gun is in excellent condition with rich bluing and a high gloss stock. It has one blemish on the stock that I'm pretty sure is duck blood/plasma that I didn't wipe off - should come right off with some water. Gun functions flawlessly. Used once duck hunting through the 16-17 season. This beast is like a Howitzer going off in the duck blind! They truly don't make em like they used to. $1000 OBOIll sell all three for $3k. Contact through armslist if interested and I will send pics. Serious inquiries only.The only thing I'm interested in trading on are Browning Double Automatics - no blacks or steel."

I am contacting people back in the order they emailed me.For sale is an blued Beretta 92S (Made in Italy). These were Italian police trade-ins and turned in to the Beretta factory to confirm functionality, then imported into the US.This came in VG condition. The only major difference between the 92S and 92FS is the heel mag-release.It has cosmetic holster wear on the edges, lettering and some blueing wear on the barrel. Mechanically, it appears to have been barely used. When I received it after being in storage for years, it wasn't dirty, just dusty. I cleaned it up thoroughly  and the internals are immaculate, there is no rust and the barrel is in pristine condition with bright shine and sharp rifling. The parts are almost entirely compatible with the M9. It does take a different magazine with a notch at the bottom for the heel mag release. However, a standard M9 magazine can be altered to work with these without much effort, just a dremel and a few minutes.  In fact most of the new 92S mags available are altered M9 mags.Included: This comes with a factory Beretta magazine and an 18-rd Mec-Gar magazine.I will also include the common replacement parts that I purchased (Trigger spring, trigger bar spring, hammer release lever, firing pin and extractor).Here is an album with a couple more pictureshttps://photos.app.goo.gl/hAxMki2bfXVgI1rX2Possibly willing to trade for a modern 9mm compact pistol of similar value (Glock, Walther, Grand Power, CZ)"

Only around 50 cartridges have been fired through this rifle. I upgraded to the larger muzzle brake for better recoil management. The scope is a first focal plane Leupold Mark 4 mounted with McMillan heavy duty rings,  The Steyr HS .50 is a heavy-hitting rifle built for a new era of long range shooting. The free-floating barrel is cold-hammer forged, providing consistent accuracy when launching .50 caliber rounds at an effective range of up to nearly 1,650 yards (1,500 meters). The M1 configuration includes a 5-round detachable magazine and a 24” barrel. An important feature of the HS .50 is the ability to quickly assemble and disassemble the weapon platform. This allows for very rapid deployment as well as breakdown. The barrel-mounted scope also increases the speed of assembly, ensures accuracy between uses and also allows for quick conversion of specialty optics for a wide range of applications. The chassis of the rifle includes a pistol grip, a newly designed bipod, and a stock that features a screw-adjustable monopod in the butt of the stock with an adjustable spike. The recoil pad can be adjusted vertically as well as for length of pull and an adjustable cheek piece allows for ideal cheek-weld."" This rifle comes with a manual, three 5 round magazines, a tool-set for complete disassembly, a snake and 3 plug attachments for various stages of barrel cleaning. The scope is a Leupold Mark 4 8.5-25x50mm ER/T Model # 63055. When the situation calls for extreme range shooting, the Leupold Mark 4 8.5-25x50 ER/T M5 Front Focal Riflescope is the clear choice..I will ship"

I swapped the lower buffer tube and stock with a KAK pistol buffer tube and SB Tactical M4 brace. The original plan was to SBR it and have something to shoot while I wait for the stamp, however, I've decided I have other wants.The optic, light, and gripstop would stay with me. The Geiselle SD3G trigger, Surefire Warcomp, Radian Safety, and BCM grip, with the KAK buffer tube and SB Tactical M4 brace would be included. It also includes a JP Silent Captured Spring for the buffer spring which makes the action rediculously quite. I'd go an even $2100. Considering what LWRC costs for their piston stuff, and the extras, I believe it to be a great deal (I've got over $2700 invested).
The pistol has had exactly 7 mags through it as of last week (zero malfunctions obviously lol).The only trade I would consder would be an FDE Scar 16.Please be a proper person, with Indiana Residency identification, and a LTCH would be a major plus.

Ready for anything. Kimber Tactical pistols have the performance-enhancing features demanded by law enforcement professionals. Available in a range of configurations, they cover everything from tactical response to concealed carry.
Meprolight night sights are standard. Front strap and trigger guard checkering are standard. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety are standard. Kimber Tactical pistols are no-compromise, purpose-built pistols that leave nothing out, and Kimber quality brings it all together in five different platforms. Three full-size versions exceed all traditional and tactical law enforcement requirements. Compact models cover everything else. Like all Kimber pistols, each has rounded and blended edges to prevent snagging, along with match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. No other pistol design equals the 1911 for true tactical performance.

This rifle has only minor signs of wear/tear, despite it's age, and this can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only lightly fired, despite having been previously owned. There are only a handful of small, shallow scratches throughout the wood stock and receiver. The previous owner also scratched identifying numbers into the bottom of the magplate, as well as on the barrel, just in front of the receiver, but that is it! This rifle does not have any major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. This is an excellent rifle, which comes in fantastic condition for its age, and would make a wonderful addition to anybody's collection.

This shotgun comes in Rough, Pre-Owned condition, and will require someone willing to show it some love. There are a number of small cracks, and scrapes throughout the wood stock, as well as some small, minor scratches on both sides of the receiver. There is some very minor rusting on and inside the chamber, and, unfortunately, the barrel has a rather pronounced bulge near the end. We suspect that a shell was loaded backwards and fired, causing this damage.

This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular usage. This shotgun HAS been Reblued, which is why it has the color that it does. There are some light, minor scratches, and scrapes throughout the wood stock, and a couple on the receiver. The receiver features a beautifully etched design, which is still visible, despite the rebluing. There are little to NO signs of rusting, staining, or discoloration inside the shotgun's chamber, and the barrel likewise appears to be in great shape. The previous owner did scratch what appear to be identifying numbers into the bottom of the stock, right where it meets the butt, however, that is it! There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. This is a wonderful shotgun, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this shotgun, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have, or if you would like to receive additional photo's of this firearm."
