Three pad lengths are available in ½"" increments to provide length of pull adjustment to fit a wide variety of shooters. A ¼"" spacer is included for customizing. Unfortunately, a tiny scratch appeared one day last week on the top of the receiver and I have discounted the gun quite a bit for that issue.  Other than that the gun has been fired only on one occasion for trap shooting approximately 50 rounds (two boxes).  I also have 8 or so boxes of light target loads that we can negotate.  I also have a browning cynergy take down case that we can negotiate as well.  The case cost $189.00 new and I have no room to store it so it will go pretty cheap.  Everything is like new the gun is still very stiff to open and close which indicates it's newness.

I paid $895.00 for it and there were two rounds fired and sitting in a case in my safe ever since.  Asking $750.  Pretty firm on it, but you can always ask.Would consider a trade, but for only a few different things (see below).If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.  Thanks"

I'm always surprised that the popularity of these FN pistols haven't blown up a lot more than they have. I'm not sure exactly what it is, whether the cold hammer forged barrel or low axis of the slide on the frame but it is certainly one very accurate, tack driving machine. The accuracy coupled with the awesome stock trigger, sharp looks of the stainless slide and finely detailed lines of the FNS-9 are what drew me to it. It is a really refined looking piece and comes stock with the Trijicon night sights. This pistol comes stock from FN with many of the after market features already built in that one usually pays 100's for in upgrades after buying a new pistol. The FNS-9 is completely left hand friendly with the ambidextrous thumb safety, magazine release as well as the slide lock. It pains me to let this one go but one can only have so many ""favorite"" pistols. When I told the wife I was thinking of selling this one, and how much it pained me to do it, she commented that all of my pistols are my favorite pistol. I think there may be some truth to what she says.This one will come with the original case, literature, factory spent casing, extra backstrap for the grip, Trijicon night sights, lock and the three original mags that came with it new. Only name brand factory rounds have traveled through this barrel. This FNS-9 has been meticulously cleaned, maintained and stored to ensure it remained in pristine condition. It was never a carry gun or defensive pistol of any kind as I always had others to fulfill those roles. It has been kept in the safe except when taken to the range.Please contact me if you have any questions, need any additional pictures or have an offer to present to me. I'm in North Everett and I'm very flexible for coordinating a meet. Please examine the images below of the actual pistol and see if you can find the same beauty and attraction to this gun that I did."
