Also included are four stripper clips with ammo on them. (This will fill up your ammo pouches.) That is twenty rounds of Polish Surplus ammo on the real military stripper clips that work, not the worthless after market stripper clips. 
  Hardwood stock, not laminated. Round receiver, not Hex. Rifle still has cosmoline from its years of storage in Russia after World War 2. Will need to be cleaned before shooting. These do make great shooters and very accurate. The fit and finish on these is Excellent! Shoots the powerful and easy to find cheap 7.62X54R round. I have some extra parts I will throw in as well. May include extra springs, pins, extractor, butt plate etc.. which will make a good survival kit for this gun in case repairs are ever needed.
 I will need your TX Drivers License info for my personal records.

Probably the best trained defensive shooter in the country, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
chooses and carries ""Glock"".

http://frontsight.com/newsletter/html/17-right-gun.html 

 I will tell it to you straight because Front Sight does not sell guns in our pro shop.  We have no beneficial interest in any gun manufacturer and there is no ""Front Sight Service Pistol"" being promoted to anyone.  We are as pure as the driven snow as far as our interest in directing you to what is the best choice for a simple, reliable, and easy to use handgun that carries lots of fight-stopping cartridges.

Simplicity: The Glock is by far the simplest.  Trigger, magazine release, and slide release.  That's it.  The Glock is as simple as it gets. What about the Safety? Glocks have a safety on the trigger.  Safety is between your ears, so keep your finger out of the trigger guard until your sights are on the target.  We train YOU to be safe with ANY gun. We routinely place Glocks in the hands of students taking our courses who have never shot a gun before and they do extremely well with them and are extremely safe with them. 

Ease of use:  The Glock wins again with a trigger press that is essentially the same with each shot and has no safety lever to engage.

Accuracy:  Accuracy is really about YOU and not the gun.  Consistency is a better term to describe the gun.  Put the gun in a vice. How consistent is it in shooting a tight group?   You cannot hold the gun as steady as a vice, so all modern handguns are more consistent than you can accurately hold them.  If you can't shoot a tight group it is not the handgun.  The good news is we can train you to shoot accurately up to the consistency of your gun.

Speed:  Glock wins again.  The less you have to do to shoot the gun, the smoother and faster it is to deliver a fight-stopping hit. When we teach you how to properly re-rest the trigger for your second and subsequent shots, you will be amazed at how fast you can shoot an auto-loading pistol ACCURATELY.

So what do I carry? I can carry and shoot any gun extremely well.  I choose to carry. a Glock.  Why? Because in a gun fight, I too will only be half as good and half as smart as I am on my best day on the training range due to the stress of a lethal encounter.  Fortunately, a ""half as good"" Four Weapons Combat Master is still miles above the average dirtbag predator on his best day."

This is an excellent condition G33/40 with single piece walnut stock. Receiver code 945 and dated 1940. Bolt is a correct G33/40 bolt with all correct G33/40 parts, but does not match the receiver. Stock, handguard, barrel, and rear sight leaf all have matching serial numbers. Stock is marked both on the comb of the butt and in the barrel channel. Stock has not been sanded, cleaned, or altered in any way and still bears strong eagle/swastika WaA proofs (WaA63) on the left side of the buttstock. Stock has serial number in the barrel channel as well as a second number (603?). Not sure what that is, but I've encountered it on several G33/40's before.

Bore is like a mirror with very very strong, sharp rifling. No bulges in the bore or any other damage. Exposed metal finish has faded to maybe 10% but is very natural and very attractive. Unexposed metal is near 100% finish. Gun comes with original G33/40 sight hood and cleaning rod. I've fired this rifle on two occasions and it functioned perfectly every shot. The only oddity exhibited on this gun is that someone put nail polish on either side of the front sight blade. It's covered by the front sight hood and could easily be removed. This a very very handsome G33/40 that would do any collection proud."

I have also listed my mint Sig GSR 1911 in the handgun section if you are interested.   This is from my personal collection and it has been fired very little, maybe 200 rds at most. This is an all metal (except the grips of course) 1911 with stainless slide and frame, and no MIM or plastic such as that used in some of the other 1911's on the market today, including Kimbers!

It has been carried for 2 weeks as a concealed carry gun, but never fired. My brother thought it would be a good idea to buy it. It is very thin and small, and disappears under the tightest clothes. Then when he received it, he didn't like the grip because he has pretty big hands. He didn't really think that one through. So I told him I would try to sell it for him. He would consider a trade for the right gun.

Astonishing New Elf IT Night Vision Scope fits in the palm of your hand! Elf IT makes darkened areas surrender their secrets. 

It is hard to believe that 500x light amplification can come from a device size so small. The Elf IT Night Vision monocular is made in Russia by LOMO PLC, one of Europe's most advanced optical manufacturers. Elf nightvision scope combines so many remarkable features in such a tiny package - good 1st generation resolution, excellent battery life, infra-red emitter, high sensitivity and interchangeable lens mount. 

The small size and jet black case make this beauty nearly invisible. Weighing in at less than 12 ounces, you will want to carry the Elf IT with you whenever you wish to see what the night will not disclose to your unaided eyes. Law enforcement and security personnel will appreciate seeing the ""perps"" in their hiding places. It is like ""x-ray vision"" for thedark. ""

Scope Overview
Zeiss Conquest 6.5-20x50 AO Rapid Z 1000 Reticle Target Turrets Matte Black REDACTED
Carl Zeiss has a long and illustrious history that begins in Germany in 1846. Since their inception, they have been known to be leaders in the world of optical designs and fine mechanics. Purchasing and using a riflescope from the creators of many of the world's most revered optical and mechanical designs ensures satisfaction, confidence and appreciation for how a truly fine optic can enhance your outdoor experience. 

When you are up for the challenge of accurate shot placement across distances others only fantasize about conquering, the powerful Zeiss Conquest A0 MC 6.5-20x50 Riflescope is here to show you the way. The extremely light-efficient multi-coated 50mm objective lens will deliver a bright, crisp sight picture that ensures your ability to see your target clearly regardless of the lighting conditions. Positive shot placement is no longer a concern, even at high magnification, thanks to the side focus parallax correction system. Bullet drop compensation is simple to calculate and the adjustment is right at your fingertips. Now you can bag your quarry at 300 yards or more, with the correct cartridge and the Zeiss Conquest 6.5-20x50. 

To use a riflescope with your firearm, you'll need a mounting base and mounting rings in addition to the scope itself. Bases attach to your firearm and the rings attach your scope to the base. Proper spacing of the rings, as well as the ring height should be considered to ensure a proper line of sight can be established. This will maximize the value of your investment, and enhance your shooting experience. It should be noted that in many mounting applications, a professional gunsmith's skills will be needed for proper installation. 


Key Features
. Tall Target Turrets 
. Side focus knob for parallax correction 
. 6.5-20x50 Configuration delivers long-range capability 
. 1/4 MOA precision adjustments with 45 MOA of Elevation correction 
. 1.0"" Main tube is nitrogen purged for water and fog proof performance 
. Multicoated Lenses 
Carl Zeiss MC multicoating on all glass-to-air surfaces for maximum transmission, color fidelity and brilliance. 
. Legendary Zeiss Optics 
Carl Zeiss precision ground optics ensure detailed images with high contrast 
. Rapid-Z 1000 Reticle in the Second Focal Plane 
The Rapid-Z 1000 ballistic reticle is configured with three floating posts at 6, 9 and 3 o'clock, with cross hairs. Leading toward the edge of your sight picture from each post is a series of hash-marks that end before they reach the edge of your sight picture. At 12 o'clock you'll see another series of floating hash-marks. Upon the 6 o'clock stadia, there are a number of graduated tick-marks for long-range bullet drop calculation. This design offers a very clear line-of-sight, with a generous view of the area surrounding your target. The tick and hash marks ensure that your point of aim will be your point of impact when targeting at great distances. 
This is the 1000 yd version of the Rapid-Z reticle; the hash-marks are defined for accurate range-estimation out to 1000 yd. 
Second focal plane positioning: The reticle does not magnify when the scope's power is dialed up.

The rifle is a straight-pull bolt action with a detachable magazine. Magazines were typically one to a rifle and stripper clips were used for loading. 

Sportsmans Guide typically has the ammo for these. Clips also show up time to time at SG and other surplus vendors. 

I have never actually fired this gun. There are a few dings on the wood, seeing how it was in service for a while. The metal is in good shape, the finish is all there. All numbers match. The action operates smoothly. Very nice piece of Swiss machine work. By all accounts, the most accurate milsurp there is.

There is a tag under the buttplate with the name of the Swiss citizen who carried this rifle. I don't remember it now, I just looked at the tag and put it back.

I live in the Twin Cities, but travel to Wisconsin a lot. Mainly the Hudson and La Crosse area.
It has been carried for 2 weeks as a concealed carry gun, but never fired. My brother thought it would be a good idea to buy it. It is very thin and small, and disappears under the tightest clothes. Then when he received it, he didn't like the grip because he has pretty big hands. He didn't really think that one through. So I told him I would try to sell it for him. He would consider a trade for the right gun.

Forjas Taurus finally entered the fray in 1991 by introducing its PT 92 Compact, better known as the PT 92C. This was created by cutting down the standard PT 92's barrel and slide by one inch and reducing the magazine capacity from 15 rounds to 13 and shortening the grip to match. Compared to the full-sized models the PT 92C lost three ounces, weighing 31 ounces without ammunition. To compete with Beretta's 8-shot Type M variant, Forjas Taurus eschewed further modification of the PT 92, instead introducing an altogether different l called the PT 908 in 1993."

Springfield Armory pre-ban 1993 18"" M1a Bush Rifle

This beauty sat in a safe for 15 years until I got a hold of it. I broke it in w/ the traditional ""clean it after each shot"" for the first 25. It's fired exactly 160 rounds. It's as close to mint as a used rifle could be. The only exception is the original USGI stock has been given a desert camo treatment (brown and tan), and the parkerizing got a scratch on the flash hider. These were built with all USGI parts. The only thing not original is the shitty trigger it came with was swapped out for an S.A. National Match. I don't have a camera at the moment, but I'll have it with me at the Tanner Show today. If you're interested and want to meet up please call as I'll be at the Tanner Show or in my car all day: REDACTED.
