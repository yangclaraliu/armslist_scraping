The Model 15-2 became the most well known and the best selling Dan Wesson revolver model to go into production. The 15-2 used a roll pin inserted into the frame as a centering dowel combined with a precisely drilled hole in each shroud assembly to facilitate proper shroud centering and alignment, thus eliminating the need for flanged barrel shrouds. The 15-2 introduced more barrel and shroud options, including barrel/shroud lengths of 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 inches, partial or fully lugged shrouds with choices of solid or ventilated ribs, plus removable and interchangeable front sights.[6] The Model 15-2 could be ordered as ""Pistol Pacs"" with 3 (initially) and later 4 (or more) barrel/shroud sets shipped inside a fiberglass briefcase with barrel changing tool and clearance gauges; however, most pistols were sold with only one barrel, with the buyers able to purchase other barrels later. All barrels and shrouds within a model series are compatible, thus a Model 15-2 frame from the 1970s may be equipped with a barrel from the 1990s and shroud made in 2016. The 15-2 increased sales markedly over the earlier models, and were often seen in use with both target shooters and hunters."

I bought this gun a few years ago from the son of the original owner. I was told that many years ago while walking through the woods with the gun, they tripped on a root and fell breaking the stock of the shotgun, it was then placed in the closet and sat for the last 50+ years. When I got the gun I cleaned it up, drilled into the stock of the gun and placed two medal rods, and then epoxied the stock back together, filled the small patch of missing wood with wood putty and stripped and restrained the stock. It is probably stronger than before now and you couldn't tell it was broken if not for the wood putty. When cocking the trigger, it won't set on one side. Other than that it's in pretty good condition, everything is tight and in place. Feel free to ask any questions. I would prefer to sell it but may be open to trades just let me know what you have. Thanks"

This will ONLY fit the A3 M1, which is the only rifle in the line that has removable rails/scopes.It's very easy to swap out, you just pop out your reciever (takes less than 5 seconds) and remove the 3 bolts holding on your rai/scope, and attach the new optic. If you have an AUG, you probably already know that though.This came on the AUG I bought a week ago, I'm replacing it with a rail so have no use for it.It's an extremely well built and clear scope. I've only fired 150 rounds since I got this rifle, scope is basically brand new.These scopes are $599 from Steyr + shipping and $569 on Gunbroker + shipping. You can see the full description If you click here for the link to Steyr's website.I'm only asking $450 for this scope. Price is FIRM. This is a ridiculously low price, it's priced low to sell fast.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing crazy. Since this is a speciality item (Not a ton of AUG owners on here) I AM willing to ship this, you pay shipping. I'd much rather sell face to face, but if I'm going to ship we have to do it my way because I've never shipped anything. To ensure I don't get ripped off, it would have to be paid via bank transfer to my account which means you couldn't reverse it, and that would ensure I don't get ripped off. This is the only way I'd be comfortable shipping the item, I have had over a hundred smooth transactions on MGO so I do consider myself one of the top trusted buyers/sellers. Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

I originally intended on starting some VPRC matches, but realized I don't have the time or the patience to get into the sport. The rifle is a Savage 10T SR, which is the Cabela's exclusive version of the Savage 10 FCP-SR. The only difference is the non-fluted barrel. It is still threaded and comes with both the Accustock and Accutrigger. Mounted on top is a Primary Arms 4-14x44 FFP scope in Mil/Mil with a sunshade on a 20MOA seekins precision rail. It's all mounted with Weaver 30mm tactical rings. I'll also throw in a Plano field locker case with a fresh set of foam that you can cut to your preference and 2 boxes of factory Winchester/Hornady match ammunition.This is literally everything you need to head to the range and start ringing gongs at 1000 yards if you want it. The rifle has never even been fired and still can be sighted in to your preference.My loss is your gain. Pick up in person with cash only. Must have 2 forms of ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale."

Only trades I would be interested in are quality AR uppers or Surefire QD Muzzle Devices for an RC2 Can or AAC 51T Muzzle Accessories for .308s.Check out the pics at the bottom of the page.  From The Truth About Guns measured it as a 49.12% reduction in felt recoil during their muzzle brake shootout test. Check out the excerpt below from their AR15 Flash Hider Test: 
The new AFAB — that’s Advanced FlashArresting Brake — takes the old design to a slightly more extreme level, with deeper grooves and a baffle pattern inside the bore. It kind of reminds me of a Graboid (not an insult).
For a hybrid compensator design that mitigates recoil as well as muzzle movement in other directions, all with a bare minimum of blast and concussion, the AFAB manages to turn in solid results as a flash hider as well...

This will ONLY fit the A3 M1, which is the only rifle in the line that has removable rails/scopes.It's very easy to swap out, you just pop out your reciever (takes less than 5 seconds) and remove the 3 bolts holding on your rai/scope, and attach the new optic. If you have an AUG, you probably already know that though.This came on the AUG I bought a week ago, I'm replacing it with a rail so have no use for it.It's an extremely well built and clear scope. I've only fired 150 rounds since I got this rifle, scope is basically brand new.These scopes are $599 from Steyr + shipping and $569 on Gunbroker + shipping. You can see the full description If you click here for the link to Steyr's website.I'm only asking $450 for this scope. Price is FIRM. This is a ridiculously low price, it's priced low to sell fast.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing crazy. Since this is a speciality item (Not a ton of AUG owners on here) I AM willing to ship this, you pay shipping. I'd much rather sell face to face, but if I'm going to ship we have to do it my way because I've never shipped anything. To ensure I don't get ripped off, it would have to be paid via bank transfer to my account which means you couldn't reverse it, and that would ensure I don't get ripped off. This is the only way I'd be comfortable shipping the item, I have had over a hundred smooth transactions on MGO so I do consider myself one of the top trusted buyers/sellers. Best way to contact me is by texting 248-255-9307 at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

The sling is a chinese sling off an SKS and the pistol grip is a russian bakelite grip. I have three 30 round mags 2 magpul and one fakelite mag made by tapco. The muzzle break is a dtk style clone made in the usa and does an exceptional job of reducing muzzle rize but is very loud. The scope mount is made by midwest industries and retails for 100 bucks. The scope is a 2-7 power redfield that got great reviews on youtube from some of the operator channels.

My asking price is 800 for everything or 700 for everything but the scope. Obviously if you were to buy a RAS47 and then buy all the extras on this rifle you would be paying a lot more than that.

His Chogan and Kangee T-Hawks are shaped of single-piece steel with a curved handle and grip choils along the front for enhanced holding power. Full-length handle scales are checkered for added grip security, and can be removed for cleaning. The two different models offer distinctive bladed head styles, which both provide exceptional utility and toughness. Molle equipped, form-fitting Kydex sheaths slip over the head and secure with a buckled strap. Available in both the Chogan and Kangee T-Hawk (tactical tomahawk) models. You will find both of these T-Hawks very well balanced and easily controlled, while still being robust enough to handle most anything dished out.
