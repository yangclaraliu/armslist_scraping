It has the shortened Nitron stainless steel frame/slide, compact/short grip with the checked custom aluminum grips, and the SIGLITE night sites that glow in the dark. Very few were made, and very few seem to exist. This specific pistol is in pristine, unfired, original condition in the original box. Also comes with the original 6 round magazine with pinky extension (6+1 capacity). If you like the single action 1911's with the solid-as-a-rock performance of a Sig, this is the pistol you want. For those who may be unaware of the SAS (SigAntiSnag) versions, note the lack of a lower rail on front, and the rounded edges making it ideal for concealed carry with no fear of snagging on clothing. This version is no longer in production, and is no longer in the Sig catalog. It is an extremely nice pistol and needs a good home!"

These go for up to $459.00 new.  Excellent shooter.  Has Hogue 1911 rubber finger grip.  Below is description from Beeman.  Need to sell for money for a gun project.  Will sell for $175.

Looks like a .45 1911 firearm...and just as accurate! Made in Germany by the legendary Weihrauch company, the Beeman P1 is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of air pistols. This is an heirloom airgun that you'll pass along to your grandchildren and beyond.

The gun's heft and balance convey quality and substance. It fills your hand without feeling bulky or oversized. The unusual overlever cocking mechanism compresses the powerful mainspring, and the hammer is actually the catch for it. Highly adjustable two-stage trigger, which has a serrated surface for more control, will help you extract maximum accuracy from the P1. In fact, the adjustable trigger is so crisp, you'll wish it was on your firearms.

The dovetail grooves are extra wide, and our accessory list has several 11mm to 14mm mounts that are known to fit.

Unlike many modern air pistols, the P1 isn't made of molded synthetics. It's a solid metal gun with finely checkered walnut grips. And, it's ambidextrous. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight.

The P1 has two power levels. The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points. See the detail shots to see how to cock the gun for high power and low power.

The distance you shoot, the weight of the pellet and the type of target will let you determine which power level is best. The P1 is an excellent indoor trainer for those who shoot the M1911A1."

The North Eastern Arms Compact Carbine Stock (CCS) is the ultimate Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) solution. A collapsible stock; shortening the overall length of the rifle approximately 2 7/8” inches compared to a traditional M4 stock. The CCS has been designed with the professional in mind, allowing for quick deployment into the firing position. The CCS is a 2 position stock that can simply be pulled into the fully extended position without the need for manipulation and collapsed by depressing the locking mechanism. The CCS is made out of 6061 T6 Aluminum and 4140 steel to ensure its durability in the harshest environments. The aluminum is Type III Hard Anodized and the steel components have been treated with our ARC+ Nitriding giving an added layer of corrosion resistance and durability.

SOLD!

A few things you should know when buying a black Taurus PT 738 TCP with the  blued finish is that brand new this gun goes for $240 or lower.

Next, the earlier versions of the Taurus PT 738 TCP have had many problems. You can tell how old the pistol is and what version it is by the letter of the last serial number. Taurus PT 738 TCP that have a serial number that end in D and E will be the most current and issue free versions. An used ""A"" - ""C"" version isn't worth $200 or more IMHO.

I have an ""D"" version for sale.  Unlike other sellers, I'm not going to try and sell or trade a probmatic TCP to someone else.

Here's a google URL to YouTube videos about issues older TCP's have had, but has been fixed long ago in the ""D"" and ""E"" series of the TCP. http://http://goo.gl/2HC5mP"

I loaded one tray of 100 in 40 cal for my competition Glock 35 which has a light aftermarket striker spring (Wolff) for a better trigger pull. I experienced about a 20% failure rate of light strikes so these aren't gonna work for me. (most did fire the second time I ran them thru the pistol so I know there's nothing wrong with the primers)

Just did a little more research and these may actually be small rifle primers and not SPP.  Which would explain the SR on the box despite it saying ""Rifle, Pistol and Revolver"" in the top right corner. Plus the ammo I loaded with these felt a little hotter and ran about 50fps faster than the same load with Federal pistol primers on my chronograph.. Perfect for loading some .223 for an AR-15.

I just got through texting back and forth with the buyer. He claims that he ""took it in"" to get checked, and they told him ""the scope is fucked up. The cap is cross threaded"". that's what people at the place near Miller Park (i'm not saying any names here) told him
Well, I guarantee that, wherever he took it, that scope cap (I assume he means the cap over the windage and elevation dials?) was find when I sold it to him. I have been a tool and die maker for 35 years, and I haven't cross threaded anything since I was an apprentice back in the early 80's. Now he wants me to give him $100 back to fix it? Seriously? How do I know who or what anyone has done to it since he bought it yesterday lunchtime? Anyway, I would like some feedback from sellers and buyers out there. I don't feel I should give him a cent, but what do you other guys think? I'm willing to listen to all arguments on either side. email me. Thanks

I am now listing this rifle for charity, or whatever else you want to call it. A friend of mine and his wife were in a serious motorcycle accident a couple weeks ago. She's been in a coma since the accident, and he's busted up pretty bad too. A fund has been set up for medical expenses. EVERY DIME OF THE PROCEEDS OF THIS GUN SALE WILL BE GIVEN TO THIS FUND. In addition, I will personally be contributing money besides the proceeds of this sale. THIS IS NOT A JOKE OR SCAM!!! Whomever buys the rifle, I will supply details including proof of my contribution of the proceeds of the sale. He's a really good guy, and his wife is a wonderful lady. I don't want to say more due to privacy concerns, but as stated, I will divulge info to buyer and show proof of contributing proceeds. Please email if you want to take a look. I took a good look at all I have and how my life is, and realized that selling this gun for me was not the way to go. I would rather help out a friend. God bless all, and thanks for looking at my ad. I give you my personal word of honor that everything in this listing is 100% true.

10/19/14 I am dropping the price and bumping. the charitible contribution still stands. If no one wants it in a week, it will be taken down from the list. the 350 is firm as this is going to a medical fund for a friend and his wife.

757,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3586757,For Sale/Trade:  Reminder regarding .22LR prices,"North Carolina, North Carolina, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, October 9, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I can't help but notice that the aftermarket asking price for .22 ammo seems to be a little misleading and that people would have you believe that they, themselves, paid a hefty price for ammunition just before they sold their gun leaving them without a need for their ammo, and they just need to get rid of it at a little higher price than they paid.  Heck, I'll just say it: some people on here are liars.

If you've posted an ad like the ones I am talking about and this hits close to home for you, don't worry, you are not alone in your untruthful posts.  Instead of saying, ""I have $.10 per round in these and I sold my gun and just want to recoup my expenses,"" perhaps you would get less ill wishes from the people on this board by saying something more like, ""I bought this ammo when it was available, knowing all along I would be wanting to/willing to sell it at a profit.""  At least then I could respect you.

So, since the 'asking price' on sites like this often skew the perception of what ammo is worth or what it costs, I've created a small list of some of the more common types of 22LR so that the people who just don't ever seem to find any in stores can at least know the base prices that the seller paid.  For instance, before you consider paying $.10 per round of Federal 550 (red box, which is a Wal-Mart exclusive item, by the way) totaling $55, keep in mind that Wal-Mart sells them for just under $25.  Your paying double will only encourage them to take it from the shelf again the next time they see it.  [Note: I am indifferent to gun shops who charge $25 for 100xMiniMags, ONLY because they rent guns and insist that you use their ammo in those guns. The $25 makes sure they will have it available when you rent, so... it sucks as a buyer, but I can understand.]

The prices are based on Gander Mountain (GM) and Wal-Mart (WM).  To be fair, I will use the higher of the two if they both carry them.

Federal 550 (red box) ...$25 (WM exclusive)
Federal 525 Champion (blue box) ...$25
American Eagle (40) ...$3 (Dick's)

	Blazer (50) ...$3
	MiniMag (100) ...$8
	Stinger (50) ...$8 (may have been lowered to $6.99)
	Velocitor (50) ...$8
	Standard Velotity (50) ...$5
	Standard Velocity (100) ...$7.47 (black box, new at Wal-Mart; as expected, this one has already popped up here for $12)

Winchester
	222 bulk ...$13
	Super-X (100) ...$8
RWS Target Rifle (50) ...$8 (German, fantastic stuff)

As you can see, outside the RWS, CCI Stinger/Velocitor/Standard, and most of the Eley stuff, basically nothing costs more than $.08 per round.  Many, perhaps most, of us know this and just roll our eyes at these ridiculous asking prices by gougers.  This list is meant for the benefit of people who don't ever come across them in stores and so don't know what the current retail market is for the stuff.

Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks. ________________________________________ Features • 7.62x39 Russian • Gas piston, rotating bolt • 7075-T6 aluminum, Hard coat anodize lower receiver • M1913 Picatinny rail for mounting optics • Ambidextrous magazine release • Polymer Handguard that accepts Magpul light and rail kits • Two Stage Trigger - 7.6lbs • Flip Sights • Bolt release • Safety selector • Charging handle that can be installed on either side • (1) AK Type, 30 round magazine • Swiss folding stock"

Lightweight, little recoil, accurate, DEPENDABLE (this gun does not jam...even after I fell face first into the mud on a duck hunt), easy to clean, gorgeous, and cheap to shoot.  Only reason I'm getting rid of her is to get a 12 gauge goose gun that shoots 3""-3.5"" shells.

No dings, dents, discoloration, etc.  The gun easily has approximately 98% of the original factory finish remaining.  The wood is immaculate. The only ""flaws"" it has are a handful (around 5) of extremely light scratches/rubs on the receiver metal.  For being a 27 year old hunting gun it's in exquisite shape.
