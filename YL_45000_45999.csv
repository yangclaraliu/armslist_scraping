Montgomery Ward decided not to sell them, but Mossberg took up the type and sold it in its various incarnations into late 1970s.   
     The Model 800 had a strangely-shaped S-shaped bolt handle - bent forward, then back.   The rifle is well-made and looks good.   Internally, the bolt is also unusual, having two rows of three lugs (most rifles only have one set of lugs).   The extractor uses a rather short blade, but its spring is especially strong, saving space and giving the Model 800 reliable case ejection.   The early versions used a walnut Monte Carlo-type half stock, with the pistol grip wrist having a plastic white cap and the buttplate having decorative white spacers.   The pistol grip wrist and fore-end had impressed skip-line checkering.

I can media blast your knives, handgun/rifle magazines and Duracoat it in any color that you want.

There are about 145 colors available and many different camo patterns as well. I do plan on offering more custom work in the future but right now solid colors and basic camo are what I am sticking too. Once I feel more comfortable I will do firearms but right now it is just smaller items.

Feel free to email me details.  I am really trying to gauge any interest and work on a few pieces at a time.

I have discovered that this is great for AR mags as well. I am doing a few tonight and will post pics to my photobucket account as soon as I get them complete. I am also working on a few ESSE knives tonight as well.

I purchased this gun at a local gun shop in 2004. Since then she has been very well taken care of. I have not had any issues with  performance since day 1. I have fired around 1000 rounds of both ball and hollow points through it with only 3 rounds refusing to eject that came out of the same box (Winchesters).

The gun is taken to the range regularly and is cleaned after each use. It has been stored in my bedroom for home defense while not on the range. 

There are very minor scratches that appear to be from sliding it in and out of one of those cheap plastic paddle holsters. I have tried to get a good picture of those to give you an idea of what they look like. 

Included with the sale are the gun, 2 magazines and a soft shell paddle holster. Also included will be at least a 50 round box of ammo.One mag is a standard 10 round, while the other is a 15 round mag. One of the mags has a weak spring and will fail to grab the slide after the last round is ejected occasionally, but I did not have any problems this past week at the range. 

I will not ship, it simply costs too much to ship a handgun if you dont have a FFL. 

Please do not contact me with trade offers. I am selling my Smith to purchase a 1911, just time for a change. 

If you have a criminal background or otherwise are not legally permitted to purchase a firearm, do not contact me. All transactions will go through a local federal firearms dealer, you will be required to have a handgun purchase permit from your sheriff or either a valid concealed carry permit.

You will find 2 for sale on GunBroker in similar condition but both of them are priced at or above $1900; they don't have any bids at the moment so that is probably a little high.

PBM serial number prefix, one of the latest production with none of the earlier G30 trigger bar problems. In other words, it has the newer 4256-1- trigger bar.
Mar 10 2010 test fire date.
Exactly 300 rounds of factory ammunition (Federal, WWB, Speer) has been fired for function testing. Very accurate, soft recoil for a 45cal. No malfunctions or other issues, flawless operation.
It is in excellent, ""like new"" condition. Thoroughly cleaned and inspected before firing. Lubricated per manufacturer recommendations. Doesn't even have the usual ""smilies"" on the barrel (although I can't take full credit for that, the new barrel finish is great).

This pistol can sometimes be difficult to find and goes for about $549 new around here, so you are looking at over $600 after taxes. I'd love to keep it, but I now have a new baby and a young family to support. This would be a great pistol for someone looking for 45cal in a compact, accurate package. $500 FTF. No taxes (or shipping and transfer fees if buying online). Also, no 4473 to fill out if that is important to you.

Probably the best trained defensive shooter in the country, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
chooses and carries ""Glock"".

http://frontsight.com/newsletter/html/17-right-gun.html  

I will tell it to you straight because Front Sight does not sell guns in our pro shop.  We have no beneficial interest in any gun manufacturer and there is no ""Front Sight Service Pistol"" being promoted to anyone.  We are as pure as the driven snow as far as our interest in directing you to what is the best choice for a simple, reliable, and easy to use handgun that carries lots of fight-stopping cartridges.

Simplicity: The Glock is by far the simplest.  Trigger, magazine release, and slide release.  That's it.  The Glock is as simple as it gets. What about the Safety? Glocks have a safety on the trigger.  Safety is between your ears, so keep your finger out of the trigger guard until your sights are on the target.  We train YOU to be safe with ANY gun. We routinely place Glocks in the hands of students taking our courses who have never shot a gun before and they do extremely well with them and are extremely safe with them. 

Ease of use:  The Glock wins again with a trigger press that is essentially the same with each shot and has no safety lever to engage.

Accuracy:  Accuracy is really about YOU and not the gun.  Consistency is a better term to describe the gun.  Put the gun in a vice. How consistent is it in shooting a tight group?   You cannot hold the gun as steady as a vice, so all modern handguns are more consistent than you can accurately hold them.  If you can't shoot a tight group it is not the handgun.  The good news is we can train you to shoot accurately up to the consistency of your gun.

Speed:  Glock wins again.  The less you have to do to shoot the gun, the smoother and faster it is to deliver a fight-stopping hit. When we teach you how to properly re-rest the trigger for your second and subsequent shots, you will be amazed at how fast you can shoot an auto-loading pistol ACCURATELY.

So what do I carry? I can carry and shoot any gun extremely well.  I choose to carry. a Glock.  Why? Because in a gun fight, I too will only be half as good and half as smart as I am on my best day on the training range due to the stress of a lethal encounter.  Fortunately, a ""half as good"" Four Weapons Combat Master is still miles above the average dirtbag predator on his best day."

FROM SIGSAUER.COM--
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The Sig Sauer STL-900L tactical light and laser is great for civilians, home defense, off duty police officers, and military personnel. The SIG SAUER STL-900L tactical light and laser is the ideal integrated solution for weapons illumination and aiming. A high output LED provides a blinding white light, with a strobe function optimized for disorientation. The high intensity red laser works alone or in combination with the white light to provide pinpoint accuracy. The STL-900L features a quick release latching system that can be operated with one hand and tightened for added security without the use of tools. The unit attaches to M1913 and similar type rails, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of platforms."

In 1968 Daisy, brought out a really strange gun. It was a .22 that fired caseless ammunition, which was ignited by the adiabatic heat of a conventional spring-piston airgun powerplant. That's right, a pellet rifle that shot a 40-grain lead bullet at 1100 f.p.s. It was a firearm, of course; but, because Daisy built it, it had a plastic stock.
