Its a few years old and was bought new from Fin Feather Fur. It has served me well but recently upgraded to a bigger safe.   Its in like new condition. Comes with the stock interior and a custom interior I built. I ordered the fabric and trim directly from Liberty so it matches perfectly. I primarily have rifles with scopes and the custom interior accommodates that along with one large shelf at the top. Pictures of the custom interior can be sent to interested parties. The pictures below are of the actual safe with the stock interior shelves like it comes from Liberty.  Some of the options it has are no longer available in this model. It has a semi-gloss gray textured finish, black-chrome hardware and an E-lock. The instruction manual will be included and a unique PIN number of your choosing can be entered and used. It has a gray fabric interior (stock and custom). It has an electrical kit installed with 3 outlets for the interior. I will also include a dehumidifier rod along with the sale and an exterior light for the E-lock.  If your interested in the safe, you will have to arrange pick-up of the safe. I can help you remove it from the house and load it into your truck. The safe was brought into my house by Fin Feather Fur and I do not have a truck or appliance dolly to bring it to you. You will have to supply the appliance dolly or other means to move it and a truck or flat bed trailer to haul it away. That being said, I have priced this safe accordingly. Moving it from my house will be easy. Its 10 feet from my side door which leads right to the driveway where the truck can be pulled right up to. Only one step down from the house to the driveway and flat concrete floors in the house. No stairs to go up or down, no carpet to deal with. I will have to remove 3 pins from my exterior door and that's it. Should take 10 minutes or less to move.  
 
I just priced this model out as close as I could through Fin's Liberty dealer website and its $1289.00 for just the safe with the options I listed, no delivery.
 
I will sell for $700 or $900 in trade value."

This beautiful rifle has been lovingly taken care of and never abused. She received regular maintenance and has only had about 200 rounds put through her. She features a 20” 1:12 free-floated twist cold hammer forged barrel crafted by the very professionals that make the majority of the barrels for the military ensuring decades of continuous use. This barrel allows this rifle to achieve sub-MOA accuracy with ease. I have personally punched tiny holes at 250 yards using only factory loaded average quality ammunition. I am confident that this beauty will achieve laser beam like accuracy when using good quality ammunition or decent hand-loads. The trigger achieves a crisp 4 pound break with no creep. The stock is a rubber coated Hogue overmold that can be handled in any condition and still maintain a good grip. This is a great rifle for hunters or operators alike and will soon become your go to rifle for all your accuracy and long range needs.

This rifle is a great addition to any collection, based off the proven Mauser action and chambered in 8mm Mauser. This rifle was produced in factories created by the Germans during WWII using quality materials. This particular rifle was produced between 1948-1952 in the Zastava factory and was maintained in a “combat ready” condition since then. She was brought state-side by the Mitchell’s Mausers Corporation and underwent an inspection process before being sold. Since I bought this rifle it has been maintained on a regular schedule and has never-been exposed to adverse conditions. I have fired exactly twenty rounds of non-corrosive factory ammunition through this rifle. She functioned correctly with no problems and has been my “safe queen” since then.
I am asking $300 OBO, cash only no trades. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions."

The only flaws I can really find with it , there are super fine chips near the lever set and a couple very faint hairlines on the dial. That are pretty much undetectable. And the bow is not as tight as I would like it to be. I was going to take it to a silversmith to have that taken care of but never got around to it and it has never fallen off my chain so it's still got to be on their good. I SERVICED the watch about 3 months ago took it apart cleaned and oiled up it's been keeping perfect time ever since. It is only a single sunk dial by The Sweep hand. But this is the one of only a few Sidewinder swing outs I have ever seen.If you need any other pictures please hesitate to ask, thanks for looking and God bless.
