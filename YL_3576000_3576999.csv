What I have...
DPMS Oracle purchased in 2012, looks brand new. It's only had 30 rounds through it and I followed the recommended routine of cleaning the barrel after every round for the first 20. No problems at all. I added a quad rail, but still have the original hand guard. I also added a DPMS extended bolt release, which works well, but wasn't really necessary. 

Why?
I just don't shoot the DPMS and I am looking for a smaller CCW."

Product Overview: This is a really beautiful stainless steel shotgun. The Winchester Model 1200 was first offered to the public in 1964. It was used by US Marines and US Army soldiers in Vietnam. It was a successful design and was also adopted in a police riot model for many departments across the United States. Though the shotgun was well received, Winchester wanted to develop a 'cheaper' shotgun that would cut into the market of Remington & Mossberg. The Winchester Model 1200 was one of the models to be phased out. This model was very well made and with its shorter barrel, it would make an excellent home defense shotgun."

I bought this gun new 2-3 years ago roughly. Probably has 5-600 rounds through it. Never had a single function fault of the gun (box of junk ammo with bad primer or powder in a few of the rounds.) It does have a bit of a punch to it with +p rounds in that may be a bit much for an inexperienced shooter due to the subcompact frame size.

The bluing exceeds 93% and the stock is in good-very good condition with a minor chip next to receiver and normal wear on stock and checkering. The previous owner engraved his name several times on the receiver which is the extent of the bluing grade deduction (see pics). This gun has been taken down, thoroughly cleaned, and oiled for humidity protection. Hunting season is around the corner and this is the shotgun that started it all, making the 870 the highest selling shotgun in history and it remains so to this day. Barrel is stamped KWW (May 1950) with matching receiver and barrel serial number 6964V making it a first edition Wingmaster! Jason REDACTED"

The wooden stock is in good shape with only a couple small nicks, again does not penetrate the finish. This was  made in the 1964-1981 era so it is a vertical ejecting rifle and just has the half cock safety with no cross bolt safety (like the pre-64s). I group about 4-5"" at 100 yards with the iron sights. It has the shorter 20"" barrel so it is short, light, and handy. It would make a great truck gun if it were not so pretty.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

From Burris:

For AR and carbine shooters, Burris offers a complete package with the new AR-F3 Flattop FastFire Sight. This bundles a FastFire III with 3 MOA dot and rugged protective mount that's range ready right out of the box. It's the simplest and most effective way to mount the FastFire III on an AR flattop as a stand alone sight or as a co-witness for your iron sights. The FastFire sits low in the mount and a pair of metal wings on each side of the lenses protects the sight from impact or unintentional abuse. For added convenience, there is a lower compartment for spare battery storage, open end wrench and Torx wrench. Fits any Weaver or Picatinny-style base.

Specifications and Features:
Smaller, lighter in weight and more compact than most red dot sights
Strong and durable with a frame made of stainless steel, bronze and anodized aluminum

Can be mounted directly on almost any weapon including on the slide of a semi automatic pistol Since eye relief is unlimited, the FastFire can be used on handguns, rifles and shotguns

I did some research, and found that this ammo was produced in between 1941-1945 by a Canadian company then known as Dominion, and is for a 9mm sub-machine gun. But before i knew that I fired about 20 or so from my Glock with no issue other than very stiff recoil, and a strange burning smell.. the other 'less believable story I read on this involved something along the lines of clandestine CIA ammo, and I stopped reading. 
 Long story short: I am not an ammo collector, these were made in 1945,  i have no idea what they are worth if anything, if you are a collector of old ammo and have interest in adding these to your collection,  or have helpful info on these rounds please pm me. Id be willing to trade them for just about anything I can use firearms or outdoor related ie: modern 556/223, 357 mag, 9mm, anything else, Or what have you? but being that this is quite petty on my end i am not willing to travel far.

The CF-29 was the flagship model of the Toughbook range and boasts a whole host of innovations, wireless applications and rugged features.
Constructed using a re-designed ultra strong magnesium alloy case, the CF-29 Toughbook is vibration and shock resistant to MIL-STD 810F and comes with a 32mm thick, foam packed HDD casing, enabling it to withstand drops from a height of 90cm. A special HDD-heater allows the CF-29 to operate under extreme conditions up to --20°C while the anti-sun-reflective silver painting and the internal thermal pipe system of the unit prevent heat absorption in hot outdoor conditions. All joins and external covers have been sealed using a new dispense gasket method that creates a watertight seal with flexible elastomer to ensure dust and water resistance to the IP54-standard.
The Intel® Centrino™ Mobile Technology allows for greater flexibility and guarantees optimal WLAN reception with two integrated antennas located in the top of the display unit. In conjunction with the CF-29's redesigned durable battery a running time of up to 8 hours can be achieved. The 'hot swapping' multimedia pocket gives the flexibility to swap between several optical drives and even a secondary battery."

These shotguns are manufactured in a wide spectrum of models, with different stocks and options, but all are based on same action with patented features such as Tri-bore barrel profile and Pulse Piston gas operated action. FABARM SAT-8 shotguns are gas-operated, semi-automatic weapons. Gas piston is of ring type, and is located around the front of the magazine tube, below the barrel. The patented Pulse Piston system consists of a polymer brake ring which is compressed between the gas piston and operating rod, which is connected to the bolt group. Upon discharge, this brake provides constant velocity of recoiling parts (regardless of the power of ammunition used) through the self-adjustable friction between the polymer ring and outer surface of the magazine tube - the heavier the load and the higher is pressure in the barrel, the stronger the ring will be compressed and the more friction will be added to the whole operating system. Barrel locking is achieved by single swinging locking piece, which is installed in the top of the bolt. The locking piece engages the notch in the barrel extension, and drops (rotates)down when bolt is unlocked. Return spring is located around the magazine tube. Feed is from underbarrel tubular magazine, which holds 7 rounds (total capacity is 8 rounds, assuming that one round ischambered). Receiver is made from aluminum alloy, and features integral Picatinny rail. Furniture (for end and buttstock) are made from polymer. Barrels are made using FABARM's proprietary TriBore bore profile, and can be equipped with interchangeable chokes or muzzle brake /compensator."

The rifle is exceptionally clean and the serial number starts with “823-“ which makes it produced in 2013 according to this site:  

http://www.ruger.com/service/productHistory/RI-10-22.html


The scope sits on a Picatinny rail that allows for tactical items to be quickly attached and removed as the shooter desires.  The scope is a 3 – 9 x 40 BSA Sweet 22 which retails for ~$149.95 new.  This type of scope uses trajectory compensation technology that was originally designed for military snipers; however these hot new scopes are catching on fast with target shooters, varmint hunters, and plinkers who want to spend more time hitting and less time missing when they go to the range.  The Sweet 22 is calibrated for .22LR ammunition and ¼ MOA, this means one click will move the bullet ¼” at 100 yards.  That info was basically taken from these two sites and then my own nickels worth tossed in too:

This was my first shotgun and I've taken very good care of it the entire time I've owned it. This rifle comes with the longer field barrel and the shorter home defense barrel. I put a Hi-viz front sight on the security barrel as well as a polymer heat shield. The field barrel has a sling stud installed on the end cap. I also painted the stock and fore end a tan Krylon. Those are the only modifications I have made to the firearm. This thing shoots like a champion and has never had any issues what so ever. I have cleaned it after every use, completely disassembled it once for a deep clean, and took it out on less than 5 hunting trips. This is an outstanding value gun, a super accurate shotgun, and a very very very light rifle for hunting.  The rifle comes with both barrels, a neoprene shell holder, rifle plug, original manual and any other parts I can find. I don't have any current pictures of the rifle so I posted some of the most recent ones I have, but I can send you more if you are a serious buyer.  Transfer must be done at an FFL and I can drive anywhere in the Santa Cruz County to meet you. Let me know.  Be advised, the firearm is not camo, those were just decals for a hunting trip"
