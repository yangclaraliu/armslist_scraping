Has single stack mag Aside from the weight makes a great carry weapon. Has factory tijicon nite sites, however they do need to be relamped, I believe they do it for around 40 dollars, you just send the slide into Trijicon. This weapon is what S&W calls Traditional DA-fires single action unless decocked-then it is double action first shot, then single after unless decoked again.This weapon is extremely reliable, and has fired any and all 45 ACP ammo I have shot through it with not a single issue. The only caviat to this weapon is if you have smaller hands, you may not shoot it as accurately, a lot depends on finger length on this one. I have large hands and long fingers and for me this weapon is confortable and I can double-tap center mass at 15 yards and keep both round in the 10 ring. I have seen others with smaller hands fire this pistol and shoot it effectively, but with less accuracy.  I will only sell to people 21 years of age or older, with FLDL and Fl Conceal carry permit. Please do not email me telling me the law states an 18 year old can buy a pistol from private sales, I am aware of the law, I simply will not sell a firearm to anyone under 21."

I discovered it had a broken rebound slide spring and replaced it. Now it functions fine. It has 3 or 4 smooth dark spots in the bore. It isn't rust and doesn't affect the function. As far as I can see there is no rust anywhere. It was completely disassembled. At some point in the last 112 years someone put their drivers license number on the back strap. It's not that noticeable. Price is $250I will consider trades for other military or older revolvers or pistols.Must meet local to Helena/ Macalla.Please text to 205-223-threenine03"

This is one of the rarest Lugers one would hope to encounter with only around 250 examples doucumented today out of the original 1000 test pistols. These pistols were manufactured in 1901 and 1902 also making them among the first lugers every available. This pistol is in very good condition for a test Luger as most were beaten beyond recognition and were pitted from one end to the other from the humid Climates in the philliphnes and Cuba and most of them encountered today are reblued because of this. This one has a matching upper and lower frame and barrel assembly with the toggle assembly being mismatched to the receiver but matching itself and the trigger and side plate displaying non matching numbers as well. This was extremely common for test pieces as the Army swapped parts to see if they were interchanable and it's very rare and a true collectors prize to find a test piece that is all matching and original finish and they command very high prices when found. This luger is 100% original finish with about 60-70% of its original rust blue finish still present. This gun belongs in a museum or an advanced collection. Below is some information about the 1000 test Lugers. One thousand test Lugers (7.65 cal) were delivered to the U. S. Springfield Armory in late 1901. Most were distributed to U.S. Cavalry troops involved in police actions in the Philippines and Cuba. As the American Cavalry troops had used revolvers (Colt .45 and .38) for over 30 years, the small caliber, complex Luger, was viewed with some suspicion and not readily accepted. There were complaints as to small caliber, safety while riding from horseback, and unreliable action. As a result of these reports 50 Lugers in caliber 9mm were briefly tested by the Army in 1904-1906 and three Lugers in .45 caliber were tested. Ultimately the Luger was rejected in favor of the Colt 1911. The characteristics that separate these U.S.-American Eagle-Test Lugers from other Model 1900 Lugers are: the lack of proofs, the lack of a Germany import stamp and the last two digits of the Lugers serial numbers on the right end of the takedown lever (instead of the left lower side) which this guns displays all of. This serial number 6373 is also listed on the bannerman sales invoice when he bought most of the remaining Lugers that survived testing from the us army ordnance department confirming beyond a shadow of a doubt this is indeed a us test trials pistol. Take a look around at recent auctions and you will see you will never find another of these pistols anywhere close to this price and if you do it usually has been refinished. Will ship to FFL or C&R license holder anywhere in the US. Email, call, or text REDACTED."

The handgun is in excellent shape and has the factory wood grips with inlalyed gold ""Trident"" medallions which makes for one nice looking Beretta. The gun is the single/double action decocker model (from the factory) and would include 6 factory mags; the original box, cardboard sleeve, manual, and extras; and a six round mag pouch with embroidered labels. I own two of the Beretta 92/M9 variants, and only really want to keep one.If you aren't already aware, the Beretta 92FS (or the military designator, Beretta M9) was the sidearm of choice for the US military from 1985-2017, where it has been marked for replacement from sig. Aside from that, this gun has been used by Police agencies all over the world and has been seen in countless movies and tv shows over the last 3 decades.This particular gun has seen exactly 500 rounds after I first got it, to get it through its break in period, and then was promptly stored in the safe. It has been well taken care of and comes cleaned, lubricated and ready to shoot.$625 is where I start pricing, but I'm pretty open to equivalent value trades. Here are a few ideas to get the ball rolling:CZ 75 variants, Quality 1911 (especially a compact model) in .45, P226's or P229's, 44 Mag revolvers, CZ 97B, Walther PPQ M2 in 9mm, Kimbers, H&K's, Sig's, etc.This trade list is in no way conclusive, so feel free to make offers, the worst I can say is no, and I can add a little cash/bitcoin/gold coinage to make the right offer work."
