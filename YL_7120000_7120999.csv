(2 3/4”), 32” single barrel with an excellent, bright bore; 30” O/U barrels with excellent, bright bores. This is an excellent, modern trap gun that features: adjustable ribs with mid-beads on both barrel sets, extensively engraved frame with gold game bird inlays, single release trigger (installed by Phillip Crenwelge of Albert Lea, MN), hooked pistol grip with palm-swell, and adjustable comb. The barrels retain 95-97% of their original matte blue finish with most of the loss occurring on the metal surrounding the breech trunnions of both barrel sets due to use (not visible when the barrels are mated to the frame). The frame itself retains 97-98% of the original color case-hardening, while the bright blue has faded partially to gray on the forend iron, and along the edges of the trigger guard bow. The highly figured European walnut forend has a few very minor handling marks with some mild flattening of the points as well. The buttstock, likewise, has scattered small handling marks with a small triangular chip missing from the wood at the top of the right sideplate, and some further flattening of the points in a few spots. The stock has a 14 7/8” LOP to a black, Caesar Guerini recoil pad. Lock-up is still tight with both barrel sets, and the lever is still well right of center. The set is housed in the original case with the following choke tubes: 1 Full, 1 Light Full, 2 Imp. Mod., 1 Mod., 1 Light Mod., 2 Skeet, and a single Muller U/3 tube (Imp. Mod.). Also included are a choke wrench/thread cleaner, stock wrench, double-headed comb adjustment wrench, the original hang-tag, manual, and original velvet component sleeves.

This is number 228 of only 500 rifles manufactured in 1990/1991 to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the Swiss Confederation by the Association of Swiss Gunsmiths. These rifles were made using ex-military 7.5mm K.31 Short Rifles and sleeving the barrels to .22 caliber. A fixed, semi-cylindrical loading tray (and an offset rimfire firing pin) was added to the original, matching numbered bolt, and this fits into a corresponding recess surrounding the chamber mouth and allows the cartridge to be positioned correctly for loading. The metal retains 99% plus of its original mixture of bright blue on the barrel and matte black on the receiver with gold highlighted Swiss shield, “Jubilaums” on the left side, “KK-Karabiner” on the right. The bolt retains its original bright finish with satin textured finish on the aluminum knob, and the original matching numbered magazine is still present. The select, straight grain walnut stock and handguard are also in virtually pristine condition with almost no handling marks or blemishes marring the beautiful semi-gloss finish and the inset oval plaque on the right side has no chipping or damage around the inletting. The rifle still has its original 10 shot/50m test target in a sealed plastic hang tag, the original woven leather sling, which is in excellent, virtually unused condition, is also included. An original metal muzzle cover completes the package. These are absolutely splendid rifles that are seldom seen on the market today, especially in the U.S. and this example is in virtually new condition and exhibits practically no use."

This rifle does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular usage. There are a number of small, shallow nicks and cuts, as well as some minor scraping throughout the wood of the stock. However, there are no major flaws/defects, such as severe cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, rusting, staining, or discoloration. There are also some light scratches on the receiver, though the receiver is also free of rusting, staining, or discoloration. This rifle DOES NOT come with a scope, though it does have it's original iron sights, and has been drilled so that a scope may be mounted on top of the receiver. This rifle features a safety switch set in the rear of the trigger guard, and comes with the original 3-round clip. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this rifle, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."
