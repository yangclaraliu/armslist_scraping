I have the paddle style attachment, soft belt loop attachment, and hard belt loop attachment, as well as the extra parts kit with extra bolts and all. I do have two shells for this, a walther ppx shell and a Taurus Pt111 g2 shell, but as most know, the aliengear shells are swappable and you can get one for almost ANY handgun out there. This is a great holster, I just prefer my IWB one more so this one is going to waste. Please email or text for pics or any other info, 5106954eighteight7. These do sell for 47.88 brand new WITHOUT all of the belt attachments and not including Aliengears shipping/handling fees, so I am fairly firm on price. These have a lifetime warranty no questions asked, and also a lifetime swap out program for shells, so for example if you have a Kimber 1911 just send one of my shells back and swap AG for a Kimber one and the holster is good to go. Thanks for looking!"

These specially altered US government revolvers are most commonly referred to as ""Artillery"" models. No special care was taken in preserving the matching assembly and serial numbers of these refinished and modified pistols and they were reworked in relatively large numbers. These single actions are very interesting to debunk as nearly every part came from a different US cavalry gun from a different era. This particular gun has a frame with the serial number 120291 (c.1887), trigger guard marked with the serial number 96034 (c.1883), and a back strap with the serial number 82019 (c.1882). The frame bears the inspection mark of ""D.F.C"" David F. Clark. The cylinder is Marked with the serial number ""6339"" and is also marked ""D.F.C"". The trigger guard is marked with a ""G"" and the back strap has no visible inspector marking. The barrel is correctly double proofed and is marked with ""2277"" and the inspector mark ""R.A.C."" Rinaldo A. Carr. The grip has both original cartouches. They are weak. The LH is the better of the two with the 1901 date still be readable. This artillery single action is no doubt an original example with all original parts and I guarantee the authenticity. The condition is very good. The frame has been cleaned up some but still has some original case color in protected areas. The barrel is mostly a lightly cleaned silver patina. The guard and ejector housing actually still have some bright original bluing. The grip is free from cracks or major damage. Bore is near mint with strong rifling. Mechanically excellent. A great original and early single action artillery, shipping is also available."

This has been my EDC for several months and I love it, but unfortunately, need to sell. It conceals so well because it is incredibly thin (see the pic comparing it to a S&W M&P compact in its holster). The sturdy but lightweight, all-metal frame and 4.25"" barrel won't let you down.
The holster is by HBE Leatherworks up in Bountiful. If you aren't familiar with him, you should be... check his site and reviews on his top-notch work. It's a black leather tuckable IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster with a sturdy clip. I truly do forget that I'm wearing it. It cost me $130. Come check it out.
Along with the custom, beautiful holster and ridiculously expensive spare mag, this pistol comes with the box/case and all original goodies. It's in great condition and has been reliable.
After the holster ($130), spare mag (not lower than $40 even on Cheaper Than Dirt), the gun ($579) plus tax, I'm $800 in so you've got a great deal here.
Face to face only; buyer must have ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I'm not interested in trades at this time because I need to sell - cash only.Happy to answer any questions; thanks for looking and God bless.

It's a drop-in cylinder that will allow a .44 Pietta 1851 Confederate Navy cap & ball revolver to accept .45 Long Colt or .45 Schofield ammunition. It's a specialized, lower power round often called ""cowboy ammo"". Should only be used in the steel frame version. Will also fit the brass frame version although I've heard it can bend with repeated firing. I believe it was made by Howell and is compatible with another model revolver although you'd have to do some research. The back end of the cylinder detaches to load and the revolver must be disassembled after your 5 rounds are spent. Just a heads-up, it's called a ""drop-in"" cylinder although I've read a few reviews in which some modification was required. I paid $300 for it and am asking $150. Call or text me @ REDACTED"
