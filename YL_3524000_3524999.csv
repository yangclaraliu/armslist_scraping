Gun Review: This is Posted on GOOGLE
The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

Thank You for Looking

Holster is in excellent condition.  Note that I have upgraded the straps to some really nice leather straps with Chicago screws (see pics below).  This allow for lots of adjustments to be made for a perfect fit.  I was carrying a S&W 629 Classic (which has been sold) with 8 3/8” barrel and the holster and straps always stayed in place.  Price is $80 shipped – again this rig is in excellent condition and you won’t be disappointed.

Willing to consider trades for a LH holster for a Ruger Super Blackhawk Hunter with 7 ½” barrel, or a LH holster for a S&W L-frame 6” revolver (with boot of course!).  Also would consider trades for a EER pistol scope (no gloss black finish) – would prefer matte silver, but would also consider matte black.

Some Lipsey Exclusive guns happen fairly fast, others take some time. The Bearcat Shopkeeper is one gun that has been on the drawing table for several years. It all started with a visit by Lipsey to one of our biggest and most loyal dealers in Alabama. He showed them a beautiful little 3"" barreled Ruger Bearcat. Everyone agreed it would make for a great Lipsey's Exclusive, and after talking to Ruger, they agreed to take a look at it.
Ruger decided to produce a round butt or birdshead type frame to go along with the 3"" barrel. In addition to the 3"" barrel and birdshead gripframe, they had to use a couple of other unique features to make it all work. Due to the short barrel, Ruger had to use a ""button head"" cylinder pin and a crescent shape ejector rod so that the spent cases could easily be extracted from the cylinder. Ruger is also using a steel ejector rod housing that matches the rest of the gun verses the aluminum one used on the standard Bearcats.
Even though it took 3 years, the wonderful engineers at Ruger made it happen and now we have a true ""Shopkeeper"" size Ruger Bearcat.
This is one of those guns that once you put it in your hands, you will have to get one.

It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5 round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.[2] Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail can be placed which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments."

This jeep is the cleanest XJ on the market with all of the goodies so you won't have to build or buy them yourself. I built the jeep at a 103,000 miles and it is very apparent that everything on this Jeep is literally brand new. The interior of this jeep is absolutely perfect and the body is almost perfect with only a few little door dings. If you know anything about these Jeeps you know it's impossible to find them with this low of mileage or in this kind of condition. I drove this Jeep up to Denver on the interstate to see how it would ride. I set the cruise control at 75 mph and it rode great, the only thing you could hear was a slight tire/gear wine (what you would expect for 33 inch mud terrains and 4.56 gears). For the hell of it I kicked it up to 100 mph to see how it handled and to my surprise it seemed like I was still driving 75 (Kind of crazy for a jeep with a 7.5'' lift and 33's). So this jeep can be a daily driver or go off road and do anything you want. The front dana 30 axle has the new Eaton gear driven limited slip and the rear Chrysler 8.25 has a brand new dana limited slip, both are running a set of Italian made motive 4.56 gears. The axles are completely rebuilt. I went with limited slips because they act like open diffs on the street but lockers on the trail. My living condition has changed making me get rid of this amazing Jeep. I would be open to possible trade for a nice Tacoma or 4x4 vehicle in the $15k range, I also like guns, or would sell for $12,500 OBO (Give me a call and we can talk). If you plan on buying a jeep and building it to the max, you would be crazy not to check this one out and save $3-$4 grand. This Jeep stock would sell for $7,000. I have $10k in parts listed here and guarantee I have an easy $1-$2k total in parts that I'm forgetting. Here is a list of all of the parts that I can think of, off of the top of my head.
 7.5 Rough Country Long arm Lift kit with High flex coil springs, lower high clearance arms with X-Flex Joints, upper control arms with X-Flex Joints, long arm mounting cross member, transfer case skid plate, adjustable track bar, drop pitman arm, sway-bar disconnects, and stainless steel brake lines.

Guys, Golden Tiger is the best of the steel cased Russian ammo, supplies have completely dried up.  It's lacquer coated and FMJBT bullets.  If you want to stockpile some quality ammo, this is good stuff.  If you want to spend an afternoon doing mag dumps, then buy wolf or tula. Try Gunbot.net.

Open to trades as well as cash,  7.62x51, .308, 9mm, 5.45x39.  If you propose a trade, please do a little internet research to see what the going rate is.   You can get Federal 7.62x51 for $0.60, Winchester 9mm for $0.26, Wolf 5.45x39 for $0.22.  Tiger used to go for ~$0.25 but you can't find it anywhere anymore.

This jeep is the cleanest XJ on the market with all of the goodies so you won't have to build or buy them yourself. I built the jeep at a 103,000 miles and it is very apparent that everything on this Jeep is literally brand new. The interior of this jeep is absolutely perfect and the body is almost perfect with only a few little door dings. If you know anything about these Jeeps you know it's impossible to find them with this low of mileage or in this kind of condition. I drove this Jeep up to Denver on the interstate to see how it would ride. I set the cruise control at 75 mph and it rode great, the only thing you could hear was a slight tire/gear wine (what you would expect for 33 inch mud terrains and 4.56 gears). For the hell of it I kicked it up to 100 mph to see how it handled and to my surprise it seemed like I was still driving 75 (Kind of crazy for a jeep with a 7.5'' lift and 33's). So this jeep can be a daily driver or go off road and do anything you want. The front dana 30 axle has the new Eaton gear driven limited slip and the rear Chrysler 8.25 has a brand new dana limited slip, both are running a set of Italian made motive 4.56 gears. The axles are completely rebuilt. I went with limited slips because they act like open diffs on the street but lockers on the trail. My living condition has changed making me get rid of this amazing Jeep. I would be open to possible trade for a nice Tacoma or 4x4 vehicle in the $15k range, I also like guns, or would sell for $12,500 OBO (Give me a call and we can talk). If you plan on buying a jeep and building it to the max, you would be crazy not to check this one out and save $3-$4 grand. This Jeep stock would sell for $7,000.

    This one's pretty simple. Looking for black powder revolvers(doesn't have to be Pietta but I'm blanking on the other companies that make them).

       Primarily my attention is fixed on the Pietta Engraved Colt Navy 1858, with a golden Union Eagle on the sideplate. Gorgeous gun, and out of stock everywhere. Other than that I'll look at anything.

      Other than your standard black powder pistols, I am very intrigued by the Lemat revolver. If you have one of those, you have my undivided attention. I will find something in my safes that you'll want just as badly.


   If you have the Civil War Commemorative Pistol, please let me know. We can easily work something out for that one especially. Backplate and certificate required for that pistol.

the slant AK muzzle brake works as both a muzzle brake and as a flash hider. Officially however, it is classified as a muzzle brake by the BATF.   The brake helps to control muzzle rise and keeps down dust when firing from the prone position. The slant brake works by deflecting the gases upwards causing the muzzle of the rifle to be pushed back down, therefore eliminating muzzle rise.

Fits men size x-small/small and probably women medium. Color is navy blue but looks black in photos. This vest carrier is made by ABA Body Armor and has been fitted with 2 layers on each side of Level 2 Police Surplus Body Armor, so its like TWO VESTS in one and has 4 Level II Panels, all manufactured in 2001 and 2002 by PACA Body Armor.

Measurements:
Front Panels
Length (neck to hem/bottom): 12""
Width (bottom of hem and side to side): 16-3/4""

Back Panels
Length (neck to hem/bottom): 14""
Width (bottom of hem and side to side): 17""

Level II body armor is the second best soft armor, so 2 panels doubled up effectively is better than the best soft armor Level IIIA, or you can take out a front and back panel and have a slimmer profile for conceal-ability with less but still very good protection. Both panels and vest carrier have pockets for solar plexus trauma panels, (not included).

The vest carrier is in excellent condition, and the velcro and straps are in great condition and stretchy. It had an iron on patch on the front (dumb for a concealable vest) that was removed and left some residue but its not sticky. Also had a tag snipped off that is included with the vest.

The body armor panels are in good condition and have light-medium staining but have been properly cleaned and deodorized. They have not been hit with any projectiles that would leave obvious damage and have no tears or holes.

May be interested in trades. Let me know what you have. I also have another very similar vest, let me know if you are interested in both for a deal.
Will not sell to people under 21, or felons.
No liability for use/misuse implied or given.

Fits men size x-small/small and probably women medium. Color is navy blue but looks black in photos. This vest carrier is made by ABA Body Armor and has been fitted with 2 layers on each side of Level 2 Police Surplus Body Armor, so its like TWO VESTS in one and has 4 Level II Panels, all manufactured in 2001 and 2002 by PACA Body Armor.

Measurements:
Front Panels
Length (neck to hem/bottom): 12""
Width (bottom of hem and side to side): 16-3/4""

Back Panels
Length (neck to hem/bottom): 14""
Width (bottom of hem and side to side): 17""

Level II body armor is the second best soft armor, so 2 panels doubled up effectively is better than the best soft armor Level IIIA, or you can take out a front and back panel and have a slimmer profile for conceal-ability with less but still very good protection. Both panels and vest carrier have pockets for solar plexus trauma panels, (not included).

The vest carrier is in excellent condition, and the velcro and straps are in great condition and stretchy. It had an iron on patch on the front (dumb for a concealable vest) that was removed and left some residue but its not sticky. Also had a tag snipped off that is included with the vest.

The body armor panels are in good condition and have light-medium staining but have been properly cleaned and deodorized. They have not been hit with any projectiles that would leave obvious damage and have no tears or holes.

May be interested in trades. Let me know what you have. I also have another very similar vest, let me know if you are interested in both for a deal.
Will not sell to people under 21, or felons.
No liability for use/misuse implied or given.
Sorry for the upside down pictures, craigslist still hasn't fixed that?!

On to the python now. It was manufactured in 1979 and has the original box, colt instruction manual, colt letter, hang tag, colt screwdriver and envelope it came in, colt companion manual and the authorized repair station list. The finish is IMMACULATE, there are no scratches, holster wear or thin spots. The screws appear untouched. The bore is bright and shiny and the rifling is sharp. It doesn't appear to have but a handful of shots fired through it. There is just barely a hint of a turn line of the cylinder, the line hasn't even gone through the finish. The grips are original and in almost perfect condition, just a little bit of varnish has flaked off on the bottom edge, no gouges, scrapes, scratches or thin spots."

It is currently my EDC, but I recently acquired another Glock 19 (gen 3) and considering parting with this one if the offer is right. At this time I'd rather trade for something of similar size and capacity, but offer away. Worst I can say is ""No thanks, not interested."" I'm very easy going so don't hesitate to let me know what you have. **I understand this is no $1000 dollar pistol, but I will ignore the $400 offers simply because of its condition and overall value. While it is not brand new, between the pistol, sights, and laser, it's value is around $900. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT TO GET, but it is why I won't sell it for the price of some SR9 or Sigma, or things of that nature. And don't even tell me I can keep my laser or sights because they don't fit the Gen 3, therefore I will have no use or want for them at that point. Also, the barrel in the pictures is not the stock barrel, but the original will be going back in. The nickel one in the pictures is from my NiB-X Gen 3 and is serialized for that pistol.**
So now, onto the firearm itself. It was purchased brand new by me about 4 years or so ago if I remember correctly. I've put around 800 or so rounds through her, and cleaned her after every range visit and periodically to keep lint buildup out of it. Slide and frame finish are basically immaculate. It currently has Trijicon Night Sights installed and a Crimson Trace laser grip. I have the OEM sights still and the 2 additional back straps that came with it. I have the original case and paper work with spent casing, and the 3 mags. Because I have my other 19, I am going to be keeping my hoster. It's nothing special anyway. 
I also have the paperwork and box for the CT grip with cleaning tips and allens for adjusting windage and elevation, as well as the OEM pin that the CT replaces in the grip. In short, I have everything needed in case you wanted to return it completely to stock. I have never done any trigger work or springs or anything, and never had a failure in any way. The only thing I did was the paint in the engravings to add a bit of contrast. Any questions, feel free to email me!

New in Box, Never Fired FNH FNS-40, 40S&W Two Tone (Black & SS), Night Sights, 3- 14 Round Magazines. No trades firm $650. Some Features are listed below...

The FNS pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with an optional manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.

Fast and Accurate Shooting
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.

The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.

Maximized Safety Systems
In addition to the manual safety, the FNS features:

1. Trigger Safety
The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.
The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.

2. Firing Pin Safety
The firing pin safety prevents the stricker from passing.
The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.

 3. Drop Safety
Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled. 

Enhanced Ergonomics
The FNS pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:
- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension
- Front serrations for easy press check
- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size."

This is a few years old with a scope that had came with the shotgun when it was new. Tasco 9x32mm I believe. I bought this used and it has only had 2 dozen rounds down the barrel at most. I am the second owner. The original owner bought it, kept it cleaned, and never got around to firing it, or getting his hunting license. 

I bought this for one of my sons, but he is not interested in deer hunting, so no since in having it collect dust.  I own 3 of these, and love them.  

This is the Ultra Slug Hunter 12 gauge with the heavy ""bull"" barrel, rifled. The Stock is a darker brown. Cleaned and oiled every few months, and I use linseed oil on the stock to keep it waterproof and scuff resistant. As with most H&R shotguns, the wood is not varnished. Just wipe a little linseed oil on it once a year and it looks great. No rust. Clean bore. Roughly 9 lbs.  

$215 ...  CASH .... Email contact preferred initially. I can send pictures of the shotgun upon request. I believe I have a video file of my son firing it for confirmation that is is in proper working order. 

I will consider shipping to an FFL as well.

Other than that, it's design has been followed in the sioux, cheyenne, plains indian motiff. If you married a native american woman, she may have made you something comparable to this to wear. This took over a month to create, it is hand stitched, antiqued with bees wax, and would look good in a museum, or hanging in a mans cave. I guarantee it is the eye catcher, conversation piece, as it appears in the photo. I need to clear out a few things, and this needs a new wall to hang on. It is a large jacket, I am 5'10"", and it is a little big for me, although I have worn it hunting for the historical touch. Please do not text.

Bought it way back then as a great piece for my collection of famous and historically significant American firearms.
It has been barely used - but taken out of the safe and cleaned and oiled once every six months to preserve its pristine condition. The action is smooth, the trigger is positive and the rifling is immaculate. 
Comes with the original iron sights as well as a Bushnell 4x32 Sportview Rifle Scope. It will shoot Short, Long and Long Rifle cartridges and is very accurate. I'll also include the high quality soft rifle case in the picture. I'll be more than happy to email you a collection of pictures if you wish. The Winchester 9422 is one of the few rifles you can buy with confidence because history has proven that it appreciates over time as a valued collectors item.

Shipping: Prefer local buyer but will ship if necessary for actual shipping cost.

I hand built them, they are approx. 36"" waist, yet will stretch. The inseam is roughly 34"", and I mean roughly, they will stretch too! The beautiful beadwork was done on a loom, and took many days to create. The trousers took over a month to put together. The buttons are real elk, sawn from antler. The belt is a nice french touch, historically accurate. This would look good in a museum, or in your man cave. However they wear very nicely, and are very comfortable. I'm letting a few things of my collection go. At one time, my house did look like a museum. I am asking $150.00 for these trousers . Your wife will really be turned on by the new ""mountain man"" in her life! Please no texts. Rick@REDACTED No answer? Leave a message, Enjoy!"

It is currently my EDC, but I recently acquired another Glock 19 (gen 3) and considering parting with this one if the offer is right. At this time I'd rather trade for something of similar size and capacity, but offer away. Worst I can say is ""No thanks, not interested."" I'm very easy going so don't hesitate to let me know what you have. **I understand this is no $1000 dollar pistol, but I will ignore the $400 offers simply because of its condition and overall value. While it is not brand new, between the pistol, sights, and laser, it's value is around $900. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT TO GET, but it is why I won't sell it for the price of some SR9 or Sigma, or things of that nature. And don't even tell me I can keep my laser or sights because they don't fit the Gen 3, therefore I will have no use or want for them at that point. Also, the barrel in the pictures is not the stock barrel, but the original will be going back in. The nickel one in the pictures is from my NiB-X Gen 3 and is serialized for that pistol.**
So now, onto the firearm itself. It was purchased brand new by me about 4 years or so ago if I remember correctly. I've put around 800 or so rounds through her, and cleaned her after every range visit and periodically to keep lint buildup out of it. Slide and frame finish are basically immaculate. It currently has Trijicon Night Sights installed and a Crimson Trace laser grip. I have the OEM sights still and the 2 additional back straps that came with it. I have the original case and paper work with spent casing, and the 3 mags. Because I have my other 19, I am going to be keeping my hoster. It's nothing special anyway. 
I also have the paperwork and box for the CT grip with cleaning tips and allens for adjusting windage and elevation, as well as the OEM pin that the CT replaces in the grip. In short, I have everything needed in case you wanted to return it completely to stock. I have never done any trigger work or springs or anything, and never had a failure in any way. The only thing I did was the paint in the engravings to add a bit of contrast. Any questions, feel free to email me!

I'm very easy going so don't hesitate to let me know what you have. **I understand this is no $1000 dollar pistol, but I will ignore the $400 offers simply because of its condition and overall value. While it is not brand new, between the pistol, sights, and laser, it's value is around $900.

And don't even tell me I can keep my laser or sights because they don't fit the Gen 3, therefore I will have no use or want for them at that point. Also, the barrel in the pictures is not the stock barrel, but the original will be going back in. The nickel one in the pictures is from my NiB-X Gen 3 and is serialized for that pistol.**
So now, onto the firearm itself. It was purchased brand new by me about 4 years or so ago if I remember correctly. I've put around 800 or so rounds through her, and cleaned her after every range visit and periodically to keep lint buildup out of it. Slide and frame finish are basically immaculate. It currently has Trijicon Night Sights installed and a Crimson Trace laser grip. I have the OEM sights still and the 2 additional back straps that came with it. I have the original case and paper work with spent casing, and the 3 mags. Because I have my other 19, I am going to be keeping my hoster. It's nothing special anyway. 
I also have the paperwork and box for the CT grip with cleaning tips and allens for adjusting windage and elevation, as well as the OEM pin that the CT replaces in the grip. In short, I have everything needed in case you wanted to return it completely to stock. I have never done any trigger work or springs or anything, and never had a failure in any way. The only thing I did was the paint in the engravings to add a bit of contrast. Any questions, feel free to email me!
