The only piece thai I see not Underwood is the front sight. It IS USGI, but a post war replacement. Excellent finish on all parts. Strong Cartouche on the stock. Underwood recieved the coveted "" E for Excellence "" award from the US Government for their rifles all through their production period. N $1100 OBO. 
There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   

The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"

Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.Fit & FeelWhen it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil.

Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.Manufacturer : GlockModel: G43Caliber: 9mm Luger(9×19para)Capacity: 6Frame finish: BlackSlide Finish : BlackGrips: Polymer"

This rifle has approximately 250-400 rounds fired through it and has been setup in several different configurations for testing purposes.  It has been cleaned, oiled, and well maintained after each of the range sessions during this period. Bore is shiny with factory-excellent chamber and crown.  No corrosive-causing-primer ammunition has been fired from this gun.The rifle is offered in an enhanched base configuration without additional modifications (as described below) for $599 plus shipping and handling cost.  The buyer is also responsible for all FFL transfer costs or fees.The foundation of this vz.58 vz2008 variant is a milled receiver with vz2008 serial number and manufacturers stamp from Century Arms International (CAI).The barrel is pressed, head-spaced, and pinned into the reciever and is manufactured by Green Mountain to SAMMI chamber specs in Carbon Steel.  These barrels slug out to around .308 - .309.The Receiver and Barrel are painted with a black tephlon based coating.

This bolt release enables the operator to easily release the bolt with the trigger finger.Available parts upgrades follow, (can be R&R'd, or included with rifle, or purchased separately after rifle is sold.):ITEM                                                       COST w/RIFLE   or   SEPARATE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(* INCL = packaged with base rifle for $599:)Operational Rifle with ""bakelite"" furiture and wire para-folder stock                               INCL                     N/APolenar Tactial Bolt Release                            INCL                     N/ACarrier with tig-weldded Timing Tab           INCL                    N/ATuned Bolt and Ejector                                        INCL                    N/ABakelite-style Surplus Pistol Grip                    INCL                     N/ABakelite (""beaver-barf"") handgaurd and       INCL                      $55gas piston cover USED CZ Surplus w/HWPara Metal Wire Folding Stock                        INCL                      $45CAI Slant muzzle break                                     INCL                      N/AUK59 Barrel bag w/ Vz.58 sling                     INCL                      $55(Canvas Gun Case.)2-30 round surplus magazines                       INCL where legal       N/A        duble stacked aluminium                    subtract $40 if not INCLudedOptions to rifle (price on rifle, and price separately w/o rifle):Stainless CZ SA Gas Piston                           $15                                $27Replaces CAI CS gas pistonZENDL Tactical Bolt and Magazine releasereplaces Polenar Tactical BR and surplus MR     $125                          $155Black coated pistol grip (OOW)                        $10                             $22Black Polymer Pistol Grip CSA                          $24                             $35Open Bottom with screwFab Defense Folding Polymer Stock (shown)      $80                       $119Used - adjustible cheek / fixed length / blackBlack Polymer vz rifle stock CSA - NEW             $80                       $115Includes all hardware and sling point.Black Polymer CSA handguard and                    $75                          $100gas piston cover with all HardWareB&T (Brügger & Thomet) Quadrail --                 $249      $400replaces handguard and gas piston cvrw/ maintenace removal feature, USEDMag pouch with 4-30rnd magazines                  $79          $100Slovakian style RH 14mm muzzle brake             $25       $30Czech Special Forces PT 2-piece Muzzle Break                                                  $125        $200Used - depth reamed/tappedOptics - Lucid 3MOA Red Dot                           $149        $165NEW in BOX -testedMAGWedge Kwick Rail                                      $65        $110Full top rail for VZ58 receiverStormwerks Straight Adapter            Please see my other Armslist listingFor ACE type buttstockUnless you are an Ohio resident picking up this gun in person, then shipping, handling, transfer and FFL fees are also your responsibility."

The rifle, the case, three magazines, the ironsights, 200-300 rounds of ammo. I'll even give you the creepy clown targets I have left along with a full pack of silhouette targets.

More pics available upon request.http://oldmilitarymarkings.com/japanese_markings.htmlThe Japanese manufactured over 6.4 million rifles and carbines in the 40 years from 1906 to 1945. Most of these rifles were still in use during the Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and the Pacific War of the 1940s. During the war and subsequent American occupation of Japan, thousands of these rifles found their way to the United States as war souvenirs, making them one of the most common foreign military firearms available in the country.The Arisaka rifles are named for Colonel Nariaki Nariakira Arisaka, who headed a commission during the 1890s which was charged with developing a new rifle to replace the earlier models such as the Murata. The Arisaka rifles were designated with the year of the current emperor's reign. Thus, the Type 38 rifle was designed in the 38th year of the reign of Emperor Meiji (1905), and the Type 44 carbine was adopted in the 44th year of his reign (1911). During the reign of Hirohito, rifles were designated by the last one or two digits of the adoption year according to the standard Japanese calendar. Thus, the Type 99 rifle was adopted in Japanese calendar year 2599 (1939), and the Type 2 paratroop rifle was adopted in calendar year 2602 (1942).A chrysanthemum with 16 petals (the symbol of the Japanese Emperor) was usually stamped on the receiver of rifles manufactured for the Imperial Japanese Army, indicating that the rifle belonged to the Emperor."
