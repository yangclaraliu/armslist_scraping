It is the modular handgun system that the Military has decided on using since they have ""retired"" the Beretta M9 series. This Sig is in, as you can see, flat dark earth..both the frame and the slide. The FDE frame is a medium compact and it includes a black compact frame as well. There are two 15 round magazines for the medium FDE frame and one for the black compact frame. I have shot this Sig a little over 100 times. It has an awesome trigger...probably the best trigger that i've ever felt right out of the box. (which was one reason that the powers that be at the Pentagon chose this gun) For those that arent familiar with this series.. the trigger group itself is considered the ""firearm"" and has the serial # on it. The switch from the FDE frame to the black compact frame is very simple and once practiced a time or two can be done in less than a minute. This is a superbly accuracte pistol with both frames. The all FDE one is beautiful and the compact black frame (once changed) adds a nice contrast as well. The price is well under what you would pay for this setup..with both frames and 3 magazines, in all. I have carried it a few times but it hasn't been shot that much at all.. just wanted to see how accurate it was and how the trigger was. I love this pistol..just don't shoot it much so decided to take it out of the safe and let it go. Also, has the box and lock. I can't find the manual but You Tube has tons of technical stuff on it so the manual is really irrelevant.  Thanks for looking! God bless"

Having said that...I'm selling two glock 19 gen 3s with all my concealed carry gear. They have served me well but I want something different. This IS a PACKAGE deal. Here's what we're looking at:Two gen 3 glock 19's- one at a little over 1000 rounds- one at a little under 500- both have gen 4 ejectors and apex tactical extractorsTwo IWB holstersTwo OWB double mag carriersBunch of 15 round and 21 round magsOne lone wolf g19 extended ported barrel(In the one with a little over 1000 rounds through it)Not pictured:Both original boxesFour spare recoil springsOne metal guide rod and recoil springOriginal extractors and ejectorsExtra g19 oem barrelNo trades please, the only thing I would want is a kimber k6. The price is solid. If you were to purchase all the mags, barrels, extractors, carriers and holsters-- it'd be more than a couple bills. MUST COME TO PORT CHARLOTTE. Last thougts:The lone wolf extended ported barrel makes a DRASTIC difference in recoil even with 124g range ammo, even more so with hot self defense rounds. If you have questions, please ask them.I can be reached at 941-894-4two91"
