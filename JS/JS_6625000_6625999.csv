The AR-556 is constructed from top-quality components, including forged 7075-T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers and a chrome-moly steel barrel with M4 feed ramp cuts. The 16.1-inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged, providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The AR-556's carbine-length, flat-top, M4 design is fully configured with a six-position telescoping stock and heat-resistant glass-filled nylon hand guards for shooting comfort and durability. The Ruger Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation-adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics. The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. Standardized M4/AR components are utilized throughout, so the AR-556 can be customized easily. 30-round Magpul PMAG. 1 in 8"" twist."

357,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6625357,For Sale:  KAHR CM 9,"Lafayette, Louisiana, United States",$ 400,"Listed On: Friday, March 24, 2017",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

These carbines were manufactured shortly after the Russian government sold the plans, material and tooling for the SKS rifle to China.The first manufactured carbines were called Soviet-Sino the serial number contained a Russian Cryllic as the first character of the serial number as well as  a Tula star on the left of receiver in line with the serial number.The Ghost was the next batch of carbines manufactured under direct Soviet supervision, before adopting the a Arsenal 26 triangle with the 3 Chinese characters denoting a type 56 military grade carbine in the later part of 1956. This as with all the Soviet-Sino, and Ghost guns have Soviet parts and Soviet QC/Proof stamps in several locations on the weapon and stock.This SKS carbine is 100% matching including the stock. No cleaning kit or sling.The bore is bright, with sharp rifling, the action is tight, trigger is crisp.Excellent piece of history.

This rifle is one you are not got going to find very often. It has been sitting in my safe for the last 10 years and I am selling to fund another project and let somebody else enjoy this beautiful gun. It has the tube feed plunger option along with the side feed so you can load it two different ways. That is the unique part about this rifle. Most of the 357mag rifles only load on the side feed ramp. It is dead accurate at 100yrd open sites and im sure it will shoot further iv just never tried. Its priced to sell quick at $600 cash. The gun does not have a scratch on it. Its 98%+ condition. Texting is best for me but email is fine. REDACTED

After properly breaking in the barrel (shoot one - clean, shoot two - clean, etc.) this rifle was sent to Sam Johnson at Answer Products.One of his Answer System muzzle brakes and the rifle was also accurized by Sam. The bolt lugs and receiver races were lapped, the HS-Precision stock was re-bedded.Tthe trigger was tuned to crisp two pounds five ounces (average on a Lyman digital trigger pull gauge).The barrel was re-crowned and sent to 300 Below for Cryo treatment.This rifle is fitted with a Burris 8-32 Signature scope (Peep Plex Reticule) in Burris Signature rings and secured with Burris mounts.These Burris Signature rings use a synthetic ""half doughnut"" insert in a pillow block style ring.This system grips the scope firmly without any damage to the body. The scope is aligned without any stress to the tube.The inserts come in varying sizes the scope can ""roughed in"" for long range shooting with the insert.This will preserve most of the internal elevation adjustments for dialing in those long shots.Custom EDM scope level makes those long shots even easier.If you do your part this rifle, with custom hand-loads, is capable of shooting .2"" - .3"" groups at one hundred yards.Rifle has a twenty-six inch 1:10 twist barrel.Hinged floor plate magazine has a five round capacity.Also included is a Hi-Score single shot adapter that allows long loaded ammo to be fed straight into the chamber.This adapter is easily removed by simply dropping the floor plate.Round count is very low on this rifle and the barrel was never allowed to get hot from prolonged firing.I set up this rifle as part of a multi rifle / handgun battery for South Dakota prairie dog shooting several years ago.I it was only shot a very few times on one trip in 1997.It has only been out of the safe a few times for ""show and tell"" since then so it's time to let it go.Overall the rifle is very nice having only a few very light handling marks. Included are original paperwork for rifle and scope. DOES NOT include rear bag and Harris bipod.Please e-mail for additional pictures.Tennessee buyers - FTF to Tennessee residents who can show proper ID. Lower 48 buyers - $35 Shipped to your FFL.

Features:  8x Digital Zoom allows you to quickly and easily use the turrets to increase the size of the image to zoom in on your targets. Fischer Video Connectors are durable and reliable, and allow the user to export the saved images and videos on the device to an external device for later review and sharing with your hunting buddies. MaxPol Polarity - Switch from White Hot to Black Hot (and three levels of each variety) when it makes sense. Different conditions can make different renderings of the thermal heat easier to discern, and with MaxPol Polarity, you'll always be optimized. IR Window - Your Germanium lens is protected by a highly-transmissive window that shields this costly component and ensures longevity of the optic. Digital Focus Control (DFC) - Sharpen or blur your thermal image on the fly. When more detail or less image graininess is required, simply use DFC to fix it as you go. Stadiametric Rangefinder - Quickly determine distance to your target using the rangefinder that's built right into the display of the IR Hunter Mark III. Just set your range units, set the target size, then adjust the range marks - and the distance to target will be displayed on-screen in the Range Read-Out display. Enhanced Target Recognition (ETR) - Image auto-adjusts to ensure that the reticle is never washed out in the image.    Specifications     Size:7.6"" L x 3.1"" H x 3.3"" W Weight:>1050 grams Display:EMAGIN OLED Monochrome Display640x480 VGA Resolution10-bit Monochrome Output>10,000:1 Contrast60Hz/30Hz Selectable Frame Rate Thermal Sensitivity:<50mK Magnification Range:4.5-36x Field of View:7° Optical1° Digital Eye Relief:2.00"" Battery Type(2) CR123 3V Optic DetailsMagnification: 4.5x Optical/36x Digital60mm Germanium Lensf/1.25 Spectral Response8-12um Item ConditionNew MPNIRHM3-640-60-K"

I purchased the revolver and laser brand new about a month ago.  Great gun and great caliber, just like revolvers with a hammer better.  The gun has just over 50 rounds through it.  Includes the gun, new Hi-Viz Fiberoptic Front sight, new Crimson Trace Lasergrip, original grip, 2ea 6-round speedstrips, Fobus paddle holster, and box/paperwork.  Will also throw in remaining ammo, partial box (35+/-) of 32 H&R Magnum hollowpoints, and 12 rounds of .327 Federal Magnum hollowpoints.  Cash price is $675 for everything. Not looking for trades.  Perfect revolver for the recoil sensitive!  Revolver can shoot .32 short, .32 long, .32 ACP, .32 H&R Magnum, and .327 Federal Magnum. The 32 H&R Magnum is sufficient for self defense but offers very low recoil.  Need more power?  The .327 Federal Magnum offers low end .357 ballistics with about 20% less recoil."
