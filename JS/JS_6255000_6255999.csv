The RAS47 is a 100% US made stamped AKM pattern rifle. This rifle is a late model with high serial number. The RAS47 is advertised to shoot 1 MOA and I've found that to be true with most ammo. I love this AK and wish I didn't have to sell it but I need money for school. There are roughly 500 rounds through it with 0 malfunctions. I bought it with the standard blonde wood furniture on it but decided to change it out with a Magpul Zhukov stock with extended butt pad, Magpul hand guard, Hogue grip, and Magpul MLok foregrip. The Zhukov stock is adjustable for length of pull and folds to the side for storage. I also added a QD sling mount via MLok on the handgaurd to enable the use of the included Magpul MS1 sling in either single point or two point configuration. The muzzle brake is a Fighter brake from AK Operators Union which eliminated the cheek slap after installing the Zhukov stock and makes follow up shots vastly easier. I have polished the slide areas and points on the bolt carrier making the action butter smooth. This sale comes with all components I have for it including the oem blonde wood furniture, grip, slant brake, Magpul MS1 sling, no-name scope mount with Tasco(?) scope, Magpul piccatinni foregrip, two thermold 30 rd magazines, two 5 rd steel magazines, four Magpul 30 rd gen 1 mags, and one Russian bakelite mag. All of this comes with/in a discreet rifle bag with loop backing for Velcro attachment points."

Sting 'em with the 17 Hornet Loaded with Hornady's popular V-Max polymer tipped bullet, Superformance Varmint ammunition is filled with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings 100 to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. Because there is no increase in pressure, regardless of the caliber, there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. Plus, Superformance Varmint loads are versatile and will perform flawlessly in all rifles, including semi-autos. Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles."

306,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6255306,For Sale:  Bushnell TRS-25 HiRise Red Dot,"San Jose, Ca, San Francisco, California",$ 90,"Listed On: Sunday, December 25, 2016",Optics,Kimber                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Blazing Target Acquisition. Peak Accuracy.There's nothing like a red dot for fast target acquisition and accuracy in dim conditions, and no one makes red dots like Bushnell. The TRS-25 1x25 red dot is engineered with Amber-Bright optics to help you quickly distinguish between a brown tree and a brown critter. Thanks to the scope's multicoated optics, hunters will have no problem seeing their target in low-light conditions. Other features include a 100-percent waterproof/fogproof/shockproof construction, a dry-nitrogen-filled housing, and a CR2032 battery.About the Sight:This sight can be easily used with both eyes open (eye relief is unlimited), increasing the shooter's awareness of the surrounding environment and providing faster target acquisition. There is no need for centering, due to the parallax free design in which the dot follows the movement of the user’s eye while remaining fixed on the target. The TRS-25 delivers full size performance in a sight with reduced size and low power consumption.Mounting the Sight:The TRS-25 sight mounts easily on any Weaver style or Picatinny rail. An Allen style cross screw is used to secure the sight to the rail, and the clamping system provides adequate strength to keep it securely mounted. Once resistance is felt when tightening the screw it should be rotated no more than ¼ additional turn (over-tightening the screw may strip the threads).About Red Dot Lens Positioning:All red dot sights have an objective lens at the front of the unit that is spherical in shape. However, unlike a conventional riflescope, the objective lens in a red dot sight is positioned off axis and appears to be tilted when looking at the sight. This angle of the front lens allows the light generated by the battery powered LED light source inside the unit to be reflected back into the sight. The reflected light becomes the “dot” or aiming reference that the user sees when a red dot sight is switched on. This engineered “bending” of light is what makes today’s red-dot sights so popular and easy to use. Adhesive is used on the inside of the sight to secure the LED to the inside of the tube. By design, the led package intrudes slightly on the field of view.About the Red Dot Reticle:The TRS-25 utilizes a crisp, sharp red dot reticle. A control knob is used to adjust the red dot setting. A certain amount of resistance is designed into the control knob to ensure that the sight is not inadvertently turned on. The red dot may appear blurry if the dot intensity is set too high for the ambient light conditions. This is most likely to occur indoors with artificial, fluorescent lighting. The illumination control knob should only be set at the highest settings for use in bright ambient light conditions; for example, outdoors on a sunny day. An illumination setting that is too high for ambient light conditions typically results in a dot that appears distorted and non-concentric. For best results, increase the red dot setting until the scope gives the user an aiming reference that is perceptible but not glaring. Installing the Sight with Hi-Rise BlockThe AR731306 versions of the TRS-25 are supplied with a ""Hi-Rise"" mounting block that can be used to position the sight at the correct height for optimum performance on an AR-15 style rifle with a flat top receiver.In order to use the riser block, first install the sight onto the hi-rise block. Ensure that the sight is correctly positioned and that the shaft fits into a groove on the block. To make sure that the shaft is firmly tightened, screw the shaft clockwise until a light resistance can be encountered. After that, screw another 1/4 to 1/2 turn. WARNING! Do not over tighten.Once the sight is installed on the Hi-Rise block, the entire assembly can be mounted on the weapon. First, loosen the mounting screw so that the clamp will fit over the tapered side of the firearm’s Picatinny or Weaver rail. Ensure that the tapered clamp on the riser is oriented with the chamfered (beveled) end of the clamp at the top. Ensure that the riser’s cross screw with nut is tightened to clamp it firmly to the weapon’s rail. Turn the large nut on the riser block ¼ to ½ turn with a coin, screwdriver or ½” wrench. WARNING! Do not over tighten."

Not seen all that often, the CYL choke does help on the skeet field. Action cycles beautifully, and the barrel adjustment sleeve hasn't been moved. Some bluing wear on the bottom of the receiver from being carried and a very good repair to the toe of the stock. The serial number dates it to 1951. Mirror like bore, and the wood has some nice straight grain figure which is pretty clean with a few marks but no signs of abuse. Overall, a well cared-for gun that saw some use in the last 65 years. I'm not a dealer so be sure your dealer will accept a shipment from a non-FFL holder with a copy of my AZDL for his book. If not, then I can use a dealer here, which would bump the shipping by $10 to cover his transfer fee. Cost of shipping with appropriate insurance will depend on which way that goes. You pay what the shipping costs, and not a penny more, because I cut a check back to you if there's any money left over.

Also there is 113rds of .308/7.62x51 ammo, making this a great starter package into the world of battle rifles! This rifle is also known to throw ejected brass 30ft! (It is hilarious, you can look up videos) The CETME weighs around 9lbs and accessories are plentiful online. The previous owner I believe had work done to the trigger, the pull seems stock but the reset is short. I am not sure if it was sent to Bill Springfield or not. If you are interested, please feel free to email me. FTF ONLY I WILL NOT SHIP THE RIFLE. You must have a valid VA Driver's license and a 'good guy ID' (CCW or voter's card). Thanks for reading!

The Maxus Hunter is the epitome of a Browning field gun. Rich bluing, gloss walnut and a satin nickel finish receiver. It looks so beautiful that its demure appearance masks the superior engineering and ergonomics design that make the Maxus so amazing. Don't let the classic looks fool you into thinking that this is just like every other bird gun in the field. The PowerDrive gas system cycles a wide range of loads and reduces the heaviest and slightest of recoils - making the gun more comfortable to shoot and allowing you to get back on target faster. The Maxus has the fastest lock time of any shotgun in its class, reducing the amount of time from trigger squeeze to shell ignition, resulting in more consistent and accurate shots. Whether you're taking rabbits on the ground or chukar and pheasant in the air, the Maxus Hunter looks the part and outperforms the competition. Three choke tubes are included, full, mod and imp cyl.   MANUFACTURER: Browning  MODEL: Maxus Hunter  CALIBER: 12ga  FINISH: Blued/Nickel/Wood  BARREL LENGTH: 26""  ACTION: Semi-Auto  CAPACITY: 4+1PaymentVisa / MasterCard, American Express, Discover, USPS Money Order, Money Order,Paypal, Certified Check."

This is a bolt mismatch rifle, meaning that the receiver, rear sight, and floor plate matches, and the bolt has a different serial number. The top hand guard has a really unique ""tiger striping"" and the cleaning rod fits securely. The bore is good, a little dirty, but good. There is a greenish something on the right side of the butt stock that will scratch off with a thumbnail or something similarly soft that won't ruin the finish...just haven't taken the time to do so. Haven't really shot it, so I can't speak to that."

Functions very reliably but likes to throw brass a good ways. No rust whatsoever-- bore looks shiny.Has an aftermarket Accu-Strut added (reduces barrel whip/group size). Also has Ruger Rings for scope mounting. Included are 5x 20-round black metal magazines and 1x black 5-round magazine.Chambered for both .223 and 5.56 NATO.  Believe barrel is 1 in 9 twist. Seems to prefer cheap Wolf Steel case 62gr, SMK 69gr handloads, Hornady 68gr handloads, or SMK 69gr factory loads.  Can provide details on request.Have original owner's manual and Ruger trigger lock, but no box.  I've put probably 500 rounds through this.Scope shown is a Leupold VX-1 3-9X / 40mm (have original box).  Add $200 if you want that as well.$600 cash for everything minus the scope, or $800 with scope.
