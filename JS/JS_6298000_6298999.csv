Ultra-reliable. It’s no wonder the 85s are Taurus's most popular family. They pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have backup revolvers. Plus PPlus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications. Taurus Security System (TSS)Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear."

This has one of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation bolts in it it has a perfect trigger system that's better than one of the average ones you would buy in the store now a days. Sometimes I get two choices for triggers this is the nicer one. I did paint the rifle but other than that there are no cracks or any kind of blemishes with any part of the rifle the magazine Fitz rounds and works perfectly and the rifle as clean as it can be. If you need a scope I can give you a scope but this rifle had a very nice scope on it that I took off and put on a nice shirt elk hunting rifle that I have now that I did not have when I bought this. I have also bought a new rifle that is very expensive and so I'm going to let this one go for a pretty aggressively priced option. I have tried this one lower than any other one that I have found on Armslist and on gunbroker.com if there becomes a cheaper one on Armslist I will match that price if you show me the listing. I am going to start at $600 please do not offer me any trades or any low-ball offers I would like to stay around that price range I am willing to work with someone if they're willing to aggressively make me an offer. Like I said I'm not in a rush to sell this for some stupid low price or for a trade I do not want to trade anything for this other than money. If you find a listing where they're selling this rifle for cheaper than this let me know and I will match that price.

The shoulder straps are cut 1 3/4"" wide on the shoulder area for comfort to help disperse the weight of your gun better across the shoulders instead of a smaller width strap that will cut into the shoulders. An adjustable lower back strap across the back so there is no need for straps that bind you to your belt. This strap keeps the holster & magazine pouch in place when pulling the gun or magazines from the holster or pouch without flopping around. The only direction this rig will move is if you lean back. A front strap could be added with a quick release snap if desired but it is not necessary. Black Chicago screws used on all attaching parts in case of any needed repairs. Gun in pictures is "" Not Included"". Built to last, Maker stamped & Made in the USA. Can pick up & I will ship on USPS Priority mail for $12.00 additional. Will entertain resonable offers."

Handguard conversion completed (new handguard retainer and Bulgarian gas tube) and Russian polymer furniture (Handguards and pistol grip seen in photos). Comes with original NATO length stock. I recommend replacing with your preferred Warsaw length stock.This rifle is a factory-manufactured AK from the the Izhmash factory in Russia. This factory is part of Kalashnikov Concern who currently makes all Kalashnikov rifles. It was imported, the rear end converted by Century where they installed pistol grip, widened mag well, soldered bullet-guide and added a Tapco G2 FCG. No bayo lug or threaded barrel. Less than 100 RDS fired to confirm functionality. Its a Russian AK, it fires perfectly fine.These have an Izhevsk, ""Made in Russia"" receiver and forged bolt, bolt carrier and trunnion.The barrel is a Russian-made cold hammer forged, chrome lined barrel.Notes: The finish on the receiver is scraped a bit near the safety selector. A large number of these from Century appear to have this issue. This may have happened during the re-labeling process. These have the classic ""Velcro patch"" where the original importer (RAA) info was covered up and the new one (RWC) was added. The finish on Saiga rifles hasnt been very good for some time now. It seems to have been an afterthought.I filed the bumps on the Tapco G2 trigger a bit for smoother cycling..Will ship FFL to FFL.

Please note- this is not a regular Mosin, they go for much cheaper. This rifle was a rear echelon issue, and because of this fewer examples were imported then any other carbine length Mosin. This rifle will fit perfectly in any milsurp collection as an example of rarer, less imported carbines.the rifle is next to another mosin of mine for scale.

The mcmillan stocks that came on the first models were about $900 in themselves.

It will also include a heavy duty gun-guard hard case, one magazine and a field size gun cleaning kit. The triggers on these rifles feel a lot like that of a sako trg 22/42,excellent. The magazine is longer than average, so if you hand load, you can seat heavy high BC bullets out to the lands/rifling and still magazine feed them. Remington, winchester, savage and most other style rifles chambered in .308 would be limited by the maximum internal magazine length, on how far you can seat the heavies out.
