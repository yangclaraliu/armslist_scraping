Mine is made in Belgium. I bought it 6 years ago and have taken it into the woods 10 times. I’m primarily a bow hunter and only gun hunt two days a year during a permit hunt (twice it was raining so we stayed in). I’ve tried 9 types of ammunition and it shot 8 of them in sub 3/8” groups at 100yds; it didn’t like Remington 150gr core lokts and shot them just under ½” for 5 shot groups at 100yds.
 
This will come with the optional BOSS CR muzzle attachment allowing you to use the ported muzzle brake for recoil attenuation at the range (makes the ’06 more pleasurable to shoot than a .30-30 but is LOUD), Burris supreme bases, Burris Signature rings, and loads of quality ammo. The BOSS weight allows you to change the barrel harmonics to tune any factory ammo you like for accuracy so you can run multiple weights and types of bullets and get ideal accuracy from ALL of them. The Burris signature rings allow for a TON of adjustment in point of aim without relying on the scope turrets so your scope can be optically centered for improved optical performance, increased range of tracking, and decreased risk of scope damage without having to lap the rings.

I purchased it used a few months ago from a gentleman on AR15.com and have since found something else I'd rather have.  The last owner sent the barrel assembly to ADCO and had the barrel cut to 14.5 with the AAC flash hider permanently reattached, putting the barrel length at 16"" overall. I've taken this to the range a few times, personally put about 300 rounds through it with zero issues. It is a joy to shoot and I'm sure I'll regret selling it. It has a few small bumps and bruises on the upper but otherwise it is in excellent condition inside and out. I can supply more pictures as requested. I am more than willing to meet up within an hour and a half each way of downtown Columbus. It comes as pictured and I will throw in one Lancer FDE or Smoke 30rd mag. I also have additional mags and some ammo if you're interested in adding any of that to the deal/price. Please text me as emails tend to go to my spam folder and I normally don't see them. 61four9sixone89eight0.Note: I am NOT currently looking for any trades of any kind, just cash only on this one. Thanks!"

This is an extremely hard to find 9mm example. It comes with 5 9mm mags. It shoots but either you need to use very hot ammunition or one would have to cut a few coils from the recoil spring. I have not cut the spring because I haven't shot it enough to make it worthwhile. The reason is because most 9mm ammo is way less powerful than the original 7.62x25 so with lower power 9mm it doesnt run well. The one box of +p ammo I ran through it ran flawlessly and the one box of herters didn't cycle well and failed to eject every 3rd round or so. Just wanted to make sure I disclose everything about it. It is in nice shape and almost impossible to find in 9mm. Asking 650 but will consider trades.

In a beautiful 2 tone, with a stainless slide and black frame. DA/SA with decocking lever. Please don't confuse this with the cheaper regular P239. The SAS (Sig Anti Snag) melt, makes this gun as smooth as possible. No sharp edges anywhere. Very comfortable for iwb carry. Then you have the SRT, short reset trigger, that reduces trigger reset by 60%!  Also equipped with a very bright set of Siglite night sights. This package will also include 2 sets of barrels. The original factory 40 barrel with 3 mags and a 9mm conversion barrel with 2 mags(1 extended 10 round). This gun fires both calibers flawlessly, without having to change out anything but the barrel and mag. Also included will be a Alien Gear iwb holster and a nice leather owb holster with thumb break. This is a great conceal carry package, and you choose what caliber you want to shoot! There's about a grand here all together. I'm asking $750 cash, which barely covers the cost of the gun. Basically you're getting all the extras free. Or I'll consider a trade in the 800-1000 range. I'm ideally looking for a smaller carry gun. Something along the lines of a Kimber Micro 9 or a Sig 938. Not looking for anything smaller than 9mm. Will consider multiple gun trades if yours is worth less. Maybe a carry gun plus a carbine or shotgun combo trade. Let met know what you have. I like a lot of different stuff. But cash is always king! Thanks for looking!Obviously all laws apply. Foid, ISP check and wait period required. Located in St Charles, but will meet within reason. Shipping possible at buyers expense. Text me.
