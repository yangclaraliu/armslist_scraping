Or you can just recoat it every few years because it is a gun meant to be used.Both bores are spotless, the shotgun itself works flawlessly, I just can't get used to the cross bar safety; it takes me a very deliberate few seconds to disengage when hunting being that I have almost exclusively shot Mossberg pumps season after season.Clean numbers, comes with a 28"" remchoke barrel, and a 20"" smoothbore slug barrel with iron sights, a quality sling (pump guns get heavy fast) and a mod.

Lock plate and hammer are smooth with smokey gray over silver. The barrel is generally a tad lighter silver/gray with an overlay of that powdery dark gray tiny dimpling from exposure and use, but with clear V/P/eagle proofs and clear 1854 date on the breechplug tang. The mismatched dates are TOTALLY CORRECT on a ""rifled and sighted"" model 1842. The guns were disassembled and the parts sorted without regard to which gun they came off of.
What makes this musket so interesting are the added markings put on by the soldier. Four small circles have been stamped around a central oval just forward of the bolster on the top of their barrel. This may be a rough representation of a Catholic symbol based on Jesus in a central circle surrounded by four other circles containing crosses and two human figures in each. Further evidence of religious symbolism is a clearly carved Christian cross on the left side flat, This cross has a Celtic flavor with half a circle incised above the cross arms. The traditional Celtic cross bears a complete circle, but this seems very close. The initials “GS” and “GHS” next to a “50 M..” have been deeply carved on the underside near the triggerguard, another “G” to rear of the lock.Best research narrows this down to either Massachusetts or Missouri (only two ""M"" states with at least 50 regiments of infantry). The likely owner in my opinion is George H. Spofford a 28 year old shoe cutter from Georgetown, Mass. He enlisted in the 50th Mass 9/19/62 and served his entire term of service until 8/24/63 when the entire regiment was mustered out of service. He then rejoined the 17th Unattached Company of infantry and served again from late 1864 through June of 1865. I believe the Catholic and Celtic symbols on the gun are more likely done by someone from the densely Catholic state of Massachusetts...
Asking $1500, or will trade for a M1917 revolver. This is your rare chance to have a Civil War musket with provenance. Additional pictures available upon request. Period-correct bayonet included."

Overall appearance and condition is good. The rear receiver is marked H&R ARMS CO with a serial number of 5683947. The receiver markings place this rifle into the second block of numbers alotted for Harrington & Richardson Arms Company. H&R produced this pattern to supplement existing supplies of M1s during the Korean War. Examples manufactured in this later block (to include those made by International Harvester and higher-number Springfields) do not generally command the prices of pre- and World War II-era rifles. In addition to the clarity of stamps and markings on steel parts, the lack of arsenal marks suggest that the receiver/barrel assembly retains the original finish. Wear is commensurate to that of a rifle 70+ years old. Some small parts appear to be of earlier vintage. The intact nature of the drawing numbers on the right-front receiver leg indicate that this rifle was never cut. The stock is a mismatch. Per the markings and inspecting agent's initials this dates to a Springfield Armory example produced between November 1944 and June 1945. Three of four cartouches are present. Those remaining are faint, and the lack of corresponding arsenal marks suggest that any refinish work was done outside of government supervision. Overall, the rifle appears to be a good example of a post-Korean M1 which has been restocked and rebuilt with mismatched smaller components. An M1 in this configuration has more appeal as a well-dressed shooter than a collector's piece. Comes with one bandelier with 6 clips of M2 ball ammo, and 6 additional clips.

Safety: Manual Thumb and Grip Length: 7.25"" Width: 1.45"" Height: 5"" Weight: 1.56 lbs. Enter the ECO – a single-stack Officer-size 1911 that weighs in at only 25 oz. For years, the Officer model has been criticized for reliability. We have conquered that by using the latest technology and doing what others say can’t be done. The recoil system is quite unique for this style 1911 as we use a solid one-piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. 15,000 rounds! Not 500 like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. That is longevity unheard of in a production 1911. It also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil. The lightweight 3.5-inch slide is topped with tritium night sights with our tactical rear, which allows for easy one-hand racking. The ECO barrel is a flush-cut, ramped bull barrel with a target crown rather than the traditional barrel bushing setup, allowing it to be more compact and easier to disassemble. Trigger pull is short and crisp at 4 lbs., just like all our 1911s. It breaks cleanly, enabling the accuracy people have come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. The Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim-line G10 grips really plant the pistol in your hand, allowing for faster follow-up shots and better recoil control. Just like the Guardian, the ECO’s slide and small parts receive the Duty finish NO TRADES PLEASE"

These rifles are designed to perform like new rifles but have the Nostalgic Battlefield look and flavor! Built with an original military surplus Romanian parts kit and new US barrel, Fire control and receiver yield a unique blend of New & Old for a cool look. Barrels are high-quality 4150 Nitride-treated and rifle also has side rail for adding a scope mount or Optic. These are battlefield pick-ups so they may have trench art and look battle worn. This is a great conversation piece for a collector or first time owner. Amount of wear on metal finish and wood will vary from gun to gun. Comes with one 30-round mag. Each gun is checked for canted sights and test fired to insure function and reliability and backed up by Lee Armory. In the early 1960s, the Romanian Army used mostly PPSh-41, Oriţa submachine guns and imported AK-47 rifles. With the development of the stamped Type 4 AKM receiver, and the Soviet Union's call to each of the Warsaw Pact's nations to produce their own assault rifles chambered in 7.62mm, be they AK-47 pattern or not, the Romanian State Arsenal developed an AKM clone featuring a forward-pointing front handgrip molded into the lower handguard, called the Pistol Mitralieră model 1963.   These are stock photos – exact condition will vary.   Must be 18+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $849.99 each"
