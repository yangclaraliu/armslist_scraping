Asking $1350.00 OBROFrom the Dan Wesson Web SitePresenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say cant be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy youve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish.If youre looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you wont be disappointed."

No trades. I have a S&W 642-1 No lock for sale. Approximately 200 rounds through it since I aquired it back in 2014. Original owner, was bought new in Box from a local shop here in AZ. Has performed flawlessly, makes for a nice pocket carry gun. It is +P rated. The gun is in excellent condition and shows no signs of wear. * Stainless Barrel and Cylinder and Aluminum Frame (Air Weight Model for those not familiar).* It's a 5 shot 38 Special (rated +P).* Approx 200 Rounds through it (all Flawlessly).* All internals are STOCK with no spring changes or work, etc.* I have Hogue G10 Extreme Grips on it currently (in ""Blue Lava"") and they are the ""Piranha"" model with the textured sides that offer far better grip than the stock grips while not tearing up your hands while shooting and also won't cling to fabric like the Rubber Stock Grip. I also have the original Stock Grip that will come with the gun sale as well (Black Rubber S&W Grip.) * With the sale will also be a Galco Horsehide Pocket Holster made for the 642 and similar J-frames. * With the sale will also be a Remora Original IWB/Pocket Holster for the 642 that has the upgraded leather ""Remora Hyde"" lining (gives a thinner profile and durability.) This holster is excellet for pocket carry in the summer time here in AZ since it is impervious to sweat. * With the sale will also be two ""Quick Strips"" made by Tuff Products. They hold 5 rounds and work well with the 642. They are new and unused, just out of the package. * With the sale will also be the original box, paperwork, test round casing, cable lock. If you have any questions or would like further information feel free to ask. I don't always get back to emails right away but I do my best to check multiple times a day. First come first served with whoever makes an offer. Any reasonable offers may be considered, just no lowballing. Low ballers will be ignored. Thank you all, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!"

It is in excellent condition, no marks or blemishes I know of. This gun comes with the upgrades I added to it, these include a nice Hogue rubber grip, Magpul adjustable stock, made for the commercial fit for AR10's, Magpul heatshield and foregrip, the foregrip can be removed if needed as it is attached to the added on tactical rails. The gun also comes with a nice BCM gunfighter aftermarket charging handle with the finger extension. There is a Magpul quick release adjustable sling on this rifle too that connects the to stock area of the rifle on a nice ambidextrous sling plate I had installed. The Hogue AR grip on this rifle feels great and helps soak up the extra punch you notice with the .308 rounds going off. The gun comes with its original factory box, papers, and two tactical rail risers for scope mounting if desired. I had an Eotech XR308 on it at one time, but obviously the .308 round can travel farther than the Eotech gives accuracy to. Included with the sell would be the factory 20 rd mag. I also have 3 Magpul Pmags, two are 20 rd mags, and the other is a 25 rd windowed mag. Trades only toward Remington 870s, Glocks, Sig 229 or 226, Springfield pistols, or Smith and Wesson carry size revolvers. I prefer to sell, trade values have to coincide on both ends, please only serious inquiries. This is a really nice AR-10 set up for 2/3 the price I have spent on it. I have a realistic and very fair price on it that will make someone a great buy if they are serious about buying an AR10. $1000 for the rifle as it comes, check em out, you will see this is a good deal with what it comes with for sure. I have attached some good photos that hopefully show the rifle and all the add ons well. I have about 200 rds of brass factory PMC ammo that can be added for the right deal. Thanks"

We will ship to your local dealer for $15. If paying by credit card, add 3%. VA residents must add sales tax. How do you make the most concealable full-power pistol even better? Offer it in all major self-defense calibers, that’s how. When the Springfield Armory® XD-S® arrived on the scene in 9MM and .45ACP , its svelte profile quickly made it the pistol to beat for concealed carry. The thin, single-stack design allows it to melt into the body when carried, yet it’s shockingly easy to control. Even those with larger hands can get most of three fingers on the grip. Practice is everything, so rather than go for uncomfortably and uncontrollably small, we aimed to create a handgun that’s easy and pleasurable to shoot while still offering amazing concealment. You’ll enjoy your range time with the XD-S® and become a better shooter as a result.   SPECIFICATIONS  UPC Code: REDACTED32 Manufacturer: Springfield Model: XDS Action: Semi-automatic Type: Striker Fired Caliber: .40S&W Barrel Length: 3.3"" Frame/Material: Polymer Finish/Color: Black Capacity: 7Rd Accessories: 1-6Rd,1-7Rd Magazine Sights: Fiber Optic Front, Dovetail Rear Manufacturer Part #: XDS93340BE"

When you inspect the BCG, shell deflector and hammer face you will be hard pressed to discern it's even been fired. Took it out Sunday and put a mag through it the A2 irons are still set on mechanical zero and I popped the 20"" steel gong at 200 repeatedly it's only going to get better the more time you spend dialing it in.  Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for your time.  This will be a cash only sale and for pick up at my home in South Tampa only. If you are looking for a vintage A2 Colt HBAR in pristine condition I know you will not be disappointed if you come to inspect it.  Thanks again for your interest and have a great day. ***You must bring and present a valid Florida drivers license or CWP and be willing to fill out a bill of sale.  I'm sorry there will be no exceptions as I'm not comfortable selling a firearm to anyone who can't or won't present either of those forms of ID."

623,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6211623,For Sale:  Snub nose revolver shoulder holster,"Nrh, Dallas, Texas",$ 150,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 20, 2016",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,This is a rusty sherrick hand made vertical shoulder holster. If you don't know anything about rusty sherrick look him up. He's been making the highest quality holsters for over 30 years. I ordered this from him for my j frame revolver. Some things came up and I had to sell my revolver. This holster was worn twice. No more no less. It's in perfect condition just like it came to me. It will hold j frames and colt snub noses. Zero fear of the gun falling out it is very secure. It conceals unbelievably well. It was over $200 new and I understand there's a limited market and I'm realistic. I'll sell it for $150. The picture is off his website just to show how it rides. My holster is dark brown and I can send pics of it. Top quality holster. Text is best. REDACTED

These mags are 10/30 pmags and are the NEW generation mags by Magpul. They fit both Domestic and Euro Platform rifles. They do come with Dust Covers and are Blocked with plastic limiters that run along the spine outside of the spring. Its tight, does not rattle, does not fail. I have quite a bit of these and have done alot of shooting with them already. Unlike mags I have purchased elsewhere allow me to load 10 rounds in the mag and still properly seat in the rifle with the BCG in the forward position.    *They are NOT riveted, they have a plastic limiter on the inside and it does not compress the spring at all times. The floor plate is epoxied shut.* I get asked alot if you can open the magazine up to clean it or to convert it if you move to a free state. My answer is going to be the same, I dont recommend it but you can do as you please. Please follow and abide by the laws in your area.
