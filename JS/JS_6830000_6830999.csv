The vx-2s are crystal clear, but a little pricy.

Not sure if long or or or long rifle.   Over all good condition. Rear stock is tight with no cracks. Some minor rust but no pitting. Both front and rear sight are on.  Negatives.  1/2 of the wood forearm is broken. Still able to cycle the pump with the half piece still on it.   And not sure if it cycles or no. I only have long rifle to test (and I don't have property or time to go to range to test it). Any way. I pulled the bullet from the shell and inserted it in the barrel.  The round fired when test fired , but unfortunately it didn't eject the spent shell. Not sure if it's because the gun doesn't use LR ammo. Or if it's the ejector.    So beside those to thing eleverything else is good.  Also the ammo tube is intact and has rod.  I didn't load it with ammo to test to see if it cycles. In fear that it doesn't take LR ammo.    Anyway. That's the truth of the gun.    I would like to trade for a more more modern gun. Or sell for cash.   Taking cash offers."

Barely fired.
This VZ2008 is fully loaded.  I only fired 60 rounds through the gun and then I got bored and moved onto a different project.  If you want to purchase a highly reliable, fully upgraded 7.62x39 rifle this is perfect for you and has a fully functioning bolt hold open mechanism unlike the AK.
This rifle comes with 5 magazines.  Upgrades include the following:
-Bonesteel Arms VZ 58 U.S. made gas piston.
-Bonesteel Arms VZ-58 Slovakian Style Muzzle Brake.
-StormWerkz - Stock Folding Mechanism SFM-UNI-01.
-StormWerkz - Vz-58 Stock Adapter, Type 3, MultiPoint Straight SA-VZ58-03.
-DPH Arms Aluminum Stock, solid billet, 9” with 1/2 inch recoil paid.  Very difficult to get.
-NEA Aluminum Handguard for VZ-58.  Upper and Lower.  Very hard to get.
-Mako VZ58 Pistol Grip.
-Rifle comes with a spare set of brand new springs.-Most importantly the rifle was welded to the bolt carrier by Morgan Goldberg of Forced March Fabrication who is an expert on that process.   This modification is needed so that the VZ2008 will run reliably over the long term.  Century Arms is not allowed to do this process and was sued by D-Technik for doing so.  Very few VZ2008s have had this done.
If you want to save some time and get a top of the line rifle this is a great option for you."
