It uses a virtually indestructible light emitting diode (LED) to provide six output levels, from a long-running low beam suitable for map reading, to a brilliant tactical-level high beam with five times the light of a big two-D-cell flashlight. The U2's selector ring provides instant output control, and electronic current regulation maintains a more consistent level of light output for the useable life of the batteries. At the high setting the U2 will put out two hours of tactical level light (50+ lumens from an LED source) with a total runtime of three hours. At the lowest setting it will run for 175 hours. The combination of features in the U2—compact size, extended runtime and high output capabilities, along with the 10-year shelf life of 123A batteries—make it perfect for backpacking, camping, or disaster preparedness kits."

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

I am firm on price as I think it is more than reasonable for the gun + ammo. For serious buyers only - I am willing to travel up to 1 hour from Butler to meet at a FFL and complete the transaction. Buyer is repsponsible for paying transfer fee (approx $30-40). I will only sell this through an FFL with correct transfer paperwork and background check.

I would have to get an additional $250 for the light and the custom holsters if you want those, but I don't really want to sell them as I have other glocks that I shoot and carry.
