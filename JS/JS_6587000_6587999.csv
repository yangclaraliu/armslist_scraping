An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most.  $995 obo"

This one comes with TWO 9 round magazines. Please LOOK AT THE PHOTOS CAREFULLY, it's what your buying. I COULD ONLY POST THREE SO EMAIL ME AND I'LL SEND YOU MORE. I've taken great care to show scratches, dings or any flaws I see. It looks better than the photo's make it out to be. I'm asking $410.00 OBO. I'm selling it because my grip is no longer strong enough to pull the slide back when it's not already cocked.

The new Dolos Gen2 incorporates a locking mechanism to prevent barrel from backing off. To break the rifle or pistol down, simply lock the bolt to the rear, disengage ratchet lock, turn the aluminum handguard and pull the barrel assembly straight out of the receiver. To reinstall the barrel, insert it into the receiver and twist the handguard. The kit comes with the new rail, updated lock ring, ratchet housing assembly, jam nut, and set screws. Installation takes only a few minutes and the Dolos is compatible with any mil-spec upper. The kit is designed to work with any carbine or pistol length direct impingement gas system.

It will turn your shoulder black and blue! The rest of it's time was spent in the case in the closet. I think it has spent most of it's 48 years in seclusion. It really doesn't look like it has been used very much at all. I had been told by several people that the gun is worth $1500 but I think they were telling me what I wanted to hear. I talked to a broker and think I got the real story.

It features a Caspian slide and frame with a black/od green cerakote, checkered back strap, competition rail job by Acc-U-Rail, hand fitted Kart NM barrel and bushing, guide rod recoil system, extended safety, slide release and mag release button, Wilson Combat internals with a 2.5 lb competition trigger, Kensight Adjustable sights, VZ Grips, and two 8-round mags. This pistol is as good as it gets in the accuracy department. Looks plain Jane but will out shoot any factory custom on the market, including the popular high priced guns. The gun is worth over $3000 and has only been fired for testing. Doug Jones is a well known professional gunsmith who builds and services nationally known competition organization guns on a regular basis and inherited the rights to the ACC-U-RAIL system which is widely used on the competition circuit. The accurail is a design feature that runs the length of the slide, taking up any play in the slide's movement to improve accuracy and give the gun a solid, tight fit versus the traditionally loose frame/slide fit on most 1911s. If you are looking for a real sleeper (and a pretty one) that will make your buddies jealous, this is it.
Build includes:
Caspian Slide (Black Cerakote Caspian Frame (OD Green Cerakote)
5"" Kart National Match barrel and bushings
Extended Mag Release
Kensights adjustable sights
Wilson Combat internals and trigger
VZ grips
