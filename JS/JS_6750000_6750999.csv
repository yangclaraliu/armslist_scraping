An Auto-Brightness sensor continuously samples lighting conditions to provide optimal reticle intensity, or can be overridden should the shooter prefer the manual mode. The exterior lens surfaces are treated with Leupold's DiamondCoat™ that adds abrasion resistance and durability, and assists in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast. The aspheric lens creates a wide field-of-view, with sharp image quality, allowing user to keep both eyes open and focused on the target. Slotted windage and elevation dials allow positive 1 MOA adjustments without the need of lock screws. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro Reflex Sight is constructed with a lightweight aluminum housing, shrouded in spring steel for maximum durability, and has been waterproof tested to 66 feet.
