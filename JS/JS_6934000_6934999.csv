I need help with $200 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in God but me and my family wont have a roof over our heads for our 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till next Wednesday night to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask God to take care of this thank you and God Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $200 then anything helps even if its a little! Thank you and god bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, I don't care if I have to give someone my bank card to hold and my social security card, even the registration to my truck just so you know I have to come back to pay if its a loan, I never use craigslist and posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, I have received messages saying people are cautious to meet in person, well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, God bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend"

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

For is is a 12ga Remington 870 Express Magnum, used. This gun and optics package is mechanically sound, and in great shape. While I may have enjoyed this shotgun when I got it 11 years ago, tastes change, and it no longer interests me. Here are all the notable details:
- Pre-Cerberus / Freedom Group. This is before Remington's reputation went downhill. - Capacity 6+1 for 2-3/4"", or 5+1 for 3"". - 18"" cylinder bore barrel with front bead - OEM magazine tube extension - Freshly refinished with Cerakote H-148 ""Burnt Bronze"" prior to the sale. Unscratched and unfired as of now. - Trijicon RX30 on RX11 mount. Currently not sighted in since refinish job. I can gladly offer to shoot it in with some slugs before the sale. - Knoxx CompStock generation 1 ""maximum recoil reduction"" stock with dual tension springs. - Magpul SGA forearm - Mesa Tactical SureShell, 6rd (high-quality hardcoat anodized aluminum part, not a cheap plastic side saddle like ATI) - Receiver drill and tapped for Weaver 98 base - GG&G follower - Earlier barrel lug design with spring-loaded detent. - Flextab system
As I said before, this is a used gun. The finish is perfectly fresh, though there are a few tiny dings present pre-finishing. No wear or blemishes I would call ""noteworthy"" though. No gaurantees are given, but the shotgun and optic has performed to my satisfaction over the past 11 years.
Thank you, -Josh Geho"

The Draco is a semi-automatic pistol with a 30+1 capacity detachable magazine.

Then you can add in tax+shipping as well as instalation if you don't have the tools to do these mods. Then of course you have the price of the gun, so you can either buy an SKS for $4-500 and put over $1k in parts into it or buy mine and shoot it today. I have no problem meeting you at a range to shoot it but bring your own ammo or be prepared to buy mine (unless you end up buying the rifle). We will either meet at a range or an FFL. I don't care which FFL we go to as long as it's an actual storefront and not someone opperating out of their garage.

I have a clean title for the motor and valid (current registrations) for the trailer and boat. no need to get the trailer weighed. boat registration is paid til 2019, will only cost $5 to transfer into your name.

The stainless-steel slide sports SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights as well as front cocking serrations that provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm or conducting press checks.The P220 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip and a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing.

An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. The P220 Legion also features low-profile decocking and slide-catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most.

Bought this from Cabelas for my son last Christmas. Came with modified choke. When I got home I couldn't get the choke out to put in the improved cylinder choke. Called Cables, no returns, must contact Remington for warranty issues. Took to a local gun store, they couldn't get it out, and offered to deal with Remington for the warranty. Long story short, Remington denied the warranty. So, this is a next to new gun (we did fire a few rounds over New Years before taking it in) that works perfectly, with a modified choke that won't come out."

Can be powered by battery bank/solar/ Diesel generator (GenSet) or Shore power (110). This type of diesel generator is made for RVs and other applications where a large/quiet/portable power station is needed. They typically cost around $10,000 new and are made by Cummins (Google Onan QD 7,500 or see pic for model.) The towers usually go for $50,000 to $100,000 but that is with new paint and military/police hardware etc. The Norman Police bought a striped down military one like this in 2011 (see part of a NewsOK article I found online below).""----NewsOK:A new Skywatch tower retails for about $96,000, but the agency located a slightly used ""military surplus"" one that was available for $7,500, including the cost of a new paint job, Capt. Tom Easley said.Easley said Homeland Security federal grant money was used to pay for it.""We got a smokin' hot deal on it,"" Praizner said. ""We feel really lucky to have found it. We see it as a crime-prevention tool. It gives us visibility and a presence in large-crowd type situations. It will allow us to respond quicker to problems than if we were just walking through a crowd.""------""It works great. It had been completely sanded and has two coats of black automotive primer and my paint guy has started the main camo coat which is going to turn out great! Would be great to use for hunting as a mobile deer stand but also had plenty of other uses. I recently loaned it out to a friend and we parked it in plain view near the entrance to a job site that was experiencing a lot of theft. We raised the tower each night and kicked on the lights. The thieves must have assumed there was a a 24 hour guard on site because the incidence of theft dropped to zero. Serious inquiries only please. If you are interested please email me with your contact information and we can schedule a time to look it over. I am continuing to make improvements and can customize to your specs."
