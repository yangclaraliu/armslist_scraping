Has fully adjustable Accutrigger! Currently sighted in for 75 yards and it groups right at an inch. I purchased new combo for $669.99 came with Bushnell 3-9 x 40 scope which I removed before shooting and installed brand new Nikon Slughunter with BDC 2-7 $159.99. The ammo I have is 10 rounds (2 boxes) of Remington Premier Accutip slugs $15.99 a box. This is the 3” slugs that Savage recommends and boy do they shoot great. I purchased 3 boxes but used one to sight in.  All total this comes to right at $862.00 + tax, feel free to check my numbers on Cabela’s website.

My wife has only fired it a total of 10 times on the range and didn't like it because her hands are too small for the gun and it requires too much hand strength for the trigger pull as well for her, so I bought her a LCP .380 instead which she absolutely loves! Sorry if I sound sexist for what I'm about to say but it is what it is, this gun would be an excellent carry weapon for a man that has plenty of hand strength and can handle recoil, but it is NOT going to be comfortable to shoot for a woman who is unaccustomed to considerable recoil, and the good ol' loud bang! Especially with +P ammo which I have never even shot out of it, but I do know from experience it would be waaaay louder and have a LOT more recoil than just .38 wadcutter target ammo. Just an honest assessment...but your wife may be different, or you guys like I said, it would be a GREAT carry weapon for you.Call Barry at REDACTED.
