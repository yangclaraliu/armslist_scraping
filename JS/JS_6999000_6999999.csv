I also purchased an extra Glock factory magazine, a kydex holster, and a kydex duel mag carrier. Holster is right handed. The holster and mag carriers are both high quality made by SAS holsters in Sidney Ohio. The gun has never been carried, only taken to the range by my wife. With the extra magazine, sights, holster, and carrier I have around $600 in everything. Buyer will get all of the above along with the original Glock box. The price is $450, FIRM, for everything. Please do not waste time with any other offers, I will ignore them. I will meet on I-75 from Wapakoneta north to Piqua south at a public place like Walmart or the like.  You will show me your ID and will sign a bill of sale, I will do the same for you. You must be 21, legally able to own, and preferably a CC permit holder. Again, the price is FIRM and so is the distance I will travel."

A friend who died recently had it. Doubt he fired it in over a decade. I know some of these guns can be unreliable. I had zero issues with Hornady defense ammo or CCI. Comes with 3 mags and the original box, no paperwork. Its not a bad gun, just not something I have much need or use for."
