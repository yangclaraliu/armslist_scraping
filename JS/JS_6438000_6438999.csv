Buyer to cover private transfer fees. No trades, moving sale.  Also selling Kimber Stainless Target II, a set of Kensight Trijicon Tritium Dot Night Sights for Kimber 1911's and HK P30L.  Please don't email me asking if this is still for sale, if it is still on here, it is still for sale.This is absolutely, positively one of Kimber’s highest level 1911s. Carrying all the form and functionality of the typical 1911, this pistol is a lifelong heirloom. Its adjustable target sights have steel on steel click adjustments that are both responsive and secure to lock in your zero. Stainless steel and aluminum match grade products are machine fit by hand in Kimber’s Custom Shop for best accuracy. No detail is spared on this pistol -- even the diamond grips are hand-checkered to provide a positive grip without sacrificing elegance. Kimber workmanship and construction quality are easy to see, even down to the smallest detail. The forged steel slide and frame fit together with tight tolerances and function perfectly. Recoil on the Kimber Gold Match II feels significantly less than that of competing designs. This is due in part to this pistol’s lower center of gravity, which is slightly below the slide, and very close to where the shooter's hand grips the gun. Although the single-stack magazine puts the Kimber's capacity at only eight rounds, the relatively small diameter of the 1911's frame still allow the shooter to create a secure two-handed gripA match grade barrel and bushing deliver tack driving accuracy. For added reliability, Kimber includes a full- length guide rod, as the shorter G.I. style guide rods have a tendency to bind or break over time. Adjustable sights sit on top of the slide and provide a consistent target presentation. The checkering on the mainspring housing and the texture of the rosewood grips feel secure. The knurled extended magazine release of the Kimber Gold Match II is a huge improvement over releases seen on other pistols. Performing tactical reloads is quick, simple and efficient.The Kimber Gold Match II single stage, match grade aluminum trigger is a joy to pull, especially over the mushy triggers seen on most double action pistols. The 4 – 5 lbs pull is steady and smooth, while the reset is short and crisp. This is a gun that fires naturally, even for beginner's that have “low and left” trigger slap tendencies. In fact, the Kimber Gold Match II has one of the smoothest trigger pulls of any production 1911 on the market.. The Gold Match II includes an ambidextrous thumb safety. Finally, to further minimize felt recoil, the grip safety is a high-ride designed beavertail that quickly establishes a positive grip for maximum control in stress fire situations.Specifications   Height (inches): 5.25Length (inches): 8.7Width (inches): 1.28Weight (ounces): 38Magazine capacity: 8Ambidextrous thumb safetyRecoil spring (pounds): 16.0Full length guide rodFrame: Material: Stainless steelFinish: Highly polished stainless steel (flats)Slide Material: Stainless steelFinish: Highly polished stainless steel (flats)Front serrationsBarrel Length (inches): 5 Steel, match gradeStainless steel match grade bushingTwist rate (left hand): 16Sights: Kimber adjustableRadius (inches): 6.8Grips: Rosewood Double diamondTrigger: Premium Aluminum Match GradeFactory setting (approx. pounds): 4.0 - 5.0"

Truly great gun, runs like a champ, but I find myself liking my Shield just a little more these days and want to fund another project. The sights are the best Day/Night sight combo I've ever owned, and the SSVI trigger with Ghost connector is unbelievable. Maintains all the good aspects of the Glock trigger that glock lovers love, but improves uptake, break, reset and over travel. I have switched all my glocks to this trigger setup. Trigger breaks between 4.5-4.75# and can be made heavier by re-installing stock connector.  All original parts, case and manuals included. 3 Taran +2 magazines and a Pearce +1 pinky extension mag as well as a Taran +1 base plate not installed. 4 mags total.

I know the brand snobs automatically assume anything with DPMS on it is junk but I can assure you they aren't. DPMS has been filling US military and law enforcement contracts for years. This AR-10 is one of their upper tier models, not a slick side sporter with budget minded parts.  Some features include: Forward assist and ejection port cover Angle cut bolt carrier for increased reliability 16"" M4 profile barrel 7.62x51 nato chamber  Romovable carry handle rear site for use of optics Free float handguardThis is a very nice rifle in perfect condition with very low round count. Unlike most guys on here I'm still pricing it as a used rifle and not claiming it as new. The only reason I'm considering selling or trading it is that I have picked up another 308 platform and this one will very likely just collect dust. I'd rather put it in the hands of someone who will use and enjoy the rifle. I will however let it collect dust before I take some low ball idiotic offer.  Meeting for a deal needs to be relatively close to Danville and I will not travel at all for a straight cash sale. I've dealt with too many no shows and misrepresented guns to drive half a day to just return home with the same gun I left with."

In almost like new condition with absolutely no flaws, it has a beautiful walnut checkered stock inlaid with the Marlin bullseye, 22"" fully floated, crowned and recessed JM stamped barrel, almost flawless bluing, and a jeweled bolt that was masterfully reworked by Skip Baldwin in Michigan. It is topped with a matching set of Leupold rings and bases and a awesome period correct Swift Model 656 3-9x40 scope. Here is a brief history of the rifle, which is touted as one of the finest and most accurate bolt rifles to ever be produced:The Marlin MR-7 was only made from 1996-1999. It was only chambered in .25-06, .270, .280, and .30-06. It features a 3-position safety, a bolt face encircled by three rings of 4140 steel, a shrouded striker and high-visibility cocking indicator. It has an adjustable 3-6 lb. trigger, a forged, machined and heat-treated receiver and an extra-strong bolt lockup. The MR-7 has a hinged floorplate with a removable yet securely mounted 4-shot box magazine (The MR-7B does not). It has a 22"" barrel with 6-groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It also has a classically configured, cut-checkered American walnut stock. The later (1999) MR-7B was made with birch wood for the stock and the MR-7B didn't use a floorplate. It was a few $ cheaper and in 1999 the MR-7B was only available in .270 and .30-06 calibers.The Ring of steel around the cartridge and the strong locking lug bolt-face was mimicked off of the Remington 700.The wing-style safety was mimicked from the Winchester Model 70.The ""Dogleg"" Bolt handle mimicked the Ruger 77The floorplate with the detachable mag was mimicked from the Browning A-Bolt. This would be a special setup for someone's collection or a superb and accurate hunting setup. Asking $800 sale or trade, and I'll consider any nice firearm offers. Thanks for looking!"
