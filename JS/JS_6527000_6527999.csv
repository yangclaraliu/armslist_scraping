It has a milled reciever and takes in butt stocks that a stamped could as well. I chose a zhukov stock eventually was planning on getting a matching handguard but did not get that far. It also has a 1/4 inch cheek riser on it. This c39v2 also has a TWS dust cover gen2 that's solid and has very miniscule wiggle. There's a ironsight you can get for it on the Texas Weapon system website but again, I haven't been able to get around to getting it. Akoperator on YouTube does a review of this dust cover and the 2nd gen is definitely a huge improvement over their 1st gen. Only has 100-200 rds through it.I have not modified anything else internally because I personally think it's perfect the way it is. The trigger is probably better than my AR 15 geiselle trigger and its fed and spat back out all the rounds I put through it. The safety I bent a little out and now makes the safety switch hell of a lot easier to operate it. I can add the vortex strikefire optic and the mount with it for another $80 on top of the listed price. The rds is already sighted in at a 100 yards.Original butt stock included and on top I'll put in 500+ ammo for it with 3-4, 30rd magpul magazines in as well.Recap:- 200 rounds roughly through it- c39v2 milled reciever- vortex strikefire zeroed at 100yds (optional $80 addition) - TWS gen 2 dust cover and spring- zhukov stock with 1/4 cheek riser (original magpul stock included) - 500+ ammo included- 3-4, 30rnd magpul magazines (2-3 are white colored)I could be interested in a handgun (since it's easier to conceal from my wife) but it would depend on what kind it is but I could settle for cash as well. I am willing to ship if you can cover the shipping fee for both ammo and rifle. I can send more pictures it you'd like, just ask away!"

Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools.

Very low round count and in excellent condition for being 36 years old (IA date code = 1981 manufacture). This has obviously been a safe queen, not a shooter, with very minimal surface wear marks and no rust inside or out. Factory German-imported Heckler & Koch, not a cheaply-built clone. The factory hardwood stock set was made in 1964 and is in pristine condition. These are extremely rare, especially in this condition, and don't come around too often. The Williams trigger is the lightest, most crisp trigger I've ever felt on any HK roller-lock firearm (normally over 10 lbs). The port buffer helps keep brass from getting beat up so it can be reloaded and also keeps the shells from banging up the receiver. No claw marks on the receiver means it's never had a scope installed. You will NOT be disappointed in this amazing rifle!!! Willing to accept credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover any PP fees. Private sale, no FFL fees or paperwork to hassle with. If a face to face meet isn't possible, shipping is $45 private party to your FFL or $65 if I have to pay my FFL to ship it. Contact me with questions or to see additional pics (I have many to send). Also, beware of sellers with cheap HK91s as I've seen numerous deals that were too good to be true and the listings were removed so nobody else got scammed by them. Buyer beware!!!"

I see no signs of ever being carried. I have only fired twices in last 12 years.. but not enough to concern. Aside from the mark on the slide, this gun is in about as near factory new in 1986 as you could ask for. Has one factory magazine. I read that these were only built from 1986-1990, and not all were marked with the tasteful gold lettering as this one. You can ask for more picture and you will get them.."
