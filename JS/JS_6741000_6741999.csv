I looked it up on gun.deals (slickguns) and found the lowest price for $140+shipping (or +tax)+background check+FFL fee = more than what I have it listed and PLUS I have another magazine with valued at $15. So at this point I have this one listed lower than anyone that I have seen. Cabela's has it listed for $179.99 and that's not including tax, background, or an additional magazine. So at $165 its already a great deal!"

It was manufactured from parts by Springfield Armory in April of 1987, with an Israeli match heavy barrel upper parts kit and an Imbel lower made in Brazil. It is in fantastic shape and shoots very accurately. It has a pinned on picatinny rail on the upper for mounting scopes, while still allowing use of the iron sights. Will come with 13 total magazines (all functioning, in rough to very good shape, with three in excellent shape) 2- five round, 10- 20 round, and 1- 30 round. Also comes with the bipod and hard case. Please keep in mind that this is the pre-ban version and not the post-ban, and this is also the T3 type receiver, meaning that it is a forged and not cast receiver. I can also throw in for the right trade or sell brand new boxed American eagle ammo with it. This is not a FrankenFAL, but a licensed FAL build by Springfield. On the forums this is a well received version of the FAL, without the price tag usually associated with it.Thanks for looking!Will consider all trades, including multiple guns or with cash, with special consideration given to 300 win mag long range setups. Will also strongly consider short barrel 300 AAC blackout uppers, and any version of the Arex Rex Zero. Doesn't hurt to ask, worst I can say is no. Cash value is $1,900, trade value is $2,300."

I didn't want to remove my sight to change the cap so I bought a different hand guard.  Ther are some scratches which are pictured from me mounting it and realizing it was not the right fit.   It looks like you could probably cut some grooves in it to work with a triangle cap but I gave up on it before modifying it.  I may trade for some 9mm, 380 , 38 spcl, or 223/5.56 ammo or reloading items."

I won't lie about the condition. It never jammed or had a misfeed, there is just the accuracy problem. I have been told it needs a barrel, which is available for about $65. It has 1 magazine that it came with which has functioned perfectly so far. I also bought a new 8 round magazine for it, which I can add for the $30 I paid for it. I will also give you the .45 ACP ammo I have, a partial box of 50 of aluminum case Federal 45.The gun has been taken apart & cleaned since firing, and looks good inside. $400 + 30 for the new magazine if you want it."

I've also fed it every kind of ammo and it always shoots every time you pull the trigger. These are incredible guns for the money. I've owned a few of them.

The XD® Mod.2® is the refinement of a classic, a distillation of greatness. Those things that made the XD® what it is remain and are amplified, revised or improved in order to bring you the next step in the evolution of the polymer framed pistol. When picking up the Mod. 2®, shooters will find that critical aspects of the design have been fine-tuned. Mod. 2® ergonomics are a next-level experience that you have to feel to believe and understand. The entire interface between the shooter and the gun has been updated, while retaining the Point-and-Shoot characteristics that made it famous. Key features have been tweaked and enhanced to further enable effortless shooting. And you’ll find that the overall package is now more concealable as well. When it comes to security for you and your family, there’s rarely a concern over having too much ammo on hand. The XD® Mod.2® 5″ Tactical Model packs 13 rounds of .45ACP ammo in each of its two included stainless steel magazines. While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity. A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul. Springfield XD Mod.2 .45 5"" Tactical"
