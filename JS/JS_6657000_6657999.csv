British 303 cambered Lee Enfield No 4 Mk 2 bolt-action rifle with a barrel of 25 inch with a strong and clean bore, groves, and lands. Metal is the black military finish and retains almost all-original finish; have to say that as it is considered “used” and not straight from an armory/manufacturer. No box, original paperwork etc, sorry. All numbers matching including the stock and magazine (hard to see in the pictures, but it is) numbers are very clear and deep. Blond stock and hand guards retains their original finish, so little heavier near the stock section that is held with the right hand. Brass butt-plate has some normal wear and some patina (tarnishing). Bolt hand knob has the finish/paint wearing. The import marking on the right side of the barrel at the muzzle, reads CAI ST ALB VT 303 UK. I have not fired this rifle, checked head-spacing, etc, is the buyers’ responsible for those actions prior to firing with a gunsmith. Round count is unknown, although we must assume fired as it is considered “used”. Additional photos available."

Basically zero chance of a lock out, and the battery lasts forever. I've had this for close to 10 years and only had to change the battery maybe 2 times.- LA GARD digital lock- Extremely easy to change the combination as long as you know the current combo (takes less than 3 minutes)- Ability to add users with separate combos (but you don't have to)- 4 holes in the bottom of it (from the factory) below the removable felt floor that allow you to bolt it to the floor of where you live- When unlocked, door can be removed off its hinges for easier transportation- Made in the USA- Disclaimer: Minor scratches from normal use and moving to different places I've lived. Longer scratch to the left of the lock where a piece of tape from the factory was on it and I got it off. It is kind of visible in the first picture. Handle has a couple spots of surface rust but it's just cosmetic and is barely noticeable. Caused by keeping it in garage one summer, other 9.75 years kept inside. No damage to contents inside.If you've done your research, you know that RedHead has some good safes and some not so good safes. This is one of the good ones that was really made by Granite Security around 2007. A 12-point locking door with at least one bolt on each side reduces the chance of a bad guy finding a weak spot to pry it open.Only selling because I'm moving out of state and I'm tired of moving it around, and I've sold its contents to fund the move. It's very well-built and very heavy. Please bring help when you pick it up. I'm not able to deliver.Asking $580. Cash only, no trades.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Upper Receiver Group was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 URG is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel.  Daniel Defense upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION

Low-Profile Backup Sights Won't Interfere With Primary Optic
KAC’s line of Micro Iron Sights are currently in use by the United States Army, Marine Corps and numerous law enforcement agencies worldwide. This is because they are built to exacting tolerances, maintain their zero under adverse conditions and, when folded, have one of the lowest profile top-rail footprints in the industry.
The simple and rugged 300 Meter Folding Micro Rear Sight has a fixed post aperture, which  is ideal for shooters who want an easy to use, close to medium range back-up sighting solution. The 300 Meter Micro Rear Sight is adjustable for windage only, and includes a snap-in polymer aperture insert that gives the user a more precise sight picture if desired. 
The KAC 600 Meter Micro Rear Sight features a finger-adjustable, rotating drum that enables shooters to engage targets from 200 to 600 meters with both speed and accuracy.
Zeroing Tips 300 Meter Rear Sights: Place a target 25 meters down range and fire a 3 round group(s). Adjust the front sight post and rear sight windage knob until the desired point-of-aim/point-of-impact is achieved. If possible, place a target 300 meters down range and confirm zero."

These EOTech red dot sights combine the high-accuracy optics of the EOTech EXPS2-2 Red Dot Sight and the zoom-enhancing properties of the EOTech G33 Red Dot Magnifier into a single potent reflex sight. The heart of the red dot sight is the EXPS2-2, a highly compact, tactically-oriented red dot sight that features a large ring reticle with two 1-MOA aiming dots. The relex portion of the EOTech HHS2 Holographic Hybrid Reflex Sight w/G33 Magnifier features true two-eyes-open aiming, allowing you to get a full picture of the battlefield while maintaining precision accuaracy, and it's 7mm raised base allows you to use iron sights even with the red dot sight equipped. EOTech has equipped the EXPS2-2 red dot sight with easy to adjust side illumination buttons, and it's transversely mounted 123 lithium battery will rarely need replacement. The EOTech Holographic EXPS2-2 Hybrid Magnified Red Dot Sight is also highly versatile, capable of mounting to your weapon with the integrated locking quick detach lever. The EOTech HHS-II Holographic Hybrid Magnified Reflex Sight evolves beyond the original red dot sight when you attach the included G33 magnifier. Shorter and lighter than it's previous incarnation (the EOTech G23), the EOTech G33 3.25x Red Dot Magnifier is a powerful optic that will boost the power of your red dot sight by 3.25x, enough to add long-range accuracy to the list of features on your reflex sight. Each of the red dot sight accessories features tool-free azimuth adjustment and a wide field of view that won't diminish the incredibly fast target acquisition capabilities of the EXPS2-2. An easy to adjust diopter allows for precise focus with the EOTech HHS-2 Hybrid Red Dot Scope w/ G33 Magnifier, no matter the target. What's more, these EOTech red dot sight accessories allow you to switch between 3.25x magnification and 1x magnification at will with the included Switch to Side (STS) mount, which will flip the magnifier to the side of your weapon and out of the way with a single motion, adding even more versaility to your firearm. When you want to combine the precise tactical advantage conferred by the EOTech EXPS series with the long-range firepower of a scope, choose the EOTech HHS-II Hybrid Holographic Sight II with EXPS2-2 Sight and G33 Magnifier."

Viridian XTL is a light, no laser. Pistol is in the mid hundreds on rounds, not sure of exact count. Mags and thread protector do show wear, there's a few very small wear spots on the rest of the gun from being carried around and used as a ranch gun, but nothing major. Installed flat match sear spring to remove grit from trigger pull. Still have original sear spring, also have a match trigger return spring and light firing pin block spring that could be installed. I had put them in, didn't notice a difference, so went back to the original and kept them as replacements. The pistol has shown itself to be extremely accurate, reliable, and controllable. There's nothing wrong with it, I just bought more gun than I needed, and would rather put that money towards a CZ and improving my AR setup.If you have any questions or would like any other pictures, let me know and I'll get them as soon as I can. Price is open to reasonable offers, and would be willing to separate the light/pistol. Would prefer to trade + cash for a CZ P07 9mm gen 2. Located in the north DFW area, but willing to travel a fair distance."

My understanding is that they were issued by the Hungarian Police and security services (How do you say KGB in Hungarian?) from 1950 to 1957. The FEG AP is very similar to the German Walther PP but the design has been slightly modified by FEG. It features an aluminum frame. It holds 8 rounds of 7.65mm Browning in the magazine. It has a safety decocker lever and is a traditional double action firearm. The double action pull is very long and heavy. The gun weighs in at approximately 20 ounces.  I just received a few of these in from my supplier.  They were supposed to come with 2 mags, but low and behold there was only 1 mag with each.  If my supplier provides the missing extra mags, I will include 1 each with the sale.  These clearly haven't been cleaned after being in long term storage, but they should clean up well.  Grips are all good.  Mechanically they appear to be in excellent condition.  Great classic conceal carry pistol.  I have some .32acp available for local sale.  FEG made some great pistols, and this is one of them."

It is an Old Model Single Six, 5 1/2"" barrel. It has not been converted using Ruger's transfer bar system, so the old original trigger system is fully intact. The finish is original with some minor wear marks on the sides of the recoil shield and the end of the barrel, as shown in the pictures. These are light rub marks and my best guess is that they're due to being in a holster. It has the original black rubber grips. I have no idea what year this one was made, but the serial number is 157XXX. These guns in this condition are getting harder to find.  This gun must be shipped to a dealer. If you're local and can meet me here then you're free to pick it up in person, but I will need to see a carry permit as proof that you can legally own a gun.This gun is sold pending pickup."

The interior is clean and no rips or tears in the seats, could use a shampooing though if you wanted it to shine. The exterior is the only downside...the hood is bent and the passenger side fender has been replaced with a non-color matching part. There is a small 1 inch hole in the bumper...a small dent in the rear side driver door...but I would assume most people aren't buying a car like this for its good looks. Its a mechanically sound vehicle...and I still drive it almost every day. Asking $1900 cash will take partial trade of guns...I no longer need this because I purchased a new vehicle.

If you know our lever actions, you’ll be right at home with these new small-game-getters. There are times and places where a 20 or a 12 is just too much gun, and for those times and places the .410 may be the ideal way to go. Both model variants are based on our blued steel-framed .45-70 Lever Action, with five-shot tube-loading magazines chambered for 2.5” shells only, dark straight-grained American walnut furniture, pistol grip wrists, checkering fore and aft, sling swivel studs, and a good thick non-slip ventilated black rubber recoil pad at the rear. We give you two approaches in this .410. You can be the judge of which best fits your own hunting style. The H018-410 is the long version, with a 24″ round blued barrel, removable factory installed invector style full choke and large front brass bead, with no rear sight. This one provides slightly longer practical ranges with its barrel length, along with additional choke options you can buy separately. The H018-410R is a more versatile and compact package featuring a 20″ barrel, with a cylinder bore “choke”, simply a tapered constriction of the gun barrel’s bore at the muzzle end, and our standard adjustable semi-buckhorn rear and vertical blade bead front sights. The weight’s easier to tote over a long afternoon on foot, with the shorter round barrel working easier through brush and other tight terrain where shots are expected to be close and fast.  The adjustable sights make it easy to regulate patterns with a variety of birdshot and slugs to handle anything from small game birds such as partridge and pigeons through cottontails to fox and coyotes, varmints and pest control. Whether you’re in the camp that regards the .410 as a beginner’s gauge or the camp that considers it a specialist’s gauge, we’ve got you covered with these two new models; simplistic, rugged and a great forager for survival, they’ll fit right in among your other prized Henry lever actions.    Model Number H018-410R    Action Type Lever Action Shotgun   Caliber 410 Bore   Capacity 5 Rounds   Length 40.5""   Pull Length 14""   Barrel Length 24"" Round   Rate of Twist Smooth/No Choke   Weight 7.3 lbs.

I am looking to sell or trade my MP5/HK94 clone rifle. It is made by MKE (Not Zenith). It is an AT94 model, very rare and high quality. It is made on HK tooling. The gun has only minor wear on the finish. Specifically where the lower connects by the magwell, which is typical of these. Comes with 5 korean mags, original MKE 10 round mag, claw mount top rail, and Bushnell TRS-25 Micro red dot with med-rise mount. Takes the 30rd mags and has necessary 922r parts.These guns were made on HK tooling. A lot of the parts are interchangeable with true HK parts. They take any mags that HK94 take. These aren't ones that take only proprietary mags. The AT94 are more desirable and rare than other clones because they have a thicker barrel than the newer clones. It's an all-around great gun. The recoil on this is non-existant. I have not shot any other factory 9mm that shoots smoother than this."

I have been making and finishing stocks for a high-end company for three years. My company does not take low-end jobs, so I am offering a service for regular firearms owners to refinish their rifle stocks or shotgun stock sets. The stocks I make on a daily basis sell for $5,000 just for a shotgun restock, and $8,500 for a rifle build. When I refinish stocks, they come out looking far better than when they came from the factory. The service I am offering entails:-Taping off of chequering-Removal of old finish-Raising of dents and scratches-Repair of cracks-Filling of small holes-Sanding of stock to a 320 grit finish-Filling of pores and grain-Final wet sanding to 600 grit-Lustrous, hand-rubbed tung oil finish-Cleaning up of chequering-Final wax coat to protect finish-Polishing, buffing, or satinizing to desired level of glossThis service will cost a minimum of $500 at the company I work for, and will change hands from employee to employee. I am offering an introductory price of $200 for my personal service. No hands other than mine shall touch the stock throughout the entire process, so no steps will be missed or done out of order. I am am working from my personal shop, and not an FFL, so I will not take in any actions or other pieces. I will only take in your stock or stock set. I am willing to meet to pick it up and drop it off. Estimated turn around time is one week.Why refinish your stock? Most companies use spray on finishes that hide the natural beauty of the wood. They tend to stain it a reddish color, dulling the hues and figure. The finishes they use are designed for maximum profit. Quick and easy to apply, fast drying, and ready to go out the door in a day or two. They also hide the compression marks left in the grain by rasps and files, and sanding scratches left by poor craftsmen. I take the stock down to bare wood and hand rub in penetrating tung oil, which soaks into the wood rather than building up on top of it. You can't hide poor sanding with tung oil. Only after the finish has achieved the desired luster, and popped the figure to its fullest potential, do I coat it in a layer of wax to protect the wood from the elements.You can turn your grandfather's old beater deer rifle into a beautiful firearm which will turn heads at the range or hunting camp. My service will restore and protect the wood, increasing its longevity, and vastly increasing value. A beautiful stock on an old rifle can as much as double its value compared to a dull reddish finish flaking off of a scratched and dented stock."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
