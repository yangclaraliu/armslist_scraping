It is a very nice finish and you will never have to worry about it rusting.  It features a 20-inch barrel and it is chambered for 2 3/4 or 3-inch magnum rounds. Magazine extensions can easily be added for 8-shot capacity.  I will only sell to the holder of a valid Tennessee Handgun Permit.  Flakes and lowball offers....please don't contact me.POLICE MODEL 870 DETAILS From the Remington website:  870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection. All Police shotguns are assembled in a special build area at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build Law Enforcement and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift. All parts that enter the special build area are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality. Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function. Receiver pins are replaced with nuts and bolts.  A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs. A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds. Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. Law Enforcement shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety. The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.  The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.  The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing. The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a ball detent system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade synthetic magazine spring retainer lock down as used on the Express system. The receivers used in Police guns are vibra honed to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.  Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

The stamp on the tang is also 1927. This rifle has beautifully finished dark wood. The metal is in average shape with no rust to speak of, minimal wear but no longer lustrous. The barrel is dark with very clear rifling. PW Arms import marking on the hex of the hex receiver.
 
Included is 20 rounds of ammo, some cheap stripper clips and a sling with two ammo holders.
 
For sale: $400 Double action 1916 Nagant Revolver.  Arsenal stamped Imperial Peter the Great Ordnance Factory, caliber 7.62X38mmR.
 
This revolver has Bakelite grips (I think) with a light wooden front and back strap on the handle. The finish is in very good shape with no rust and some very minor pitting on the end of the barrel that is not noticeable. As is the case with all Nagant revolvers its' innovative cylinder slides forward upon the hammer being cocked creating a seal between the unique 7.62X38 cartridges and the barrel so no gas escapes from between the cylinder and barrel during firing. Interestingly, this makes the Nagant one of the very few revolvers which can be successfully suppressed.
 
Included is a holster (not sure if it's original but it came with the revolver from AIM Surplus) cleaning rod and disassembly screw driver.
 
Own a 100 year old revolver possibly used during WWII to convince doubtful Russian peasants, turned crack Stormtroopers, that the Germans were less dangerous to their immediate health then the officers directly over them.
 
I will sell both firearms together for $625. Face to face sale only at the FFL of your choice, must have NY handgun licesnse if you are buying the revolver and I'm willing to drive a ways to meet you half way."
