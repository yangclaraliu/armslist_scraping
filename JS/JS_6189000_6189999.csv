*Take from manufacturer websiteThe VZ58 is a very highly regarded weapon with many distinct features. It shoots the ever popular 7.62 X 39 round. It uses a direct impingement gas system and striker based trigger system, The CNC Warrior receiver and trigger group are well known for their reliability and smooth action.These guns are built from all original Czech military parts combined with brand new CNC Warrior parts for upgraded quality and US922r compliance. The barrel is shortened all the way back to the gas block, then re-faced, crowned, and threaded to original specs. The original right-side folding wire frame buttstock is keyed into the receiver and attached with a single screw.A Bonesteel Arms Quad Rail is added to the for-end. This handguard is designed by Chris Bonesteel and manufactured by CNC Warrior from billet 6061 T6 aluminum. It has been a very highly sought after product since our initial run over two years ago. They are very popular and limited production makes them hard to find at any price. The original bakelight pistol grip and for-end are also included with this rifle for added customer value and versatility.The original military VZ58 barrels come in just under 16"" in length. So a muzzle device has to be permanently attached even if the barrel was not shortened further. So we shorten it back to the gas block and permanently attach (with blind pin) a fake suppressor to reach just beyond the 16"" legal barrel length. This gives the gun a great look and allows easy transitioning into a short barrel rifle if desired."

I'm in Dover  and due to illness would need someone to pick it up and this doesn't need any Ffl. It's serial number is j so I think that's 1919. These rifles not demilled go for 400 or 500 from what I can see. This was a gift, but due it being demilled not really interested in it. This from what I can tell may have been used by military academy cadets in the 1930's to maybe early 1950's. This is based off info I've done in my research"

(20 day lead time right now) If you are not familiar with Dale Fricke Holsters, he makes the best appendix carry holster on the market. I've added the description from his website, but feel free to look up his website yourself. From Dale Fricke Holsters: The Archangel© is the latest holster in the (AIWB) Inside the Waistband Appendix Holster family. The Archangel was specifically designed to retain the concealment advantages of Appendix carry as well as the speed of draw offered by its predecessors. We changed the “J” hooks to dual snap belt loops and did away with the tuckable feature.Additionally, while the the tuckable feature is important for some end-users, it does add some bulk to the overall holster. The Archangel does not feature a tuckable design and is intended to be worn with a shirt-tails out concealment. The holster itself is very minimal in design and rides very comfortably inside the waistband. The result is a slim-line holster with reduced dimensions and yet just as secure and fast as its other KYDEX® predecessors."

(NO TRADES)4 month old Ruger SR-556 Takedown complete package with 300 Blackout Barrel package included. Less than 75 rounds fired of each barrel thru this AR. I put in all the work, even sighted in ! Each barrel assembly has its own scope sighted in for each barrel with a Weaver Detachable One Piece SPR Scope Mount. All equipment and carry bag included. Five 30 round magazines included with two marked for 300 BLK. This gun will shoot both 5.56 and 223 and I have yet to find a round it will not shoot well. And the 300 BLK barrel shoots the lighter grain and heavy grain subs with ease. It has an adjustable gas block in the front that has 3 settings. Front and rear sights for both barrels that stay zeroed. I changed the buffer plug (Spikes Extra Heavy ST-T3) and spring (Geissel Super 42) to reduce the recoil dramatically.

Christmas, bills and job. I love this gun and spent a lot of time sighting it in and prepping it. Both detachable scope mounts so far have held true to a quarter inch at 60 yards removed and put back on. The barrels can be changed in under 30 seconds. I can change the scope and barrel, put in another magazine in under a minute. If a man lived in East Texas where Coyotes and hogs reign, this would be the gun. I have over 2300 dollars in this gun and would buy it again and wish I did not have to sell. I am taking a huge loss for personal reason's. Price is semi-negotiable, no trades. The gun is registered to me and I have the boxes and all the paperwork. Bud's Gun Shop has a used one right now for 1399.00 and that does not come with the 300 BLK package or all the other stuff. If I have to ship, you will have to pay. I am already taking over a 650 buck loss. (NO TRADES) please, gun is registered to me by the State of Tennessee."

Compare that to extremely expensive European target pistols that boast 1-1/2"" groups (measured center-to-center, which gives you a smaller measurement than edge-to-edge) at 50 yards.

Originally designed as a means for persons with limited mobility to operate and fire the AR-15 pistol, the custom adaptation of the Stabilizing Brace to the UZI PRO SB takes the application of large frame pistol control and stabilization to a new level. With the IWI brace’s unique sidefolding feature, the UZI PRO SB can be fired with or without the brace extended depending on the shooters need. With the brace in the folded position, storage space required in your safe or range bag is minimized.In all other respects, the UZI PRO UPP9SB is identical to the UPP9S, a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location.     Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel.     Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:  Manual thumb safety Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block  Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states where these magazine capacities are permitted. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard.  Available late 2015.

It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.
The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.
Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement."
