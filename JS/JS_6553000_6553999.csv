These specials were built with brand new CMP walnut stocks, new criterion barrels and new parkerizing on all the metal parts. These are no longer produced and there are very few M1 Garands in 308 making this an uncommon rifle. Anyone looking for an M1 Garand in absolute perfect condition has found it. Anyone looking for an M1 to actually shoot, a 308 and a brand new barrel is hard to beat compared to one chambered in 30-06.Comes with CMP hard case, sling, certificate of authenticity and M1 Garand manual.$1600"

I am only selling this because I have tried to like it, but I just can't find myself to really enjoy it as I do the larger Glocks, so it's a great deal for you. I'm just looking to sell it to put money towards another firearm.  This has had 300 rounds through it. 200 American Eagle 124 grain, and 100 Federal HST Micro in 150 grain. I am the original owner, and I also have all of the original receipts if you would like those upon purchase. This will come with the Glock case, two of the factory magazines( both 6 round, 1 with and 1 without pinky extension), and the Glock magazine loader. I will also be throwing in a box of Hornady Critical Defense in 115 grain as pictured. I am also including the Vedder Lightuck holster that I purchased for it, the holster is Black. Im currently just looking to sell this to fund another firearm purchase, so I'm not looking to trade at this time. The quickest way to reach me is to text me at REDACTED, however I will also respond to email if needed or contacted that way. I also have more photos of you would like to see those. Buyer must be 21 and Ohio Resident. CCW is a plus. I am willing to meet on the North side of Dayton, however I won't be driving to Cinnciannti or Columbus due to trying to schedule that from where I live. I will also be out of town until this Friday 03/10 due to work, so I can meet Friday evening or Saturday during the morning. Thanks for checking out my post, and God Bless! If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me."

German P220 .45 ACP pistol.  Date code is ""JE,"" which means this is 1986 vintage.  It has all the classic features collectors like me seek:  the original fire control group with the spur hammer and half-cock notch (modern SIGs use a rebound spring and have no half cock notch).  It has the Euro-style magazine release on the heel.  The downside is this means it cannot use modern 8-rd P220 mags with the plastic baseplate.Includes (2) 7-round SIG magazines.   ---  I have (3) other 7-round mags that fit these Euro-release P220s, and also (3) New Old Stock SIG OEM floorplates that can be placed on modern P220 magazines.  Since the floorplate is flat, it converts them to 7-round mags just like the originals.  Any potential buyers are welcome to inquire about working out a deal to include extra magazines and/or floorplates to convert 3 more mags.It has some standard holster wear, as I believe the first owner was a LEO who carried it as a duty gun.  I'm happy to entertain serious inquires from other SIG fanatics like me.  In the coming days I will try to shoot better pictures and would be happy to send any specific angles to any serious SIG enthusiasts who are interested."

All original. I think it is made pre- 1970s. - revolver is in good condition and has no rust. - original colt wood grips, with the  shiny silver colt emblem. - trigger is very smooth in single or double action. When using it in double action the trigger is extremely nice with a hair like pull. - The wheel locks up with no movement! - excellent working order, and extremely accurate and dependable... - there is some useage/ wear on the bluing. Mostly on the end of the barrel. No gashes or dings... just has original finish, so some degrade on the bluing is expected. - this is a official police issue colt: one side of barrel says official police and the other says colt.....  - inside of barrel looks deep and in great condition... I have owned several newer revolvers and a couple older S&Ws. This Colt in my opinion is by far the most accurate, tight, and finest  trigger pull I've had yet. They built this gun to last, and it is built with more quality than most new revolvers on the store shelves..  I will be moving next month and  I am only selling to help with expenses... $350 firm. I will through in a holster and a case. If interested you can text me at 501-516-one54three looking to sell but would possibly trade if the offer is to good to pass up.

Was very well maintained and I do have a lot of the receipts and records available from the previous owner. I put over 5,000 miles on it the first summer I had. It ran beautifully. I redid plugs, plug wires, alternator, transmission gasket and filter. My truck died last winter and I had to drive it a few weeks while I bought a new truck. Because of this there are now a few spots behind the rear fenders of surface rust. Before this the car was spotless. Underneath its still really nice. I also needed a sandbag in the back that winter and because of this I accidentally bottomed out the tail pipe and put a small hole in the exhaust so it's a little louder than it should be. It runs a little rough after its warmed up now and when I took it in, the shop said it had something to do with the thermostat in the carburetor. They suggested a new carburetor would be easier than trying to find that one specific part. I know nothing about carburetors so I can't verify the accuracy of that information. The transmission gasket is leaking pretty good. It shifts beautifully once it's filled with fluid though, no slipping at all. There is a minor coolant system leak and I have to fill the reservoir about every 2 weeks. Some other minor things include the power antenna not working, the headlights wiring is old and the lights are dim. The headliner is sagging. Some of the LED in the original stereo are burnt out and not all of speakers work. This car is all original and still in very great shape. Looking to trade for a quality 1911. I'd like the Sig Emperor Scorpion model ideally + cash to come out to a total of $2000. I have my Minnesota Carry permit."

(These are not loaded cartridges, only the tracer projectile)  They light up really well and are designed not to prematurely wear your barrel like other tracers.  I have several thousand rounds and I am selling them for $50 per 200 rounds ($.25/rd) which is a great price if you know what these are.  If you can find loaded rounds, they are typically $1.00/round or more.  These appear to be old military rounds and I do not see any pull marks or any other functional concerns. Some of them have more orange paint than others, however all work properly. These are more desirable than their 55 gr little brother, the xm196 red tip. These do not light up right out of the barrel, with that design to help hide your position and not prematurely wear your barrel. If you are shooting at a short range, they may not light up for you, however once lit they will stay lit for 1,500 meters or more.  In my experience they light up around 60-75 yards out.  Shooting at 100 yards you will see them light up the last bit before hitting the berm. Text or call for the fastest response 379-7888.
