Includes a ton of accessories like a laser sight with grip-mounted switch, tactical weapon light, and scope. Also includes 25rd Mossberg magazine, sling, and some other extras.
The airsoft stock works as-is and looks very cool, but could use a little finishing for best appearance. It has multiple Picatinny-style rails for mounting other sights or accessories. I haven’t fully sighted in the scope or laser so it will need some adjusting for maximum accuracy.
I will also include the original composite stock that came with the rifle. The gun has no permanent alterations, and it can be easily swapped back into the factory stock if you prefer. Or you could install it in your own favorite airsoft shell, I have seen people mod this gun to look like a P90, XM, G36, and others.
Price is for complete package consisting of: -Mossberg 702 rifle -Custom tactical stock with multi-position adjustable buttstock. -Original factory stock & hardware -Laser sight with remote grip switch -Barrel-mounted tactical light -Telescopic sight -25rd AR-style magazine -Adjustable black nylon sling -Magazine loader -Remote switch for the light

It has a couple of cracks in the stock that have been screwed down or pinned, but functions perfectly fine. For safety reasons, I would only fire black powder out of this gun, due to the age. All serial numbered parts match, both barrels are in good shape, overall metal finish is in good shape, internal mechanism is dusty but functions flawlessly. I have fired it recently, I have 25 brass shells that will come with it if you want them but I have not cleaned them so they're likely corroded. I also have most of a bottle of black powder, some wads, and a 25 grain measuring cup for the black powder, and most of a pack of pistol primers for the shells that I'll toss in as well.

If you have not yet received your tax stamp for your Scorpion, we strongly encourage you to NOT store this kit at the same physical residence where your pistol is located. Please read the following:
NOTICE REGARDING EVO 922R KITS The EVO 922R PARTS AND FOLDING STOCK KIT (“EVO 922R KIT”) is intended to be used in conjunction with a CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol. Under federal law, attaching a stock to a firearm with a barrel less than 16” amounts to making a short barreled rifle (SBR). Prior to making an SBR, the owner of the firearm must first register the firearm with ATF and pay the appropriate tax. Additionally, federal law (the “922(r) statute”) prevents a person from making a rifle using more than 10 of the parts listed in 27 CFR 478.39 if the resulting rifle would be “non-sporting” under federal law. A Scorpion SBR would be “non-sporting” under federal law, hence the EVO 922R KIT. ATF has taken the position that an SBR is made when unassembled parts are placed in close proximity in such a way that they “serve no useful purpose other than to make a rifle having a barrel less than 16 inches in length… or convert a complete weapon into such an NFA firearm…” See ATF Ruling 2011-4. CZ-USA takes no position on exactly what “close proximity” means in the context of dealers and distributors of firearms. Purchasers of the EVO 922R KIT, including dealers and distributors, are solely responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the assembly, manufacture, and possession of SBRs and SBR components, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. § 922(r) and 27 CFR 478.39 and related regulations and rulings, and encourages you to consult with your attorney or to contact ATF should you have questions are your particular circumstance."

The action and rails are hand honed for smoother operation which is essential for fast follow up shots. Two shot extension tubes are added along with our fully machined sights. They feature fully adjustable ghost ring apertures that are adjustable for elevation and windage. Front and rear sights are fully shrouded for protection against being knocked out of adjustment or damaged if dropped.Every Nighthawk shotgun is finished with CeraKote. Finishes differ from all black to full custom. Our six round side shell carrier and fast action tactical safety are the final standard components on every shotgun we build. The shell carrier is made from a one piece aluminum billet that is hard anodized to military spec and the dome on the safety is so pronounced that you can release the safety while acquiring the trigger in the same move.
