The water pump and timing belt were replaced at 160,000 miles and it now has 189,000 miles, this was my daily driver and never had issues, it was always reliable for me. The interior is clean and no rips or tears in the seats, could use a shampooing though if you wanted it to shine. The exterior is the only downside...the hood is bent and the passenger side fender has been replaced with a non-color matching part. There is a small 1 inch hole in the bumper...a small dent in the rear side driver door...but I would assume most people aren't buying a car like this for its good looks. Its a mechanically sound vehicle. Asking $1900 cash or partial firearm trades. I no longer need this because I purchased a new vehicle. Bicycle roof rack does not come with the vehicle but if you would like to buy it I can sell it to you separately."

According to the serial number, this  rifle was manufactured BEFORE 1898 (1896 to be exact). It is EXEMPT from the Gun Control Act of 1968 and is classified as an ANTIQUE the same as a black powder gun. It is not subject to FFL requirements, it doesn't even need a C&R. It is not on the books and isn't supposed to be. It is a functional, legal ""off the grid"" gun. It can legally be shipped door to door pretty much anywhere. This is one gun the gun grabbers can't grab! What is it? A gorgeous US Springfield Armory Model 1896 Krag-Jorgensen 30-40 Krag. The brief predecessor to the M1903 Springfield, these guns saw action in the Spanish-American war and were used by Teddy Roosevelts Rough Riders. According to the low serial number, this rifle was manufactured in 1896. Beautiful condition, flawless bore with sharp rifling and period Redfield micrometer peep sights-- a match rifle in every respect. While not an original carbine, it is unclear if the conversion was factory or not. Due to the high quality of the gunsmithing, it is hard to say. This turn-of-the-century tack-driver would make any avid marksman proud to own. I won't turn down anything over $800. Additional pics on gunbroker:http://www.gunbroker.com/item/636637267"

Designed for first response, law enforcement, and SWAT personnel to have the very best emergency first aid and wound care available for immediate use when and where they need it.Used in on-site field training, the Tactical Response Life Saver Kit (TRLS) is housed in a drop leg pouch for immediate access and contains critical trauma wound care, tactical field dressings, and EMT tools. Durable interior straps keep contents organized for fastest access in high stress and high risk situations, and prevent tools and materials from falling out of an unzipped pouch as the operator moves from one patient to the next. Because every second matters, we selected tactical wound care products with the best quality, performance, and rapid application possible.OLAES modular bandages are the latest generation of trauma bandages, designed with the input of combat medics to provide the most effective care with maximum multiple application efficiency in high-pressure field emergencies. HyFin Vent Chest Seal—included in a twin pack for treating entry and exit wounds—has an innovative design with pressure relief vents and channels to effectively control air and blood flow plus advanced adhesives for a sure seal even under the most adverse conditions. Gen 3 SOF Tactical Tourniquets’ unique design eliminates the need to re-thread webbing, yielding easier operator use under stress for faster application time and reduced blood loss.Every Tactical Response Life Saver Kit also contains a black permanent marker to identify tourniquet application time, glow sticks to mark areas or object of interest, and 7 1/5 inch EMT shears on a self-retracting tether for exposing wounds and allowing proper application of contents. Plus the drop leg pouch has an exterior pocket, to hold additional critical trauma care materials, such as PPE like nitrile gloves.The Drop Leg pouch is new to the Voodoo Tactical line up and can be purchased separately, item #20-0210 and is available in Black, OD Green and Coyote Brown. The Leg strap is adjustable to three different heights allowing for maximum comfort for the operator. The drop and leg strap can be removed and the kit can be affixed to PALS webbing with a third party device.Every Tactical Response Life Saver Kit contains:1 ea – Drop leg pouch (20-0210) 1 ea – Black permanent marker for marking tourniquet time 1 ea – EMT shears 1 ea – T-Reign retractable key holder 1 ea – Green light stick 1 ea – Red light stick 2 ea – Twin pack – HyFin Vent chest seal 1 ea – OLAES modular bandage – round 1 ea – OLAES modular bandage – flat 2 ea – Gen 3 SOF Tactical tourniquet – high-viz orange Features:Drop leg zippered pouch for rapid deployment Inner straps for organization and loss protection in action Used by professional first responder, law enforcement, and SWAT personnel Designed for maximum efficiency in high risk situations OLAES bandages designed for fast and effective trauma care of multiple applications in field emergencies HyFin chest seal twin pack included to dress entry and exit wounds HyFin chest seal vent and channel design effectively controls air and blood flow Gen 3 SOF Tactical tourniquets eliminate the need to re-thread webbing, yielding faster application time for reduced blood loss Exterior pocket on drop leg pouch can hold additional critical trauma materials An IFAK or Individual First Aid Kit is intended to be used on the individual carrying it.

Avirex supplied the jackets for the 1986 movie ""Top Gun"", so their jackets are very close to the government issued jackets. The fur collar is removable. It does have various patches on the interior as well as a graphic on the back lining (see close-up photos). It has a leather patch applied to the exterior that reads ""Avirex Ltd"". The lining is printed with a Certificate of Service given to Charles T Reilly and signed by Bill Halsey. The jacket has two large pockets affixed to the front that can be accessed either from the top by unbuttoning the flap, or from the side.  The back has a double flap at the top, dropped sleeves and the armpits have gusseted extensions for ease of movement.  -US Navy pattern -Bi-swing back -Genuine lamb’s wool shearling mouton fur collar like the WWII era.  The fur collar is removable. -Knit cuffs and waistband -Top entry front flap pockets -Full zip with front wind flap -Under arm grommets  She Paid $550 and I am selling for $250"

Avirex supplied the jackets for the 1986 movie ""Top Gun"", so their jackets are very close to the government issued jackets. The fur collar is removable. It does have various patches on the interior as well as a graphic on the back lining (see close-up photos). It has a leather patch applied to the exterior that reads ""Avirex Ltd"". The lining is printed with a Certificate of Service given to Charles T Reilly and signed by Bill Halsey. The jacket has two large pockets affixed to the front that can be accessed either from the top by unbuttoning the flap, or from the side.  The back has a double flap at the top, dropped sleeves and the armpits have gusseted extensions for ease of movement.  -US Navy pattern -Bi-swing back -Genuine lamb’s wool shearling mouton fur collar like the WWII era.  The fur collar is removable. -Knit cuffs and waistband -Top entry front flap pockets -Full zip with front wind flap -Under arm grommets  She Paid $550 and I am selling for $250"

I have my new, unfired Glock 17 gen 4. This things is loaded with extras and upgrades. I will give you the parts and you can google or go to GlockStore and check them out for yourself, but there is $1600+ of value in this glock. I wanted to competition style glock and I am mainly interested in trades. I will not sell and take a loss, I'd just keep it. It will come with 3 mags, all the backstraps, and what came in the box new. Glock was $599 new, Blacklist barrel was $230. The custom slide work was $300 with the black cerakote. Pyramid Trigger was $150. Magwell was $90. Gold mag release and extended control kit was $110. Heavy magazine base was $30 and the TruGlo night sights were $150. THE STREAMLIGHT IS NOT INCLUDED. I can send more pics if you need them. I'm interested in Trades, of equal value of atleast $1600. Trades plus cash that equals $1600. Just like I provided my verifiable value, you need to do the same and offset with cash. Example, a stock KSG plus $200 doesn't equal $1600. Used guns don't have the same value as new guns so if it's not new, please be fair with your value. Looking for an FN5.7, Tavor, Chiappa Rhino plus cash, KSG plus cash, PS90, Kriss Vector, I'm very open to offers. I won't respond to nonsense though. If nothing comes across interesting then I will likely remove it after a few days. Serious inquiries only. REDACTED"
