The gun is designed for all the practical uses an AR - 15 would be used for with the added benefit of being very accurate at long ranges. It is built from a Mega GTR-3S lower. These are one of the best lowers you can get. It is machined from billet 7075-T6 aluminum for increased strength. There are only 2 other manufacturers (Noveske and POF) that use a 100% milled lower. The trigger and small parts kit is a Daniel Defense Competition 2 stage trigger. The trigger is crisp with little to no uptake and breaks cleanly at about 5 lbs. This will allow the shooter to use the rifle for a variety of shooting options (bench rest, long range prone, three gun competition or even CQB) The barrel is from a custom barrel manufacturer in North Carolina who also does work for Special Forces 3rd Group. The gun has never been shot and has been in my safe since May. I am mainly interested in selling it but I would be interested in a higher end 1911 for trade possibly. I am selling it for $1,800. Feel free to contact me via email at REDACTED or REDACTED.I was only able to upload 2 pictures but I have more available via email or text."

These KS-47s are an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The PSA KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). Would trade for a Sig Sauer P226 MK25.Can add additional items for the right trade."

Never carried, no wear marks or scratches. Comes with 3 mags, one of which is a factory 9-round magazine. This is the newest striker-fired, “Pro” model which comes without either the manual thumb safety or the magazine disconnect found on the earlier “Standard” model of the LC9s, but with a vastly improved trigger which is much lighter with a shorter pull than the awful trigger on the original, hammer-fired LC9 model. I bought this gun a couple of weeks ago but even though it has Talon Grips installed, I have decided that I’d like something a little bigger to fit my hand better. Otherwise it’s an excellent gun. You’ll especially like the trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and makes me more accurate than I’ve been. It has a very slim profile that makes it excellent for concealed carry. Even though it’s a 9mm, not a .380, the LC9s Pro still has almost the same small dimensions as the small Glock 42. It comes in the original factory box with all paperwork, 3 mags (one factory 9-round, one factory 6-round, and one Pro-Mag 6-round), soft case, Kydex paddle holster and lock w/two keys. I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit. I’m in College Station so anywhere in the Austin, Houston, DFW triangle is ok if we can meet halfway to save driving. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. Cash only please so I can go buy something else. I’m not really looking for a trade and definitely not low-ball offers. Thanks!"

A couple of years ago I took it to a gun shop and had them check the bolt and the head space, they looked it over and said all looks fine and as far as I know it hasnt ben fired since the war. Ive never shot it because I have plenty of newer toys to shoot, it would make a nice period piece for a collector but thats not what Im into right now, If you want a nice piece of history carried back fromm W.W. 2 here you go.

Taurus packs the Model 85 with a combination of customer-requested features and pairs them with .38 Special +P ammo, making them powerful, easy to carry, and lightning-quick to use. The Taurus 85 models in blue or stainless steel make for uncomplicated carry and the total titanium models make for a lighter sturdier package. A transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear and the Taurus Security System consists of a keyed, quarter-turn style socket-head screw which can be set to prevent the hammer from pivoting back into the frame, thus rendering the weapon inoperative."

Brand new, never fired. Still has factory oil. Only thing changed was the longer PSA proprietary buffer tube. I swapped it for a standard carbine length buffer tube to allow full collapse of the stock. The PSA tube prevented this because it's about 3/4 of an inch too long, in order to use AR15 buffers. The new tube uses DPMS length 308 carbine buffers, which are far more reliable. Everything is factory new/ fresh.
 
Selling this because I originally planned on building two identical rifles. One in 308 Win, the other in 6.5 CM. Have changed my mind and no longer need this lower.

While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.  A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul."

For me, the blind order 1911 was going to serve as a starting platform for a bullseye competition gun. However, when I took possession of it I was blown away to find the gun had dried cosmoline inside, and no carbon or copper on the breech face or barrel: ostensibly, in unfired condition. I chose to keep it that way, and the gun has never been fired by me, and only handled for periodic cleaning.Research on www.sitem1911.com puts this Colt's year of manufacturer at 1951. The bluing appears original: deep, reflective, and reminiscent of an Art Deco age where attention to detail was paramount. It shows handling wear, primarily at the muzzle end on the dust cover; there are fine lines in the bluing here and there, and an ""idiot mark"" from an uncareful reassembly somewhere along the line. While not 100%, this classic has carried its 66 years very gracefully.The period-correct box arrived in my possession too tattered to salvage, and I no longer have it.Comes with original Colt 7 round magazine, in similar condition to pistol.Higher-definition photos on request: seven Owe Won, three 0 sicks, for 3 ate 3.FtF with proof of MO residency is fine.

I love this pistol, but the CZ-inspired slide-inside-frame design leaves less area to grip when racking the slide, and my arthritic hands are having trouble with it, so it has to go; would never sell it otherwise. I’ve fired exactly 250 rounds (200 FMJ and 50 Hornady 230-grain JHP), and that weight makes it the softest recoiling .45 I’ve ever shot, plus it’s extremely accurate. Lowest Web price now is $580 total (w/shipping & FFL) and it goes up from there, so you’re getting a “new” pistol for $100 less, and with none of the hassle.
