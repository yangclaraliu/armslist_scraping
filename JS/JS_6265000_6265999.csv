The CG 63 featured a new free-floating heavy barrel, a new pistol-grip stock and a micrometer aperture sight. The cocking piece was modified to reduce mass and stroke, the trigger was ribbed, and the trigger guard was serrated.  Armorers chose the best possible parts to outfit the CG 63 rifles, since these rifles were used by members of the rifle organisation 'Frivilliga Skytterörelsen' (FSR) for competition shooting.  The rifles were designed for shooting at 300 meters, but the fully adjustable diopter sights allow shooting from 100 to 600 meters (yards).  Rear sight diopter elevation tabs can allow shooting out to 1000 meters (yards) for some models. Here are the specifics for this rifle:  This rifle has a fully adjustable Soderin rear diopter sight and a front globe sight with an aperture insert.  I have 2 additional aperture inserts with different aperture sizes for the front sight that will be included.  I would classify the bore to be in good condition and is shiny with minimal chamber wear.  Rifling is strong with some light frosting.  The muzzle is very tight.  The stock is in very good condition with a few small dings.  The bolt matches the receiver.  (It is typical for other parts not to match on these rifles, since the armorers were hand picking the best parts for each of these rifles).  The only defect with this rifle is that there is a crack in the front globe sight base.  This crack was repaired and I have shot it many times with no problems.  These front globes are easily replacable, but I have seen no need to replace this one, since it functions perfectly.  One unusual feature of this rifle is that it has a 1943 Husqvarna receiver and bolt.  The vast majority of these rifles have older Carl Gustav receivers.  Some Swedish shooters claimed the Husqvarna receivers were more accurate, and were highly sought after.  I believe that this particular rifle was converted to a CG 63 in 1970, but can't be sure.  The rifle is chambered for the very accurate Swedish 6.5x55 mm round.  This round shoots flat, is accurate, has low recoil, and is easily reloadable.  I hate to sell this rifle, but I need to fund another purchase and will let it go, since I have another one.  I have more photos available upon request.  I can be reached by text at REDACTED or by response through the Armlist website.  I have a hearing loss and cannot answer phone calls, but will respond by text."

To the rear you’ll see a Mil-Spec Daniel Defense Tornado Collapsible buttstock with 2 interchangeable buttpads.  Up on top we have a Vortex Spitfire AR 1x prism scope with multi-height mount system. Uses a glass etched DRT reticle with red OR green illumination. Excellent red dot and absolutely fog/water proof. I use this design on most of my rifles. This particular one has been mounted but never fired while in use or carried in the field.  The rifle was assembled about 4 months ago and has seen only one range trip with less than 100 rounds to check for functionality. I haven’t had the time or the inclination since to take it back out after our sunny weather went away.  Christmas bills force the sale unfortunately…. (damn I hate the holidays). I’ll be including the black 30 round P-Mag pictured and a bonus 100 rounds of Federal XM193 5.56, in 20 round boxes. That’s about as sweet as it gets price wise. The Vortex Spitfire alone retails for $250. I only ask that you take care of your own transfer and background check fee. I live in Sandy and will be willing to meet as far as Portland. We can decide a meeting location somewhere between us if necessary—otherwise we have a great gun shop here in Sandy, Rapid Firearms. I'm not looking for trades at the moment.

Featured in a separate SHOT Show auction on ARMSLIST.com is a Kimber SuperAmerica .308 Traditional rifle, hand-engraved and offering serial number “SUPER308”. The special pair not only marks the first time that Kimber firearms have been featured in the SHOT Show auction, it is also the first time that a themed handgun and rifle have ever been offered by one manufacturer. The rifle and pistol share the “SUPER” serial number theme to emphasize their “Super” status among target shooters, hunters and collectors.This Super Match “SUPER1911” is hand-engraved by Rob Bunting of Baron Engraving in Trumbull, Connecticut. Rob is a highly skilled and creative engraver who has engraved some of the most popular firearms in SHOT Show auction history.In explaining the engraving pattern he featured on the Super Match II 1911 (and the SuperAmerica .308 rifle), Rob said, “First off, 1911's are one of my favorites to work on! When I saw the serial number was special, I thought I would try something a little different for this one. I tend to do leafy scroll, which I like very much, but I wanted to simplify the look this time around. This pattern has a very strong central spine with leaves placed more formally at regular intervals. The spine receives very little shading and the leaves are heavily shaded and cross-hatched, which creates a very strong contrast in the design. I think that is what makes it nice. I also removed a fair amount of background from between the scrolls and put in a nice strong punch dot pattern down to increase the contrast. Black fill in the cuts makes the whole thing pull together and pop.” The new Super Match II 1911is designed for competition right out of the box with all new features and an accuracy guarantee of one-inch five-shot groups at 25 yards. The .45 ACP features Kimber adjustable sights, fancy walnut grips and match grade trigger. Barrel length is five inches and weight is 39 ounces with unloaded 8-round magazine. You are bidding only on the Kimber 1911 in this auction.

If I'm reading it correctly, THEY say that those of us with a CCW are EXEMPT from the law. So, it would seem that you others need to get down to your Sheriff's office and apply for the CCW. Problem solved.Taken from the QUESTION 1 FACT SHEET.Question #8Will the initiative require a person with a concealed weapons permit to undergo a background check to purchase a firearm?Answer: Background checks are exempt for those who have a state concealed weapons permit... Should a person with a CCW obtain a firearm from an unlicensed dealer ( at a gunshow, on the Internet, or a face to face transaction) there is no requirement for a background check to be conducted.Seems pretty simple."

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in .45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, this handy pistols combines compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot two-finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. All variants of the USP Compact have modified contoured slide and frame for effective concealability. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high energy +P and +P+ loads. $799 out the door price for cash/check.

IC-A5 SBR
Individual Carbine
Directly descended from the rifles developed by LWRCI to meet the requirements for the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program, the IC-A5 is built for high performance.  The IC-A5 SBR model delivers the same great features, fit and function of the full size IC-A5 in a compact 10.5"" barrel configuration

The IC-A5 SBR  is the latest model in the IC  Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and user configurable rail system on the same rifle. We listened- the IC-A5 SBR is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of our longer modular rail system. 

The Monoforge upper receiver with LWRCI modular rail system is stronger and lighter.  Access to the gas piston system is quick and easy by loosening 2 thumb screws on the IC-A5 SBR.  This IC-A5 SBR brings together the best features of the IC Enhanced and IC-SPR in one compact SBR package.

Like all IC models the IC-A5 SBR is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. 

Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5 SBR.  LWRCI Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard.  Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.  

Our IC-A5 SBR uses LWRCI manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged standard barrel.  The LWRCI Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.  



The LWRCI IC-A5 SBR comes complete with, LWRCI Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, LWRCI Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCI Adjustable Compact Stock, Magpul® MOE+ Grip and LWRCI High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider."

Barrel length 36.6 inches. The rifle was chambered for the powerful centerfire .50-70 Government cartridge (.50 caliber 450-grain (29 g) bullet; 70 grains (4.5 g) of black powder). (Wiki): The Springfield Model 1866 was the second iteration of the Allin-designed trapdoor breech-loading mechanism. Originally developed as a means of converting rifled muskets to breechloaders, the Allin modification ultimately became the basis for the definitive Model 1873, the first breech-loading rifle adopted by the United States War Department for manufacture and widespread issue to U.S. troops. The Model 1866 corrected problems encountered with the prototypical Model 1865, in particular a simplified and improved extractor and a superior .50 caliber centerfire cartridge (the Model 1865 used a .58 caliber rimfire cartridge with mediocre ballistics), among many other less significant changes. It employed a robust version of the ""trapdoor"" breechblock design originated by Erskine S. Allin, Master Armorer of the Springfield Armory. Approximately 25,000 .58 caliber Springfield Model 1863 rifled muskets were converted by Springfield Armory for use by U.S. troops, the barrels being relined and rifled to .50 caliber and the trapdoor breech system affixed. The rifle was chambered for the powerful centerfire .50-70 Government cartridge (.50 caliber 450-grain (29 g) bullet; 70 grains (4.5 g) of black powder)."

Included:
- Two mags that came with it.
- Soft carry case that came with it.
- ""Pocket Shot"" CCW case, gives it the shape of a wallet, and easier to aim too (paid $30 Amazon)
- Techna Clip orig. (paid $30 Amazon)
- Talon Grips rubber texture grip (paid $17 Amazon)
- A few rounds of .380
Selling because I am moving overseas and don't want to store them.  In for about $475... figured $350 would be a fair deal.

They are Glock brand.When you contact me, I'll give you my phone number (we can talk by phone if you like) and basically you paypal me the money, I'll put the magazines in the USPS to you.I am not an expert on Maryland law. I believe this is all legal. You, being a Maryland resident, should know more about those laws than I know. Do not do anything illegal."

Meticulous triggers built by our staff toolmakers ... without a stopwatch in sight.
No question, we’re particular about accuracy. Everyone knows that one of the smartest improvements an AR-owner can do to their rifle is a precision trigger upgrade. Everyone also knows that LaRue Tactical has a track-record of doing things right. The LaRue MBT-2S was purposefully designed and manufactured to render the greatest benefits from our legendary line of accurate rifles. The MBT-2S can also replace the stock trigger on any mil-spec AR lower receiver.
Sparing no expense, all major components are precision-machined from S7 Tool Steel. The result of this extra effort is a glass-smooth, hyper-consistent trigger that will satisfy even the most scrupulous competition shooter, but also be overly rugged for the battlefield. The MBT-2S breaks crisply at 4.5 lbs (2.5 lb first stage, 2 lb second stage) and has a smooth and positive reset. Each trigger comes with an additional ""heavy"" trigger spring that increases the pull weight to 6 lbs.Made in-house, in Texas, in the USA."

Up for sale is an Aero Precision matched upper and lower, stuffed with all kinds of extras that will make shooting all day a treat.  This gun has never seen a bullet fired, or even chambered and all items were purchased brand new.  It would be an ideal rig for prairie dog, small varmint hunting, punching paper or ringing steel at longer distances.

The Lower receiver:
The receiver is an Aero Precision Gen 2 and has a Black Rain Ordnance LPK in it.  The enhanced trigger guard is by Core-15.  The stock is a black Magpul PRS and for the life of me I cant remember the manufacturer of the tube.  The magazine release bar is a Strike Industries model and the button itself is by Odin and provides a shorter reach and a larger surface to make dropping the magazine easier.  The gun has an Extended Bolt Release made by Phase 5 and is one of my favorite accessories on the gun.  The take down pins are made by Strike Industries and provide a bigger surface to aid in removal.  The selector is by Hera Arms and is a 60* short throw and is also ambidextrous.  The grip is a Magpul MOE.  The drop in trigger group is an Elftmann 3-Gun trigger.  It is adjustable between 2.5-4lbs and is, in a word, ""AMAZING"".  Read up on them for full details as I dont remember all of the specs off the top of my head.  The trigger pins are KNS Anti-Roll and are often used with drop in triggers.
The Upper receiver:
The upper is an Aero Precision M4 Enhanced.  These are great because the barrel nut that also holds the rail for most guns, is actually part of the upper receiver.  By having all one piece, you never have to worry about it loosening or twisting.  It cant.  The actual barrel nut is actually inside the rail mount and slightly recessed.  Another nice thing about the enhanced receiver is that the forward assist roll pin has been replaced by a hex head screw in pin.  The forward assist and the dust cover on this are from Strike Industries.  The 15"" MLOK handguard is also Aero Precision and is solid as a rock due to its mount.  The barrel on this beast is a Wilson Combat Super Sniper .223 Wylde (shoot everything from .223 Rem, 5.56, and .223 Wylde with no issues) with a 1:8 (best of both worlds and allows for a wider variety of bullets to be accurately fired) twist that is 20"" long.  It is a .936 diameter and therefore, it also has a Wilson Combat Adjustable Gas Block.  Obviously, since I havent shot the gun yet, it has not been tuned for this barrel, BCG, and buffer setup.  Speaking of BCG's, this one is the NiB (Nickel Boron) offering from Fail Zero and it is full auto rated.  The charging handle is a Strike Industries and has the extended latch for easier operation.  The gas system on this gun, as you can imagine for a 20"" barrel, is a rifle length system.Will include a new magazine and a box of ammo as well. I am also open to selling the upper or lower by themselves if someone is interested in just one or the other.  Let me know what you have in mind.
I can accept Debit and Credit Cards for the small fee of 2% as well."
