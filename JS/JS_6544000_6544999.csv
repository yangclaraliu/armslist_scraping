Like the IC platform, the CSASS has fully ambidextrous controls and a Monoforge upper receiver with a free-floating forend. 
For the ultimate in reliability, LWRCI installs a 20-position gas block, allowing shooters to fine-tune the rifle for suppressor use, specific ammunition or environmental conditions. Unlike the REPR, it has a top-mounted, ambidextrous charging handle, while the lower is equipped with a Geissele SSA two-stage trigger and a SOPMOD collapsible stock."

Now they are taking their highly regarded bullets to the next level loading them in ammunition. Like the TAC-X bullet, the TAC-TX bullets offers controlled double-diameter expansion, maximum penetration and full functionality at long ranges. The only difference between the X and the TX is the polymer tip that increases the Ballistic Coefficient for better long-range ballistics. Composed entirely of copper, these bullets have high weight retention and exhibit excellent performance when shot through barriers. Designed specifically for Military and Law Enforcement customers, these bullets function flawlessly in AR-type rifles. VOR-TX ammunition is manufactured to precise tolerances to ensure excellent accuracy and consistent velocities. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable brass cases.

It has the black finish, two magazines, original box, bore brush, and the book that came with the weapon. I purchased this used, but never fired it. It has little to no wear. The finish is a little thin on the forward part of the slide on the left side. It isn't from wear, just thin. From the reviews, it should be pretty good for an inexpensive 1911, 45. Call REDACTED."

It is the back pack to end all back packs. With ample space, extra pockets, an incredibly strong and light-weight frame, and super-durable material, it is the most rugged, practial, effective pack I have ever had. Furthermore, it's absurdly comfortable. The frame, which is basically indestructable, not only supports your gear solidly, but it's shape keeps it from pressing against your back so you get airflow between your body and the pack. The whole package comes with Tactical Tailor's Malice Pack version 3, Super Straps (extra padded straps), Super Belt (extra padded belt), and Fight Light Malice Pack Frame. This pack sells for $437 on the Tactical Tailor website, and for good reason. In addition to the outstanding quality, it is prized by members of the special operations community, who must rely on the very best gear to get the job done. However, I'm offering it to you today for the low cost of $350! It's in excellent shape, and while I would love to keep it, I have to downsize! My loss is your gain!"

This is a series 1 gun (not an Ultra Carry 2), with no Swartz safety system, which many people prefer. This gun has seen very little use and is in perfect condition. Included are two factory Kimber magazines and one Wilson Combat magazine as well as a set of Hogue grips and all factory manuals/paperwork. This gun was taken to master pistolsmith Jim Garthwaite after I purchased it to have some minor enhancements done. Work includes repin plunger tube, install gold bead on front site, dimple slide stops, rework trigger, and fit a set of grips. The trigger is incredible and this is extremely nice gun to shoot. I have two of these guns and neither gets used, so I have decided to free up some room in the safe. Series 1 guns do not show up on the market very often, and this is an extremely fine example."
