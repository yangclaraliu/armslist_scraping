It works with the M4 Carbine, the M249 machine gun, and the H&K and M16A2 rifles. It is suitable for use in most weapons with a 1-in-7 barrel twist.The M855A1 has a copper-jacketed steel core, differing from the previous M855 round which has a lead core. The so-called “green ammo” not only has increased penetration of armor and hard targets, but allows the Army to be more environmentally friendly on its ranges and training environments.The M855A1 is optimized for the shorter-barrel M4 where the standard M855 was optimized for the M16. The powder burns faster and creates more pressure, and has the effect of reducing flash. The round yaws like the M855, but its yaw is more consistent and predictable, meaning its terminal effects are not yaw dependant."

And just for giggles, I also brought along some extra hot Ranger ammo just to see if it would overwhelm the M&P Shield....I shot it wet. I shot it dry. I shot it limp-wristed, weak handed. I shot it with ammo so crappy it would gag a maggot. I shot it with the finest JHP ammo known to mankind. I shot it with very hot loads.

PRODUCT SUMMARY
No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger Mark III pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol.
 
The 22/45 Lite has an aircraft-grade aluminum upper that's ventilated or fluted, making the pistol extremely lightweight. The 4.4-inch stainless barrel sleeve is kept in place by a tension nut, ensuring the same accuracy and reliability of the Ruger 22/45 line. The barrel is threaded 1/2""-28 for popular muzzle accessories with a thread protector supplied. The 22/45's integral cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving slide designs. The comfortable, precision-molded Zytel polymer grip frame has a serrated front strap and backstrap. The accurate sighting system features precision-adjustable rear and fixed front sights and a drilled and tapped receiver for the included Weaver-style scope base adapters. Ruger's patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that the chamber is loaded and the magazines disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed. Other features include: a contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, and a conveniently located push-button magazine release on the left side of the frame.

Built like a tank. Safety and de-cocker. Slide indicator shows you when a round is in the chamber. Old Fashioned Blue finish. Prior to Bluing Regulations. Standard Government Issue for Police and Military in Poland and other Eastern Euro countries. In design and function, the P-64 is similar to the Walther PPK, though some internals are different and are covered by a Polish patent. It is a double-action (DA) blowback design with a hammer-drop safety. As with the PPK, it incorporates a loaded-chamber indicator, which may be seen or felt. It is larger in diameter than that of the PPK and, hence, easier to see or feel. When chambering a round, the safety lever may be placed in the down position, which will lock the firing pin and disconnect the trigger bar. I always liked this feature as it allowed a round to be safely chambered without having to lower the hammer manually on a loaded chamber. As with the PPK, the slide locks open after the last round is fired and may be released by pulling it backwards and releasing it after a reload is completed or after removing the empty magazine. A bottom magazine release, which catches a protrusion on the rear base of the magazine, is used. Since the magazine has a finger rest hook, by catching this hook and depressing the magazine release button, the mag may be removed readily.Need to liquidate my collection. All Sales final.

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.
The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American."

PRODUCT SUMMARY
No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger Mark III pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol.
 
The 22/45 Lite has an aircraft-grade aluminum upper that's ventilated or fluted, making the pistol extremely lightweight. The 4.4-inch stainless barrel sleeve is kept in place by a tension nut, ensuring the same accuracy and reliability of the Ruger 22/45 line. The barrel is threaded 1/2""-28 for popular muzzle accessories with a thread protector supplied. The 22/45's integral cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving slide designs. The comfortable, precision-molded Zytel polymer grip frame has a serrated front strap and backstrap. The accurate sighting system features precision-adjustable rear and fixed front sights and a drilled and tapped receiver for the included Weaver-style scope base adapters. Ruger's patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that the chamber is loaded and the magazines disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed. Other features include: a contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, and a conveniently located push-button magazine release on the left side of the frame.

The 22/45 comes with two 10-round magazines and a Weaver rail for the addition of optics. The 5 1/2"" bull barrel already comes drilled and tapped from the factory.
No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.
22/45 Blue Titanium Features
In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Moreover, this is a great handgun for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting.
Other great features include a contoured ejection port, push button mag release, a hard plastic carry case, and tapered bolt ears that couldn't be easier to grasp.

Some are now polymer. Shooting a 357 round out of a light-weight revolver will beat the hell out of your hand. You will not want to practice then you will not be prepared if you get attacked. The Ruger Sp101 is a nice sized revolver. Not big, not too small. Nice amount of solid stainless steel to give it strength and weight. This greatly helps recoil, follow-up shots, and range time. The 2 ½ inch barrel allows more powder to be burned, in the barrel, rather than out, i.e. a 2 inch barrel will not allow all powder to burn, allowing for a major flash and wasted energy. Most importantly, REVOLVERS CANNOT MALFUNCTION – IMPOSSIBLE. REVOLVERS CANNOT FAIL. Bad round? Pull the trigger and the next round is ready. Bad round in an automatic?

Class is $60 and that is all inclusive-we provide guns, ammo, range fees, targets, ear and eye protection, student books. This is the official state course for obtaining your MO CCW permit but I encourage anyone who owns a firearm for self-defense to take this course to learn some defensive pistol fundamentals and the laws regarding deadly force and weapons charges. Classes are from 9-5:30 from an NRA Instructor/Mo CCW STATE approved instructor. If you are looking for a 2 hour ""class"" from a fly-by-night instructor this is not for you. If you do not think you need to learn the laws or become proficient with a firearm to carry one this is not for you. This class is very laid back and meant for all skill sets including those new to the process. 10% discount for active or retired military and first responders.  Gift certificates available for CCW, NRA, and Defensive Pistol courses and would make a great Christmas gift for anyone(especially the stubborn spouse who has put off getting their permit).

Contact me for a link to additional photos.  I planned on deer hunting with this gun, for the last two seasons but, that has not happened. Not even once. I’m ready to sell it.
I purchased this gun and scope(new) about a year and a half ago. I've shot it around 20 times. That was on a bench, just to get the scope sighted-in. Cleaned between almost every shot (mfg. say's up to 3 shots between cleaning after proper break-in) and has been stored in a humidity controlled room (@40% RH) since it was new. I'm meticulous about my firearms, this one included.  This gun is very, very accurate. I think anyone who has shot muzzle loaders before will instantly realize what I mean, once they pull the trigger. I was shooting as accurately as my 308 Weatherby, at the distance it is zeroed in at right now, about 38-40 yards. It is more accurate than you are, just like most well-made-modern rifles but, this is a muzzle loader!      The CVA Accura MR currently and always retails for over $410. The scope is rarely bought for less than $175. With the Leupold screw on lens covers, scope mounts, bullets, rods, tool kit, etc., I've spent a little over $800. I have anything and everything you could possibly need or want to shoot and care for this gun, as shown in the pictures. Everything shown is included, plus a nice steel military ammo can/box (I forgot to take pics of).Gun buyer gets choice of everything for $400 or everything minus the scope for $300. I will not sell the scope before the gun is sold. It will go on ebay if gun buyer doesn’t want it. First person to put $400 cash in my hands leaves with everything shown in the pictures. NO OFFERS, NO TRADES, NO SHIPPING, CASH ONLY! Located about 10 minutes south of Florence Ky. Can meet in Florence, at the police station / justice center. REDACTED Cameron"

I have $953 into this gun not counting FFL and taxes, and that's what I'd like to get out.  the only reason I'm selling is because I wanna build one from the ground up with a spikes lower I like a little better.
It's got two small 'problems'
it has a ambi extended charging handle, which works great BUT it hits the Magpull cheek riser.   the UTG 3x magnifier makes it a little awkward to get to a stock handle so I'm undecided which complaint bothers me more, however with the ambi it makes it difficult/impossible to lock the breech open so I'll probably switch it back to stock.
And the brass hits the deflector which is a totally non-problem problem but it is what it is.   Haven't decided if I'd try a new buffer or spring to ""fix"" it or not.
 
so...   I'll sell it for 850 W/O the optics, 950 as pictured or we can probably make some sort of deal with different furniture etc.  
 
Possibly Interested in trades for a  handgun. Particularly a .380 or 9mm like Walther PPK/S or Glock 43.  Possibly a .22.
 
Save yourself $125 off buying new and it's your last chance to own one without big brother knowing all about it."

""The evolution of the SPR comes home to Daniel Defense in the MK12.  Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.  
The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.  
The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.""We will ship anywhere in the ConUSA for $40 to your local FFL.  You must be legally allowed to own this rifle and you are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations.  Stop by our store or give us a call for more information.  Thanks for looking!"
