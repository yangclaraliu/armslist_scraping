(Resistant for 9mm and shrapnel)For $550 you will get 2 side sapi plates (left and right) thrown in rated to survive multiple 7.62×39 or 5.56 impacts. (Comes in a kevlar ballistic spall liner that is itself resistant to up to 9mm impacts even without the plates)Im sorry but I do not posess the front or back sapi plates, but they are easy to find on Ebay. Without sapis this vest will protect from handgun rounds and shrapnel, with sapi plates you can take multiple impacts from mid-range powered assault rifle type calibers, or one hit from rifle calibers like .308. This is about 1/2 what this system can go for, I am willing to bargain with you but please no low-balling. You WILL NOT find this level of protection and modularity in off the shelf plate carriers for less than 1,000 to 1500 and thats even before you buy front and back plates. (AR 500 doesnt count unless you like shrapnel in your face)I have two of these complete systems. Cash carrying locals only please, I will trade both of them for a PTR-91. Otherwise no trades."

Even better, it has a shorter trigger reset than a stock M&P - ask any competition shooter and they will tell you that trigger reset is more important than trigger pull for achieving fast, accurate follow-up shots!The trigger weight has been left at the factory-default 5.0-5.5 lbs, which is recommended for concealed carry for both safety and legal reasons.The gun also comes with three 10 round magazines. I know that 17 round mags are better and you can pick them up for only $14.97 at https://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/promag-s-and-w-m-and-p9-magazine-9mm-luger-17-rounds-steel-blued-finish-smia12-REDACTED82.do. The ten round mags are great for training, though.I'm so confident you'll like this gun and trigger that you are more than welcome to test fire this gun at the range with me, provided you supply your own ammunition.Thanks for reading and I hope you find something you like! Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like more photos.P.S. I am open to trades, especially if you have a Sig P290RS, A Ruger Speed Six in stainless steel, or a Smith & Wesson 43C."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and another 9mm stripped lower and cash or??  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower and side charging uppers.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and $250-$300 cash, depending if new or used, since I can buy most of those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.

The exterior looks rough (I bought it with plans to dip it) also has engraving/writing on it from Israel) and on of the grips has a break in the bottom corner but does not affect the functionality (I have Hogue grips on my others that were under $20 online). It has night sites but only the front can be seen faintly and the rear sites have been worn down on one side a bit, but still accurate. The pistol fires great with no mechanical malfunctions and is in great mechanical shape. Just looks rough on the exterior. These sell for $550 and up new and I'm only selling because I currently have 3 of these and do not need to go through with hydro dipping this one.  I would like to get what I have invested in it so far. This is a great firearm that just needs a new home and would make a great hydro project. Selling for $370"

It does not fit the M&P 9 or 40, nor does it fit the M&P 9c or 40c. It is designed to be worn inside the waistband for concealed carry. CYA Supply Co. a member of NRA Business Alliance. We make our holsters with the end user in mind. We have put much attention to our materials, design and process to bring you a top of the line holster at a better price. Finally, you do not have to sacrifice quality for a good price! We have taken the major wear and friction points out of this holster. In most kydex holsters, makers mold straight to the shape of the gun, this includes the slide release, safety etc. By recessing this area we are able to create a smoother draw and re-holster. This also reduces the amount of holster wear on your gun. Our holsters are made from Boltaron thermoplastic, a similar plastic to Kydex. Boltaron is abrasion resistant, chemical resistant, and extremely durable. Boltaron out performs Kydex T, the material most thermoplastic holsters are made from, in impact resistance, hardness, and keeps its shape better than Kydex T in high heat situations. Our cant is adjustable from 0 to 15 degrees, simply use the hex key provided with your holster to loosen the screw on the belt loop and adjust. As stated above, CYA Supply Co is veteran owned, and our holsters are made right here in the USA. Texas to be exact. Thank you for supporting American made small busienss."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  Not going to be interested in trades unless the value is there, Thanks.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower, side charging uppers and cash or??  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"
