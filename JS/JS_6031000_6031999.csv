 Only the shroud is for sale, the rifle, bipod, Archangel kit, scope, and magazine shown are not. Before you buy, make sure your barrel is an 18 1/2"" taper barrel.
 This shroud has 4 rows of holes along the length.
 Pictures show a gun with the shroud after adding it. This shroud is made of thick walled plastic, is approximately 15 1/4 inches long, and will add about 1/8 inch to the overall length of your rifle. It weighs about 5 ounces and is designed for standard 18½” taper barrels only. Each shroud has been test fitted to ensure a proper fit. Instructions are included for easy installation.
 The shroud was designed to fit the AA556R and AA556R-EX Stock kits when using an 18.5” Ruger tapered barrel. The shroud is 15.25” long and terminates just in front of the rear sight. The outer dia. of the shroud is 1.03-1.05” and slightly larger than a .920 bull barrel. With that said, it can be used on an AAM1022 Nomad stock with minor modifications to the stock. It will NOT fit the AAP1022 Precision stock or the AATS1022 Target stock.
 This Ventilated Hole Barrel Shroud is made to enhance the looks of your Ruger 10/22 and Archangel 556 Stock kit. It replaces the partial shroud and plastic bayonet that comes with the kit. It will give your setup the Bull Barrel look without all the added weight. Made from a high impact thick walled plastic with a texture similar of that found on the AA556 Stock. Installation is easy and no set screws are needed that may mark your barrel. Only front sight blade removal is necessary to install.
 This shroud is for looks only, and serves no other purpose. These shrouds are not affiliated in any way with the manufacturer of the stock kit.
 For obvious reasons, this will not fit Tapco stocks. It will not fit the AAP1022 Precision stock or the AAT1022 Target stock."

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Both are Flat Tops with Carry Handles. Both have 16 inch 1/9 twist, M4 Feed Ramps, Chromed Lined Barrel. They do not come with any magazines or ammo. Both have adjustable butt stocks. Handguards were changed on one of these so my wife could handle it better. I do not have the larger handguards that were removed. They were used on another AR I sold. They operate fine, and are very accurate. The round count is low. Rifling is sharp and very crisp. These were carried in our vehicles as a SHTF weapons. We have since went to AR Pistols is why we are selling these. They look nice in my opinion. If you're looking for brand new, they are available at your LGS. The barrels are threaded. You must have VALID ID and VALID CHP or Pistol Purchase Permit issued by your county sheriff to purchase these from me locally. Price is FIRM. I don't NEED the money...

These are all complete with individually headspaced bolt carrier groups and extended charging handles. It will be possible to have any of these set up with your preference of sights or optics as a part of the trade. All the parts in these uppers are first quality, I didn't build these to sell, these are my personal firearms.I am a retired engineer and have worked as a professional gunsmith in the past, so no corners are cut and the best tools and techniques were used were used in their fabrication and will be used in anything to adjust one to your needs. I don't have the disposable cash to just buy one of these revolvers outright, so I will have to sell something or trade for it. I can clip cut the cylinder myself, but would prefer to have it factory if possible, so the 642 Pro is the favored model. I am able to give considerably on my side to get what I want ASAP, so somebody is going to get a good deal on a upper set up just like they want"
