I bought two of these and only used one and sadly I need the cash so I have to get rid of the other. It's a forged lower made from 7075 aluminum. Very easy to route. Jig set is the Ar15 easy jig set and has been used once for the first lower but is in great shape. Holes aren't over routed or bored out and these are rated to do 10+ lower recievers. Bits are also in great shape and can be used again with no issue. It's a really simple process to do this and doesn't take very long at all. Willing to sell seperately but prefer not to.Also willing to sell the power tools required for routing out the reciever which are a ryobi drill press and ryobi router if they aren't already sold on craigslist.

I fired less than 100 rounds back then without a hitch, and this past weekend fired about 100 rounds again. 
 
Except this time, there were a few failures to feed properly. I was using a factory PSA lower which i have used withg other uppers flawlessly, and USGI mags which i also successfully used in other weapons. The empty casing would fully leave the weapon, and the bolt face was properly pushing the new round up, but the tip of the bullet would hit, just below the feed ramps in the barrel extension. POF has a lifetime warranty, but i truly do not feel like messing with any of this. This would happen every 10 rounds or so, rapid firing. I think the only issue is that this old style upper does not have the nice m4 feed ramps which would more than correct this issue.
 
On the upper are troy industry shorty sights, designed specifically for this platform. these alone are 200 or so for the pair.
 
asking for 400 for the upper and sights, and maybe it will work fine on your lower? no modifications so the pof warranty is all there."

It is made in Austria but these were demo models from what I gather as they do have the finger grooves of the Gen 3 also the pistol comes in an original tupperware box with serial number sticker and information original mag loader and cleaning kit plus the original two 10 round magazines the pistol will also come with a 26 round magazine and a 13-round magazine the slide and every internal part inside of it was replaced by glock and I had the slide fixed with steel Glock sights since there is no purpose for night sights on this pistol it is a definite Rarity and I will accept the first good cash offer that makes sense also you can text me at REDACTED I will throw in a box of ammo if the price is right $650 obo. If I finish the work the price will go up

Just make sure you are OK with a single curve plate vs. a multi-curve plate. I'm also a smaller dude so that is part of my problem when trying to conceal body armor. Valid LE, Military, or CCW credentials only please. I have to be able to verify that you are not a felon. Cannot ship to any state or location that restricts body armor sales. Email me with any questions. Cash or paypal is accepted. Buyer pays $10 towards shipping (if required). If you're interested in anything else I'm selling then I'll take a few extra bucks off the price."

I bought the gun only a couple months ago after trying to find a nice WASR 10 but having no luck. Then a coworker was needing some cash and sold me his WASR 10 for a deal I couldn't refuse. Therefore I'm selling this RAS47 as I have no need for two AKs. The gun only has 40 rounds of Golden Tiger FMJ fired through it. I cleaned it well, oiled, and greased with Mil-Comm TW25B before shooting, and shot the 40 rounds. Made a slight adjustment to the sights and had it dialed in nicely (shooting 2-2.5"" groups) at 100 meters. I then cleaned, oiled, and greased again and she's sat in the safe since. I will also throw in two Tapco 30 round mags with the gun. Price is $600. Not really looking for trades at this time. I will sell only to Alabama residents with a valid/non-expired drivers license and prefer you have a valid/non-expired concealed carry permit. Also be willing to sign a bill of sale. I'm home for the holidays here in Baldwin County and brought the gun with me (I live and work in North Alabama in Huntsville). Thank you for looking, and I hope this AK can be of use for you. -Mike"
