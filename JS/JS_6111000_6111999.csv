Not sure if barrel is US made or not, but it likely is. Through my reading, it seems Century switched the name to ""Golani"" after a squabble with IWI over licensing, and a large amount of early ones were shipped back to be re-stamped, making ones actually marked Galil pretty uncommon. Golani's also do not posses a bayonet lug.Some of these rifles were affected by a recall, in which Century would replace the firing pin with a spring loaded one. I contacted Century, and they claim this rifle isn't included in the recall. However, during my reading, I found that it likely IS included, but since I've had no issues, I've had no reason to push the issue. this particular rifle comes with a Midwest Industries quad rail system. Very sturdy and doesn't impede field stripping. Also included is 7 35rd IWI magazines. I am interested in trades for other firearms, ONLY. $1,500obo"

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.  The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Though a repro, this procedure was done by the Egyptians late in the Rasheed's development cycle and is correct.Though im open to certain trades (C&R preferred especially Garand Receivers [I'm building a BM-59]), im setting the price at $850.

It is a ""Second Model"" with the ""thumbprint"" dust cover and dust cover rail that is attached to the receiver with screws. Like all of the early 76's, it is chambered for the .45-75 cartridge and unmarked in regards to caliber. It wears the standard 28"" octagon barrel with full length magazine. It is factory fitted with the optional single-set trigger. This rifle is in very good condition overall and still retains a fair amount of the original factory blue finish although much of the surface has light rust and surface corrosion from poor storage. There are a few handling marks as well as some fine scratching to the right side of the receiver from over-aggressive cleaning. I'd grade the remaining finish at about 30-40% overall. The ladder type rear barrel sight is marked ""1876"" and works alright in spite of the right side of the sight blade being bent to the rear. The stocks are in good condition and free of any cracks. There are the normal handling marks, small dings and scratches that one would expect. The rifle appears to be in good mechanical condition with everything working properly, including the set trigger. The bore rates about good with some minor erosion but good rifling with a fair amount of shine. It looks like it would certainly be shootable with appropriate loads. Essentially a scaled-up 1873, the Model 1876 was the largest of the Winchester lever rifles and had an enormous receiver to handle the large cartridges it chambered. Production was somewhat limited however, partly due to the introduction of the mechanically superior Model 1886. These were typically ""working guns"" which saw heavy use, many shipped out West. This rifle comes with a Cody Museum letter which verifies it was manufactured with an octagon barrel with a set trigger and ""lid"" (dust cover). It was shipped September 18, 1878, the second year of production.shipping is free. This is an antique cartridge firing rifle and as such, no FFL is required for transfer. It can be shipped directly to buyer."

I have about $1744.25 into the rifle. Asking price is $1100 (dropped from $1200) OBO no trades located in PDX, buyer pays for all FFL fees. I can be reached thru texts at REDACTED. Does not come with a case. Local FTF deal, no shipping. I will NOT reply to stupid people asking to ship the rifle. I don't care if you add more money, everyone know it's a scam.
 $1100 for the whole setup or $1000 for just the rifle no optics."

All of the original packaging and accessories will be provided (1 30-rd magazine, gun lock, cleaning kit, and carrying case)I originally purchased this AR-15 to use as a patrol rifle, but I never deployed it out in the field. Used primarily for static target shooting with very minimal wear and tear. The rifle is extremely dependable, as I have never experienced any jamming issues with it. I have only ever used brass ammo from American Eagle. The only reason why I'm selling this rifle is because I recently purchased a Colt M4, and have no need for two AR-15s.If you have any questions, offers, or would like to see pictures, please feel free to contact me via email.Please be willing to sign a Bill of Sale/Provide ID.
