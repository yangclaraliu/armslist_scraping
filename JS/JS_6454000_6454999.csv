I found the gun to be very accurate in the test-fire.Price/Value is pretty firm.  Will consider trades, but will not travel.Indiana residents only (unless you are willing to receive shipment at an FFL near you and pay shipping), must show photo ID and complete bill of sale.  Can text REDACTED or message here."

According to ""The Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson"", ""Detroit Police"" was not stamped on these Model 10's until 1962, with the introduction of the newer Model 10-5 variation. The one listed here is among the earliest version of model 10 manufactured between 1957 and 1960, and therefore does not have the aforementioned back strap stampings."

It was purchased with the intent to carry it but never got around to actually using it all that much. It's had less than 200rds through it, all of which were American Eagle 180gr brass FMJs. It's in absoutely awesome condition, almost no wear on the exterior as it has barely been used outside of a few range trips. There's just a tad bit of carbon near the muzzle, where it typically collects on Glocks after a few range trips. It's been properly lubed and maintained since Ive had it. Currently has ALG Purple Go-Juice lube inside it. The sights were upgraded to the Wilson Combat/Vickers Elite Battlesights. Rear U-notch and green fiber optic up front. Super nice upgrade from the cheap factory Glock sights. I also swapped the mag release over to the Tangodown/Vickers extended mag catch. That's another great addition, as its way more pronouced over the stock mag catch. It has the original box with all the goodies, as well as 2 magazines. I'm sad I never got around to using it because it would make an awesome option for concealed carry.Asking $575 with a bill of sale. I'm located just North of Tampa, FL.

This Glock was purchased only a few months ago and has literally only had 50rds through it, all of which were American Eagle 180gr. brass FMJs. This thing is in superb condition and is basically brand new with no wear on the exterior and just the slightest bit on the inside.I installed a Tangodown/Vickers enhanced slide stop, as well as Tangodown/Vickers extended mag catch. These are leaps and bounds better than the stock factory Glock controls with regards manipulation and ease of use. Internally, it only has one minor modification. It's got a Zev tech v4 race connector inside of it. I did this to drop the weight of the trigger by the slightest amount. It's just barely noticeable but provides a little easier break when up against the wall of the trigger. I'll included the stock factory connector as well, in case you wanna swap that over at a later date. It comes with the original box and all the goodies, as well as 1 magazine. I'm looking to get $600 for everything with bill of sale. I'm located just North of Tampa, FL. Shoot me over an email through here for more high res pics of it, as Armslist has a max file size on them. Thanks!"
