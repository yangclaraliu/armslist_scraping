Finish has some speckling but other than one spot at the very back, no pitting and that isn't severe.   Given what I've seen of these over the years, I'd say it's 80-85% for 1929 gun.

It basically disappears in you pocket.The original LCP was designed for deep cover situations, with a very small size and streamlined outline to avoid snags, and is STILL the most carried pocket gun out there. The LCP 2 follows the same design principles, with a few improvements:It has better slide serrations, an improved grip, better sights, and an improved trigger over the standard LCP (including a trigger safety).I have the original box and all the original accessories still, including the pocket holster.I prefer to meet at Low Price Guns in Bellevue, but if you have another shop to do the FFL transfer that's not too far we could meet there.Buyer pays any FFL fee."

First I want to say this rifle functions as it should. It looks very nice with no wear, No jams, every round goes bang and it's as accurate as any ak. With the AK goes 4 tapco mags and a brand new unused 75 round Romanian drum I just paid 100.00 for. However There are two reasons why I have it priced so low and I want anyone interested to know everything about the rifle so we have a fair transaction with no uncertainty. I did not know when I bought this AK that the previous owner did some gun smithing on it to install the Zukarov hand guard on it. When I paid 45.00 for another handguard I can't now return I figured out that the retaining ring to keep most handguards on is no longer there. And the sling loop had been dremmled off to install the handguard. Also one of the screws on the handguard won't go back in because the threading is stripped in the handguard. Nevertheless the handguard is firm and secure. The second is very minor... After shooting about 200 rounds through the rifle the stock needs to be tightened. There are plenty of different stock options for the rifle as well as a few handguards but I'm calling it quits on this one because it is my only rifle. This would be a great inexpensive AK for someone that patiently can work on them or someone that doesn't care about these two issues. If interested text REDACTED 550.00 OBO thanks!"

This is the newest updated model with the ceramic bezel and the new ""h"" stainless steel bracelet.This watch comes complete with inner and outer boxes along with the case, pillow, signed warranty cards etc. It is the chronograph with date, it is an automatic and has a clear sapphire case back so you can see the beautiful automatic movement. It also features their stainless deployment clasp. The cards are signed and the watch has been registered, which means the watch is protected under the Tag Heuer warranty until May 2017. It shows absolutely zero ewear/scratches/etc as it was worn maybe once. I am selling it as new with tags though because it is in new condition and has everything you would get from Moodys. Retail is over $5,500. Check eBay to compare prices with what I'm asking as you'll see my price is very fair for a complete set with signed warranty cards that guarantees authenticity and that it is under warranty. The exact model is: Tag Heuer Carrera 1887 car2a10 ba0799I may consider paypal/shipping as I have used paypayl for like 10 years and know the difference between a scam and a legit buyer. $2,650 is my cash price (cheapest deal you will ever find anywhere) for trdes though I still need a $3k valuation."
