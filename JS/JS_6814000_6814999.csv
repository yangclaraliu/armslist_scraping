Individual Carbine
The LWRCI IC PSD | Individual Carbine- Personal Security Detail weapon delivers  rifle cartridge firepower in a size usually reserved for sub machine guns.  The IC PSD s designed to be an ultra compact personal defense weapon. 

Directly descended from the rifles developed by LWRC to meet the requirements for the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program, the IC-PDW is built for high performance in an ultra compact configuration.  Its compact size and light weight means it can be carried and deployed in a variety of roles.   
Designed on the LWRCI Monoforge upper receiver with Modular 7"" Rail system allows the shooter to customize as needed.  With the slim modular handguards, the user has the ability to add rails where desired. At just 6.15 lbs, having the option of rails saves weight off of an already light rifle.

Like all IC models the IC-PDW is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws.
Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-PSD.  LWRCI Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard.  Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.  

Our IC-PSD uses LWRCI manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged compact 8.5"" barrel.   Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.  

The LWRCI IC-PSD comes complete with, LWRCI Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCI Adjustable Compact Stock, MagpulÂ® MOE+ Grip and LWRCI High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider.

Elegant in Blue and Stainless this small, single-action-only could be found under a cummerbund or a pair of bibs. It's what you have been asking for! No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come.Taurus Security System (TSS)Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

This is “old world craftsmanship” at its very best! After World War I, Germany was forbidden from manufacturing military firearms. FN, using Paul Mauser’s excellent design for the Model 1898, manufactured this model at their factory in Herstel, Belgium, one of the world’s great armories and where top grade Brownings are made today. There are Belgian proofmarks on the bolt handle and front receiver ring. Our example is serial number 5726 and that number appears on the stock, receiver and bolt handle. The barrel and most metal parts still retain about 99.5% of their original bright blue. The receiver and bolt are polished bright. The bore is mint and looks unfired, bright and shiny with razor sharp rifling. To top it off, there are lots of traces of original armory grease in protected areas. The bolt release lever is brilliantly fire blued. The front receiver ring is beautifully impressed with the Venezuelan coat of arms. The stock is absolutely beautiful and with its highly figured, deep honey color wood looks like it should be on a high grade hunting rifle. No cracks or splits with its entire original military finish remaining. All markings in the metal and wood are excellent. No import marks that I can find. The sights are in excellent condition and the front sight still retains its original protector. These short rifles are a joy to handle. With just a 23 inch barrel and 43 inches overall, they’re fast pointing and fun to shoot and ammo is easy to get! An about mint 1924/30 FN Venezuelan Mauser that would be a terrific addition to any military collection. Don’t miss out on this one!"

Stevens and Ammo Co. Model 520 12 ga. shotgun.  From what I've gathered it's pre wartime and the serial number is in the early 6000's.  Everything appears to be original with matching serial numbers.  The earliest serial number i've found on my searches is in the 11000's.  I'm looking to either trade this firearm for a rifle (7mm or 30.06 ish...) or sell it for around 400.  I just thought I could use a distance hunting rifle more than this gun.  I know there's some that are in not the greatest condition selling for 150 or so but I'd rather hold on to it if I can't get enough to replace it with the rifle.  I can send pics to anyone interested.

Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.Taurus Security System (TSS)sTaurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

Selling to get cash to buy a riding mower I'm looking at. Has had less than 200 rounds shot through. It has a spikes upper, surplus ammo and arms lower, and a DEZ ARMS 24"" 1x8 fluted/twisted barrel. Has a center point scope on it, a bipod, 45 degree offset sites, and one steel mag. I haven't shot the gun in a year, but it's very accurate. I had it hitting a 6"" steel plate at 300yards before I last put it in the safe. If you would like to shoot it we can meet at Buseik Park's gun range in Highlandville. It won't shoot cheap ammo however. I usually shoot 5.56 ammo out of it without any issues. If you have any questions email me with your phone number. I'm almost always in class or working so I'll txt you the first chance I get unless you'd prefer a call then just add that to the email. I would like to get $900 out of it OBO."

This beautiful boxlock 12 bore is one from the turn of the 20th century, manufactured around 1903, sn51-10. It is a wonderfully balanced,6 3/4lb. game gun with gorgeous and healthy damascus barrels stretching out to 29 1/2"". The engraving is superbly executed rose and scroll covering 70% of the action and an equal amount of the original case colors. The action has four locking mechanisms, including a Greener style cross bolt, double underlug bites, with additional stability provided by a through action barrel lug and side clips. The butt stock is contained at the head of the stock in nicely done rebates at the top of the frame. The triggers are crisp, and the trigger guard is case colored. The English style stock has been restored to perfection with a hand rubbed oil finish, nice figure, no cracks or repairs, and perfect wood to metal fit. The gun is stunning with sharp checkering and crisp damascus pattern on the barrels. It is easy to say this is a great value in a fine European masterpiece and would be at home at the clays range or in the field. One of the most ELEGANT 12 BORES WE HAVE HAD IN YEARS, and at a very affordable price! Thanks for looking."

I'm guessing you're either spammers or my mail is going to spam. If you've previously messaged me I suggest checking your spam folder. Like new, 50 rounds through it. Great shooter but just thinking of trading it down to get several other firearms instead. Comes with factory soft case, and all factory items. Will consider trades for other full size 45s plus cash, or $1K outright. Will also consider other calibers minus 40SW and may possibly consider firearms other than pistols. I have quite the extensive collection so it's easier for you just to send a potential trade than me listing what I'm interested in. Just shoot an email with your trade or cash offer and I'll get back to you. Thanks."
