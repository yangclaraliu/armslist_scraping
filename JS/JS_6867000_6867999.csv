True custom shop gun not a worked SP-01. Comes with factory box, test target. Less than 1k rounds down the pipe. Only flaw on the pistol is the grips have a shiny spot on the right side from draws. Will include a pair of hard rubber grips I have laying around. This pistol is incredibly accurate and smooth shooting, no issues whatsoever. I have two of them and this one is just hanging out."

No trades, and please don’t ask me if I’ll take one hundred dollars for it. Serious inquiries must include your name and address. While this type of arm can be sent to almost anywhere in the U.S., there are a few urban locations that are prohibited, so if Cabela’s or any other major chain can’t ship you a black powder arm, neither can I.

There seems to have been a desire by Gabilondo for a clean break with the Ruby brand, given the adverse reputation that wartime Ruby-type pistols acquired (the majority of which, ironically, were not even manufactured by Gabilondo). These were based on the Colt M1911 and later the improved Colt model 1911-A1 model of 1924, but without the grip safety. Very early models were advertised in .45 ACP, 9mm Largo and 7.63mm Mauser. The Llama IV was the first numbered model to appear, and unusually, it was advertised as having a ""tolerant chamber"" capable of firing .38 ACP and 9 mm largo rounds interchangeably. The Llama V was chambered for 9mm Largo 38 acp, and 38 super, for sale in the US. The Llama VII was chambered for 9mm Largo and 38 acp and came it two different versions, a regular 5"" length barrel and the Extra with a 5 1/2"" barrel. There are reports of a Llama being bought by the British in 1944 for use by the S.O.E. but which gun cannot be confirmed if it actually happened.Llama III-AConcurrent with the release of these large models, Gabilondo replaced the Danton with the Llama I and Llama II. The Llama I was manufactured from 1933 to 1954 and resembled a miniature copy of Colt 1911 in 7.65 mm/.32 ACP. As a locked breach was unnecessary for a pistol in this calibre, it was eliminated, as was the grip safety. Similar to previous Gabilondo models it had a nine-round magazine. The Llama II was manufactured from 1933 to 1954, The Llama II was chambered in 9 mm corto/.380ACP with an eight-round magazine and without grip safety. The Llama III was introduced with a grip safety, locked breech and continued to be made until 1954. It was made in the same calibre and magazine capacity.[6] Refer to http://www.carbinesforcollectors.com/llamapage.html for accurate pictures of the guns. Llama never made a Stainless Steel gun as some report them to be, they are all chrome plated either bright or Satin."

Like all IWI firearms, it was developed in close cooperation with elite units of the Israel Defense Force, tailored to their specific requirements and needs. Taking cues from the Tavor TAR-21 issued to the IDF, the X95 continues the evolution of the modern bullpup CQB rifle. Slim and compact with a 13” barrel and an OAL of 22.8”, it is offered in 5.56 NATO, easily converted to 9mm Luger Parabellum and soon to .300 AAC. The X95 features STANAG magazine compatibility, forefinger ambidextrous magazine release, interchangeable pistol grip assemblies and a tri-rail forearm with removable rail covers for easily customizable accessory placement (flashlight, laser, vertical fore grip, bipod, etc.). Like its predecessor the TAR-21, the X95 is 100% ambidextrous to right or left hand operation with the optional opposite hand bolt.   Rifle is brand new. Does not come with accessories. Sold as is. Buyer is responsibly for pick up, or shipping cost."

In 1965, the U.S. Navy commissioned a version of the S&W Model 39 that could take the 13-round magazine of the Browning Hi-Power. In early 1970, a dozen experimental all-stainless-steel prototypes were made and were issued to Navy SEAL commandos for evaluation in the field. The firearm was not adopted. The Model 59 went on the market in 1971.[1][2] It went out of production a decade later in 1980 when the improved second generation series was introduced (the Model 459)."

For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find EL CEN series 1911 38 super, Detective Specials, Snake guns such as unfired enhanced Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda , unfired Colt Python , and other Python guns that are in great shape, royal plus, stainless, and nickel.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), Pre-lock Lady Smith revolver, 686 no dash, pre-lock 29-3 combat, chiefs special cs-9 like new, a couple of performance revolvers.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

Thank you for your time and have a good day. I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find EL CEN series 1911 38 super, Detective Specials, Snake guns such as unfired enhanced Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda , unfired Colt Python , and other Python guns that are in great shape, royal plus, stainless, and nickel.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), Pre-lock Lady Smith revolver, 686 no dash, pre-lock 29-3 combat, chiefs special cs-9 like new, a couple of performance revolvers.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

For the right trade I might have some ammo to go with it. Started its life as a 300 WinMag but decided to go bolder. Incredibly smooth ... and terribly accurate. Guaranteed 0.5MOA if you do your job right. After ""transformation"" we shot only 20 rds to sero the scope and properly break the barrel. Because it is so heavy it is pleasurable to shoot.

Aimpoint CompM4 Official US Army M68CCO Red Dot Sight 30mm Tube 1x 2 MOA Dot with Picatinny-Style Mount Matte
 
Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock.
