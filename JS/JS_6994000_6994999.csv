The Tula Bakelite mag is not included but can be purchased  separately if desired. The Tula bayonet is  not for sale but used to show the bayonet lug is still intact on the rifle and was not ground off prior to importation.

Comes with orginial Maddi thumb hole stock as well.The wood was imported from Finland. Do your research on these. The rifle  is in excellent condition to be 23 years old. No Century junk or mismatched parts or crappy cast  parts here. All parts are # to the gun including the dust cover. CHF barrel bolt and bolt carrier. The barrel is bright and shinny with no wear and the bolt and carrier have just normal wear. Has Egyptian crown right below rear sight. The wood is in excellent condition. Comes with Maadi military issued green sling and Maadi blue grip. Looks navy blue inside but turns neon blue outside in sunlight. Also butt stock cleaning kit and factory manual. 30 round Egyptian steel mag also. If you want to try it before you buy or trade no problem just bring your own ammo. Thanks for looking.

What I have (according to S&W and a couple of other sources) is a 38 Military & Police Airweight. Some, including myself, would refer to it as a Pre-Model 12 but I have been rapped smartly on the knuckles for that. The serial number is C3523xx and it was made in 1955. The serial number is on the bottom of the grip, the rear of the cylinder and on the inside of the right grip It’s a four screw rather than a three or five.. The cylinder and barrel are steel and the frame is lightweight. There is some small bluing loss on the muzzle and on the bottom front of the frame and the top of the sight channel on the right side. I think that’s holster wear.   It’s in 38 S&W Special.  Shipping included except to AK.  I will not ship to NY, MD, CT, CA, HI or PR or anywhere else that restricts like the aforementioned."

The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever.

Some are quality knives that I'm asking half of retail for--and the rest are some that I'll likely try to throw in for free if you buy something from me. Tops BoB fieldcraft. Bought a few years ago, but never even clipped to my belt.  $100Benchmade SOCP. Tip has some wear, but the rest is in good condition. $80Ka-bar with kydex sheath. Blade has a few dings, but that hasn't prevented it from being my trusty bedside knife for years. $40Leatherman Wave. Trusty multitool in good condition (in the picture I forgot to take it out of the leather pouch). $75SOG tomahawk in not the best condition (still sharp). $10Cold Steel kukri machete. Great condition. $5Camillus carnivore machete. The most used. $5Cold Steel Double Agent 2 neck knife. $5The other three are Gerber, Buck, and S&W. Not worth much separately, but $5 gets them all. At my listed price, that'd be $325 for them all. But if you bundle, I'll cut the price down. Say $280 for them all (that's around than the price of a new fieldcraft and SOCP)"

Chambered in 7x57mm MauserReceiver marked ""Fabrika de Armas Oviedo 1914"" I believe 1914 is the manufacture date.Looks like an older sporterization, many of these were sporterized in the 1950's by large dealers/distributors for resale, I think this is one of those. Barrel has been shortened to about 22.5 inches, stock cut down, bolt handle bent, and a black enamel type finish applied to most of the blued parts.Mechanically fine, feeds and cycles rounds alright, but I have never fired it.Stock has a pretty decent crack behind the receiver tang as pictured. There's also a chip off the top of the stock next to the bolt handle (also pictured) Would make a nice project, basically needs refinished and a stock repair (or new stock)Bore is dark, would probably benefit from a good cleaningI have another sporterized stock available that is a little longer than this one (still not full length), but not cracked and in decent shape that I'll include for another $40. Would probably require some minor fitting. let me know if you want pics of it.Prefer to meet at Field & Stream Easton or somewhere near thereAsking $160 cash or best offer."
