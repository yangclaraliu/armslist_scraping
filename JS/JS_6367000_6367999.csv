This firearm transfers as a PGO (Pistol Grip Only)/Other on the 4473 that you fill out at your dealer. DO NOT install a shoulder stock or a shorter length pistol grip on this firearm! If proper paperwork is not filed with the ATF Prior to doing so this would be a violation of Federal Law punishable by up to 10 years in prison! Description: A 14"" Mossberg 500 12 Gauge that's NOT considered a Short-Barreled Shotgun or an AOW! The Asylum Weaponry AW500 (The Gatekeeper) was built on a Mossberg 500 Cruiser Pistol Grip only Firearm. The overall length of the firearm is 26 1/2"". This is achieved by using a complete 14"" front end from a Mossberg 590A1 and a Shockwave Technologies birds head grip to get to the 26 1/2"" overall length. The Mossberg 500 Cruiser (50588) that this firearm is made from ships from Mossberg with a pistol-grip already installed and a 20"" barrel. By definition of what the ATF considers a shotgun the original firearm was never a shotgun despite it's ability to fire shotgun shells. This firearm is considered an ""other"" because in order to fit the definition of a shotgun it must have been manufactured with a shoulder stock in order to be ""fired from the shoulder"". Therefor it cannot be considered a ""sawn-off"" shotgun either as it never met the ATF's criteria to be a shotgun in the first place. Since this firearm is not a shotgun, it is not required to have at least an 18"" barrel. Also the overall length exceeds 26"" therefor it cannot be classified as a AOW (Any Other Weapon) which would require a tax stamp and Class III registration with the ATF."

So the parkerized finish is pretty gnarly from the police shot gun rack, but other than that, it is a flawlessly functioning workhorse. If you’re in the market from an 870, this one is the real deal, nothing like the cheap crap that is being produced today such as the “870 Tactical” or the “870 Express.” I added the magpul furniture myself, which is about $150 give or take. And in addition to the original hard traditional shotshell holder which it came with, it’s coming pre setup with Velcro that is stuck to the side, and to the buttstock; to attach two SOE Gear 6 shell shotshell carriers. Which is by far the most superior method for carrying ammo onboard a shotgun. And just to clean house, I will include an entire 50cal ammo can full of lose Estate 9 pellet 00 Buck, and several boxes of Federal Law Enforcement Hydra-Shok slugs, and Federal Law Enforcement Flight Control 9 pellet 00 Buck as well.

This is ready to go on your pistol lower. Was going to use for my pistol build, but decided to do a 300 BLK instead. My loss, your gain. Info from Adams Arms:The 5.56 Carbine Tactical Evo 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The piston system will give you the benefits of less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 7"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.Specifications:Upper Receiver: A4 Flat-Top, ForgedBarrel Length: 11.5""Barrel Contour: GovernmentBarrel Material: 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium SteelMuzzle Thread Pattern: 1/2""-28Chrome Lined: NoBarrel Finish: QPQ Melonite / Black NitrideTwist Rate: 1 in 7""Chamber: 5.56x45mm NATOM4 Feed Ramps: YesBolt Carrier: 1-Piece w/Integral Piston Strike FaceMuzzle Device: A2 Flash HiderGas System Length: Carbine, Short Stroke Piston OperatedGas Block Diameter: 0.750""Handguard: Evolution RailSights: None, Single Rail Gas BlockWeight: 4.162 lbs"

For those not already familiar, this is an all-stainless steel, 5-shot, snub nosed, double-action revolver chambered in .357 magnum (but also shoots the less expensive and lower recoil .38 special.) The pistol is very clean, very low miles, and functions 100% as it should.  Included is a basic zippered/padded soft case, and the walnut grip inserts (seen in the photo) made by ChigsGrips, as well as the factory original black plastic inserts and screw.  Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be a legal Georgia resident over age 21, with ID. As always, I'll show my GDL and Georgia carry permit.  Please respond with enough detail that I can tell you're a legitimate local buyer instead of another scammer, or I'll just ignore the message. If the ad is still up, then I still have the pistol !!  So, brief messages like, ""you still got the gun?"" will be ignored. (This now includes, ""what's the least you'll take"" and my new favorite, ""will U trade for a 9 that holds 16?"" ) Sorry for the bad attitude, but this site has nearly been ruined by scammers and/or jerk-offs, and I'm tired of responding just to give them my contact info.Thanks for looking......( This is a killer deal, so price is firm. Need the money for another toy, so no trade interests. And yes, I did do a high polish job on it. You're welcome !!)"

Reciever and trigger group is off of a savage 111 Hog Hunter. Has a 26 Inch Mcgowen Precision Barrel with a PRS 338 Lapua brake on the end (Still works wonders for reducing recoil, gun kicks like a 243 at the most). Stock is a MDT LSS with a Mako Group Adjustable Buttstock. I ended up building this gun myself from the action up and turned out very well. Gun shoots 1 MOA or less, and have fired about 200 rounds without any issues. Note that I am not including the scope in the deal for the listed price, unless somebody wants it. Its a vortex 4-16 FFP scope worth 600-700 so figure add about that to the list price. However, Alot of other extras are included. Comes with 1 Accuracy International mag, and 2 Magpul Mags, all 5 rounders. Have about 80 rounds of factory ammo, about 70 Rounds of HAndloads (Mix of 208gr ELD-m's and 168 gr HPBT's). Also have about 100 pieces of fired Brass which I can turn into loaded ammo given I get a few hours to do it. So Presumably, about 250rds will be included with this. Also has a bipod and will throw in a case for it. If interested, I also have a set of reloading dies for it, as well as a barrel wrench and headspacing kit if You ever want to change out the barrel on it. Barrel should be good for another 1000-1500 rounds or so. Reason I am selling is to get money to put towards a vehicle, and possibly upgrade to a 338 Lapua or something similar. NJ Buyers prefered, must have Matching NJ DL and Firearms ID. Out of state buyers within a reasonable distance must be willing to meet at an FFl to do the transfer. Sorry no shipping, too many scammers on this site to risk it. Also, Any trade offers let me know, but most likely will only consider an upgrade to the platform I am listing here. Asking 1250 Firm, or 1800 with the scope included"
