Shoots true, brass drops out the bottom, never fead corrosive primers or weird surplus / import rounds, goes bang.Straight talk: This is a Calico, not a Calicoshnikov . Its got its quirks. It may not like your hand loads. It might complain about out of spec brass. It takes exactly - precicely 23 turns on the magazine spring for 100 rounds, and absolutely no other number than 10 turns for 50 rounds. It may attract attention at the range.

The LeMat revolver is a truly unique design which incorporates a 44cal 9 shot revolver with a single shot 20ga. barrel. This “double barrel” revolver quickly became associated with the Confederacy when soldiers started using them during the civil war. Other unique features on the LeMat revolvers were the lever at the end of the hammer which would let you select which barrel you wanted to shoot out of and the pivoting ramrod on the side of the gun which would swivel to allow you to ram both barrels. This revolver, as the name states, was design as a tribute to the soldiers of the Confederacy. 24 karat gold and nickel were used for the design work. Along the right side of the barrel, “The Museum of the Confederacy Tribute” is in a classic banner tipped in matching scrollwork. Each Tribute’s individual edition number is featured on top of the barrel near the sight. This one is #? not sure I can not open the display of 500 ever made. The cylinder holds the portraits of three of the Confederacy’s favorite sons. Right side features Confederate General Robert E. Lee, and the left side features Cavalry Major General J.E.B. Stuart. Both are surrounded by flowing scrollwork and crossed rifles of the Confederate Infantry. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, is featured on top of the cylinder. The frame of the Tribute is adorned on both sides with a Confederate flag displayed within a field of scrollwork. The “CS”, or Confederate States, belt buckle is featured on the breech of the barrel. The official seal of the Museum of the Confederacy is also featured on the smoothbore shotgun barrel, surrounded by matching scrollwork. The condition of the revolver is all of 99% with only one tiny mark on the backstrap shown below, some light marks from where the ramrod locks into place, and a small dark spot in the bluing by the hammer which looks to be from the factory and was impossible to get to show in a picture. The revolver comes in a lined custom display case with an engraved brass identification plaque. This revolver is only one of 500 ever made so the chance of coming across another one in this condition would be almost impossible."

The stock incorporates a selector switch that, when mounted, allows selective fire. Cyclic rate of fire for the three-round burst is 2200 rounds per minute. When not mounted, the stock acts as a holster. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. In lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post. Contrary to a common misconception, the VP70 does indeed have a manual safety. It is the circular button located immediately behind the trigger and is a common crossblock safety."
