The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip.

The Wylde chambering was developed to bring out the inherent accuracy of the .223 Remington that was commonly lost with AR chamberings in 5.56 NATO, because of the slightly longer throat. The Wylde chambering allows you to fire both .223 Remingtion and 5.56mm Nato ammunition. This rifle has never been fired and features a chrome moly HBAR barrel with 1:8"" twist and MFT flip-up rear sight. With the 1:8"" rifling, heavier bullets such as the 69 grain match bullets are stabilized. I am located in Bedford.  If this ad is up the rifle is still for sale. Thanks!"

The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. The USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. It hs an ambidextrous magazine release and universal mounting grooves for mounting accessories. Variant 1 is a double action/single action with ""SAFE"" position. The control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) is on the left side of frame. This model comes with two (2) magazines.

The HK45 adds front end grip serrations on the slide, a Picatinny rail, and an O-ring polygonal barrel for increased accuracy and more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling. HK's unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces recoil by as much as 30%, and the polymer frame with a textured ergonomic grip allows the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to recoil management and greater control of the weapon. This pistol features interchangeable backstraps, 3-dot sights, and an extended ambidextrous slide release. The HK45 has ambidextrous controls, enabling the control lever to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol (additional parts required); for true ambidextrous use, a control lever can be mounted on each side of the pistol. The HK45 has been extensively tested and operationally proven, and it is well-suited for personal defense use.

Sometimes it’s a brand new idea – like the XD®. Other times innovation is the fine-tuning of a classic – like the EMP®. How could the enduring design that is the 1911 be improved? Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be. The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there. If you’re looking for a 1911 to carry with you every day, look no further than the Springfield Armory® EMP®. Sometimes innovation changes everything.
