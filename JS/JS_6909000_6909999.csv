I’ve fired exactly 250 rounds (150 FMJ and 100 JHP); it’s a great carry size and is very shootable and accurate, with Sig’s well-known reliability. I stumbled across this 9mm version at Gander Mountain after a Sig rep told me they were only making them in .40/.357 Sig. When I called back, he said it was a “very limited production run” of the 9mm model. Only reason I’m selling is because I bought the same pistol in .40 SAS for carry, so this one’s available.No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga."

Comes with 3 mags new foregrip and flip up sights. Palmetto State Amory KS47 is based off of the Ar15 and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the the stopping power and the magazine options of an AK. While the current Ar47 rifle fires the 7.62x39 round, it uses modified AR style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful more expensive and less reliable as the AK style magazine for the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 allows a shooter to capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver the KS47 features the AR style modular configuration wich consist of a upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins.    Text REDACTED anytime"

When the last round in a magazine is fired, the slide locks open telling you the mag is empty.The TCP is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a very smooth trigger. Its light weight (10.2 oz.) with a comfortable grip makes it an outstanding concealed carry gun. It's easy to pocket carry and just disappears in your pocket or purse.  It’s identical in size to the Ruger LCP but feels a bit softer to shoot than the LCP.The full package for each TCP comes with everything that came with the gun from the factory: original box (matching serial number), Taurus locking system with key, all paperwork, and the 6-round magazine supplied by Taurus.  I’ve also included an extra factory mag that I had purchased (first buyer gets it), plus I’ve added a Talon Grip to the TCP we’ve shot for increased control and comfort. Each TCP comes with a pocket carry holster.The Taurus lifetime warranty travels with each gun, not just with the original owner.  I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas, without shipping. I’m in College Station so the triangle formed by Austin, DFW, and Houston is OK.  Maybe we can meet half-way to reduce driving time.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TX driver’s license or permit.If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.The new, never-shot TCP is $250 and the used TCP with the Talon Grip is $200.  Take your pick, or buy them both (his and hers?) for $400. I don’t really need low-ball offers, and cash price is firm.  Thanks!"

Ak47 made in Romania, Model is ROMAK 1/CUGIR/WUM-1. With folding wire stock, picatinny foregrip, hogue pistol grip and safety modified for a bolt catch. Barrel end has jacked up threads and will not accept a muzzle brake, however it doesn’t affect the barrel crown. Shoots huge groups at 300 yards (Romy AK with imported steel cased ammo… not surprising). Barrel, trunnion, and frame are straight. Also it includes a sweet olive drab and brown tiger stripe rattle can paint job. This is an excellent shooter and of all the Romanian Ak patterns I’ve had, for whatever reason it’s been my favorite.
This rifle also includes 8 various steel magazines, one polymer magpul mag (the gen 1, without steel reinforcements) and two shitty steel promags that I wouldn’t advise using… maybe stoppage training or something, but they’re legit the worst.
Price is $475. Unfortunately I will not accept trades and buyer must sign a bill of sale for my records.
It may also include: 1515 rounds of various tulammo, wolf, tiger, and red army steel cased ammo that is hp, fmj, sealed, lacquered, 123 gr. As well as 20 rounds of norinco pre ban steel core. If you purchase them all with the rifle I will sell them for 19 cents a round ($292).
