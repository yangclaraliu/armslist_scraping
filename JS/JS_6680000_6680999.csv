This pistol comes with everything straight from Ed Brown (bag, mag, lock, hang tag, etc.). This is a standard build. Condition is excellent. I have not fired the pistol during my ownership. Previous owner bought this new around 2010 (sights have 09 date) and claimed to have not fired it. I cannot fully confirm this but I do not doubt his claims after inspecting the pistol. The pistol is in top notch condition. Night sights are more than adequate. Pistol will also come with NIB unused slimline black Alumagrips and associated bushings and blues hex screws which were put on the pistol last month.  Pistol has been in my safe unused since I acquired it in January. Price is $2295.  Can meet in downtown Dallas or Waxahachie.  I can be reached via text at 806.5seven6.six17six."

Most sellers would list this revolver as new old stock, although we feel this revolver is well above most you will find outside box is not with tears and tape and since its 35 years old the pickiest of inspections may find something not to perfection so its being offered as used. Some sellers buy replacement boxes and transfer labels to make them look better we do not operate that way. The internal foam box is excellent and the paperwork is complete.

I've owned a few of them and have never had a single issue. It's as close to new as you can get without actually being unfired. I purchased this on 3/19/17, only put 30 rounds (two mags) through it and it's been sitting in the box since then. Comes with the box, paperwork, 2 mags, everything it came with new. Also comes with an unused Safariland ALS holster (best in the business!) that's about 4 days old. Asking $550 firm for this. Cash is always king. Looking for a Gray or FDE VP9 for trade, but open to all other offers so shoot me a text and let me know what you have. Absolutely NO .40's, Glocks, 1911's, shotguns, AR-15's, bolt actions, or black powder. Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED or sending me an email on here at any time.FTF only, 18+ with Purchase Permit or CPL required.

It has at least 1000 rounds fired through it and they were all low power, light weight lead using bullseye powder. I can provide as many pictures as you need and meet you to look it over.

Aero Precision Lower with Anderson LPK, Magpul PRS Rifle Length Stock, Magpul Grip, Magpul Trigger Guard. Sabre Defense Upper, 24"" Super Stainless/Blacked Flutted BB, Sampson Evolution Free Float Rail, Harris Bipod. Comes with 5 Lancer 20Rd Mags, and 100rds of ammo. A plano case and gun lock also included.The scope shown here is no longer installed. It's now equiped with a Sagitarius 10-40x56 from TacVecotor Optics with sunshade/glare-mesh cover to be included as well. 310 total rounds fired and this is by far and away the most accurate gun I've ever owned. It's literally boring to shoot after a few consecutive cloverleafs at 100yds. You have to take it out further to really enjoy it. With a muzzle velocity of 4,225FPS, that's 2,880MPH or MACH3.75, it is the SR-71 Blackbird of cartidges. Another way to think of it is 0-600yds in 1sec. That said, it's basicly the mother of all varmint sniper rifles, though you could hunt much bigger animals if you wanted. This cartridge has been used to hunt animals like deer and even black bears, but I wouldn't recommend the latter. No recoil worth speaking of and a beautiful gun from end to end.

All rounds are 147 grain JHPs, stored in cool, dark conditions. 200rds Speer Gold Dot 147gr. All but 50rds are in boxes due to one box getting smushed. 100rds Federal HST 147gr. Like the Gold Dot, a premier defensive round. 100rds Winchester WWB 147gr. A cheaper round than the others, so use this for practice. 50rds Winchester Silvertip 147gr. A classic round. 7 rounds Winchester SXT 147gr. Partial box left over from practice. Good stuff, and just the right number of rounds for a full mag for your subcompact 9mm. Selling as one lot for $150, and the ammo can goes with it all. If you want a box or two, the price is still $150, but you get a bunch of free ammo and a can to store it all in. Go in with some buddies and split it all up afterwards. Local to middle Tennessee, cash only, no trades."

Its basically brand new I got it as a gift mounted it to a AR15 and ended up taking it off without firing a shot and went a different route. I'm selling for 175 which is a fantastic deal it's just sitting around collecting dust and I'd like to get something for it. I have the original box it came in and everything that came inside it including warranty card. This would be perfect for a AR or a lever gun because of how small and light it is. The scope mount is NOT included and I'm firm on the price so don't lowball me it's more than reasonable I'm in the Mt. Holly area. Trades may be considered

In the box with it was a receipt from 1986 from when they tried having the stock repaired, so it had been sitting since then. I replaced the stock with a Richards micro fit dual grip thumbhole with ebony tip and cap and upgraded recoil pad ($450 stock). I also had the stock glass bedded. This is by far the smoothest action I have ever felt. Blueing is great with a mirror finish. I am selling only because I would like a nice 20 gauge over under and with 4 kids I need to sell something to buy something and this is the only gun in my safe I dont use.  Leupold base and rings included. Must have permit to purchase or CCW$800 with out scope. Add $250 if you want the scope with it.Trade for stainless Ruger handguns and revolvers.Or would consider a trade for a nice 20 gauge O/U like a Beretta Silver Pigeon or Onyx or a Ruger Red Label 20"

I am limited on photos here but I do have more available upon request.This pistol is in excellent condition and has spent most of its life in a holster or as a custom work display model. That said, it does have some of the wear you would expect from a pistol that is being carried and shot. It has only been carried for about 2 months and had a few hundred rounds of good ammo through it. I keep my guns clean and properly lubed as needed. The pistol works great every time I get it out to the range. Please, only contact me if you are interested in buying and you have a CPL or PP. I will take down your CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for you. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them.I am asking $900 for everything included with this and will throw in some ammo as well. This price may seem high but it is well under the cost of the pistol with the parts that are included and work that has been done. This is an extremely nice Glock 19! I will entertain a trade with cash for items listed below. I really am looking to sell for cash but if you have something for trade, make me an offer. I would be willing to remove the Zev Technologies Ultimate Trigger and the Trijicon Ameriglo I Dot night sights and provide the original parts at a discounted price.If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.

I believe this design was licensed to Cobra Arms who now manufactures this weapon.   An EXCELENT FIREARM!!!  Perfect for concealed carry and/or a ""car gun"".  The gun works perfectly.  Comes with one factory mag (6+1), but it takes standard 1911 mags, so you can get higher capacity if you wish.  I've been around firearms my whole life and I don't know of a smaller or lighter 45 cal pistol. The design and disassembly is very simple and almost identical to that of a Kel-Tec. It's almost like a ""45 cal Kel-Tec 3AT""    Double action only with a long/hard trigger pull so it's perfect for self defense and, if you carry cambered, accidental discharge is less likely.  I'll also include a small holster.Looking to trade for something a little smaller as I already have a 45. Perhaps a 380 or 9mm Keltec or similar.   Please Text Me: REDACTED"
