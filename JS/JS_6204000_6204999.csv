Versatile enough for western big game hunters or eastern whitetail hunters.  The Predator Series was made for hunters who demand all-around capability in their optics - mobility without weight, ease of use and bright picture in any light. With its lightweight roof prism design, game-revealing CAT™ (color adjusted transmission) coatings and excellent low-light performance, this is the perfect choice for turkey hunters, bowhunters, black powder enthusiasts and anyone who hunts the early season or in heavy cover.Steiner OTAL-C Close Quarter Battle Laser - The OTAL-C is  the “classic”  version of this offset tactical aiming laser. Rugged and compact, the OTAL-C laser is used by military and law enforcement agencies worldwide and has developed a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.  It mounts behind the front sight on M-4 style rifles and the laser is offset to project around the front sight.  The compact design minimizes weight and the low profile makes it easy to mount in front of scopes, holographic sights or night-vision devices."

Most replacement parts are russian/bulgarian standard. Russian plum handguards + fixed plum stock w/ russian cleaning kit inset. Plum grip is US made I believe. Cold hammer forged bulgarian barrel and stamped receiver which has two rivets beneath the chamber instead of one in their newer 74' models. 922r Compliant.
If you total up all the crap I listed I got around 2,050 into this thing. Price is fair and firm given the rifle's cosmetic wear as the de-bans typically go for upwards of $900 and up.All in all this is a semi-unicorn AK-74 that was manfactured late 2006 or early 2007, so yes it's seen it's thousand rounds already. Most of the wear is cosmetic due to crappy commie paint and after alot of firing it's been broken in. No signs of keyhole shots. Original serials on internals matched, if it looks sketchy it's because it was hand engraved when Arsenal was a smaller company. Original single-stage trigger for faster shooting.
All in all this is a semi-unicorn AK-74 that was manfactured late 2006 or early 2007. While it was gunsmithed to accept fun devices it is still a decent rifle.Included with rifle in package: - http://imgur.com/a/fKW7bOptics:- PK-01v Russian 1.5 MOA Red Dot w/ original bag + zeroing card in pinko commie translation.

The upper and lower were originally Nickle boron.  If I had the outside of the upper and lower cerakoted black so it didnt have bling.  The inside of both the upper and lower are still nickle boron coated and super slick.  Cleaning is a breeze. The BCG is also Nib.  The barrel was originally stainless but has been cerakoted black as well.  It also has an Elftman adjustable match trigger installed that is currently set at 3.75lbs ( single stage).  The optic is mounted in Warne rings properly torqued.  The optic itself is a vortex razor hd gen2 3-18x with the ebr2c illuminated miliradian reticle.For the right deal I'll throw in a few hundred rounds of matchgrade ammo, Plano hard case with foam plucked, I also have thousands of surpluss .308 and roughly 15 mags.  Email to discuss a package deal or a price with the extras youd like.I am in no hurry to sell.  Lowball offers will be ignored.  I do not need to sell but would like to use the cash to partially fund begining another small hobby business.  I have no problem keeping it.  Serious inquiries only please."

Also note on the image of the bottom of the upper receiver, you will see ""PWS"" and then a blurred area after those three letters, since PWS puts an identification number on these uppers, so you can be assured they are the real deal and not some knock off. I refer you directly to PWS site: http://primaryweapons.com/store/product/mk111-upper-mod-2/ Also, VERY IMPORTANT: I am not being condescending here (after all, we did not know all this stuff at one time, either) you must understand the firearms laws very clearly, it is your responsibility to understand what the Federal, State and local laws are, and this is NOT a ""standard"" complete carbine upper assembly, as the barrel length of this upper is LESS than 16"". It can be mounted on a lower built as an “ AR pistol with the proper buffer tube or arm brace installed.  If mounted on a lower receiver with a  stock  the lower receiver must be registered with ATF as a Short Barreled Rifle, as this rifle barrel is only 11.85"" in length, and, among other criteria, any rifle with a barrel of less than 16"" is considered a National Firearms Act firearm."
