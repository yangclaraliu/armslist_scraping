All external parts have been reblued with the same black hued reblue throughout and professionally assembled. The gun is mechanically fine with all moving parts functioning smoothly. The blueing job is very professional, but you can see that there is some very minor pitting underneath the new reblue throughout. The bore is in quite clean and in excellent condition with sharp rifling. Underneath the barrel was stamped ""7.63 Germany"" at some point and now it is basically faded from the refinish. There were some other letters I can't make out even in lots of lighting as well that are faded. The gun has adjustable rear sights.  I would rate the reblue as 95%+ throughout. It looks nearly excellent. The box shows some discoloration to the finish. This pistol should make for a fine shooter. Upon this sale, I am able to meet within 15 miles of 90505 for PPT.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.  HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.  The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.  The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.  Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.  A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.  The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.   The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.  HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.  The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.  Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

Manufactured in '03. This 16ga variant was only manufactured for 4 years until Remington decided once and for all to discontinue making their 16ga shotguns. That said, this generation of 16ga Wingmasters dwarf in numbers to the others, making these pretty hard to come by, and collectible. I had a hard time finding the same model for sale online, found lots of the older ones, but not many of these—however, I have watched them sell for upwards of 1K on Gunbroker in the past.This particular model has a vent rib barrel, removable chokes, dual action bars, dual bead sights, gold trigger, polished blue metal, and high gloss walnut furniture. I received this shotgun in a trade and had planned to use it to shoot clay pigeons with my grandpa, but don't get out there as often as I'd like, and he supplies 20ga shells. 16ga is widely considered to be the best upland round ever made, and ammo isn't hard to find—my neighborhood Walmart carries it.she includes a couple boxes of shells, magazine plug, and the set of Rem-Chokes.its a VERY nice gun, but think I'd rather get into a nice bolt action.

The Tavor is a superb rifle, with excellent design, ergonomics, fit/finish.  ShootingSight has designed the ideal trigger to go with it.  
In chosing the best trigger for a battle rifle, we took a cue from the greatest battle rifle ever devised: the M1 Garand.  The M1 has a superb 2-stage trigger.  It is robust, but keeps the crispness and accuracy of a two-stage trigger pull. 
The M1 concept was married with tool steel, CNC machining, and aerospace surface coatings.  The result is the TAV-D, a 2-stage trigger which is robust, smooth, and crisp.
Features:
· 2-stage, giving a predictable glass like break. 
· 3lb first stage, 5lb total pull
· Machined from heat treated plate tool steel, for superior metal grain structure.
· Housing CNC machined from billet aluminum and Mil-Spec hardcoat anodized.
· Ultra hard / low friction surface coating allows lube free operation in dirty / tactical environments.
· Polished and honed sear surfaces for butter-smooth pull.
· Drop in trigger pack is fully assembled.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).
The CZ 75 Kadet conversion kit is a separate accessory for the CZ 75/85 pistol series allowing the firing of .22 LR caliber cartridges.
The CZ 75 fitted with the Kadet .22LR conversion is the perfect training or plinking pistol with the slide weighted and balanced just like the CZ 75. The Kadet adapter features all-steel construction and an adjustable rear sight.
Included are 2 10-round magazines that fit flush with grips of the full size CZ 75 and SP-01 models.  The Kadet conversion kit will work on the CZ 75 full-size and compact models including the 75, 85, SP-01, 75 Compact, P-01, P-06,  and PCR, but note that the full-size magazines will extend out of the bottom of the shorter grips on these models. The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models. Pre-B model 75s may or may not function with the Kadet due to differing magwell dimensions.
The CMR-201 Rail Master® is a powerful and versatile laser sight designed to fit rail-equipped pistols, rifles and shotguns. The Rail Master locks onto Picatinny M1919 or Weaver-style accessory rails with Crimson Trace's Secure-Lock Technology™. Once locked on, it will not move under recoil or handling. The universal design of the Rail Master offers quick Instant Activation™ by simply ""tapping on"" and ""tapping off"" from either side with the ambidextrous activation control tabs. Additionally, the CMR-201 features a 5 minute auto-shut off feature that will power down the unit to conserve battery life if the laser sight is unintentionally activated.
Versatile and flexible, the CMR-201 laser sight includes four (4) different inserts to adapt to various firearm platforms. The unit features a powerful 5mW red laser that will run for over four (4) hours on a single 1/3N Lithium battery. Rail Master is factory sighted at 50', but is fully user adjustable for windage and elevation.In addition, bag, cleaning kit, glasses, ear plugs, 2 (500 ea) boxes of 22 LR ammo, speedloader, and extra clip for 22 conversion."
