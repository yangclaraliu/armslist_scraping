I have over 1000 rounds and would like to sell all at once. Here is the description of the ammo from the website I purchased these from.""The open-tipped rounds until now have been available only to Special Operations Command troops. The first 200,000 7.62 Special Operations Science and Technology rounds are already downrange with Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan. SOCOM developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel, at 13.8 inches, is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine’s. Using an open-tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition, SOST rounds are designed to be “barrier blind,” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields, car doors and other objects."""

That's right , time to get yourself something nice. Because you know all your getting this year from the ones who really love you are just socks and underwear ...again... So why not treat yourself with something for those spicy tastebuds you've got reserved. Like some 223/5.56 Incendiary rounds. They're made right here in the greatest state of them all...KY. I've got some custom made incendiary rounds for your favorite AR-15 by ClarkCustomCartridge.com If you haven't checked our good buddy Chris out in Mayfield Ky or it's too far to drive, then shoot on over to his website and check out his wide range of custom rounds. He's got custom tracers and sporting ballistic tips for maximum hunting and of course INCENDIARY / F.U.B.A.R rounds. Man these things are just what every man needs for his ammo hoard or collection. They are super fun to shoot too. Now don't go shooting into your woodpile out back and expect to creat the greatest bonfire on the block. You have to shoot these into steel targets or old truck doors...anything metal really. These are New Stock and New And Improved Componets to give you the maximum Bang Boom and Spark to cause that Big Fireball. When these babies detonate they burn at 5,000+ degrees. Yes they're legal in the state of Ky but I don't need to tell you to use responsibly. I've got 4 Boxes of 20 at $50 a box. Some loose rounds I might sell off in ten packs for $25 so take some or take all the price is firm. Must be Ky resident w/ID. Cash sales only and Meet Face to Face Locally. Will Not Ship"

Has paperwork for an Iron Cross awarded to Kyoungjong several other japanesse and russian medals . I am no expert but Iron Cross has no makers mark not magnetic may not be an original wear on medals does look original but its doubtful yang could have kept them in capture , Kyoungjong was captured by LT Robert Brewer of hit ww2 movie band of brothers fame shortly after the Normandy invasion its likely Kyoungjongs medals reside with him. It is likely some or all of these medals are not originals though the ware looks original to me I am no expert , collector did have many original items before his passing. Not knowing I figure the medals value at $20 each, in the bottom drawer of the box are what appears to be some kind of army/infantry certificate from the soviet union in russian , WW2 era pictures of russian and japanesse / korean or manchurian women. Some japanesse era ww2 money , two medal boxes which held the japanesse medals which look original, 2 japanesse and russian world war 2 era pamplets which I cannot read and the iron cross second degree award document which looks authentic and bears an ost battalion unit present during normandy fighting signed by that division commander. I am sure someone speaking german , japanesse and russian can verify those documents unfortunantly I cannot. A 2014 ""my way"" movie dvd is also included in the box . I think this is an american historic society 45 though the box looks like its custom made has a picture of axis surrender to allies on it. The American Historical Foundation is selling a simularly gold accented 45 for $2,500. This one is in good shape about %95 of bluing and good condition gold inlay on slide. Gold accented trigger , hammer , mag release , safety and handle screw are in perfect condition. This thing is really a work of art . the American historical society is selling their 45 service pistol for $2,495 each.https://www.ahffirearms.com/product/the-distinguished-service-tribute-45-pistol/ This one is only $1500 ,here are some additional links for Yang Kyoungjong who fought for the Japanesse army only to be captured and impressed by the Russian army only to be captured and impressed by the German army then finally captured by the american army.

I picked this up from the CMP as a Field Grade. I needed 2 parts that were on the rifle for one of my other rifles. I installed the following H&R parts that I had in this one to make it more correct: H&R Bolt (head space checked) H&R Rear Sight, and H&R Gas Plug. The Rifle is much nicer than my Service Grades. Here's the details the best I can give, please don't hit me up with a bunch of questions and expert opinions. H&R with HR Barrel Dated 10-1955, barrel appears to be original and in the white with no rust, park matches the receiver. When I picked this out, the CMP Armor also thought the barrel was original to the receiver. HR Sights, HR Gas Plug, HR Bolt. It has a Winchester Trigger Guard with nice rounded pins. S/A Op-Rod, S/A Trigger group. The Stock is Original GI Wood, with 1/2 DAS Stamp ""P"" Proof on grip, all HR Metal. THe Lock up is not good, but the cartouch and wood are too nice to throw away. All I did was clean it with Tung Oil. Since the Lock-up is not good, I'm adding a GI Rebuild Stock that has good Lock-up. It is a square stamp ""P"" with a faint RRA on stock. I installed a front swivel so it would be quick and easy to swap if you want to shoot with a good Lock-up. 1 Enbloc is included with the CMP Manual and Certificate. You can email and I will respond if you're serious. Muzzle is +2 and Throat is 3. Thank you."

COME GET IT!!!,"Zanesville/Coshocton/Newark, Ohio, United States",$ 900,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 21, 2016",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"One time deal. Selling the entire package for $900. Buy the gun, get the rest for free. Found something else I just have to have. Selling to fund other purchase. Up for trade, possibly sale. Mostly looking to trade, but will sell for reasonable cash offer. If offering cash, please be reasonable. All offered will be acknowledged. We are all adults here and respectful gun owners. I will not ignore anyone. I enjoy speaking with like minded gun owners, even if a deal isn't struck. Rest assured, I am completely legitimate. I am a civil servant and can show state and federal identification as well as CCW. I am open minded and reasonable. With that said, I am prepared to take a loss, but will not give away. With all that out of the way, down to business. Gun:Up for trade/sale is a Sig 226R ST. This is becoming a harder to find option. Sig replaced this model with the ""Elite"" series and increased the price tag to match. This gun now has the exact same specs as the ""Elite"" series without the price. The gun is finished in stainless steel. The only wear is to the barrel lug as seen in the pics. Gun has seen around 300 rounds or so. Never had a failure of any type. Gun presents and runs flawless. It has SigLite night sights that are still very very bright. The E2 grips have been change to factory grips. I found the E2's to be bulky and uncomfortable. This is a DA/SA model with decocker. It's is also a railed model. Standard rail, so any accessories will mount. I have the factory case, papers, oil, etc included. Mags:4 mags included. Two mags are factory flush fit 15 round mags. Springs and followers are tight. Two mags are MecGar high capacity mags with base plates. They are 18 rounds. Springs and followers are tight as well. Light:The attached light is a Streamlight TLR-1HL. It is 800 lumens with quick mount. It runs on 1 CR123 battery. It features momentary beam and strobe as well as constant mode of each. It's a really nice light. Holster:the holster is a hybrid leather and Kydex holster. It can be worn OWB or IWB. Hardware is included as well as extra screws and bushings. The IWB mounts are steel spring clips. The back is lined and double stitched. I have two Kydex shells. One shell is for just the gun. One shell is for the gun with the light attached. Both mount to the leather back plate. This is an extremely comfortable and adaptable holster. Ammo:I am including 5 boxes (250 rounds) of factory sealed Eagle brand ammo for range use. Each box is unopened. I also have 20 rounds of Federal HydraShok defense ammo. 18 rounds are in the mag, one round is chambered and the last  round is in the gun case. This is open container. I have several pics available and can send them upon request. This is a complete range, carry, home defense package. I will not separate anything. All or nothing as this is my last 9mm. I have consolidated to strictly .45ACP. Do the research and price each piece. You'll find this is a great deal and an extensive package. If you can even find the ST model. I'm not suggesting the are rare, just hard to find. Trades:I am looking for one type of trade. Please don't offer BP's, bows, Hi-Points, revolvers, washing machines, or lawnmowers. I won't ignore you, but courteously decline your offer. With that said, I am looking for a 1911 for carry. Will accept commander or government length. No ultra or compact. I would prefer an entry level such as Rock Island, Desert Eagle, or Citadel. Perhaps a mid level such as Ruger, Para, or Taurus. I would either like accessories and ammo to even the trade, or cash to make up the difference, maybe a combination of both. I will also look at higher end 1911's as even trade. This is to become a dedicated carry gun, so entry to mid level is preferred. Not looking for a 9mm 1911 unless it's the new TCM with cash or accessories. All trades acknowledged, but I'm just really looking for what's listed. Thanks in advance for time and consideration. Happy Holidays to all and be safe. I am located near Zanesville and willing to travel within reason for the right deal. I will take your travel time into consideration if your prepared to travel. Again, thank you and have a good day. Also, I realize the holidays are upon us and money is allocated elsewhere. With that said, if a deal can be struck, I'm prepared to pull my listing and hold the gun until after the holidays when times are not so hectic. Again, just offering options. Cash price is $1200 OBO. Prefer to trade."

Lighty used with 1 optic on 1 rifle and sat in the safe. Very SOLID mount!
Details from the LarRue site: http://www.larue.com/larue-tactical-eotech-qd-mount-lt-110
 
Converts low-profile EOTechs to lower 1/3 cowitness, and provides a better cheekweld too.
The LT110 is another mount designed ""by request"". The LT110 raises the EOTech by .275"". This extra height sticks the irons low in the EOTech's window...you can still see the irons if push-comes-to-shove.
 
The response has been outstanding. The extra height is just what the EO has been needing. The design had room for a piece-of-picatinny on the back, so we put it there and now you can mount a PVS-14 or Aimpoint 3X Magnifier in perfect co-witness.
 
Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.
 
Comes complete with locking lever instruction card and 1 LT2005-B box wrench.
 
NOTE: The LT110 EOTech Mount will work correctly with 511, 512, 551, 552, XPS-2, XPS-3 and similar models. It will NOT work with the EXPS2 or EXPS3, it also will NOT work with 516, 517, 553 or 557 models (or any EOTech with a built-in riser). The LT110 is not compatible with an EOLAD installed.
 
The LT-133 (PVS-14 Mount) and LT-602-1 (fixed Aimpoint 3X Magnifier Mount) attach on the rear of the LT-110 and correctly line-up with the LT-110-mounted 511, 512, 551, 552, XPS 2, XPS 3 and similar models. The LT-649 ""Tall"" Pivot Mount (with Aimpoint 3X magnifier), mounted on the receiver rail will work on all models, but may interfere with rear sights."

This firearm is incredible. This is the Glock slayer. This weapon has seen less than 100 rounds down the pipe. Perfect 5 Star review on Buds. A little about this fine weapon, worth the read, because who doesn't like gun porn?The size and weight of the S40-A1 is similar to other popular compact striker-fired .40 S&W pistols on the market today. However, its sleek lines, generous trigger guard, and ergonomic grip configuration make it stand out from the crowd. The steel slide is treated with a surface-hardening Tenifer finish and is topped with Steyr's proprietary metallic triangle/trapezoid sight system. The sights are possibly the most remarkable part of this weapon. Incredible smooth and quick target aquisition. The double-action-only trigger is fitted with a safety system, not unlike the Glock Safe-Action trigger, that Steyr calls a Reset Action Trigger. It tipped the digital trigger gauge at 5 lbs. 5 ozs. The short, smooth, crisp trigger stroke feels lighter and easier to operate than the digital gauge indicates. The fit and finish of the steel and polymer components was excellent and the pistol was free of the mysterious internal rattles that show up in some modern pistols when given a shake.You will not find a better weapon for this price point."
