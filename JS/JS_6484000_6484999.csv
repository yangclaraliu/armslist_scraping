12 rounds, I'm cleaning off my reloading bench and don't need these
 
Great for competition, hunting or plinking, Remington Hypersonic Bonded Rifle ammunition delivers the best performance possible in a centerfire hunting round. Users can expect higher velocities resulting in a flatter shooting bullet that delivers more energy down range. Remington has also chosen a bonded bullet that expands to 1.8 times its original diameter at all distances while still maintaining 95% of its original weight. This results in maximum energy transfer along with great penetration. With all of these features, Hypersonic Bonded Rifle ammunition gives the hunter the most versatile load possible with accuracy and ballistic performance over a huge range of distance. This ammunition is non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases. Caliber: 300 Winchester Magnum Bullet Type: PSP Interlock BT Bullet Weight: 180 GR Muzzle Velocity: 3122 fps

It’s the most accurate, polymer-tipped big-game bullet available today. Along with match-grade precision, it delivers an unprecedented combination of laser-flat trajectory and devastating terminal performance. Accutip™ bullets expand quickly – producing an awesome level of transferred energy – to dispatch medium and big game with lightning authority. A thicker jacket and harder lead core regulate weight retention and optimize penetration. PRA300WC
