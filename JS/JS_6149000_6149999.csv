""The Daniel Defense A1.5 Detachable Rear Sight is optimized for back-up sighting purposes when used in conjunction with a red dot or reflex optic. The one-piece design is machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum and Type III Hard Coat Anodized for strength, and attaches easily to any Picatinny-Spec rail with a single slotted screw. The fixed rear sight is of the correct height for proper alignment with an A2 Rifle or M4 ""F"" Marked Front Sight Base, as well as for co-witnessing with a red dot optic. The sight's streamlined profile does not interfere with an AR-15's charging handle, while its feather-light 1.7 ounce weight goes virtually unnoticed when attached to a rifle's top rail.  ""The A1.5 is a hybrid rear sight that incorporates the A2 Flip-Type Sighting Aperture (large and small aperture sizes) with an A1-Type Windage Wheel that requires a bullet tip or similar tool for adjustment, thereby ensuring that sighting corrections made at the range are not inadvertently altered by rough handling or use in the field."""

I have deer hunted with it for two seasons and killed two deer with one shot, one kill at 25 and 390 yards. I'm going back to a bolt action platform as I just don't love the AR for hunting. This rifle was sighted in with 5 shots and I have shot sub 1 inch groups without a bench rest or vice. It is the most accurate rifleI have ever owned. It has less then 20 rounds through it. Everything you see in the picture is included. This includes the following:-Bone Collector 3-9x40 waterfproof, fogproof scope mounted with Nikon M-223 Mount with Butler Creek Scope Caps-Padded Rifle Case with Lock-.308 Bore Snake for cleaning-Magpul handstop on pump-3 - 10 round magpul Gen 3 magazines- Single point sling and ambitexterous attach point-Black double stack 10 round magazine pouchLet me know if you have any questions. As always you must have a FID and matching State ID. I am also willing to ship this gun through a FFL as well. Thanks.REDACTED"

Broke in per Kahr directions. You don't see the P models come up for sale very often. Unbelievable accuracy. No shipping, don't waste time asking. I bought two of these and have carried the other for over two years with well over a 2000 rounds flawlessly.From Kahr's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

Almost NIB Glock 19 Gen 4 with 184 rounds fired through it.  It’s been my nightstand gun and I’ve never carried it, so it has no wear marks or scratches.   The Blackhawk holster has basically been sitting in its box.I have decided that I’d like something a little smaller to suit my arthritic hands.  Otherwise it’s an excellent gun and many consider it ideal for home defense or EDC.  You’ll especially like the Glock trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and VERY accurate.This one comes in the original factory box with all paperwork and all other factory stuff: backstrap/beavertail package, speed-loader, 3 15-round factory mags, childproof lock w/two keys and the Blackhawk Kydex holster plus a Fobus holster. I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping.  I’m in College Station so inside the Austin, DFW, Houston triangle is OK.  Let’s meet half-way to save driving time.Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Price is firm; cash only please (so I can go buy something else).  I’m not looking for a trade or low-ball offers.  Thanks!"

I will beat any price you show me! Including those Black Friday prices. Great Christmas present!New in box, not registered! Just bought yesterday but have too many. Your steal, my loss!  Comes with rifle case, pMAG, box, books, plastic.The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Lightweight, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.Manufacturing # / SKU 02-151-30032-047-Restricted Shipping YesCaliber 5.56mm NATOMuzzle Thread 1⁄2×28 TPI (Threads Per Inch)Gas System Mid-lengthBarrel Length 16""Profile LightweightProduct Weight 6.15 lbsLength 32 ¼” – 35 7/8”Magazine DD MagazineCase Daniel Defense Full-Latch Impact Plastic CaseManufacturer Daniel DefenseLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

The fixed grip locks by unscrewing the base, which has a compartment for batteries, and requires no tools for installation. The 5 position grip locks automatically and when you press the button on the side, you are free to move it around. It has a base for batteries also. On the 5 position grip you need a 5/32 hex to secure the grip. $10/each, could maybe knock off $2 if you want one of each or two with free S/H included also."

Price dropped to $2,000. Willing to take a loss, so send a reasonable offer!
 
I have a custom built Remington 700 AAC-SD in .308 that I need to sell. I built it as an entry level precision rifle, but have moved up to a 6.5 Creedmore now. The following is the list of upgrades currently on the rifle.
 
Bell&Carlson M40A5  Medalist fully adjustable stock. Stock has been bedded, reamed out to fit the heavy barrel profile of the rifle, and painted in woodland camo.
 
LaRue Tactical 20moa scope base.
 
TPS Precision 30mm rings.
 
Vortex Viper PST 6-24x50 illuminated scope. First focal plane, MOA reticle, MOA turrets.
 
Harris Bipod. Mounted to a Anschütz stud adaptor on the bottom rail of the stock.
 
Custom trigger job. Stock trigger was completely broken down, cleaned, polished, and the geometry of the trigger was adjusted to allow for the cleanest break possible. It is currently set at 3.25 lbs, but can be adjusted anywhere from 2.5-5 lbs without removing the trigger pack.
 
Internal magazine has been modified to hold 5+1 rounds instead of the standard 3+1.
 
Padded cheek riser/storage compaertment that I keep a small log book and some spare rounds in.
 
The original box/paperwork, as well as the original Hogue rubberized stock.300 rounds of Federal Gold Medal Match 175gr Sierra Matchking ammo.
 
It shoots sub-MOA every time with match ammo, as long as the shooter does their part.
 
I hate to let it go, but I have bills to pay. Cash only at this time. Open to offers, but low ball offers will be politely ignored. Keep in mind, the scope itself is over $1,000. I will not separate the scope or accessories from the rifle. It's a package deal only. 
I will be at the gun and knife show at the memorial coliseum today until noon if you would like to see it in person. My cell is 260-seven oh 5-405eight. Text preferred.
Thanks!"

From what I have read TC was  the cat's meow when it came to custom rifles that would shoot cloverleafs all day. He left the wood very subdued but everything has been built great from the re barrel to the bedding job. This rifle would be great for someone who wanted a rifle as a history piece from Mr. Kennon, someone who wanted to upgrade the glass and shoot 1000yd benchrest or someone who wanted a precision deer rifle in possibly one of the most underrated calibers around.  I will sell but would rather trade on a .44mag rifle in good shape. I have 3 and possibly 4 boxes of core-lokts that I will let go with this rifle if the trade is right. I am really having a hard time judging the value of this gun because if you look up any of TCs guns they sell well into the thousands but most are more ornate. I am listing this at the price of a decent sportered 6.5 because although I assume it to be a bit more, I really haven't a clue of the actual value.

Best I can tell from the serial this one was made in 1969. If you know anything about this era T Bolts (and other Brownings too) you know a lot of these suffered from salt wood stocks which rusted the guns. As you can see this one is not a salt wood gun. Before I bought it I pulled the buttplate screws and they are pristine as is the rest of the metal on the gun. Also, notice the pic of it removed from the stock .This is important to know before investing in these, that's why I always state something about salt wood. This one has been in the back of my safe for quite some time so I pulled it out to double check and I cant find a flaw on it. It does not come with an original box, but has the desirable peep sight and original 5 round magazine. I have been told by other Browning guys that this particular T1 stock is fairly rare. This one has not been fired much. I have less than 10 round through it myself.  Any questions, feel free to let me know. Please, no trades."
