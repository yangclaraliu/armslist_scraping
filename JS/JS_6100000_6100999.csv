I took this carbine riffle out and Ran 1 full mag through it that contained all diferent brand ammo and it ran the mag flawlessly .  I cleaned it and put it away and now am out of work and need money for my mortgage .  gun and ammo brand new purchased this summer and stored in my safe. this is a fantastic deal. I will consider a half cash half trade deal. guns I would consider most would be a dead reliable carry pistol , defense riffle ,  lever action ,  i prefer steel and wood to polymer .  But need cash more. thank you"

Grip panels were changed sometime early in 1942 (in the low 900,000 SN range) from checkered wood with medallions to simpler smooth round top wooden stocks without medallions. A sandblasted Parkerized (phosphate) finish replaced the Black Magic oxide finish beginning in early May 1942 at serial number (approximately) 940000 to further speed up manufacture. Due to royalty payment issues, Parkerizing was soon replaced by a similar proprietary phosphate finish. The new S&W phosphate finish was phased in, completely replacing the earlier Black Magic blued finish by mid-August 1942. S&W factory letters refer this S&W phosphate finish as ""Military Midnight Black."" Whether this was an ""official"" name is unknown. It has been stated that the majority of all 1942 revolvers produced in the serial number range of V6 to V40000 will be found chambered in .38 S&W caliber, but without any doubt, some in this range were also produced in caliber .38 S&W Special. The first five 1942 Victory-series revolvers (V1 to V5) were made up in .38 S&W Special caliber as presentation pieces, having the earlier commercial Carbonia bright blued finish."

(auto-regulating gas operating) system used on all of Benelli’s very popular, incredibly usable shotguns. The rifle is adapted to work with a smaller operating rod and lower mass recoil mechanism, which reduces inertia felt by way of recoil in the shooter. The barrel is drilled and tapped for a scope and comes with a picatinny rail to keep the rifle zeroed when changing barrels. It's chambered in 300 win mag. Beautiful rifle. Must meet close and be willing to complete Bill of Sale. Will not ship gun. I can include a Leupold VX3 3.5-10x50 for the right trade/price. If this add is still up then rifle is still available."

I have this item up for sale on Gunbroker as well. I'm also accepting payment via Paypal in case you're not in MN and/or don't want to meet up. All I ask is that payment clears before I send. Message me for my Paypal e-mail, if you're interested in the rail or if you have any other questions.
Here is a brief description of the item:
Up for sale is a very lightly used Bravo Company Manufacturing (BCM) Keymod Rail (KMR). The rail is 13 inches and you are bidding on/purchasing the rail in the picture. I will also include the necessary mounting hardware, however you will need your own tools to install it.
This particular rail is special because it's the original magnesium-infused aluminum version that is 30-40% lighter and is sold out everywhere. I'm selling mine because I want a 15"" rail and this rail is 13"", but make no mistake this is an incredible lightweight rail.
I only fired the rifle this rail was formerly on for a total of 60 rounds. It's been indoors since I purchased it and only has very minor blemishes on the finish (one towards the front bottom and one at the 9:00 position). Functionally it is as good as new.
Cash or Paypal only, no trades. Thank you.Call, e-mail or text.

Their foam-tipped stem design, featuring soft memory-foam Comply™ Canal Tips, fits most people and provides a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 28dB. Sounds, at safe levels, are allowed to pass through into the ear canal, while potentially harmful noises (above 85dB) are reduced via a proprietary design that incorporates a special noise-reducing filter. EP7s include attached filter caps, which can be inserted for additional protection and blocking out lower-level noise, like that heard on a plane, in situations where hearing ambient sounds or conversations isn't critical. Right/left color-coded Sonic Defenders Ultra are made from a soft but durable, hypoallergenic polymer that provides all-day comfort and an extended product life (up to 6+ months, depending on usage and care). Their patented EarLock® retention rings lock the earplugs in place, while soft foam-tipped stems provide secure seals in the ear canals. And their low-profile design means they can be worn while wearing a helmet or mask, or while using a phone or headset. Available in clear, black, or orange. Comfortable EP7 Sonic Defenders Ultra also serve as earpieces for compatible radio communication systems* simply by removing the noise-reducing filter and attaching the earpiece to the system. NOTE: EP7 earpiece will not provide hearing protection if the noise-reducing filter is removed. EP7s are available in small (S), medium (M), and large (L). Proper size is based on the dimensions of your ear's concha bowl. Size ""medium"" fits most people; however, to ensure the best possible fit, review the earpiece sizing chart by clicking on the Sizing Chart image. EP7 Sonic Defenders Ultra are sold as a single left/right set or in a box containing 25 sets. Each set is packaged in a convenient carry case and includes a polymer lanyard and an extra set of memory foam Comply™ Canal Tips; replacements available--see Parts and Accessories on this page. * RADIO COMM SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY: Thales: Covert Security Harness; Harris: Security Force Communication Set; Motorola: Surveillance Kits; Tactical Command Industries: Tactical Earpiece Products; Peltor: Lightweight Systems-Hearplug; Silynx: C4Ops HeadsetFeatures28dB Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) with filter caps insertedLowers potentially dangerous noise levels above 85dBHear safe sound levels (with filter caps out) as if you weren't wearing ear plugsPatented EarLock® retention rings utilize seven contact points to lock earpieces in place and fit the same way every timeSoft memory-foam Canal™ Comply Tips provide secure seals in ear canals and all-day comfortMade from hypoallergenic, medical-grade polymer that's soft, comfortable, and durableLow-profile design allows you to keep them in place while wearing a mask, helmet, hat, or while using phone, headphones, or supplemental hearing muffsServe as earpieces for compatible* radio communication systemsAvailable in clear, black, or orange26"" polymer lanyard includedAdditional pair of Comply™ Canal tips included"
