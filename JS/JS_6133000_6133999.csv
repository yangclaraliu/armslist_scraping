These guns are super nice .380 Pistols. Reliable, sturdy, and accurate. The previous owner bought it new and barely used it. I have not fired it even one time since I bought it. I wanted a .380 so I did my research and bought this. Fact of the matter is I already have too many Pistols and my CCW only allows me to carry three. Besides, I collect Berettas, so if I'm going to have something just sitting in my safe and not being used, I'd like it to be a Beretta I don't have (or a second of one I do have if it's one I really like). So drop me an email, text, or call if you're interested or have something to trade. I'm asking $425.  I'd be willing to make up the difference in cash on a trade.Thanks for reading!CoryREDACTED"

Just email me directly at adamslater82@outlook.com Maybe we can work out a trade or use it as a partial down payment.This item is new, Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot. This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action. The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system. The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA."

We only know of two Pocket 49's that were outfitted with Tiffany style grips, both are one line New Yorkers.  One has an American Eagle, the other a Mexican Eagle design"".  This gun was advertised by Al Kelley and Jack Malloy in 1967 as having 10% original silver and gold finish, very clean and crisp, with no rust or pitting, and factory engraved by Gustave Young, with original Tiffany grips.  Since then the finish has been restored and it has been cased with excellent accessories.  The condition of the gun and case is exceptional.  The engraving is sharp and totally untouched and the bore is nearly mint.  This gun did not need polishing when it was restored, the original silver and gold having simply drifted with age, being very thin from its 1863 manufacture date.  The cylinder scene is crisp and complete and of course, all numbered parts are matching.  Truely outstanding, this is certainly an investment piece, because of its rarity and condition."

The barrel is 4150V Chrome Moly and has 1:7 rifling to handle the heavier 62 grain and up bullets accurately. Has the recoil reducing mid-length gas system underneath an 11” Keymod free float rail to also aid in accuracy. Rifle was assembled with all PSA parts including the BCG and charging handle so you are getting a very good solid rifle.

This is a very well taken care of firearm. It has functioned flawlessly. I have never had any malfunctions, failure to feed, or light primer strikes.
Has the DA/SA trigger, upgraded with the Short Reset Trigger (SRT), and has a 17 lb Wolff hammer spring. I do have the original Sear and original safety lever that I will include, but the SRT kit is a great upgrade over the original. I will also include the original hammer spring and a never used 19 lb Wolff hammer spring in case you want them, but the 17 lb spring noticeably improves the trigger pull and has functioned flawlessly.
Hogue G10 checkered grips are installed. These were over $100 grips, and were well worth it. The E2 grips that came on the gun feel much better than the bulky old Sig p226 grips, but these G10 grips are even better than the E2 grips in my opinion. I will include both the Hogue G10’s and the E2 grips (with E2 grip removal tool).
The Bladetech OWB (outside the waistband) holster has attachments to be used as a through the belt, or a paddle style, so you can choose which way you like. The Mag holster is a paddle style. Both holsters have adjustable retention, so you can have them hold as tight or as loose as you like.
Also included is the original Sig Sauer hard case and manual, as well as 4 Magazines."

Dynapro AT-M (RF10) is Hankook's premium On/Off-Road All-Terrain Light Truck tire developed for light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles.
 
Also included is spare tire and steel wheel, size matches the tires that are mounted so no issues there.
 
I had these wheels on my 1995 4Runner for the past 10+ years with no problems.
Tires are about a year and a half old and I would say about 1/3 of tread remaining. I was going to run them through the winter but I ran into a deal on 17” rims and tires and went with them instead.
 
They should fit most 6 lug Toyotas. Possibly Chevy as well as others. They fit my 4runner without lifting it so should be good with most stock set-ups.
 
Yes they are dirty but in good shape.
 
Includes 4, 15” Mag wheels with Hankook Tires, 24 Lug Nuts, 1-Spare Tire matching size

Shot it to a mile with great sucess. Just now time to move it down the road. 
 
It has a SilencerCo muzzle brake on it, a NEAR manufacturing 45MOA canted base on it and the B&T industries front rail for a bipod. Otherwise, it's a stock rifle. Comes with box, manual and factory accessories too. 
Great condition, though there is a small scrape/scratch on the stock.
