I have a bunch of Walnut gunstock blanks, I consider it Claro Walnut, but I'm no expert....I do know it's beautiful wood regardless of name! Lots of color and figure. I cut this tree down about 5 years ago and had it sawed into gun stock slabs. After a year covered outside, I cut the slabs into stock blanks, reapplied end seal and moved them into my basement. These are cut WAY oversize, and have great grain layout. I have rifle blanks and two piece blanks, average 3"" some are little thinner at 2 1/2"" thick. My moisture meter broke and it hasn't been a priority to replace it, so I don't know exactly what % they are at, but should be getting about right. This is NOT kiln dried, its been handled correctly, and will make great stocks. The picture is a sample of a few of the blanks. I have about 5 rifle blanks left, one of which should be long enough for a muzzle loader, and 5 or so 2 piece blanks left. I also have tons of cut off pieces for knife handles or turning projects, just let me know what you are looking for.  Anyway, I'm looking to see if anyone is interested in a blank for a project, price depends on piece....but its going to be much cheaper than anywhere else, for the same quality! Most rifle blanks are in the $100-$200 range, two piece from $50-$200..... just let me know what you are looking for and I can send pictures. If you are wanting to try your hand at making a two piece shotgun stock, I may also be willing to drill the through bolt for you.  I'm also willing to trade as well.  I would love to find a small or large ring Mauser action, or a sporterized anything.  Also interested in 45 acp mauser or enfield conversions or parts like a 45 cal rifle barrel blank (or other caliber conversions)  I'm pretty open as far as trades go.....offer away!Also interested in zabala side-by-side shotgunsValmet 212 or Lion models barrels or partsModern actions, right or left hand.

It is NOT Cerakote - it was part of a limited run made at the Glock factory with colored polymer exclusively for Lipsey's.I had been looking for one of these for a long time and could never find one. I finally found a brand new one online, ordered it immediately and just received it last week. I took it to my local range the other day and put about 150 rounds through it - with no issues of course - it's a Glock.I really didn't expect to sell this gun. It's awesome. Unfortunately, I feel that the size of the grip just isn't a good match for my fairly small hands. I bought an Inforce APL 200 lumen rail-mounted flashlight which suits it very well in my opinion and I would be happy to sell it with the gun if you want to buy them both together.I have also installed a Vickers extended slide-stop (not shown because the picture was taken before I installed it) and replaced the rear slide cover plate. Obviously, I will include the original parts with the gun so you can decide which ones you like better. If you'd prefer, I could go ahead and re-install the stock parts myself if you'd rather not do it. Feel free to ask any questions, make any requests and make an offer. I'm not really looking to trade but hey, it doesn't hurt to throw an offer out there. If you look up other pictures of this gun online, it can tend to look different from photo to photo depending on the lighting conditions.I personally love the color. Sometimes, different colored guns can come off looking more like a toy and not a serious weapon. However, I think they nailed it with this color. It manages to stand out in a sea of black guns without looking silly or strange.Feel free to call, text or email me if you'd like to see any more detailed pictures of the gun. It will of course come with the Glock case, three 15 round magazines, grey replaceable backstraps, mag loader, etc.832 - 7nine5 - 1410 or REDACTED"

It has only been function tested a few rounds but not had any long term range time yet so the barrel is basically factory new. My loss is your gain! You will get the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 sight and 18 magazines! The ACOG has the crosshairs, and has the backup iron sights on top, the front sight on top the ACOG even has the tritium glow in the dark. The ACOG also has an illuminated reticle for night or low light conditions so it is always ready. INcluded is 7 factory FN FDE magazines, 5 factory FN black metal magazines, and 6 high quality poly magazines. The poly magazines are similar to PMag quality, and these sold to law enforcement departments. But not Magpul, i'm not sure the brand. But they function great. This rifle is basically in mint or like new condition, no problems or anything like that. This is a real ACOG not a chinese knock-off, beware of the counterfits."

I have the original box. This one has had a custom Multi-Cam finish (multi-camo). It looks great! It has only been function tested a few rounds but not had any long term range time yet so the barrel is basically factory new. My loss is your gain! You will get the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 sight and 18 magazines! The ACOG has the crosshairs, and has the backup iron sights on top, the front sight on top the ACOG even has the tritium glow in the dark. The ACOG also has an illuminated reticle for night or low light conditions so it is always ready. INcluded is 7 factory FN FDE magazines, 5 factory FN black metal magazines, and 6 high quality poly magazines. The poly magazines are similar to PMag quality, and these sold to law enforcement departments. But not Magpul, i'm not sure the brand. But they function great. This rifle is basically in mint or like new condition, no problems or anything like that. This is a real ACOG not a chinese knock-off, beware of the counterfits."

It has been used by the nation´s top shooters to win many matches, including the likes of Daniel Horner and Robby Johnson from the AMU. Its reliability and accuracy have become legendary.
Now, other manufactures are offering similarly priced rifles that do not compare or compete, making the CTR-02™ an incredible value. The CTR-02™ upper assembly mates well with a standard forged lower receiver for an easy upgrade, and we now also offer both the CTR-02™ upper and lower as stripped receivers for the home builder. There is no doubt that the CTR-02™ will continue as a premier top-charge rifle system well into the future."
