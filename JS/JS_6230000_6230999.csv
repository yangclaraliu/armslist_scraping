As always, have antique weapons checked by a gunsmith first. Keep in mind this is all original wwii production german ammo, in original boxes. Average going rate for low quality eastern block surplus 8mm right now is about 75 to 80 cents a round. More for decent newly made ammo like prvipartisan. I have priced this ammo accordingly.I have two different grades available.Collector; and shooter. Collector boxes have quite literally never been opened since being packed in 1940, and look and feel brand new. These would be great for display or shooting, with a beautiful box to keep when you're done. I have both AP and standard FMJ. The other grade is shooter. Shooter grade is the same ammo, except the boxes have light water staining, possible warping, and the labels aren't perfect. The ammo has been inspected and cleaned for use.I also have a single box currently in stock of very hard to find 1941 produced nickel plated 8mm made in a Czech work camp. I can't recommend firing this ammo since it does have some rust on the casings but given the quality of primers used by the Germans, it will undoubtably fire.Prices will be listed below. Prices do not include shipping. Cash (if local) or Paypal only. -Collector grade armored piercing 8mm produced in 1939. Very nice. $20 each box.-Collector grade standard FMJ steel cased 8mm produced in 1940. Very nice. $15 each box. -Shooter grade standard steel cased 8mm FMJ.  $12 each box.-Nickel curo coated 1941 Czech produced 8mm. The box is in relic condition and the ammo does have rust. One cartridge shown as an example. $20. -Lot of empty boxes in okay shape for almost 80 years of age. Solid but a little off kilter and the labels are slightly damaged or dirty. $25 shipped for all."
