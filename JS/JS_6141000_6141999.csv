The fiream has 1 box of 50 rounds through it for the purpose of a function test. Everything functioned flawlessly. I label this firearm like new because it essentially is other then the 50 round function test. No scratches, no dings, still in ""out of the box new"" condition. The fit between the slide and frame is very tight, well built with a nice smooth action and a perfectly crisp trigger break. I have not stripped the firearm for cleaning as most 1911's need a good break in period before their first cleaning. Most will recommend 500 rounds before cleaning. The firearm still has factory lubrication, but the barrel was swabbed to keep the chamber and rifling clean. I have decided not to keep it in favor of a few more pressing projects I must complete.
It comes complete with everything that came from the factory in the case.
Factory box contains the following:
- Pistol with two 7 round magazines.
- Springfield holster and double magazine pouch
- 1x packet of Lucas gun oil
- 1x pistol lock
- manual, orange accessories price sheet, springfield EMP promotional picture

If you're a reloader, I also have 100 rounds of .357 Sig brass that I can include. The pistol is in great shape, basically new in the box, and has nice bright night sights (siglite). I'm just looking to see what's out there for trade, but I'm ready and willing to trade today if something catches my interest. I like handguns, not really into rifles or shotguns much. I may be interested in just about anything in handguns (not really a Glock fan), especially revolvers with a 2"" or 3"" barrel. Let me know what you have to trade, the worst I can do is say no thanks."

It was purchased by myself with the intent of competing in the Vintage Sniper Team Match. Although that never came to be. Its been sitting in the plastic bag it originally came in with a rust preventitave stick in the barrel, and then that wrapped in a silicone impregnated sock in the closet for over 5 years. It has everything that came with it from Creedmoor Sports, threaded lense caps, scope spring, papers, everything. It is even in the box it was shipped in from Creedmoor Sports. I also have a M1903 Air Service Rifle Magazine for sale with the rifle as well. Air Service Magazines are extremely rare and equally expensive. They were designed for the use of the M1903 rifle out of the back of biplanes. As the soldier was unable to reload easily the magazine would afford him 20 extra rounds on top of the 5 the rifle held internally. Bringing the total capacity to 25 rounds. It is affixed to the rifle by removing the trigger guard, depressing the floor plate button, removing the floor plate and replacing it with the magazine. Then reinstalling the trigger guard and magazine as a whole. The Air Service Magazine is an extra $600 added to the rifle price if interested. More pictures are available upon request. Thanks for looking."

I am a single action trigger guy and bought this as I've heard great things about Kahr triggers. Yes, it is ""smooth as glass"" as everyone says, but I just prefer my tiny stroke 1911 single actions. This gun is very slim. From what I've read, slimmer than a Glock. It conceals really well. The holster is not bulky either.I have the box, papers, lock, etc. it came with. I also put a Pachmyer grip ($10) on it and bought a nice in waist band leather holster for it ($30 used, like new). Paid $489 for the gun before tax, transfer. All total spent over $500. So $350 is a pretty darn good deal as it is basically brand new.I will sell it all for $350 or trade for a cheaper gun with some cash.  I want to put some night sights on one of my 1911's, so need at least $100 cash with your trade."

There were made for the CMP Vintage Sniper Team Match. As said before these were only done in limited numbers. It is brand new never been fired. It was purchased by myself with the intent of competing in the Vintage Sniper Team Match. Although that never came to be. Its been sitting in the plastic bag it originally came in with a rust preventitave stick in the barrel, and then that wrapped in a silicone impregnated sock in the closet for over 3 years. It has everything that came with it from Creedmoor Sports, threaded lense caps, scope spring, papers, everything. It is even in the box it was shipped in from Creedmoor Sports. I also have a M1903 Air Service Rifle Magazine for sale with the rifle as well. Air Service Magazines are extremely rare and equally expensive. They were designed for the use of the M1903 rifle out of the back of biplanes. As the soldier was unable to reload easily the magazine would afford him 20 extra rounds on top of the 5 the rifle held internally. Bringing the total capacity to 25 rounds. It is affixed to the rifle by removing the trigger guard, depressing the floor plate button, removing the floor plate and replacing it with the magazine. Then reinstalling the trigger guard and magazine as a whole. The Air Service Magazine is an extra $600 added to the rifle price if interested. More pictures are available upon request. Thanks for looking."

Features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. Spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. Hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Picatinny rail allows the use of any aftermarket optical, electronic or flip-up sighting system. Backbone of the rifle is formed by the barrel and its extension which runs rearward to serve as bolt group guide and structural support for external housing which is made of plastic. Uses STANAG (M16 / Ar15 compatible) magazines and magazine release lever is centrally located in front of the magazine housing. To release the magazine, one has to push this lever backwards and this can be done by either non-firing hand or by the back of the firing hand depending on situation and user preferences.

This small ""stock"" or ""skeleton"", is then completely OverMolded with the same rubber compound used on Hogue grips. The skeleton or insert, as it is called, chemically as well as mechanically adheres to the rubber resulting in a permanent bond between the rubber and the insert. The super strong insert not only gives the stocks their strength but the precise molded dimensions provide a perfect drop in fit of your rifle action. OverMolding with rubber is superior in every way and provides the ultimate in a comfortable, non slip, super smooth attractive finish, that is durable and extremely quiet. Features include; a sleek straight comb, palm swells and a ""varminter"" style forend which are treated with a unique ""Cobblestone"" texture. Hunters especially will be attracted to the incredible quietness of these stocks coupled with lightweight, superior non-slip comfort, and accuracy. Centerfire rifle stocks all come equipped with the finest in recoil pads. Hogue recoil pads are formulated and molded from a ""super cushion"" blend of recoil reducing materials that rivals and even surpasses any other pad available. Special material coupled with computer designed, internal cushion structure provides outstanding recoil control and shooting comfort."
