Crisp 4 different Reticles. Easy QD attachment. Sturdy aluminum housing and big screen with infinite eye relief. Cash only in and around Lexington within reason.Lowest I've seen brand new for these is $80 so I think $50 and no tax/shipping is a good price just in time for a Christmas gift!  Cheers"

If I don't get very close to my asking price I will sell it to the dealer. This is an amazing chance for someone looking to save a few hundred on this rifle.

Chinese Aks are highly collectable due to the relatively small import numbers and for the fact that the Chinese only sold Aks here for 4 years and are built with thicker steel than their Russian counterparts. This particular rifle was caught in customs right after the bush ban went into effect so the rifles name was removed and it's bayonet lug filed down. Additionally the government made importers weld a nut or cap on the barrel threads or remove them. This gun has a welded faux suppressor that can easily be removed for re milling. It's all matching numbers and low round count make it a nice addition to your collection as is or re mill it and have that awesome ak look we all know and love.

Model#KBNV-474 in high gloss stainless steel finish. It is in the original box with all papers. It appears to be unfired. That is what the gun shop told me when I purchased it but he could not guarantee it. It is in 99% condition. I bought it a few years ago with the intention of getting into SASS Cowboy action shooting but never did. It has been sitting in the safe since purchase. This has the sought after 4 5/8 inch barrel. The 5 1/2 and 7 1/2 in were very common but not the 4 5/8 in. It is actually an un-cataloged item by Ruger because it was never supposed to be made and very rare. You will not find one in better condition. Must have CWP and sign bill of sale. Not interested in any trades.

This is the MK116 which is 16 inch barrel. This is new in box never fired or taken out of custom soft case. In fact I picked it up yesterday. I was on waiting list for this one since March but found the exact same gun 4 months ago so bought it as I could not wait. This version has the custom 5.5 pound trigger but also comes with a rebate card for the Zev SSR trigger once they catch up with production. Basically you get two custom triggers. I I could go into the specs but it would take me all day. Go to the PWS website. These guns are amazing!!! They are long stroke piston which is the only way to go and lighter than most DI AR's. This version also comes with custom soft  modular case, snake skins, Qd rail attachments, lancer mag, nd some other misc stuff. This is one of maybe 2 or 3 for sale in the US right now. I have not found the 16 inch version anywhere. This is brand new...  You don't have to worry about shipping, tax, etc...  You also don't have to wait for them to get back in stock. I am asking $1,925 which is less then I have seen this for anywhere else. On top of that this has the rebate card for the Zev Trigger which is rare. That trigger alone retails for $250.  Most don't have rebate...  I will entertain offers but will sell to first $1925.00 offer."

This gun is in excellent condition. It has had about a box of shells fired through and is a blast to shoot. Other than some very light handling marks on the metal receiver/ rear stock and magazine tubes, it looks like new. The KSG is no ordinary tactical shotgun. Its dual tube magazines hold a dozen 3-inch, 12-gauge shells (plus one in the chamber), with the flexibility of switching between various projectiles. A patented downward ejection system makes it truly ambidextrous, while its 26.1 inch overall length, 18.5-inch cylinder bore barrel. and 6.9 pounds of weight make it is as compact as legally possible. The forend is a simple, smooth, and reliable pump with an integrated Picatinny rail. A 3-position manual selector switch provides for switching between the two magazine tubes. The sling mount is centrally located for both two-point and single point sling options. A long Picatinny top-rail provides for the mounting of optics and sights. The barrel is threaded 15/16"" for muzzle attachments.This is for local pickup only at the address listed. A TBI background check will be required for the purchase of this gun.
