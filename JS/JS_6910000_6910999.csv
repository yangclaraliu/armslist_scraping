The receiver is Beretta, but most of the parts seem to be Breda(also Italian). The only non-Italian parts are the op-rod and the gas cylinder(as far as I can tell), but the Danes had many american Garand's in service and these may just be Danish replacements and not necessarily incorrect.
Overall the rifle is in good shape and functions fine. I am not, however, an expert on garands, so feel free to ask any questions or for more pictures.
I'll include 4 Danish made clips and the rest of the PPU M2 ball I have laying around(24 rounds)
Located in Fairfax city.
 
As for trades, I'm mostly interested in other milsurps, but I'm open to other things, so feel free to shoot me an offer. I can add cash on my end for the right trade.Some things I'm looking for in particular:- SVT 40- Swedish AG-42b Ljungman- pre war Mas 36- Frommer Stop- Daewoo K2- Maybe FAL's (Would love a rhodesian clone)- FN Five-SeveN"

I never cared for shooting .40 and this is the only one I ever owned. You seriously won't find a nicer G22 on Armslist. There isn't a spec of carbon or the tiniest of scratch on the entire gun and has been sitting in my Liberty since 2014. I am the original owner.The gun has the original box, paperwork, cleaning rod, 2 backstraps (before they included 4), six magazines with Pearce Gen 4 textured extensions on all of them (they were $11 each but if that isn't your thing baseplates are dirt cheap to swap), factory mag loader, Pearce grip plug ($6), Glock extended slide release ($15), and a Ghost 3.5 connector ($20). The gun has not been modified or tampered with in any way aside from the connector swap. Again, if the lighter connector isn't your thing a new one can be had for as low as $15.The gun is mint. If you were to purcahse it from a shop in its current conditon you would pay $30 less than the price of a brand new one. Probably a lot more with all of the mags and features.I am after $500 or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls.Buyer must be an Ohio resident or pay $35 in shipping to an FFL.Thanks for looking!"

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature - consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels - is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety; this model also has an ambidextrous safety/rear decocking button. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot.

Now here's the dirt, I bought this from a guy who said it was flawless but it actually has one problem. It's doesn't always feed reliably. The slide locks back after firing even with a full mag. I'm pretty sure that jackass knew he was lying and I refuse to be like that. It might be an easy fix, I don't know, I haven't taken to a gunsmith or anything. I changed the slide lock lever and spring and I'm pretty confident that I did it right. Anyway if you know how to fix it then my loss can be your gain.

Some of the trades above would require extra cash from you, so I'll put a trade value of $500. If you want to buy the g26, you'll pay $475. No need to haggle there, $475 is the cash price you'll pay if you'd like to purchase it.I have gotten some interesting offers, but nothing that has made we want to pull the trigger (bad pun) just yet. Please try to stick to the above list of interests. I have gotten some pretty oddball offers...To trade for or purchase the g26 you'll need a valid NCDL and CCW or an original permit(s) for me to keep. I also will require whoever wants the rifle to show valid NCDL and a CCW or an original permit to verify you are legally able to own a firearm.

Not suggested for using in brass that is going to be fired though any semi automatic rifles that have floating firing pins. Not suggested for reloading MAGNUM rifle brass.       The reason for selling these primers. I purchased these primers for reloading 7.62x39 brass to be fired through my AK-47.Supposedly these primers are okay for this application.        I knew to check this.The AK-47 has a floating firing pin. The firing pin will strike the round following a fired round, through testing 3 of these rounds had a dimple on the primer face.     I have switched over to CCI#200 Primers,these primers are thicker and harder. With the CCI #200 Primers  the round following a fired round, the primer face has a slight indication that the floating firing pin hit it, no dimple.    I fired 20 rounds having one round in the chamber and one round in the magazine,using the Winchester primers in my AK-47,I never had a slam fire. I don't take chances,when I can see a dimple on the primer of 3 not fired rounds.      No shipping because the cost of the required HAZMAT FEE, would not make it economically feasible.I Will sell individual boxes of 1,000 Primers and the 500 Primers that are not in the original box of 1,000.

The only thing different from how it came from when it was bought is that it has a BCM gunfighter charging handle. I don't have the old one sorry. The round count on this upper is something around 500, I didn't shoot this one much just because I have other rifles and uppers I shoot more over this one. So anyways price is 1250$ firm. If you have any questions feel free to ask unless it's about the price because again the price is firm. Might be open to trades, if you have an offer send it I like to trade a good bit. But it has to make sense and please be rational with your offer or it'll be ignored. Factory glock 19's are always welcomespringfield 1911's are great, TRP's half railed would be perfect. Not a huge fan of Sig if you're going by MSRP, you can keep those. I don't like aks or cheap guns I'm good without those. Dont mean to come off rude by any means but I've used armslist for several years now and I'm just trying to eliminate some of the pointless/irrational emails."
