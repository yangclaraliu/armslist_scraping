With a larger capacity than previous PMAGs, the PMAG D-60 gives the shooter 60 rounds of ammunition, effectively allowing the same round count as two standard capacity 30-round magazines without requiring a critical reload. The unique drum configuration keeps the height of the magazine manageable as well, allowing prone firing and easier storage. Features a paint pen dot matrix for easy marking and a rear window for instant capacity indication. Compatible with a wide range of NATO firearms such as the M4, M16, SCAR MK16/16S, HK416, MR556, M27 IAR, and others."

Decently accurate, no failures with minimags, haven't tried it with any other ammo. Only issue I can think of is the front sight feels a little loose and could use a drop of loctite, however I haven't had it move while shooting yet. I really like these guns, they're light and everything stows away inside the stock, but I already stock parts for Marlin rimfire rifles and I decided I'd rather have a Papoose. Asking $185 OBO, would be willing to trade for a Marlin Papoose, bulk ammo, or anything else that catches my eye. Email or call/text at REDACTED. Thanks for looking."

The only thing I did was remove the Trijicon sights (which I will throw in along with the original sights) and the Grim Reaper slide plate he had installed. It now has a set of Zev sights and a Zev slide plate. The pistol looks new other than the small scrape on the finish of the slide near the rear sight. It was like that when I got it. It looks like someone had their sight pusher tool a little too close to the slide when they removed the original sights (see bottom picture). The pistol comes with everything as it did new (backstraps, mag loader, barrel brush and tool, literature, etc) as well as a box of ammo the original owner gave me."

990,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6250990,For Sale:  458 Socom New Custom Build,"Taylors, Greenville, South Carolina","$ 1,160","Listed On: Friday, January 13, 2017",Rifles,no type,458 SOCOM                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a brand new custom built AR15 in the 458 SOCOM caliber.
The upper is an Aero Precision 7075-T6 aluminum forging made specifically for the 458 Socom cartridge. The upper features a factory oversized ejection port, factory installed dust cover, forward assist, and white “T” marks. The lower is a matching Aero Precision 7075-T6 aluminum forging marked Multi Caliber. The lower contains a tensioning screw that can be used to remove all clearance between the upper and lower creating a wobble free assembly. The adjustable carbine stock, trigger guard, and grip are Daniel Defense in Milspec dark brown. The Daniel Defense stock can be adjusted to 6 different positions and comes with 2 butt plates. One butt plate is convex and the other concave. The Daniel Defense grip has a storage compartment. The lower parts kit is milspec. The aluminum free float hand guard is a 15” long key mod rail system in dark Bronze that matches the Daniel Defense furniture perfectly. The top of the rail is full length picatinny with 2 additional 5” long dark bronze key mod rails that can be attached anywhere along the sides or bottom of the hand guard. The ported barrel is manufactured by custom barrel manufacturer Deadshot Barrels. This 18” barrel is of the heavy contour style and is manufactured from 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a non-reflective armor black Cerakote coating. The barrel is ported and therefore does not require a flash hider or muzzle brake. The ports act as a muzzle brake which keeps the recoil down and since it is integrated into the barrel the overall length is kept to a minimum. The barrel features a center feed ramp for proper feeding of the 458 SOCOM cartridge. The barrel is manufactured for a carbine length gas system with a .875” diameter gas block seat. The underside of the barrel is dimpled for proper gas block alignment. Rifle comes with one Wilson Combat/Lancer 4 shot magazine specifically made for the 458 Socom cartridge. The weight of the rifle is a light 6 lbs. 12oz. Awesome looking that stands out from the crowd. Rifle has been function fired to ensure proper function. Nothing to do but mount some optics and start shooting.
Payment: If local cash only. Must have an active drivers license and sign a bill of sale.
If shipping is required I will ship to a licensed FFL holder of your choosing for $40 which includes insurance. Payment can be in the form of USPS money order or cashier’s check.
