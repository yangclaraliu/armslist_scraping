Hello. I am selling a Taurus TCP 738 6+1 shot semi auto pistol. I'm a second owner of gun. Ive shot 100 rounds thru gun with no jams or ftf. Purchased earlier this year with my sister looking for a conceal carry gun. She purchased one of several guns I own. The Things I done with the gun for her was add Taci mac type grip for more traction. Added two 6 round magazines with finger extensions for total of three. (One without). Also improved sights by drilling out sights and painting them with high visibility paint. Can send more photos when contacted. $249.00. Call, text, or write. Thanks.  REDACTED"

This is not a Russian capture or a Mitchell Mauser. 1942 BYF is stamped on the receiver (manufactured in Oberndorf). Nazi markings are easily noticed on the side of the receiver and faintly seen on the butt stock. This gun was never fired by myself or the previous owner so the barrel shows only approximately 10-15% wear and has no rust or pitting. The stock has a small crack behind the bolt and some minor stock repair has been done to prevent it from cracking further which has seemed to work and is barely noticeable. I am including a second stock in the deal that is in great shape in case you do decide to make this a shooter gun and want to swap stocks before shooting. Cleaning rod and sling are not included. I am willing to come down SLIGHTLY on the price if you only want the one stock that is seen on the gun. More pictures are available on request.

SOLD-1944 Izhevsk arsenaled 91/30, re-arsenaled into a 91/59 carbine.  Nice example of a much less common rifle, bore is dark with light pitting.  All parts are force stamped matched to receiver. $400-1952/46 Tula arsenaled 91/30, MO marked, double dated, hex receiver.  Beautiful rifle with a great looking stock, bought this some time ago and never cleaned it or shot it just stuffed it into the safe.  Bore is dark, hard to tell beyond that since it still has cosmoline in it from storage.  This rifle has a fitting bayonet as well.  Large billboard import mark on side of hex receiver, most parts are electropencil force matched. $250-1943 PU sniper scope and mount.  This is a very nice scope that was made at the Yoshkar-Ola (factory 297) plant.  This scope manufacturer is less common then the usual Progress manufactered scopes.  The scope itself has never been re-arsenaled, there are no markings on it to denote so, and the finish and wear patterns prove this out as well.  Optics are clear and the windage and elevation dials operate the reticle as they should.  The scope mount is an original Izhevsk marked with a mis-matched scope number on it.  The receiver scope mount is a repro not an original and it has the pins and screws necessary to attach it to a rifle.  $420"

I was given a 25 round Pro Mag magazine so including with this sale.
This rifle is the start of “thinning the herd” a little bit so will probably be selling a few other firearms in the not too distant future too. For that reason I am not interested in any trades right now:)
Transaction requires a Bill of Sale (I will bring two copies so each of us will have a copy) so will require being a Florida resident and have photo ID or CCW.
If any questions of course let me know!!
You are welcome to call or text me at REDACTED and ask for Rick."
