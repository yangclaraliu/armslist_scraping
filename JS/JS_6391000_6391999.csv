Anderson Lower, stripped DPMS uppper with Anderson upper parts. CMMG bolt carrier group, Spikes 16"" mid length medium profile barrel with AAC Brake 2.0 buzzle device. SLR solo 13"" rail, Daniel Defense fixed rear and Troy fixed front sights. BCM buffer tube, grip, stock, H buffer, spring set. (The stock pictured is a magpul, but there's a BCM on it now). It also has an HSP Thorntail mount attached, and I'd be willing to throw in an Inforce WMLx to sweeten the deal. I'd also be willing to throw in two brand new, in sealed plastic Military Contract mags as well. Comes with a Troy front sight tool in the grip housing. Everything on this rifle is quality, and this is a slightly sub MOA gun with the right ammo. Never had a failure, and it's been cleaned between every range trip and re-lubed with Militec1. No reloads used, no +P's used. So if you're looking for a stupid accurate and reliable base gun for maybe an SPR or something, this is a great rifle.
Very reliable gun. Runs great, but I never shoot it. Other AR's get my attention. I'm looking for a straight trade or cash. My trades are very specific, although I'm open to at least talking about what you have to offer. I'm not adding mags, cash, or ammo to sweeten your side so please don't ask. If your gun feels higher value then don't message me. The idea (for me) behind this is NOT putting out cash to fund my next project. This rifle cost me $1300. Now I know AR's are everywhere for quite cheap right now so I'm aware you can buy them for less. This is probably going to be a better deal for someone looking to trade me for a gun they're looking to get rid of and wants an AR. I'm not going to get into a debate down to the exact dollar value. Also, my meeting place is the 7/11 in Minneola @ Washington and 27. Not at all flexible on that. Very public and inbetween me and Orlando.
Trades: NOTHING subcompact at all.Nothing in .45 ACP unless it's an HK45C.
Beretta 92A1 (NOT M9A1) + cash (unless you have a bunch of mags and upgraded sights that don't suck)Beretta 92A1 Compact (with rail ONLY - no Cheetah's) + Cash9mm Springfield 1911 (Range officer or one of the new ones.. Maybe a loaded)Gen 4 Glock 23 (with no mods besides sights or easily reversible things) + cashSig P226HK USP .40 full or mid size - no LEM triggers (will consider anything from HK)Again, I'll consider anything. You'll either need to do a Bill of Sale (with drivers license present) or have a CCW permit. No selling to criminals."

It has been fired but not enough yet to be considered ""broken in"" acording to the manufacturer's recomendations. (I'm estimating I've got 50 rounds through it or less.) Very clean and I challenge anyone to be able to tell the diffeence between this one and a brand new one. I've got a lot of guns, never fired this one much and already replaced it with a bigger gun.INCLUDES:Absolutely everything that is came with new. 4 inch barrel, normal Glock sights, three 15 round magazines, multi-sized backstraps for the hand grip (which are not Cerakoted) Even the stupid spent casing and cable lock is included. But wait, there's more! hahaha Also included is Blackhawk Serpa holster which is already configured for belt carry with an FBI angle to it. The open carry over the belt paddle attachment is also included as well as the miscelaneous mounting hardware. Holster is compatible with the Serpa CQB molle attachment if you buy one of those mounts seperately.About the Glock 19 Generation 4 model: Includes all the latest greatest technology Glock as to offer PLUS the factory applied Cerakote finish for the most durable finish available in the firearms industry. Extremely popular model which has been used by everyone from US Army Special Forces groups to first time gun buyers. See the official Glock web site and the Cerakote web sites for more information.Why am I asking $580.00 for everything?Bud's is offering them for $600.00 and you can't tell the difference between mine and their's. Buying mine saves you shipping and transfer fees, there is no waiting... you get it today (with proof of eligability to own a handgun) and mine comes with a fantastic and versitle holster. Everything you need all at once (except for ammo). I think that's a great deal and you can't always find these Cerakoted models when you want one.THE FINE PRINT:Please include your best contact information upon first contact. Face to Face local meeting at Target Parking lot at 7 Corners preferred. Bring exact change and your Virginia Driver's license AND YOUR CONCEALED HANDGUN PERMIT or ""CAC"" as proof of eligability to own a handgun. I will either write down your credentials or grab a selfie of you and your credentials. Serious inquires only please. First come first serve. Please feel free to ask if I missed anything.Thank you."

Very few P5's were imported. And of those only about 8% were the highly desirable Compact. I can only find 2 that have been sold on Armslist nationwide in the last year. And on gun auction sites they normally go for $1300-1700. I know only well educated buyers will want this super collectible firearm. So I hope it goes to a true Walther lover. For such a collectable pistol the price is low enough to actually shoot and carry. And I know the P5 compact is considered to be a super reliable and well built handgun. It was the pistol used by the British and Irish special units. And is also the sidearm of both Connery and Moore as James Bond. This pistol is in 92-97% condition(depending on who you ask). And has all matching number. I can't really see any signs of use. There is no surface scratches or wear marks. By the condition and barrel I would guess it has had less than 100 rounds through it. I do NOT have the box. But I have the owners manual and the mag that it came with. I will only consider face to face transactions in the Worthington/Dublin area. I WILL NOT SHIP.  Buyer must have valid Ohio ID. This pistol is CASH ONLY. NO TRADES....please don't waste your time asking(I won't answer your email). Any other questions please ask. And I would be happy to send other pictures. Good luck! I hope it goes to a good home. If I didn't need the cash it would stay in the family for another 25 years. Asking $1050 obo.

This optic brings high quality craftsmanship to allow you speed and versatility in a variety of shooting environments. The high-quality, fully multi-coated lenses deliver a clear, crisp sight picture and optical low-light performance. The true one-power on the low end of its 4x range provides quick target acquisition in close quarters scenarios, and as you need to engage at a distance, you are able to crank up to 4x. The STRIIKER is perfect for you whether you're looking to win a 3-Gun competition or you're looking for a versatile hunting optic.Our focus on quality at an affordable price continues with the STRIIKER, and it's backed with our Lifetime Warranty and exemplary service.The tactical target turrets allow you to easily adjust your windage and elevation with distinguished and audible 1/2 MOA clicks. The turrets then push down to lock in your position without risk of unintentional rotation. Additionally, the turret covers are removable, allowing you to set your true zero and align the '0' on your turret cover to the hash mark on the body. This feature allows you to always be able to return to your ""true zero"" even after adjusting to fit that day's needs out in the field.The STRIIKER utilizes the Tactical Combat Reticle (TCR) with a 4 MOA center red dot with a BDC calibrated for 5.56 and .308 calibers. The TCR reticle allows you to quickly obtain your target and bring it down fast with 4 moa red dot for CQB situations."

Finish: Two tone Nickel finish
Category: Compact
Bersa of Argentina has been producing quality compact pistols chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. Firestorm are basically the same reliable Bersa pistols produced for years.
It is similar to the well known Bersa .380. The Firestorm 22 offers the same reliability and accuracy, chambered for the excellent .22 Long Rifle cartridge for less recoil and lower cost ammor.
Two tone finish looks great. Nickel slide is sharp-looking and durable.
Compact frame and grip are sculpted perfectly for your hand. It obviously works well for smaller hands, but it is surprisingly comfortable for large shooters too.
Double-action auto pistol that holds ten cartridges in its magazine, with a total capacity of eleven.  Traditional double-action design where the first shot can be fired either by a long pull of the trigger or by thumb-cocking the hammer for a single-action pull, with subsequent shots fired in the single-action mode.
The ten shot magazine has a finger extension, to effectively lengthen the grip.
Barrel is three and five-eighths inch and is fixed to the frame – Barrel does not move with the slide at all, resulting in a very rigid barrel – and outstanding accuracy and reliability! Having a fixed breech, it gets more power from the .22 Long Rifle cartridge than does a revolver, due to the barrel/cylinder gap inherent to the revolver design.
Feed ramp to the chamber is polished smooth for reliable feeding, even during extensive firing. 
 
Slide features a large extractor and large ejection port, resulting in excellent case extraction and reliability.
Safeties: Manual safety that disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer, and also serves as a decocking lever, which is well placed just above the gripping hand for easy reach.  Also has a magazine disconnect safety which prevents the gun from firing with the magazine removed. It also has a key-lock safety, if one so chooses to use that feature.
Grip panels are semi-soft synthetic rubber material with finger grooves on the front of the grip. It makes for a very comfortable and secure hold. Exceedingly comfortable pistol to shoot. 
Magazine release button is located at the UPPER left of the trigger at the rear, and is easily operated by both right-handed and left-handed shooters.(No trades. No silly low offers -- these messges will not be returned.)"

The clips cost $29.95 each so right there is $60.00! Gun is clean and shoots perfect and has never jammed the few times I've shot it. The Model 845 pistol has all the features you'd expect to find on what is the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. The 845 is derived from the successful Taurus OSS pistol designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many Taurus customers. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant Strike Two capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike and when it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. Features fixed 3-dot sights and checkered black polymer grips.contact Steve call or text REDACTED"
