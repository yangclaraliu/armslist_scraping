It does have a couple scratches coming from the ejection port ( they would probably clean right off with some light blue/cleaning lubricant, but I haven't pulled it out the safe in awhile that's the reason for the sale as I'm into larger caliber guns now or small fun pistol type firearms. ) I do have the original box it came in from the factory with all hardware and this will be included. Unlike every other firearm on the market, the SIG MCX was built for optimum performance! This is not your average AR-15 that you will find anywhere. This SIG MCX is the .223 or 5.56 model so you would need to buy whatever barrel swap you prefer, but they are very easy features to change and can be done in under a minute or two. It has an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes any AR Magazine. It's revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube and works great, allowing for side-folding stocks as well as telescoping stocks that come right up the end of the gun for a very compact firearm. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers practically the same AR-style controls for easy learning and controllability. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.*Please Read*The Aftermarket Foregrip, Holosun, and Iron sights will not be included unless you decide you want any of it and will pay the extra cash for me to buy others as I really like the upgrades and will put them on another rifle!Price is $1,200 Cash or Trade value of $1,500+ as I'm not really looking to trade so I'd need something highly in my favor.PRICE DROPPED to $1,200 FIRM!Items I may consider ( feel free to offer ) a Chiappa Rhinoa Beretta 92FS Compact or Single Stack ( better if both, but I know their aren't many out there ) a cheap but decent 5.45 + cashAny Bullpups may entertain me or guns that fold up smalla Kel-Teca FN made gun ( I Like almost anything they make ), a Galil, a HK P7,would also consider a Kriss Vector Also like Nostalgia guns and rifles Like straight pull MausersWould also entertain a lot of good brand 9mm or .308 / 7.62x51 as part of a trade.NO .40's please and I can add cash or accept cash on your end ( mainly looking for cash as I'm looking to buy something specific for my car ) Unless you do Car Wraps we could possibly work out a trade after the work is done and fill out a contract beforehand.Have a 2011 Mitsubishi 4 Door Evo basically.You can email me on here or best thing to do would be to text me at 904-5zero9-zero517.Thanks and hoping to find some good offers! I live about an hour or so West of Jacksonville towards Lake City, but will meet for the right deal. First come; First Serve!The outcome of this is a firearm with superior suppression capability for the .300 Blackout and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. It's as easy as that! Basically 3 guns in one with much better reliability and much cleaner running than a regular AR.Manufacturer: SIG SAUERModel: MCXCategory: RIFLEAction :SEMI-AUTOMATICCaliber :5.56 NATOBarrel Length :16""Capacity :30+1Trigger :STANDARD SINGLEStock :FOLDABLEMetal Finish :MATTE BLACKMuzzle :BRAKEYou can email me on here or best thing to do would be to text me at 904-5zero9-zero517.Thanks and hoping to find some good offers!

I have all the original paperwork and sales receipt, the Springfield Armory soft case that is came in had a broken zipper when I got it so I store it in a hard case and it will be sold/traded in the cheap hard case and I will include the original bag (I got a quote to replace the zipper from a local place for 50.00). It comes with the one factory 10rd mag. I know I am going to kick myself for selling or trading this but that’s how projects go. I have included the specs from Springfield’s website.

And this Firearms is still Unfired!!!!!!American Legacy Firearms founder Steve Faler has been in the firearm industry for more than 35 years, has sold more than a million guns and plans to donate $1 million to NRA by 2013. To meet this goal, American Legacy has rolled out an NRA special-edition rifle that celebrates the American hunting tradition. The Fort Collins, Colo.-based company was founded in 2004, but it was at a 2009 Friends of NRA banquet that its fundraising mission began. At the event, Faler and his partner, Warren Hanson, asked NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre for permission to design, market and sell a special-edition pistol and donate a portion of the proceeds to NRA. The idea was approved, and the result came in 2011 with the NRA Auto-Ordnance M1911. The pistol's engravings commemorate the 100th anniversary of John M. Browning's M1911 and honor the men and women who have served the United States for the past 100 years. The top of the slide is boldly imprinted with ""NRA"" and the left-hand stock is customized with the name of a state scrolled above ""National Rifle Association"" and an identification number scrolled below. Only 100 pistols are available for each state, and the additional identification number ensures that ""Colorado, 54 of 100"" (pictured) and every other NRA special edition is a unique handgun. Since their debut, the pistols have been a success and Faler was able to donate $250,000 to NRA in 2011, an investment that he considers a good first step. ""My goal is to raise as much money for the Second Amendment and the NRA as possible,"" said Faler. ""I ask myself, how can I help the NRA? That's why I make the special editions, and that's why I donate. [The NRA] needs that money, especially during these times,"" he added. Determined to outdo last year's contribution, American Legacy Firearms has introduced another special-edition firearm, the NRA Hunting Tradition rifle. Based on the Mossberg 4X4, the American-made, bolt-action rifles are purchased wholesale and shipped to SWS Engraving in Hope, Ark., a plant owned and operated by Hanson. The American-walnut stocks are ornately engraved with wilderness scenes depicting a father and son sharing a hunt as well as popular North American big-game animals. The bottom of the fore-end is engraved with ""National Rifle Association,"" and the illustration on the stock's right rear contains a scroll similar to those on the Auto-Ordnance M1911s with a state's name and an identification number. As with the pistols, there will be 100 rifles per state, and customers who purchased the NRA pistol will have the right of first refusal on the NRA rifle with matching state and identification number. The stock is finished with an extra-durable coating to protect the engraving during normal use. All metal parts, including the barrel and receiver, are buffed, blued, engraved and then plated in gold, nickel or blue, as the design dictates. The bolt is nickel-plated and then hand-jeweled. Faler's choice of rifle to use for the Hunting Tradition was based on features and performance, and the Mossberg 4X4 Bolt Action had the right combination. Its fluted barrel is free-floated and has an effective muzzle brake, the stock is of nice American-walnut with weight-reducing cuts in the fore-end and a stout rubber recoil pad on the butt. Also featured is the Mossberg Lightning Bolt Action (LBA) single-stage, adjustable trigger system, one of the cleanest breaking triggers I've ever tested. Adjustable from 2 pounds to 7 pounds, the LBA incorporates a lever in the trigger blade that must be depressed before the trigger can be pulled. Although the rifle does not come with sights, it is drilled and tapped for bases of the same pattern as the Remington Model 700. The Hunting Tradition is available chambered for .25-'06 Rem., .270 Win., 7 mm Rem. Mag., .30-'06 Sprg., .300 Win. Mag. or .338 Win. Mag., and includes a detachable-box magazine-four-round capacity for standard cartridges or three-round capacity for the magnums. Steve Faler and American Legacy Firearms have a mantra, ""Life's too short to shoot an ugly gun!"" With these words in mind, I packed up the Hunting Tradition evaluation rifle and took a trip to the range. It is important to note that, according to Faler, these NRA special-edition firearms are meant to be shot. While there is no doubt that many will be displayed or passed on to kids and grandkids, the Mossberg 4X4 and the Auto-Ordnance M1911 were chosen, in no small part, because they are proven shooters. For a reasonable fee, American Legacy will even repair and refinish the guns back to original quality, so owners should not be afraid to enjoy them for a few years before cleaning them up and passing them down. While a complete evaluation was not conducted, I did send enough rounds downrange to be very satisfied with the results. The test rifle, chambered for 30-'06 Sprg., was topped with a BSA Majestic DX 4-16X 44 mm scope, and I used Nosler Custom Trophy Grade ammunition with 165-grain AccuBond bullets. My first impression of the rifle was that it felt light for its weight. Scoped, it weighed 8 pounds, 10 ounces, and the LBA trigger broke crisply and consistently at 2 pounds, 4 ounces. Ten rounds over a chronograph at 10 feet produced an average velocity of 2,713 fps. For accuracy, I fired 10 consecutive, three-shot groups at 100 yards from a sandbag rest. The average group size was exactly 1 1/4 inches, and only one group was larger than 2 inches. During testing I encountered no failures or malfunctions. The NRA special-edition firearms from American Legacy Firearms are unique, ornately engraved rifles and pistols designed to not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also functional and capable. As well, a portion of the proceeds from the sales of these guns is donated to NRA. With artwork celebrating our country's heroes and America's outdoor and hunting traditions, and sales directly contributing to the protection of the Second Amendment, there is little doubt that these firearms will be relevant and cherished for generations to come."

The MTAC’s top grain cow hide leather backing is the most comfortable material to wear against your skin. It provides a soft flexible material that does not rub or pinch.
The Kydex body on the MTAC provides a rigid material that is custom fit to each firearm and maintains its shape even with the pistol un-holstered. The smooth, low friction surface allows for a fast draw and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. The all-Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents.”

I prefer a cash-only FTF in the Highlands Ranch area but I am willing to ship. No trades. Please include a phone# with your email if you are a serious buyer.
I will also ship this for anyone seeing this ad out-of-state (or anywhere not close enough for a FTF). The only payment I will take if you want it shipped is PayPal, cash or check (you will have to wait until it clears my bank if using a check). If shipping the buyer will pay for shipping and PayPal fees."

This is from Comp-Tac’s website “The Comp-Tac Paddle Holster is an all-Kydex outside the waistband holster that may be worn for competition, general use or concealed carry. The paddle is designed to be worn at 3:00 for the right handed shooter. 
The Kydex body provides a rigid material that is fit to each firearm and maintains its shape even with the pistol un-holstered. The smooth low friction surface allows for a fast draw and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. The all-Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents.”
Check out Comp-Tac’s website for any questions on the Paddle Holster.  
I prefer a cash-only FTF in the Highlands Ranch area but I am willing to ship. No trades. Please include a phone# with your email if you are a serious buyer. 
I will also ship this for anyone seeing this ad out-of-state (or anywhere not close enough for a FTF). The only payment I will take if you want it shipped is PayPal, cash or check (you will have to wait until it clears my bank if using a check). If shipping the buyer will pay for shipping and PayPal fees."

It was the first successful semi-automatic shotgun design, and remained in production until 1998. The name of the shotgun designates that it is an autoloader with a capacity of five rounds, four in the magazine and one in the chamber. Remington Arms sold a variant called the Remington Model 11. The Browning Auto-5 was the first mass-produced semi-automatic shotgun. Designed by John Browning in 1898 and patented in 1900,[4] it was produced continually for almost 100 years by several makers with production ending in 1998. It features a distinctive high rear end, earning it the nickname ""Humpback"". The top of the action goes straight back on a level with the barrel before cutting down sharply towards the buttstock. This distinctive feature makes it easy to identify A-5s from a distance. A-5s were produced in a variety of gauges, with 12 and 20 predominating; 16 gauge (not produced between 1976 and 1987) models were also available. The gun saw military service worldwide between World War I and the Vietnam War. A Remington Model 11 was used in the suicide of Kurt Cobain.[5]   The Browning Auto-5 is a long-recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun. Shells are stored in a tubular magazine under the barrel. When a chambered shell is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together (for a distance greater than the shell length) and re-cock the hammer. As the barrel returns forward to its initial position the bolt remains behind and thus the spent shell is ejected through a port on the top of the receiver. Then the bolt returns forward and feeds another shell from the magazine into the action. This type of long recoil action was the first of its kind and patented in 1900 by John Browning. To load the gun, shells are fed into the bottom of the action, where they are pushed into the tubular magazine. Most A-5s have removable plugs in the magazine which prevent more than three shells from being loaded (two in the magazine, plus one in the chamber) to comply with U.S. Federal migratory waterfowl laws, as well as some state hunting regulations. With the plug removed, the total capacity is five rounds. If the chamber is open (the operating handle is drawn back) the first shell loaded into the magazine tube will go directly into the chamber (there is a manual bolt closing button under the ejection port), the bolt then closes, and all further shells fed into the gun go into the magazine. The A-5 has a system of friction piece or pieces and bevel rings which retard the barrel's rearward travel. Setting these rings correctly is vital to good shotgun performance and to ensure a long life to the weapon, by controlling excessive recoil. The friction rings are set based on the type of load to be fired through the gun"

I bought this NIB around a year ago from Denver Guns and Ammo in Littleton. It has never been fired. Unfortunately, I decided while bored one day, to tape and paint the grips Barcelona Red, to match my Tacoma lol. It doesn't look bad and has some pebbles from Jerusalem inlaid over the emblem in the shape of a cross. Again it's never been fired. Carried extensively but never fired! I know exactly how these weapons fire and, as it's not really a range gun, I didn't ever make it in. The 2nd Gen LCPs supposedly fire much better than the 1st Gen LCPs; they actually have rear & front sights, and a much smoother trigger pull than it's predecessor (not to be confused with the band new LCP II).  It is in good condition and will make some one a nice little self protection piece. It comes with a nice  OWB custom holster and an extra mag. I will only sell this weapon legally, at a FFL DEALER, somewhere within reasonable vicinity to Lakewood. I would consider a trade for a sub compact, single stack 9,40,45 or any revolver & could add some extra $ if needed. Thanks for your time and feel free to email me and I'll get back to you asap. Denver Guns & Ammo in Littleton off of Wadsworth and Coalmine is my preferred FFL but I will travel, within reason.**this price includes an extra $33 magazine, a soft case, a gun lock, & a $50 custom-shaped, right-handed, black leather holster. The price is not negotiable and does not include the cost of the transfer fee, which is usually around ten bucks or less.Thank you for your timeCKD"

Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components.” Check out Tactical Holsters website for any questions on the INCOG holster.

This is from Comp-Tac’s website “The Comp-Tac Twin Magazine Paddle pouch is an outside the waistband holder that carries two magazines attached together. Designed to be worn at 9:00 for a right handed shooter this is an excellent way to carry more ammunition for competition or recreational shooting. 
The Comp-Tac Twin Magazine Paddle Pouch provides a rigid material that maintains its shape even with the magazine removed. The smooth low friction surface allows for a fast magazine removal and easy one-handed insertion of the magazine. The Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents. Each magazine pouch is tension adjustable allowing for a perfect fit for each magazine.”
This Paddle Pouch will accommodate other magazines besides the M&P’s listed above. Check out Comp-Tac’s website for other magazines this twin paddle pouch will accommodate.
I prefer a cash-only FTF in the Highlands Ranch area but I am willing to ship. No trades. Please include a phone# with your email if you are a serious buyer.
I will also ship this for anyone seeing this ad out-of-state (or anywhere not close enough for a FTF).
