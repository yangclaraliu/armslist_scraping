Incorporating a polymer frame, a double-action-only (DAO) trigger system and an impressive magazine capacity of 18 rounds, the VP70’s features are now common on many contemporary pistols. However, the revolutionary design was considered a curiosity in its time because it was the first polymer-framed pistol ever made, 12 years before the Glock.""Face to Face KY ID or CCDW permit requiredMeet in Lexington area.Not interested in trades at this time.Willing to ship based on terms of payment clearing.
