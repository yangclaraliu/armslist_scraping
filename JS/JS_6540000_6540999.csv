This is an original ZF4 sniper scope for the German G.43 semi-automatic rifle. This scope is complete with the original (non-repro) mount, rainshield, lens covers, rubber eye protector, packet of lens cloth, and even the original wood scope case with strap! The scope is maker coded ""dow"" for Opticotechna GmbH in Czechoslovakia and the serial number (3200) indicates fairly early production. The triangle filled with blue paint indicates the scope was manufactured for cold weather use (Russia, Norway, etc). The mount was manufactured by Berliner-Lubecker (E/214 marked) and is of the early type with ""center bend"" lever and square base ends. The mount is serial numbered to its rifle (6570) the correct pantagraph engraved/block style numerals marked through the dark phosphate finish. The rainshield is of the standard type with blue finish and three grasping legs. The lens cover is correct with pressed paper ""Presstoff"" cap construction with leather strap and wooden plug that fits into the rubber eye protector. The case is of the later wood style construction and is correct, original and matching. It is stencil numbered and matched to the rifle with the same 6570 engraved on the mount. The case is Army accepted with an ink stamped Eagle/WaA217 inside the lid, as is correct. Likewise, the case closing hardware is stamped with the ""triangle within a circle"" marking, another good indicator of originality. There is a place to store the rainshield inside the lid and a slot inside the body which holds a pair of lens filters. A note about the lens filters: these are not originals but were hand made by a famous master Optometrist. The original filters were simply held in place by the rubber eye protector and were designed to both reduce brightness in bright daylight and to serve to protect the lens from dirt.Overall condition is very good."

This is an original ZF4 sniper scope for the German G.43 semi-automatic rifle. This scope is complete with the original (non-repro) mount, rainshield, lens covers, rubber eye protector, packet of lens cloth, and even the original wood scope case with strap! The scope is maker coded ""dow"" for Opticotechna GmbH in Czechoslovakia and the serial number (3200) indicates fairly early production. The triangle filled with blue paint indicates the scope was manufactured for cold weather use (Russia, Norway, etc). The mount was manufactured by Berliner-Lubecker (E/214 marked) and is of the early type with ""center bend"" lever and square base ends. The mount is serial numbered to its rifle (6570) the correct pantagraph engraved/block style numerals marked through the dark phosphate finish. The rainshield is of the standard type with blue finish and three grasping legs. The lens cover is correct with pressed paper ""Presstoff"" cap construction with leather strap and wooden plug that fits into the rubber eye protector. The case is of the later wood style construction and is correct, original and matching. It is stencil numbered and matched to the rifle with the same 6570 engraved on the mount. The case is Army accepted with an ink stamped Eagle/WaA217 inside the lid, as is correct. Likewise, the case closing hardware is stamped with the ""triangle within a circle"" marking, another good indicator of originality. There is a place to store the rainshield inside the lid and a slot inside the body which holds a pair of lens filters. A note about the lens filters: these are not originals but were hand made by a famous master Optometrist. The original filters were simply held in place by the rubber eye protector and were designed to both reduce brightness in bright daylight and to serve to protect the lens from dirt.Overall condition is very good."

It is chambered in standard 9mm. I have not fired it for years, but when I last did it worked well. The magazine is loaded with stripper clips through the open bolt on top. The finish is probably 95%-98%, with no damage or heavy scratches. It's flat-blue, which looks to have been done during a factory rearsenal.  The bluing is 100% uniform throughout. The Mauser insignia is clearly visible on the side of the receiver. The rear sight is the long-range version with a long leaf marked out to very long yardage.The aftermarket stock is in very nice condition, fits the pistol nicely, and has real leather straps and surround.This pistol would make a great addition to anyone's collection. Own a piece of history - one of the first machine pistols, beginning production in 1896! Also called the Box Cannon, since the box holster is made of wood.I can meet at a gun shop in South Mount Vernon where the transfer is only $25. I might be able to meet in Bellingham as well, or farther south if I'm heading that way. Buyer pays transfer fee. This would qualify for C&R; I can sell directly to C&R FFL holders.

The gun is awesome and it's been perfect for me through 400ish rounds, but I'm consolidating my pistol calibers to 9mm and all she does is sit in the safe now. The gun comes with 2 factory 15 round mags (I lost the 3rd one...yes I know...let the shame come down) a ""KT Gunfighter"" OWB Kydex holster, five .45ACP snapcaps (throwing in for free because I don't need them lol), 311 rounds of assorted ammo (200 brass case 230fmj, 100 aluminum case 230grain fmj, and 11 brass case 185grain hollow points all of which is factory ammunition) and the plastic ammo can that is pictured. I purchased this new a a little over a year ago as a college graduation present to myself so I am the only owner and the gun was cleaned after every use and only carried it a few times. There are slight wear marks from shooting the gun and a rub mark on the slide from the holster (will try to put in the pictures if not just ask and I'd be more than happy to send you one), but those are the only blemishes on the gun. I'm looking to trade for a fullsize or compact 9mm and I'm more than happy to take partial trades plus cash or you can throw in ammo or a mosin or something to make up the difference in value. I'm not an MSRP duoche and realize this is a used gun and value is in the eyes of the beholder so don't be worried about sending an offer as long as it's close in value I'd be willing to wiggle as long as you do the same.Those are just suggestions please feel free to make offers, the worst I can say is no and like I said before I'm not a gun snob and won't get offended I promise. I am a CHL carrier and would prefer you be the same, Obviosuly you would need to be of legal age and be eligable to own  firearm for me to accept trade. I'd be more than happy to do a bill of sale and meet you half way in a reasonable place at a reasonable time. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great rest of your week!"
