I got this as a gift and simply have no need for it, but I do need a home defense shotgun (see below for trade options). It can handle the 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. You can see from the picture that the retail price is $541 new. Never been fired and I'm offering it for $475 ($66 cheaper plus no tax). The catch is that I will only sell or trade to someone in Ohio so it will be easy and we can do the buy in person to avoid shipping, FFL and all of those troubles. Please expect that I will ask to see your license and that you will not be a criminal (as the law requires). Everything that's pictured in the box is included also.

All magazines are 6 round capacity.I'm including an extremely useful pocket holster by Blackhawk, I've never had it come out of my pocket on the draw. I'm also including the box the weapon came in along with the manual, and original zipper carrying case.The weapon has a very low round count, the original owner hadn't fired it at all. My wife and I have only put about 150 rounds through it before I changed out the old laser for the new one in March 2017. Since then I've only put another 25 rounds through it. I haven't zeroed the laser because frankly I don't know how and I've never used one. The sights are dead on though.Weapon functions flawlessly, it's accurate and makes a great conceal carry or backup weapon. The green 3x5 card is indicative of the weapon's capabilities. I originally bought if for my wife, but someone shared a Glock 42 with her at the range and that was that.I'm looking for $350.00 cash, and the buyer must show me good guy credentials such as a DCJS card or conceal carry permit.

This is a very hard to find gun that I have had in my collection. I have only taken it to the range once and fired approximately 100 rounds through it. This is a double and single action pistol with decocker and an amazing trigger pull. Also comes with 3 mags and 3 interchangable back straps.

If interested please email me. I can also send more pictures if interestedThanks."
