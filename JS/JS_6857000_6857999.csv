Featuring the accuracy, reliability and durability of all SIG SAUER products, the P225-A1 combines the elements of the company's history with the cutting-edge manufacturing of modern day SIG.

It is in excellent shape. The rifle has a stainless fluted Green Mountain barrel, and a laminate thumbhole stock. It has the conversion that allows the use of a 209 primer without any special primer holders. I will also include the original breech and primer holders.It is very accurate with the Blackhorn 209 and 200 Grain Hornady SST, or 195 Grain Barnes bullets that I'm including in the sale. It has weaver style bases in the rear and a fiber optic front sight. Included with the rifle is 2 bottles(1 open, but nearly full) of Blackhorn 209, 13x 195 grain Barnes, 9x Hornady 200 SST, 4x Hornady quickloaders, 5 charge tubes, a EZ rod starter, a jar of T/C Lubed patches, several mops, jags, and bore brushes. Also, if you want, I will include a set of Warne 30mm scope rings for an additional $25.This is a top of the line muzzleloader, not a cheapo special combo you'd find at the local gunstore. Knight is now calling this model the Mountaineer, and it sells for over $1000.I am only selling because I recently switched to a custom smokeless muzzleloader, and no longer use this one. The asking price is firm. I'm not interested in trades. Cash only. Put a local phone number in your email or I will assume you are a scammer."

No jams like many of this cal have issues with, misfired once one some extreamly hard primered rounds but an enhanced pin will fix any problems. Bcg is an mpi brand and has an anderson lower on a yankee hill upper with a utg stock and gas block no issues anywhere or with anything on it. Very good shell for fun shooting since its the same price as 223 but packs way more punch for coyotes! Wpnt even be a problem for deer hunting so tell your wife its one gun for everything!
