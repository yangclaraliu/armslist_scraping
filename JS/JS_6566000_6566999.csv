This is a 6+1 capacity, 9mm single stack carry gun with a 3"" barrel. 1 factory mag and gun lock included.  I've owned many compacts, and of the 9mm family I prefer this one over any others I have had.  My honest opinion of Kahr is that they are as well built as an H&K/Sig. This gun fits most glock 43/42 holsters as well.  Unfortunately, it just sits in the safe so its time to make some room.  These pistols sell new for $350-$425 with tax/shipping/transfer. If you're looking for a well built, reliable ccw in 9mm (and don't want the usual Glock/ S&W or Springfield) this is your gun. Priced well at $300. Most people on Armslist overprice their listing due to quick online searches, using overpriced local gun shops retail msrp and just plain old lack of firearm value. My  guns are priced to sell and I have conducted many quick and easy transactions on this website due to my pricing since 2013.   I buy and sell alot of firearms, so please do not waste either of our time. If necessary I will pay for transfer at Stop Drop and Shop or Family Firearms. Or if you have a Colorado CCW Permit that could be a more conveinent option. DO NOT EMAIL if you want a fast response. CASH ONLYNo trades of ANY kind at this time, NO SHIPPING, thank you for reading- Best Regards,     JayI prefer phone calls or text messages to my personal cell REDACTED.  I will send actual photos via phone. Armslist will not let me post my actual photos."

I'm asking $600 for this one, and it has the upgraded stock and cheek pad, as well as sling and of course the chokes and wrench.  I would be open to trades, with cash on either end.  I could be interested in other shotguns or hunting firearms of all types.  I'm also interested in pistols and rifles, especially AR or similar platforms that are piston driven. Optics or other long range accessories would also be considered. Perhaps even ammo! Let me know what you have(especially if it's a beretta 92 or Sig P226 or similar!).

Also added a FailZero nickel-boron hammer. I had the upper and lower receivers duracoated FDE but didn't like the finished result, so I had them soda blasted.

This rifle is, in effect, an effort to adapt the venerable HK G36 to the civilian marketplace. These were imported from 1998 - 2011 in their various forms. Whereas the G36 features a pistol grip and folding stock, the SL8-1 features a fixed thumbhole stock. Additionally, the SL8-1 rifle only accepts single stack mags (offered in 5, 10 and 20 round capacities) whereas the G36 accepts double stacked mags available in higher capacities. Other modifications have been made to the SL8 series of rifles including a lightened trigger pull, adjustable cheek piece and butt plate to customize the fit to the user, and a heavier, more accurate barrel. There are also a number of folks that have customized their SL8 rifles to resemble the G36, which of course, you have to option to do so with this SL8-1 rifle......."

It has been locked away since 1985 and not used till recently. After I recently retired I found time to shoot and started using my guns. It comes in the case with all it originally came with. The case has the original sticker with serial # on the side and original target and manual and other paper work and 2 magazines. I've taken the gun to the range and it seems to have a failure to feed/eject at least once per magazine and is very fussy about ammo. CCI mini-mags work best. I don't believe it did this before I locked it away in 1985. It has approximately 500 or 600 rounds through it total. It is in Excellent condition and I'm sure a good gunsmith can get it to function perfectly. To find one in this physical shape in the original box with all paperwork is far and few between.  I'm in Madison Wi.. I will sell in person and for cash only. I will show you the original bill of sale to me showing I am the original owner. Personal preference that you must be over 25 years old and possess a Wisconsin drivers license. I will make a copy of your license for my records only. Thanks for looking. E-mail any questions.
