When I received this stock it had a reddish orange color to it. I stripped and cleaned all the old finish. Then I started to apply the new oil finish and dye to enhance the natural beauty of the wood grain. I lost count of how many coats of oil I applied using the wet sanding technique, but I'm guessing it's upwards of 30 coats of oil. It took about 2 months of working on it with all the drying time between the coats. But this stock turned out beautifully. It comes with a usgi vented fiberglass handguard that I cleaned and painted black, the handguard is in great shape. The stock also has the original front mounting hardware for the vertical grip. An original M14e2 sling in perfect condition, it also has an original rear sling swivel and bushing which are getting harder to find. The stock also has a reproduction rubber buttplate and screw set. It also comes with an original e2 coil spring set, that I bought with hopes of finding original parts and completing it. I've attached pictures of how I received it and how it looks now since it's been refinished. Can get more pictures if needed.Price is $550 shipped to the lower 48"

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the most difficult multi-gun stages. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK® rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnifed optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the course designer’s most difficult stages. The V11 Pro carries the new SLiM Rail 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue.

$880 firm in cash or best trade offer.  
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR uppers in 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel.  9mm lower, Law Tactical Gen 3-M, KAK Shockwave kits, side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 30+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe nice micro red dots.  Not interested in online retail prices.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, flakes or POS scammers!

The finger grooves and Glock hump have been removed. The trigger is undercut, and the grip has been scale style stippled cut down to accept Glock 19 round mags for concealability. The frame has also been scooped by the mag release. The pictures show it with several different magazines in it for reference. The Glock will come with standard Glock sites. I am posting this to see if anyone is interested in trading for another Glock 17 gen 3 or 4. I have another project in mind that I would like to try. If not, then I will get this recoated and carry it for another year or so. It is currently a very worn flat dark earth and dark gray. Email to contact me."

Nothing copied. No trades at this time.
Built on the same standard as the military RPK, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK barrel.
Vepr in .308 Win. caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

$350 in cash or may trade.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment except AR pistol parts like the KAK Shockwave kits and around a 10"" or less 5.56 AR upper and short(4.5""+) AR 9mm upper.  Will listen to other trades, just let me know what you have and what you want for it.  
Example, I know the complete 5.56 and 9mm uppers on PSA go for around the same price as I'm asking per case, so I would do a straight trade on a 9mm upper and maybe on the 5.56 too, depending on what you have.  If you have something nicer, then obviously I will trade more ammo and/or cash, depending.
