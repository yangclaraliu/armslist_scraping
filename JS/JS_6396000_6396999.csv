This system works due to the multi spring intricate rod (three springs) and controls the functionality of the gun. The third spring which is contained within the rod controls the movement of the slide so it never rams on the frame. Also accompanying this system is a bushing and two separate external springs so the shooter can fine-tune the weapon for his/her personal standards. Fits Walther P99 amd PPQ M2 & long slide. Lightly used (less than 100 rounds). These sell for around $80 on Amazon. Asking $50. Thanks for looking!

I have seen 2 sell on Cabela's websites: one was $1250 and one was over $1400. That being said, this one does have some handling marks on the stocks and fine scratches on the barrels. I would say unit worth a little over a grand. The barrels could be redone if you want them perfect or it can easily be used as is. This would make a perfect upland bird or sporting clays gun, especially, if you expect to take it through some thick stuff. I have too many 12 gauges and am more of an over under kinda guy. Asking $650. Please email or text with any questions. Thanks! Steve REDACTEDSide note: I had to select a brand. It is not really a European Armory or whatever. It is a Spanish made double -  very quality gun."
