Cash, no trades/checks
 
I have for sale, my most prized handgun. This is an absolute gem. I have never had even one malfunction. This gun is hardly broken in and I would estimate it has well under 500 rounds through it. I purchased this new. Buyer must agree to bill of sale created by me (with input from YOU!). 
 
This is a full sized, SA/DA Sig Sauer P226 Combat Threaded Barrel and I will include the original 15 round magazine and my primary 20 round magazine. I love this magazine and have never had any issues what so ever with it feeding, etc. with the extended magazine, I have been able to carry 21 rounds of 9mm at all times (with 15 more in the spare mag just in case!) I will include the following:Factory caseSig P226 Combat TB - lightly used
Streamlight TRL-1S (Strobe) - used
Bravo Concealment Holster and Mag Holster - used (fits nice!)1- 15 Rd mag- used1- 20 Rd mag- used6- 9mm ""snap caps"" - new out of packageOffers considered. 
The P226 Combat with threaded barrel is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The P226 Combat performs like no other .9mm available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P226 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights. - See more at: https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/57608/Firearms/Handguns/Sig+Sauer/Sig+Sauer+E26R-9-CBT-TB+P226+Combat+TB+15%2B1+9mm+4.4#sthash.Y0r5xrtP.dpuf"

I've had it for less than two weeks, the gun it was supposed to go on has never been shot. It was out of the box for a total of about 4 hours.
The optic is in perfect condition. There isn't as much as a fingerprint on the housing or a piece of dust on the lens.
I'm selling it because it was purchased for a dream rifle build, but the dream optic was a tan EOTech. Part of that involved a grey cerakote job in combination with the tan EOTech, however I decided to save the $300 on the cerakote and just go with a black rife. I also decided that the extra weight with the EOTech was unnecessary considering I put a 32oz stainless barrel on the rifle.
Unfortunately for me, I changed my mind. I want to cerakote this thing, and I want to go with the EOTech. 
More pictures are available on request.
 
I want $475 shipped for the optic and the mount, but I'm open to offers. The original case, the tools for the mount, and all the original paperwork will be included."

This package includes the rifle equipped with a picatinny top optics rail. I am including a UTG rail handguard system. 12x aluminum 20rnd German HKG3. 2x steel 20rnd German HKG3 magazines. And a rubberized dual-magazine belt pouch.For those unfamiliar, the CETME is the Spanish armaments manufacturer Centro de Estudios Tecnicos de Materiales Especiales. What has come to be known in America as the CETME (pronounced set-mee) rifle is actually a Century Arms import of demilled CETME Model 58 rifles that are reassembled into what CAI has dubbed the C308 Sporter. The CETME 58 was the foundation of what would later become the German Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifle. This CAI C308 retains all the features and benefits that the Model 58 boasts such as the awesome Spanish heavy-duty steel. The rifle is as ergonomic as you would expect any G3 pattern rifle to be and shoots extremely smoothly. The muzzle device provides a great deal of compensation and felt recoil is amazingly low for the full-power 7.62x51/308 cartridge. The rifle IS capable of taking just about any commercially available 308 or 7.62x51 cartridge. It is fully compatible with the highly inexpensive and widely available G3 or PTR91 magazines. Atop all this, there’s nothing really more satisfying than performing the HK-slap.I am unsure of the exact history of this rifle on terms of its exact manufacture or how it was treated under the ownership of the previous owners. I can attest to the flawless function of the rifle and my thorough maintenance and replacement of all springs and pins within the rifle to refresh it. No-go and headspace gauges have been used to ensure the rollers are in happy condition and that the rifle has a great deal of life left for decades of shooting fun.I can provide a plethora of additional images. Will ship if desired, you pay shipping, fees, and FFL fees. I prefer Paypal Paypal fees covered by buyer or F&F.Price is rock solid, I am in no need or hurry to sell. $650 is already my absolute bottom dollar.I am only looking to trade UP in value (your stuff has to be worth much more than $650 USED bottom-dollar-market value. Trades I'm particularly interested in would be:Glock 34 Gen4 w/ a slide-mounted red dotM1 Garand (only needs to function, cosmetic damage A-ok)Keltec KSGGood Quality AK74 w/ some magsI can almost guarantee you that your AR15, generic AK, or generic pistols will not catch my interest. If you want to ""add cash"" to a partial trade, I will value your items at the BOTTOM-DOLLAR-USED VALUE. I will search for what I can find the absolute lowest price on the used market is for your item, and that is all I will deduct from the value of my rifle."
