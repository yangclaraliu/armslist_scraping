PRODUCT SUMMARY
With continually evolving designs, rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility, the Model 870 has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years. Beneath the no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in Remington's legendary Model 870 Wingmaster, but at a much more affordable price. Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.
Exclusive 2-7x32MM scoped package with fully rifled 23"" cantilevered barrel on a synthetic thumbhole stock.

Black with gray interior, power windows and doors, A/C which I'm sure doesn't work, although I didn't check. Not perfect, but better than most. Was a southern truck until about 2008. Now has/had body rust in the typical places, fender wells have been repaired, tailgate is pretty crappy. Floors and body mounts are rock solid. Interior is probably a 7 out of 10, the armrests need replaced and the driver's seat is ripped. The dash and the carpet are perfect though. It has Warn lockout hubs.  Unknown mileage, odometer reads about 30K.  The truck has been sitting unused for about 6 years. It sat inside the first 5, outside this past year. The tires are flat spotted, but have tread and aren't dry rotted. I don't know if the flat spots will come out. It does not drive well at high speeds the way it is.  It also developed an exhaust leak where the downtube meets the catalytic converter from sitting outside this past year.   The paint is oxidized but would come back with some compound, there's a few places where it's flaked off like it tended to do in those years.  I have a Western traditional plow frame for it that was never mounted if you want it. Just the frame, no pump, lights or blade.  The emergency lightbar comes with it, it's not hooked up. If you want me to take it off, the price goes up, not down.  It starts, runs and drives. Needs a battery, I'll put a new one in if I get around to it. It's not registered or insured, so there will be no test drives. I'll take you for a short ride on the pavement in it, and prove the 4WD drive works on the gravel. $1500 cash or offer, would consider taking quality American made guns on trade. Looking specifically for a Colt Officers model .45, Smith K or L frames revolvers in .38 or .357 only preferebly in SS or quality AR uppers in 5.56, maybe a battle rifle in .308.  Or a kids 120 snowmobile.

You can't find this particular gun anywhere nowadays, it's very rare to come across one. I have shot around 20 rounds through it, and killed 3 deer. This gun is hands down the best shooting, cleanest, lightest rifle I have ever possessed in my 20+ years of hunting and being around guns, but I regretfully have to let it go! It has the DURA-TECH armor coating. On the scope, I installed the Leupold flip up scope covers that are really nice to have and makes things super easy in the stand. The gun is currently sighted in to be dead-on @200 yds, with Federal Nosler Partition 180gr. Shooting 1.5"" high @100 yds. And dead-on it is, everytime!!! Holds 3+1 rounds (3 in clip +1 in chamber). Would like to see it go to a good owner who will take care of it. Letting it go for a STEAL of $1,750, some negotitation possible but not likely.

I put it on the gun, and then i found a completely new gun on sale, so decided to go that route now. The rear iron sight was removed for the mounting of a scope, but other than that it is brand new. Anyone could easily press in a new adjustable rear sight. I paid $180. Asking $140 because I removed that rear sight. Open to trades for ammo or hunting stuff. will add cash if needed for a trade."

The .41 Short Rimfire was no barn-burner in the ballistics department, with its light blackpowder charge pushing a 130-grain lead bullet at 425 fps, producing an anemic muzzle energy of some 53 ft.-lbs.One of the Moore follow-ons, the ""Southerner"" Derringer was a neat little turn-barrel pistol. Its name, emblazoned on the top of the barrel, was obviously intended to appeal to buyers south of the Mason-Dixon line, though incongruously it was manufactured in Newburyport, Mass., by Merrimack Arms and Brown Mfg. Co. Perhaps it was the makers' attempt at letting bygones be bygones-though probably it was just a very clever marketing ploy.Standard Southerners measured 5 inches overall and had 2 1/2-inch iron barrels, spur triggers, walnut or rosewood grips and either iron or brass frames. Some 6,500 were made between 1867 and 1869 marked on their barrels, ""MERRIMACK ARMS & MANUFACTURING CO/NEWBURYPORT/MASS/PATENTED APRIL 9, 1867."" Another 10,000 were turned out from 1869 to 1873 by Merrimack's successor with their barrels stamped, ""BROWN MANUFACTURING CO/NEWBURYPORT, MASS/PAT APR.9, 1869.""Barrels were blued, and iron frames were either blued or case-hardened. Brass frames were silver-plated. Sometimes engraved, ivory-gripped specimens of both will be encountered. While most Southerners had square butts, there were a small number made by Brown with rounded grips and 2 1/2- or 4-inch barrels. These are scarce and do bring a premium. A small number of seconds were sold with their frames marked ""IMPERFECT."" These, too, have added value.Interestingly enough, like the one shown here, a large proportion of Southerners encountered exhibit considerable wear, indicating they definitely were carried. Given their small size, ease of use, good engineering and pleasing, ergonomic configuration this is understandable.Gun: Southerner DerringerManufacturer: Brown Mfg.
