This is an entry level rifle, no fancy free float handguard or five hundred dollar trigger. Just a reliable, accurate working rifle for a good price.           The lower is a New frontier armory lw-15 polymer lower with factory m4 stock with mft cheek rest and a2 grip. For being a low cost lower receiver it has a very nice trigger pull in the 5# range and a short reset. These polymer lowers come with an extra takedown pin from the factory as polymer pins are known to break after 1k rounds, an easy fix is to drop in a steel one. This rifle has had no issues but I will include the extra pin.   The upper receiver is m4 flat top with t marks made by Redx arms and has a 16"" stainless steel m4 feed ramp barrel topped with a miculek muzzle break. The bolt carrier is a psa premium hpt/mpi. Has a non free floated quad rail and railed gas block.

Please understand, I am not in a ""must sell"" situation and if you add up the gun and extras and you will see my price is very fair and resonable.  If interested, please contact Don at Seven-Zero-Two, Eight-Zero-Four, Nine-Two-Seven-Seven.  Please be 21 or older w a current or lifetime gun permit and we can do bill of sale.  No permit, we can do transfer at FFL (Warrior Arms).  Thanks for looking and have a great day or night.  OH, LOCAL AND CASH ONLY."

Please understand, I am not in a ""must sell"" situation and if you add up the gun and extras and you will see my price is very fair and resonable.  If interested, please contact Don at Seven-Zero-Two, Eight-Zero-Four, Nine-Two-Seven-Seven.  Please be 21 or older w a current or lifetime gun permit and we can do bill of sale.  No permit, we can do transfer at FFL (Warrior Arms).  Thanks for looking and have a great day or night.  OH, LOCAL AND CASH ONLY"

It was new when I got it and I have only put 100 rounds threw it just doesn't do as much for me as I thought it would. Would be interested in a 270 or 7mm but will consider all other calibers. Make me a offer worse I will say is no would also consider semi auto shotguns. If you wanna buy it out right make me a offer. The Leupold scope on it can be included for the right offer but doesn't have to come with the scope. I have a 110 rounds of assorted ammo to go with the rifle. You can reach me threw my email or text REDACTED. I am in the military so I'll get back to you when I can.

This is a german made, single shot, bolt action chambered in .22 long rifle. This old war horse has seen some stuff in it's lifetime. Story I was told by the owners son, is that it was used in a slaughter house back in the day. Stock was cracked somewhere along the line, and was repaired many many years ago. Very old repair. Whoever repaired it did a right fine job, using small dowels to pin it back together, then it was refinished. All most all of the blueing is gone, but no rust or pits anywhere. Still has the original Geco stamp on the top of the receiver and on the right side of the stock. Complete with the extractor (which would be very easy to lose when you remove the bolt) Action works as it should. Bore is still pretty decent, no pits, but needs a good cleaning which I will leave up to the next owner. All I have done is apply a light coat of oil for protection.VERY RARE PIECE!!Interesting Trades considered. Willing to add cash on my end if need be.Reasonable cash offers considered."

It comes with the necessary Midwest Industries barrel nut and barrel nut wrench. To install, it will require cleaning of the nut and screws with some acetone, application of red loc-tite to the screws, and blue loc-tite to the outside of the barrel nut. If you purchase this, I'd highly recommend a call to the excellent customer service reps at Midwest Industries to get the exact torque and installation instructions for the handguard (I lost my instructions).

I've had a blast on this, but haven't been able to ride it much since having kids, so it's time to go. I've added a bunch of stuff to it since purchasing and have it set up just how I like it. This bike is both trail and road ready....your choice.  First let me just say that these bikes are almost indestructible....almost. A small part deep within the bike, commonly called the ""doohickey"" (balance idle lever) is the only weak point on these machines.  One of the first things I did after purchasing, was swap that piece out and ensure that I wouldn't have an issue with it...which I haven't. So the ""doohickey"" work has been done. I've also added Tusk pannier racks to both sides and fixed lockable ammo cans (that I think add to the overall look of the bike, as well as act as armor in case of a drop) as pannier boxes. They are spacious, durable, and totally secure. They lock both to the rack and I have it set up so that the lid locks as well. I've also added a Top Box Quick Connect from Back Road Equipment to the rear of the bike and attached a Pellican 1550 box to the back. This allows me to remove the Pellican Box whenever I want (for instance if I'm travelling and my necessary items are in the box) without having to unbolt the box from the bike. This is also lockable. And for those that don't know about Pellican Boxes...do some research, they're the best. They're expensive, but worth it. So in summary, this thing is good to go. For an adventure bike, you simply can't do any better than this. Low miles, equipment already purchased and installed, and all the standard features and protective skid plating that comes with a KLR 650."

I hate to even sell this gun as this is a gun that just keeps shooting.  Its actually the only gun i have ever had that has never jammed, nor had a stoppage of any sort. That said, this gun no longer fits into my larger plan. I need to make room in my safe (and my budget) for my new plans.
I would like to sell this as a package and would offer the whole kit for $2,650."

Note that the entire rifle is up for sale for $1300 as well but would prefer to just sell the upper and everything else listed as extras. The Upper is Made up as so: The Upper is a JSE Surplus 6.5, with a 20 inch bull barrel, YHM 308 brake, YHM Freefloat rail and gas system. Higher End Chrome Bolt Carrier and Alexander Arms Bolt Head. Anmbidextrous Charging Handle, Single point QD sling mount, Bipod Picatinny to swivel stud adapter, and an AR-PEPR 30mm set of rings (NO scope) Overall This is a pretty Maxed out Grendel Build, have done 1/2 to 3/4 MOA before with a 5 shot group, about 300 rounds through upper, no issues. The gun also comes with 8 15rd ASC 6.5 MAgs with couplers so the mags can be attached in groups of 2, Hornady Reloading DIes and a WFT-2 CAse Trimmer with a 6.5 head (Basically most of what you need to reload Grendel if you already load for other rifle calibers). Including all the ammo i have which is 300rds of brass cased (Some are Handloads in only new Unfired Brass, No Reloaded Cases... Tested to Well within Safe Pressures and under 1MOA Groups), and 257 rounds of Wolf Steel cased (total of 557 rounds). Also 92 pieces of fired BrassOnly Reason I am selling the upper is to put money into a new platform. Note that what you get here would cost you about $1500-1600 New, that cost does not include the lower. This rifle is a pretty nice all around platform, recoils only slightly more than a 5.56, and the accuracy is certainly there. I am open to offers and possibly trades depending on what you have. Would most likely be willing to trade for an AR10, a Bullpup or compact tactical rifle, or a Long range bolt Gun, possibly something in 50 bmg. Any questions let me know. ... Also originally listed the entire rifle so the pics will reflect as such. What you get here is everything minus the complete lower. If anybody is interested in the entire rifle Im willing to do 1300. The Lower is pretty high end, Match 2 pound trigger, Magpul Pistol Grip and trigger guard, LUTH-AR MBA-1 buttstock. Dont be afraid to shoot me a cash or trade offer, worst I can do is say im not interested, Thanks"
