From the serial number, this pistol appears to have been manufactured in 1921 in Hungary.
This particular pistol is interesting in that is has a Norwegian police “POLITI” marking. After the liberation of Norway in WWII, German soldiers surrendered all of their arms. Many of these surrendered weapons were 7.65mm pistols. After the war many of these pistols were inspected and pushed into service with the Norwegian police. Supposedly, from what I’ve read, only 55 Frommer stops were accepted by the Norwegians, and they were numbered 8001 to 8055. The Norwegian serial number on this pistol is 8007, making it the 7th Frommer accepted. It also has a strange ""Sr"" in a box on the trigger guard, which I have been unable to identify.
This is a very cool pistol that utilizes a long recoil action, where both the bolt and the barrel travel backwards together.
Overall, the pistol Is in ok shape. The metal has a grey-brown patina all over. There is some very light spotting in some areas. The bore looks to be in good shape. Magazine is not original and seems to be a reproduction.
I originally had some cycling issues with this pistol, but I replaced the bolt head and now it functions flawlessly. I'll includes the original bolt head just in case the buyer wants to tinker with it.
Given the rarity of these, I'm not sure what it's really worth, so I'm asking $700 or best offer.

I'm located in Fairfax city, but I make it down to Harrisonburg fairly often, and could possibly meet down that way."

Up for sale or trade is a Century C91 (HK-91 / G3 Clone). This is one of the older “Good ones” where they were using original German G3 parts to assemble these rifles thus retaining a lot of the originality, it’s more “G3” than C91. This rifle is a 7.62x51 Nato (.308) and comes with 3x magazines. This rifle is unfired and has very little wear as it lived in my safe for many years. I am selling it to raise funds for a stainless Ruger New Vaquero in .45 cal with a 4.5 barrel.
Will trade for a Stainless New Vaquero with some accessories/ammo or a little extra cash (the rifle is worth a bit more than the Vaquero) – OR – Would do straight trade for one of the engraved ones ala-carte.
Will consider all offers of WWII pistol/rifles, or other curio relic style arms.
 
Interested in:
* Stainless New Vaquero in .45 with 4.5 barrel

On top of the rifle It comes with its origional Bushnel scope, unsure of the power/ magnification but it holds very nice. Even though .223 ins't a big round per say this rifle has very little kick if shot properly. Since purchased this rifle has mostly been a padded case closet flower, not because we dont like to shoot, just the places we've lived were to inconvenient to shoot recreationally. That being said this rifle has had less than 50 rounds total put through it. Its been a ladies gun so what else can I say? If your looking for something for your kid of wife keep this rifle in mind. It will be worth it. Price is listed as $400.00 and is negotiable."

The reciever is about .100 too long, which causes the top cover to pop up, plus the recoil spring has a kink in it, causing it to short stroke unless you hold the cover down. I never finished (as in painted) the reciever.  Barrel is original and all numbers match. There are a couple of ways you can fix this. one is to spot weld a shim to the back of the dust cover OR the lugs that hold the dust cover at the rear trunion. Or get a new reciever and make sure it fits BEFORE riveting! It's a nice gun if you hold down the cover, but that gets old fast! I will include 4 metal 30 round magazines and 1 magpul 30 rounder. Bring your own case. $400 or best reasonable offer."

Has superficial black discoloration from copper 2 oxide.  It's the result of copper's natural reaction with air.  It creates a coating, like bluing or parkerizing, that inhibits corrosion.  It's not like rust on steel that eats into and weakens the metal- this surface oxidation does not penetrate the brass.  Call an ammo manufacturer, ask for their metalurgical engineer, then ask them why they don't coat their brass to prevent copper oxide.  If brass contacting air makes brass unsafe, they'd coat it.  I've shot both the Israeli and British ammo and they both work great.  All 1100 rounds $550 or trade for guns"
