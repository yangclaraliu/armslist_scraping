I am the second owner, the first owner put very little through it as it looked brand new when I got it. I've put about 200-300 down range with both the stock barrel and with an extended barrel to use my suppressor on. Never any issues, really excellent gun. Handles just about any kind of Ammo, haven't had any FTF's with hollow points either (unlike my old Kimbers).the bobbed tail on this makes it perfect for a everyday carry gun, I can throw in a galco learher/kydex holder for an additional $50. Comes with box, and all the original stuff along with two 8-rd Dan Wesson Mags and two additional 8rd mags that I cannot recall the name of at the moment. I will also throw in about 100rds of Ammo, mostly hollow points. Asking $1,500 OBO - I prefer cash but I can also accept credit or debit cards but I'll have to add an additional 3% as it's through my company account.Please text/call Nathan @ REDACTED"

Xtreme Situations require an Xtreme Blade, and the SXB meets that demand and then some! Why play in the wild when you can DOMINATE it!!!EJ Snyder is an Xtreme Survivalist and Adventurer in real life and as seen on TV. He is also a highly decorated, 25-year Army Combat Vet who served in the 1991 Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. EJ knows what it takes to survive in a multitude of extreme situations from the wilderness to combat, and he has been tested and proven every time.EJ wanted to design a modern day blade that honors the spirit of the pioneers of the past but meets the demands of an ever evolving modern world, and a tactical survival tool that is as tough, durable, and dependable as he is; one that every warrior, survivalist, and outdoorsman couldn’t live without. The SXB is the Xtreme Tool for any Xtreme Job!!!EJ's quest for such a knife started on the Serengeti Plains of Tanzania, Africa while conducting a 21 day Xtreme Survival challenge on ""Naked and Afraid"". The knife EJ took with him, being the only piece of equipment he had, did not perform well in the field and became non-functional. It is potentially disastrous to be out there and unable to rely on your knife. Upon his return to the U.S., EJ tested many knives, sought out the advice of many top custom knife makers he personally knew, and spent countless hours researching all aspects of the art of knife making. A lot of influences, needs, and rigorous tests went into the thought process and design behind the SXB. His 2 year journey culminated with the creation of his vision by TOPS Knives.The ""Skullcrusher Xtreme Blade"" (SXB), for all your Survival and Fighting needs. When you need it most...this BEAST will take you to the Xtreme!!! BAD guys and BAD situations...you've just been put on notice! ""THE SXB.....DON'T JUST SURVIVE...DOMINATE!!!"

Extremely rare to find a 380 though the .32s can be found somewhat readily but those are the same size as the 380.I purchased around a year ago but have not shot it. After I got it and found out how rare they are I planned to just keep it in the safe but circumstances have changed and I would like to sell it. I have a really nice Sneaky Pete belt holster that is about the size of a cell phone carrier and draws no attention to it at all. I also have a pocket holster I will include. Last but not least you will get a box of ammo to go with it along with the original box with an extra spring that comes with it new.Those legally able to purchase a handgun only. A bill of sale will be required. We will meet in a public location that we agree on for the transaction.Trades considered would be a Kahr CM9 plus cash, Glock 43 plus cash, or maybe even a Keltec Pf9 plus cash.Thanks!"

DO NOT install a shoulder stock or a shorter length pistol grip on this firearm! If proper paperwork is not filed with the ATF Prior to doing so this would be a violation of Federal Law punishable by up to 10 years in prison! Description: A 13.5"" barrel Remington 870 12 Gauge that's NOT considered a Short-Barreled Shotgun or an AOW! The overall length of the firearm comes in at 27"" How is this legal? By definition of what the ATF considers a shotgun the original firearm was never a shotgun despite it's ability to fire shotgun shells. This firearm is considered an ""other"" because in order to fit the definition of a shotgun it must have been manufactured with a shoulder stock in order to be ""fired from the shoulder"". Therefor it cannot be considered a ""sawn-off"" shotgun either, as it never met the ATF's criteria to be a shotgun in the first place. Since this firearm is not a shotgun, it is not required to have at least an 18"" barrel. Also the overall length exceeds 26"" therefor it cannot be classified as a AOW (Any Other Weapon) which would require a tax stamp and Class III registration with the ATF."
