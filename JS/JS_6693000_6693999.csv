I recently got this but have to let it go to my divorce. It needs a few things but I bought it to hang on the wall.The Cons:- The dust cover, front and rear sights are missing/ broke. Orginals are easy to find on E-Bay etc.  Along with that the barrel and feeding tube wiggle a little bit so before it is shot it defeitley needs to be checked out by a gunsmith. The trigger is a bit rough so some springs etc. may need to be replaced.The Pros:- At $750 it's a deal for an original 1873 Winchester. - With a little bit of easy work it would be worth even more!"

Originals are easy to find on E-Bay etc. Along with that the barrel and feeding tube wiggle a little so definetly will need to be checked out by a gunsmith before being shot. The trigger is a little rough so may need to have some springs etc. replaced. The Pros:- At $595 it is a deal for an original 1873 Winchester, you will not find another one this cheap anywhere!"

Especially for summer carry.  Well loved and carried.  Has light scratches in the finish from being carried (nothing crazy).  The front sight popped off on its 2nd range run and was never seen again.  I never bothered to replace it.  Gun functions flawlessly, never malfunctioned except for launching the front sight into orbit.  Has less than 100 rounds through it.  Comes with 2 mags and original case, literature and box.  2 mags. One is Ruger factory and one is aftermarket promag, used once, great condition.  $175 cash. Buyer pays transfer fee at local FFL.  Must have CPL."

No rust that I see, but an area on the left rear of the receiver shows finish wear, and there's an area on the barrel where they got carried away removing the reflective tape that Oregon put on there. It's not bad as is, but would also be a nice candidate for Cerakote--what I was actually thinking when I got it. Too many projects, though. Anyway, there she is. Transfer is on the buyer (Quantico tactical does it for $15 with a one-day notice), cash only, will not ship. Thanks for looking, and have a nice day."

Magazine cut-off is located near trigger guard and must be pushed to eject shell from magazine. This allows shooter to clear chamber but keep magazine loaded. Safety: The primary safety is located on the backside of the trigger guard. When engaged, the safety is designed to block the trigger, hammer lever and the hammer which makes the firing mechanism immobile. Magazine: Tubular magazine; bottom loading. Shot plug is included and comes installed. Shot plug is easily removable by unscrewing the magazine cap. Simply pull plug out and replace magazine cap.If interested, contact me at the email provided."

This particular gun was manufactured originally in 1916. This rifle started life as an M96 then the barrel was shortened from 29"" to 24"" as part of the conversion to a M38 rifle by Carl Gustav armorers. That would make this rifle technically an M96/38, but the Swedes did not distinguish between these converted rifles and the other M38s. These Swedish Mausers are known to be good accurate shooters, and the 6.5x55 round shoots flat and has low recoil. It is also easy to reload.This particular rifle shows a fair amount of wear on the exterior metal. The stock has some dings and nicks, but is in good overall condition. The bore is typical of these Swedish rifles with a good shine and nice rifling. The stock disks reads ""0"" which is the best possible condition. There is a discrete import mark on the bottom of the muzzle end of the barrel. The numbers match except for the butt plate and the front band (this may have been a miss-strike, since the number is 780 instead of 280). This rifle has one of the rare Vasteras rear sights. These sights were put on the rifle to compensate for the change in sighting with the shortening of the barrel. These sights alone sell for $100 to $150.I just noticed in the photos that this rifle is missing the front sight blade, which I removed to put on a taller one. I've got the sight blade around here somewhere, and will install it before the sale if I can find it. If not, I think a replacement is around $10.I'm asking $400 for the rifle. Sold ""AS IS"". I'm located in Winston Salem.Text me if interested at REDACTED. I have more photos available upon request."
