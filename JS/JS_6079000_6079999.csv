                The barreled action sits in a Cadex Dual Strike Chassis, acquired through GIG Long Range Systems in Port Orange, FL in January of 2015.  It has a 40moa top rail, folding stock with quick adjust cheek rest and length of pull.  Justin, of JMG Firearms in Montoursville, PA did the Cerakote work on the rifle, which is Federal Field Drab. 
                The bipod is a Long Range Accuracy Light Tactical Long Leg.  It cradles the forend tube establishing a solid center of gravity for stable shooting and quick recovery from recoil.  The feet are replaceable and come with the rubber caps on as well as a set of spike feet.  The Trigger is a Jewel set at 2lbs and can be adjusted heaver or lighter.  Up top sits a Nightforce ATACR 5-25x56 with the MOAR-T reticle.  With 120 MOA of travel, excellent glass and precise turrets, this made the rifle fairly easy to shoot at 2000 yards and has enough travel to dial to over 2600 yards, depending on the load.  The scope sits in an ERA-TAC one piece 20 moa mount.  This German made alloy mount is able to accept numerous accessories such as bubble levels, cosine indicators, rail sections and more.  The muzzle brake is a custom creation crafted by John Buhay of US Armament Corp.  It screws on via a 1x14 threads.  With the scope, bipod, and empty magazine, the rifle weighs 26 lbs.  It comes with two 7 round magazines and will accept an overall length of 4.460”. 
                As for accessories, it comes with a set up for reloading.  850 Federal large rifle magnum primers, ~9 lbs of Retumbo.  ~430 Sierra 350 gr bullets, all same lot.  I also have 40 Lehigh 330 gr and a few Cutting Edge 352 gr solids that would be excellent to try.  It comes with 45pcs of Cheytac provided brass with 3 loadings in each.  They have plenty of life left but I would suggest gathering up a fresh batch before seriously shooting it.  Cheytac dies are provided, as well as a Sinclair priming tool.  I have found 137 gr of Retumbo to be the biggest charge without the danger of excessive pressure signs.  With that charge, the Sierra bullets had a muzzle velocity of 3120 fps measured with a Magnetospeed.  The rifle, in its completed form is a year and a half old and has had ~150 rounds fired through it."

All Police shotguns are assembled in a special build area at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build Law Enforcement and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift. All parts that enter the special build area are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality. Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function. A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs. A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds. Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. Law Enforcement shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety. The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.  The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.  The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing. The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a ball detent system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade synthetic magazine spring retainer lock down as used on the Express system. The receivers used in Police guns are vibra honed to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.  Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

It's weird, there are plenty online but they all have a name or a button, something that identifies them and they go from 20-60 dollars so I think 30 is fair.. I really don't want it around, I'm sure it will get me into trouble at some point. I have decided to sell it, I could smash it, but then I would not have money instead.If you like to tinker with things like this, or need it due is intended purpose I want $30, firm. What you do with it is your choice, you break any laws it isn't my fault and I encourage you not to do so. I have given all I know about it so I will not reply to any questions about it,I simply do not know enough about it. I won't haggle since it turns on, it wouldn't if it was broken. IF you show up with less than $30 I'll walk away, no negotiation. I will only meet at the McDonalds on hydraulic, south of Pawnee. Nowhere else. I can show you that it turns on if you want there, but that's all I'll do, afterwards you can put any Sim card you like into it. These are my terms for selling it. I really hate to be this strict about it but although while this is legal to possess it it could be used in an illegal way and I want no part of that. If you want it send an email with your phone number, make model color and year of vehicle you will be driving and a two hour window you be free that day or the next .

Prestige condition and a awesome shotgun. I love this shotgun as my first brand new weapon.  Ive only had the chance to fire it on  4 different occasions and have kept it thoroughly maintained. Had an accident in the family and now to cover bills I'm parting with it. I believe any person who fires it will be very satisfied by its performance as only a well designed shotgun can be. Made from the latest carbon fiber and a steel skeleton it's very light weight and easily carried for long trips through the hunting season. Definitely well worth the extra few dollars.
