I hate to see this rifle go but this time a year I could use the cash more than a rifle. And this is your last chance to purchase a rifle like this with a bullet button before new laws go into effect on January 1st. This rifle must be purchased and DROSed by December 21 for you to have an opportunity to own it for next year.  I live within driving distance of Turners outdoorsman in Torrance or in Signal Hill.  Willing to except reasonable offers but I know how much this rifle is worth I still have the original sales tag. No checks only cash must be Private party transfer DROS at FFL will not sell without."

So.....Up for sale is my highly customized Mossberg 590A1 12 gauge, 8+1 capacity. Gun was purchased new from Cabelas roughly 3 years ago, has probably seen only 200-300 rounds and gone on two deer hunts with me.Since it's purchase, has had just about every component of it upgraded/customized. Has a tritium front sight, extra strength magazine spring, GG&G enhanced magazine follower, Tac-Star 6-shell side saddle shell carrier, Mesa LEO AR adapter with Magpul QD sling attachment, Magpul buffer tube and castle nut, Magpul FDE forend, Magpul FDE MOE stock, Magpul FDE MOE-K grip, and a brand new 800-lumen Streamlight TLR-1S HL in FDE (not pictured).Gun has been absolutely flawless throughout the time I've owned it. Finish has some wear from normal use, could stand a good dose of Cerakote at some point and then would be a beautiful, tacticool gun to last you a lifetime. Asking $975, well over that invested in the gun, and I will cover the stupid transfer fee at an FFL in the Salem area. Only selling this to pay for Christmas, if isn't sold before Christmas ad will be closed. Thanks!"

The Citadel pistols are the upscale version of the Rock Island Armory pistols made by Armscor that come with a better finish, nicer grips, and normally two magazines instead of just one that comes with the RIA guns.
This is a full-featured tactical pistol which is ready for general shooting, home defense, or club-level competition. It has combat sights, ambidexterous thumb safeties, and a match grade adjustable trigger that measures 4.5 pounds on this gun. The slide features front and rear cocking serrations, and the entire gun is finished in a non-glare matte finish with some really nice checkered wood grips.
Once again, this is a brand new pistol which has never been fired, and comes with a full manufacturer's lifetime warranty. It includes the box and papers, the origiinal fired shell casing where it was test fired at the factory, and a total of 2 ACT 8-round magazines. The two nickel finished additional magazines shown in the photo are no longer available and not included, and I have lowered the price of the gun to reflect this. This package will make a great entry into the world of the 1911 and the .45 ACP cartridge if you are ready for something different than your typical 9mm plastic pistol.
I bought two of these pistols from the distributor and decided to keep one, so this one is for sale. I'm primarily interested in selling for cash, but will listen to any trades you would like to discuss. Buyer must have a Florida Driver's License, a Concealed Handgun Permit, and be legally able to own a firearm in Florida. I will provide a Bill of Sale. Transaction will take place at my office in Homestead, no exceptions. This is not me being a jerk, I am disabled and cannot easily travel. Face to face transactions only. Price is $525.00 or best offer.
Thanks for looking at my listing."

Troy, a company that knows its way around fighting black rifles, has answered the call for a fully functional MSR that delivers uncompromising performance and accuracy, and they’ve packaged it in a form that most of us know and respect. The PAR remains true to its AR-15 roots, and it is 50 state legal.Before we get too far in, let’s clear up some confusion. Some early press and comments on this gun implied, mistakenly, that this was simply a pump action AR-15. PAR stands for pump action rifle–not pump AR-15. It is an honest mistake, I think, and one I caught myself making, at least causally. The Troy Sporting Rifle is not, despite the visual similarities, an AR-15. The Troy Sporting Rifle is clearly a branch on the AR family tree—but AR means ArmaLite Rifle, and this, dear readers, is a Troy. Even if you were to use the relaxed nomenclature associated with the abbreviation AR, (like automatic rifle, or–worse–assault rifle,) you’d still be off. This is a pump gun meant for sporting purposes. The upper and lower of the PAR are not interchangeable with those of the AR-15; ergo, this is not an AR. This is, however, a truly fine example of a modern sporting rifle. And it will be instantly familiar to those of you who know your way around black semi-automatic modular “assault” rifles built in the style of ArmaLite and hundreds of others."

You won't find anything priced like this for such a nice rifle! I'm not interested in any trades at this time. $2,500 is my absolute lowest price I'm willing to go, so I'm very firm on the price. Not looking for any trades."

I bought it in 2008 at a gunshow NIB but with the JM barrel stamp on it and have packed it around my ranch up untill April of this year. It has some minor scatches and dents in the wood from being packed around but nothing major and a quick light sanding and restaining would make it look like new. I have always oiled the gun so theres no rust or pitting and I've probably shot somewhere around 250 rounds through it. From what I've gathered these little rifles are rare compared to its 44 Magnum brother. This model doesnt have checkering in the stock.
