IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION; MOST ACURATE AND EXTREMELY EASY TO USE!! ANY QUESTIONS write to REDACTEDNEW UNITS SELL FOR $1799 + SHIPPING.How do you improve the best piece of gear for long range shooting?  First, tighten up the beam divergence and tune up the software to get better target discrimination and detection at extreme ranges.  Then redesign the programming menu to simplify in-the-field updates to any of the five customizable ballistic profiles; and finally, add MRAD units to existing MOA and BDC outputs to create a complete ballistic solver for drop and wind.
Press one button and the G7 BR2 measures range, pressure, temperature, and incline to calculate a drop and wind solution based on your programmed Ballistic Coefficient (G1 or G7), Muzzle Velocity, Sight Height and Zero Range.  Use the MOA or MRAD outputs with any scope’s adjustments to dial-in the angular solution. In BDC mode, compatible with ballistic reticles and BDC turrets which are calibrated to a fixed temperature and altitude, the BR2 will calculate a corrected solution automatically adjusted for varying conditions- just dial your BDC turret to the displayed Shoot-To-Range. You will never need to swap out your turret again.
The G7 BR2 is the only rangefinder with an on-board ballistic solver for precise real-time Drop and Wind calculations out to 1400 yards and is accurate to the nearest 0.1 MOA!  Using a device that only provides a preconfigured-table lookup solution in 1.0 MOA increments, without wind correction, is not an option for shooting at 1000 yards and beyond.
For tough ranging conditions in rain, snow, or bright sunlight, selectable targeting modes allow you to detect and display the distance for Nearest, Farthest or Strongest targets out to the maximum range of 2500 yards.New! Drop solutions in MRAD or MOA
New! Improved ranging and targeting algorithms

The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker.Comes with original case, paperwork, 2-15 rnd mags,mag loader, and 3 different backstraps.This is the M2 version with the mag release by the trigger guard.This gun has one of the best trigger resets that I've ever fired. amazing gunNO TRADES $525.00 OBO"

I am also interested in a Ruger PC9 Carbine, a Marlin Camp Carbine or a Mini 14. The Old Army was discontinued in 2008. It is technically a black powder .44 Cap and Ball revolver, however it comes with a .45  Colt conversion cylinder (a $250 value by itself). The gun is in the hard to find 5.5 inch barrel fixed sight version and has never been fired. There are some minor turn marks on the cylinders. Comes in the original hard box with all the original paperwork, pad lock, nipple wrench and other black powder accessories. You also get  the conversion cylinder and an assortment of .45 Colt ammo. This is considered a black powder pistol so no PPT paperwork is needed on your end. I will pay for the PPT for the firearm you are trading which must go through an FFl.  Can send more photos, just ask. Will ship for CASH buyers for an additional $25."

This item has never been used on a rifle, and has actually only been on the end of a buffer-tube once.  For a few different reasons, I decided to go with another color that matched my rifle better, and this has been sitting on the shelf ever since.  It's in flawless condition, the only thing is that, I did have the battery compartments, and the storage compartment door covered with Cerakote (Coyote Tan was the name of the color).  It looks great, especially if you have any tan coloring on your rifle... I would chalk this up to a benefit, but to each is own.
Features/Characteristics:
- 2 Different Sling Attach/Detach Military Sling Connector:          - One on the top if you wanted to go with the more permanent style         - Has standard Military detachable swivel socket, which is retained within the stock by means of retractable locking ball bearings- the swivel is installed or removed by depressing the center of the sling swivel.
- Maintenance is fairly simple. However,  the manufacturer states on their website that it requires little maintenance
- If parts are ever lost or damaged, you can buy spare parts (i.e. replacement battery compartments, caps, etc.) directly on the VLTOR website
- The EMOD is equipped with a removable, rubber buttpad and integrated strike plate.  The pad is held in place by one hex screw and the strike plate hook at the toe of the stock. This is in case you want to remove and replace due to wear and tear.
- 3 Storage Compartments - Two round side battery compartments, allowing you to carry 3 AA or 4 CR123 batteries in each waterproof storage area (there are two of these compartments). There is also a storage compartment located in the clubfoot area of the stock, which has a capacity of 2 AA batteries, and which has a locking door to also resist water and debris (waterproof as well - but remember, all waterproofing is going to be defeated when you submerge in water long enough). These storage compartments are all removable if you want them gone from your rifle.
- 5 Positions That The Stock Can Be Collapsed Along
*** A major benefit for those weapons using scoped rifles, as it increases the available comb for any length of pull.  The EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than a regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch making transitions from the ready positions feel more natural."

The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over standard magazines. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance.
