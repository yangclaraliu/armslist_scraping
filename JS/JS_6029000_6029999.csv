That is the case with the oldest model of a Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special that I have owned. It is a pre-Model 36 version J-frame built in 1956. That's right...this classic snubnose revolver is sixty years old but you couldn't tell it by looking at or shooting it. Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this pre-Model 36 Flat Latch J-frame Chiefs Special has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder and can be fired in single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a blued finish and has the original diamond-type wood grips with serial numbers that match the round butt frame.This classic S&W revolver is in great condition for its age. There is some honest holster wear on the bottom front of the frame and muzzle and a small chip in the bottom of the upper portion of the right wood grip. This gun was carried some but only occasionally fired. Very clean and shiny bore and cylinders with no rust or damage on this gun. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.I have fired 50 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is one that is of the age it could be put away in a collection to fondle and admire, but is also dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID.

I have sever boxes of ammo that can go with it as well as a nice hard case. This is a very nice rifle with less than 100 rounds through it. There is one very tiny mark on it up on the left top side of the receiver where another rifle fell on it beause I stupidly had them doubled up in my safe instead of buying another one.

Price is 325 dollars for the entire package. I live near Newport and am willing to meet in the valley if need be. I am looking for a cash sale to help fund a rather expensive pistol purchase but if you happen to have a Taurus PT740 Slim with extra mags and ammo we can talk about a trade. This would be for my wife. I have one and she loves it and I would like to have it back lol. Thank you for looking.*****  UPDATE  *****    Everyone keeps asking me about trades which I did not want to do but I have now reconsidered since I just purchased the PT740 Slim I was looking for. I would still like another one though. Anyway, let me know what you have. I would be interested in tactical .22 rifles, carry pistols in 9mm, .40 or .45 acp, AR 15s and AK 47s with cash on my end as needed. Also full sized pistols such as XDs, certain Glocks, 1911s and Sigs. No bolt rifles please. I have more than I can store as it is. Please only offer weapons as nice as mine.

The Neos is the 4.5"" that has been Cerakoated a couple years ago. Neos 22lr new was 349.99 but i see they start at about 299.99 now. The scope is a Bushnell Elite 3200 2-6x32mm in great shape, was only used on this so it hasnt even seen any ""heavy"" use at all. Scope new was $349.99 and they have them listed on Midway USA at the moment for $299 plus shipping. Im asking $100 less and all i did was use it on a 22LR, i feel more than fair. Any questions id be happy to answer them. Ring the Gong at 100 yards all day, its a blast.Asking ballpark $500 Cash OBRO. (Or Best Reasonable Offer) Willing to sell scope solo."

Silver nitride finish steel receiver with high-relief engraving, polished blued barrels, and oil finish grade II/III walnut, standard Invector choke tubes. What makes White Lightning? The term ""left in the white"", or simply ""white"" has been used for decades describing the color of shotgun and rifle parts. ""In the white"" means that firearm parts were not blued or color case-hardened or colored in any way, but left in the natural, polished color of the metal, such as steel. Often times, the bolt, top lever, slide, ejectors and other parts are left in the natural color of the metal, providing a luxurious contrast to the rest of the shotgun. In this way, the Browning's Citori White Lightning receiver and action offer a fine choice as opposed to ""blued"" over-unders. But don't be afraid that the steel receiver is unprotected: the natural color steel receiver and trigger guard are protected from corrosion by a durable coating process called a ""nitrided"" finish, offering similar protection to bluing. Just with a uniquely elegant and attractive look. A well-rounded pistol grip for performance. The Citori White Lightning's round knob or pistol grip allows the shooter to position his hand at the same, solid place for each shot, thus offering better control for fast-flying waterfowl upland game, sporting clays or trap and skeet. Matching the rounded pistol grip is the forearm. It is nicely rounded and together, they give the name to this over under gun as ""Lightning Style,"" or the Citori White Lightning, a classic style indeed, a timeless style. Specifications: 12 Ga, 28” Barrel Length, 8lbs 2 OZ, 3” Chamber, Chokes Included Full, Modified, Improved Cylinder."

This is an early 1973 Smith & Wesson Model 10-5 .38 Special M&P (Military & Police) six-shot shot revolver. It has a square butt K frame with a 4” tapered and pinned barrel. Dark rich wood S&W diamond-marked grips with S&W medallions complement this gorgeous gun. This revolver has a serrated ramp fixed front sight and a notched rear sight with the traditional sighting channel along the top of the gun. Very nice case hardened hammer and trigger with a clean and brilliantly shiny bore and cylinders. There are a few slight surface lines on the side panels from cleaning as are on any reflective nickel-plated surface and a couple of light handling and storage marks behind the cylinder release button, but they absolutely don't detract from the stunning beauty or integrity of this S&W revolver. While the stunning looks of this gun first attracted me to it, the buttery-smooth trigger and pin-point accuracy after firing it made this revolver the epitome of the marriage of form and function. I have fired 60 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. While I have never had a bad shooting or feeling Smith & Wesson revolver, the Model 10 line has consistently provided the finest trigger pulls and shooting accuracy for me. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is so pretty it could be put away as a collector's item or displayed as a show piece, yet functional and accurate enough to be used as a house or carry gun, or all of the above. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Local face-to-face cash sale only.
