Put about ten rounds through it just to ensure proper functioning and its been in my safe ever since (thoroughly cleaned and oiled after firing). I prefer the weight and feel of stamped receivers so I don't really have any need to keep this rifle. It does not have the scope rail as it's the earlier version. You will receive the rifle in its original box along with everything else it would normally come with from the factory EXCEPT MAGAZINES (the shop I bought it from was not capable of limiting the factory mags so I never took possession of them). Driver's liscense and matching FID required. I go to school at Cornell and won't be back until February 18 to do the transaction. Thanks and feel free to message me.

Gun is stupid Accurate Comes with 2 factory makes and factory case, has seen some rounds and black finish on barrel is wearing, but these come with a Briley bushing from the factory to increase accuracy and if you look it up it is normal for the finish to wear from the barrel. By stupid accurat I mean a blind monkey could hit bullseyes with this gun at 15 yards.  I have two other commanders that are bobtailed and this is just the one I am least attached to, so it's the one on the chopping block. Serious offers only. Price is firm, and if you offer me any other trades then what is listed it would need to be much to far in my favor to resist."
