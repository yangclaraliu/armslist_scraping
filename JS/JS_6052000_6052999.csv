This rifle was made at the Chattelerault arsenal and is dated 1887, which is the first year of mass production, it is also an A-series rifle, the first series produced. It is all matching, however, due to the differences in the handguard and the buttstock I think a few parts may be replacements or force matched, but I don't know for certain. The bore is in great shape for being 130 years old, it still has some shine and strong rifling. This rifle does have the 'N' mark from the update in the 1930's, meaning it is safe to fire most commonly available surplus ammo. I picked this up recently, but didn't end up liking it as much as I thought, so I looking to get something else."

I'm selling it because I got laid off a week after I bought it. I don't need to sell, but I could use the money more than the rifle right now. I paid 675 out the door for it, so I'll let it go for $600. I would also be willing to take a trade plus cash (or a straight up trade in my favor).

Hey David,
We got a look at your Upper. Whoever changed it from a FSP Upper to a gas Block and longer rail Upper never tightened the Barrel Nut. As soon as our armorers removed the screws from the outside of the rail and slid it off the Barrel Nut spun free. The accuracy problems were definitely caused by the barrel being loose. Since we had it apart anyway, we went ahead and replaced the barrel with the same type that we removed. We also replaced your gas tube and gas block."

Hoping to get things ordered before the election and craziness ensues. Both are built with using completely all PSA parts except for Anderson lower receivers. Both rifles have had 5 to 10 rounds ran through them to test function and worked flawlessly. Each rifle has a 16"" free float barrel for improved accuracy. Both rifles are chambered in 5.56 NATO round so they are safe to fire 223 Remington rounds as well for cost savings on practice rounds. Both have a low profile gas block at .750"" diameterOne rifle has a 13.5"" M-Lok rail which personally I like the feel of better and it seems lighter as well.

It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is full-auto rated for .22 long rifle.   Must be 21+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $449.99 each IN REGARDS TO THE HEARING PROTECTION ACT: This bill was introduced in October of 2015 and has certainly gained momentum, however, it will likely be several years before it is passed. Anyone who has purchased a Suppressor/Silencer since October of 2015 when the bill was first introduced will receive a refund of $200.00 for every tax stamp they have paid for a Suppressor/Silencer since that date. If the bill passes sooner and you already have a Form 4 in progress it will transfer immediately. Also, Suppressors/Silencers are already in short supply with only 8,000 SOT Dealers around the country currently. Once hundreds of thousands of gun stores around the nation can sell Suppressors/Silencers overnight the supply will be worse than the .22 Ammo Shortage. Prices will skyrocket and supply will be virtually non-existent for the first year or so. It is true that eventually new companies will appear to help with the supply and prices will once again stabilize. With that being said, Combat Arms encourages anyone who wishes to purchase a Suppressor/Silencer now to still do so as you are at every advantage to purchase it now – you would get your $200.00 Tax Stamp payment back and you would already have your Suppressor/Silencer and at a lower price. If the bill does not pass then you will have already started the wait on the Form 4 paperwork and be able to enjoy your Suppressor/Silencer sooner. This is just our professional advice – we do not wish to pressure anyone into a purchase, we simply want everyone to be able to enjoy Suppressors/Silencers as we do and stay informed.   Hunting with a Suppressor/Silencer is Legal in the State of Michigan (.450 and 12 Gauge Suppressors/Silencers are very popular right now) as well as an increasing number of States.   Suppressors/Silencers are currently legal in 42 States – many of which allow them for hunting. These are excellent for increasing accuracy, eliminating muzzle flash, and saving your hearing for a home defense scenario or at the shooting range.   Combat Arms can Special Order almost any Suppressor/Silencer you are looking for and have it here within a couple of weeks.   NFA Items must be shipped to a Class II or Class III FFL Manufacturer/Dealer or picked up at Combat Arms in Milford, MI.

A 638 is an Airweight S&W J framed revolver with a shrouded hammer. That means you get a light aluminum framed revolver with 5 shots of .38 Special +P, the hammer exposed but smaller and designed not to snag. This makes it ideal for concealed carry, especially as a pocket gun. I've carried this rig for years and have never had issue with it. However because this gun has been used almost daily for years there is some holster wear and surface corrosion on the frame. I've done my best to document this in the pics, so take a close look. The holster is leather and kydex and custom fit to this gun. It's extremely easy to use, and you can even tuck your shirt in around the gun. Likewise the speedloader is very simple and easy to use. This whole setup would cost you about $500+ brand new, but since I've used and uglied it up I'm letting it go for half that. That said, everything here functions as well as it did the day I got it. So if you're looking to get a CCW rig for you or a loved one; this setup is fast, easy and reliable, exactly what you want when your or a loved one's life is on the line. Price Is Firm. No trades. I will not travel to the other side of the state for a sale."

Has a 24"" heavy varmint barrel which helps to reduce recoil & helps to stay on target with that extra weight. Has AccuTrigger that is adjustable for trigger pull weight from 1.5# to 6# I believe. It is currently set around 2-3lbs. Holds 4 rounds in the internal magazine (can be converted for DBM, 4 round or 10 round magazines).Mounted on this rifle is a BRAND NEW BSA Platinum 6-24x44 scope with Iron Sighter mounts. This is a great long range setup. The scope comes with the warranty paper for you to fill out and mail in as this scope has only been out of the factory about 1 week. This scope includes a sunshade, and the original box, manual, cloth for cleaning the scope lense, etc.The scope sells for $150 brand new, which this scope is. The scope has only been removed from the box to be mounted on the rifle, so it will need to be properly sighted in.With this rifle I've shot 4 rounds of cheap Perfecta ammo at 100 yards and had all 4 rounds touching, about a quarter inch from the bullseye. With 147gr .308 ammunition this is a very soft recoiling rifle.I will also include an army green rifle carrying case with a shoulder strap.You will need to pay for your background check ($25) that you need to pass at a local FFL. I can meet you at Southern Oregon Pawn in Medford.*Photo of rifle next to case shows a different scope.*Photo of rifle by itself and photo of the scope lense are of the scope that comes with this rifle.Text or call me at REDACTED"

The MTM 3X Afocal Lens Extender from Insight Tech Gear is a phenomenal accessory for the MTM Thermal Monocular. Its germanium lens provides low distortion and increases detection and recognition ranges by adding 3X magnification to the MTM. The MTM has a built-in 3X magnification capability, which, coupled with the 3X Afocal Lens Extender, gives the operator up to 6X zoom. The magnifier’s lens provides a clear 10.5 degrees Field Of View (8.4 horizontal x 6.3 vertical). Was only included in the top version of the MTM series that came complete with everything.  95 percent of the MTM's being used were sent without this part.

Also knows as the the AMAC and Iver Johnson. ** Im at least the second owner of this rifle so the exact round count is unknown. It includes a Millet 4-16 X 50 Illuminated optic.** It has both the original cheek piece and one that I manufactured myself out of 6061 aluminum. I found the original to be too high for a comfortable cheek weld so I made my own. I cerakoted the cheek piece in graphite black and added a section of Pachmayr PacSkin for comfort.Here is a cut and paste from the net to give ya some info on this rifle.....The .50 caliber Model 500 rifle was originally designed by the team, lead by the D. Haskins, then working at Research Armaments Prototypes (RAP), a small company then located in Jacksonville, Arkansas, USA. Developed at the request ofUS Armed forces during 1981-82, along with smaller Model300 rifle, Model 500 was purchased by US military circa 1983 in small numbers - about 125 rifles were initially delivered, and went to Beirut,Grenada, Panama, Iraq and probably several other places. The Model 500 paved the way into military service for numerous other .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles, such as various Barrett models. But it had a very controversial life of its own. During 1980s the design was bought from RAI by the Daisy Weapons Systems, then it went for Iver Johnson Arms. Iver Johnson sold the Model 500 as AMAC-1500, but when it went bankrupt, the parts and machinery were sold on auction. The AMAC-1500 rifles are still offered in USA by the Ultimate Accuracy Arms.During late 1980s the Daisy slightly modified the design, so it became convertible to three major ""big bore"" calibers, .50BMG (12.7x99),12.7x108 Russian, and 14.7x115 Russian. The model 600 was initially offered by Daisy, then by Redick Arms Development. In 1999 Redick Arms was purchased by Aurora tactical LLC ,which offered the Model 600, as well as improved, magazine fed version, Model650. For some time, M600 and M650 rifles were also distributed by RAMO Defence, before it went out of business.The RAP Model 500, Iver Johnson AMAC-1500 and M600 are all similar in basic design, being different mostly in the shape of the barrel, muzzlebrake, and bipod. All these rifles featured a removable ""shell holder""rotating bolt with three lugs. For each shot bolt was rotated and removed from the receiver, then cartridge was inserted into bolt face, and then bolt with cartridge were inserted back into receiver and locked. Fully adjustable trigger and adjustable buttstock allowed for some ""personalization"" of the rifle. Neither rifle was intended to be fired offhand, and thus had no forearm.Instead, each rifle was issued with folding bipod. For carry, rifle was easily disassembled into several major parts. Neither rifle also featured open sights -only telescope sights were used. According to some sources, the now famous Leupold Series M scopes were originally developed especially for Model 500rifle. On all variations, barrels were fitted with large and effective muzzlebrakes of slightly different contours. Model 650 rifles differed from those described above by having a 7-shot detachable box magazine, and anon-removable, manually operated rotating bolt action. Because of larger and longer receiver, M650 rifles are significantly heavier, than m500 and m600 rifles.Not interested in Trades.Rifle, Scope and both cheek pieces......$2,050.00"
