This is from Comp-Tac’s website “The Comp-Tac 1911 Single Paddle Magazine Pouch is an outside the waistband holder. Designed to be worn at 9:00 for a right handed shooter this is an excellent way to carry more ammunition for competition or recreational shooting. 
The Comp-Tac Magazine Paddle Pouch provides a rigid material that maintains its shape even with the magazine removed. The smooth low friction surface allows for a fast magazine removal and easy one-handed insertion of the magazine. The Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents. Each magazine pouch is tension adjustable allowing for a perfect fit for each magazine.”
This single Magazine Paddle Holder will accommodate a variety of single stack magazines. Check out Comp-Tac’s website for all the magazines this holder will accommodate.  
I prefer a cash-only FTF in the Highlands Ranch area but I am willing to ship. No trades. Please include a phone# with your email if you are a serious buyer.
I will also ship this for anyone seeing this ad out-of-state (or anywhere not close enough for a FTF). The only payment I will take if you want it shipped is PayPal, cash or check (you will have to wait until it clears my bank if using a check). If shipping the buyer will pay for shipping and PayPal fees."

H&K Mark 23 SOCOM. This pistol retails for around $2,000 and it includes 2 extra mags valued at $100, and a threaded barrel protector valued at $50. There are only a few of these pistols produced every year due to the excellent craftsmanship that goes into them. So often times you are put on a waiting list to purchase one. This MK23 is in pristine condition with less than 100 rounds fired. My price is $1,700 FIRM. No trade offers unless they are heavily in my favor as I want the cash. Text 252-725-139Four Thanks !"

Also make sure this is legal to own in you area, county, or state. I will not ship where prohibited. This firearm as with all firearms should be checked by a certified gunsmith before firing. I'm sort of new to Guns International but you can check my feedback on gun under big cat daddy 1952 & I have a 200 A+ with ZERO negatives.  Shipping with full insurance will be UPS 2nd day air for FREE to the lower 48.

In 1976, the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of the most accurate 45s right out of the box. Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220R features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear resistant Nitron finish, a lightweight alloy frame with M1913 Picatinny rail, and the Sig Sauer four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector. The Equinox Carry edition features a two-tone finish."

In the mid 1980s, the US military began the process of retiring their old warhorse. In 1985, Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois first offered newly manufactured 1911s to the gun buying public. The next 28 years firmly established Springfield Armory® as the leading manufacturer of 1911s – and the standard by which all other 1911s are judged today. 102 years and untold billions of rounds of .45ACP after its introduction, American shooters, law enforcement and elite military units the world over still rely on the immortal 1911 to get the job done. Whether you’re a prospective first-time 1911 owner or a discriminating collector, you’ve come to the right place. In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.

Warren Tactical provides a very contoured rear sight that has a cocking shoulder on front edge with a generous serrated U-notch with a tritium front with white target ring. They are very nice and fast to acquire, installed only 3 weeks and are dated 17, so they are brand new manufacture. This pistol is perfect for 1911 carry, very lightweight, accurate and fun to shoot. It does have a fully ramped bull barrel and springfields patented dual spring recoil assembly. Very little recoil for a 45 weighing on 26oz. I have not carried it, have shot it fewer than 100 factory rounds. In that time its been flawless, with a very nice trigger. Extended right hand thumb safety, nicely fit beavertail grip safety and a checkered main spring housing without the infamous ILS locking hole. It comes with all the SAI gear, in the very hd pistol box, I will include an extra magazine for a total of 3.
