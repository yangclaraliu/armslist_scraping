 In 1975, a version of the pistol known as the P4 was introduced, primarily targetted at the West German law enforcement market. It was a further development of the P1 and retained its alloy frame with reinforcing hex pin and 'fat' slide. It borrowed a highly reliable safety system from Walther's PP Super design. With this safety system, the lever on the slide is soly a decocker. Once pressed and the hammer dropped, a spring in the slide automatically returns it to the upward position. The firing pin and hammer work together to provide for a safe weapon. The firing pin is tilted out of alignment unless and until the trigger is fully pulled rearward. The hammer in turn has a cutout near its base inwhich the end of the firing pin can rest, when being decocked. So there is virtually no way for the weapon to discharge without the trigger being completely pressed.
 The P4 had a shorter 4"" barrel as well. It was determined that this reduction in length would make it easier to handle for police officers, while not dramatically decreasing the weapon's accuracy or range. The hammer was also made shorter and rounded so that it could still be manually cocked, but was less likely to catch on clothing or in a holster. A new slide was made for this pistol, which did not have the sheet metal topcover and instead had the rear sights screwed into place. It also lacked the loaded chamber indicator, which could be found on all earlier P38/P1 models. Finally, the P4 had a ribbed target style hammer, like that found on many other Walther firearms of the 1970s. In all other respects, the P4 was the same as the P1, including with its sights, grips, and magazines.
 The pistol found modest success, with its main users being the police forces of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-WŸrttemberg, in West Germany. In all, Walther manufactured about 7,000 P4s, with production ending in 1982.
 It's a terrific pistol!$650.REDACTED"

Not to be confused with the numerous cheap knockoffs that you see everywhere. This unit was brought back from Japan by my grandfather who served in The 2nd World War. The details of the engagement were no doubt gruesome and never passed down through the family unlike the weapon itself, but no doubt has seen its fair share of combat. If this weapon could talk- I’m sure all ears would be opened and jaws dropped at the morbid history of events it has seen. I have decided not to sharpen it, disassemble it nor read the makers marks or insignia. I know some are rarer than others so I have kept the reserve as well as the BIN option low enough to reflect that. Most likely it very well may be one that’s worth thousands to some collector who revels in that sort of information so this may be a windfall for some lucky bidder. At this point in my life I have too great of a collection of military items and too many small and curious children to keep this around. I hope this piece of history finds itself a loving home. Good Luck and God Bless"

Simple, Reliable, and Functional are what I'm looking for. Mostly for plinking, and some critter control. I can refinish wood / metal. So if it's a slightly neglected gun, that's fine. That will be taken into consideration when it comes to what I'm willing to pay though. Depending on condition on the firearm, and how far I have to drive to come pick it up I'm only looking to spend between $250-$300. Once I know exactly what the gun is, and it's condition though. That's negotiable.I will be checking on here regularly. Will respond most likely between 6-8 hours. Depending on the time / day."

It was originally purchased for home defense because of how easy it was for my wife to load, aim, and shoot it. The gun was made for hunting all kind of things and comes with a duck hunting plug to make sure the law is followed when hunting. The gun also comes with a lock. I personally don't hunt, and since purchasing it I have bought several hand guns, therefore I don't have a need for it anymore. I will be selling it for $180 OBO. This gun is great for young hunters and people that want to keep their home safe. Please call me anytime and we can get a deal made.

Was going to paint but didn't get to it.  The scope is the Leupold Mark 4  4.5-14x50mm ER/T front focal. I purchased from leupold direct. Tried to post the websit but armslist wouldn't allow it.  The rail and the rings are both the Mark 4 model.  The bi pod is the harris swivel bi pod. Can't remember what model but it does tilt left to right.  I have almost 3 grand in the weapon but that doesn't matter.  Letting it go for 2400 OBO.  The scope alone is almost that much.  Any quetions feel free to ask.  Thanks or text 405 250 8797
