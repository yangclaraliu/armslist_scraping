It is basically a Model 586 with fixed rear sight, not so common to find.I initially wanted to make this into a project gun but need money to fund another project. Gun is in overall good condition with some finish wear, timing is right, riflign is strong, bore is shiny, it shoots well and trigger has not been worked on I believe. It comes with aftermarket combat grips with the S&W medallions, I think they are Ahrends brand, I don't have the original grips. No box.I'd like to sell it for $580 (or $550 without the grips if you prefer). Will consider trades but prefer a cash sale.Buyer must show OK drivers license and be legal to own a gun in Oklahoma, must be able to meet locally in OKC area. No shipping!Email if interested, thanks!"

I purchased an extra OD green frame that also came with three backstraps. The gun is brand new and completely unfired and pristine. I have over $750 in the package and I'm only asking $550 cash.  My trade value is at least $700 which is less than I have in the package. Text me at REDACTED if interested.

Scope is mounted with Leupold rings and both have been used a couple of times for deer hunting. I am the original owner. There have been probably 40 rounds total through it while dialing in the scope. After that, I never came across any deer while hunting and now I'm totally disabled and can't hunt anymore. Gun and scope are in fantastic conditon, 98% or better with very little to no wear or scratches. It is gun safe kept with humidity control. Comes with Allen Co. shearling padded rifle bag, made in USA,  and Leupold factory box with papers, rings, etc. for scope. I have the factory papers/instructions for the rifle. It also has a non-descript padded shoulder black nylon sling. If you're a deer hunter, you know that the .270 Winchester shoots a flatter trajectory to target than other, heavier, rounds. So, the scope is set dead on at 100 yards for hunting in the Manzinita scrub. Since I can no longer hunt, I'd rather see it go to someone that can appreciate what this is and not be a safe queen anymore. Serious offers only. I will trade for a Colt MK IV/Series 80 Government .380 in VG+ condition or a Beretta 85FS Cheetah .380 in VG+ to New condition plus cash, to be negotiated, in the Sacramento valley area. Thanks for looking."

It is New and unfired only cycled some 3inch rounds to make sure the gun fed/ejected well. This is the 18” express 12 gauge model and not a tactical version because by starting with an express you can add the extension tube to give it 7+1 instead of 6+1 for much less money. This thing is decked out with the best parts out there, the only thing I did not put on it was a shell carrier because I didn’t want to add all that weight and bulk to a shotgun that already holds 8 3inch shells. Below is the list of parts on this gun, you could not build this gun yourself for less than what I am asking. I will also throw in the original box and components that came with the shotgun including the original black synthetic furniture, the spacers and two more size cheek risers that come with the Magpul SGA stock to fit your person, and 10 rounds of Winchester Double X 3 inch high velocity 00 buck shells.
