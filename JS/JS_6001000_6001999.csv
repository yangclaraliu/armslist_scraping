It is not a JM. It has been upgraded with what appears to be a late 90s Simmons 3X9, see-thru tip off rings, a pistol grip and a 25 roud mag (actually holds 27). It includes two factory 10 roung mags and has apparently been ""sloppy"" painted camouflage which in my opinion, decreased what little value the scope, grip and mags may have added. The front peep sight is also missing, but is a cheap and relatively easy fix from what I understand. So, the first $100 bill takes it. It would make someone a good beater gun or frog gun.

A civilian semi-auto variant of the Russian AKM (Chinese Type 56) rifle, the NHM-91 was built to imitate the appearance of the Russian RPK light machine gun. First imported and marketed in the United States in 1991 by ChinaSports Inc. Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or European AKM. The NHM-91 has the long barrel, but features a milled, slant cut receiver. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 rifles a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62×39mm ammunition. A must have for any collector!"

Made in 1884. This is a really good untouched example with only honest wear. When I first picked this rifle up, I thought the noise inside the butt stock was from a set of cleaning rods. But much to my surprise, three vintage 44-40 cartridges fell out when I opened the trap door. Who knows how long they were in there! These will be included with the rifle, but will be shipped separately. Receiver is a pleasant mix of bright original blue/plum patina/and silvery worn areas. Bright original blue has good coverage, but is more prevalent in protected areas. Barrel has 80% original bluing with the balance turning plum. Mag tube retains an original plummy brown old patina with brighter bluing in protected areas. Barrel has some scratches and dings. Bore is very good for an early black powder era Winchester with a mix of shine and corrosion with defined rifling. Bore rates 7/10 in my opinion. Wood is very good with excellent fit. Butt stock has numerous light dings, scratches and bruises from use. The LH side of the butt stock has a long scratch as shown in the photos. This may appear as a crack, but it does not extend to the butt plate. LH side of the forearm has a hairline crack as shown. Overall, the wood condition matches the rest of the rifle well. Action locks up tight and is very crisp for an antique 1873. Dust cover is exceptionally tight. A nice, honest example of an 1873 in the best caliber! Packed and shipped with care."

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use."

A MeOpta Artemus 3000 3x9x42mm scope in Vortex mount sits on top and 45 degree MBUS flip-ups are mounted as well. There is a Strike Force rook crown ported muzzle break, Integrity Arms premium buffer/spring and buffer tube, Wings tactical trigger guard, a Hogue carbine stock and pistol grip to finish it all off... Quality was the goal and it was very much achieved! This is a great shooter now, but will continue to improve as it breaks in. The Sig P320 matches the rifle and it comes with a LOT of extras..I only took the Sig to the range once.

Both are built with using completely all PSA parts except for Anderson lower receivers. Both rifles have had 5 to 10 rounds ran through them to test function and worked flawlessly. Each rifle has a 16"" free float barrel for improved accuracy. Both rifles are chambered in 5.56 NATO round so they are safe to fire 223 Remington rounds as well for cost savings on practice rounds. Both have a low profile gas block at .750"" diameterOne rifle has a 13.5"" M-Lok rail which personally I like the feel of better and it seems lighter as well.

In good fireable condition with excellent bore and strong rifling. Rifle has no import marks and is NOT a Russian capture. I originally bought the rifle from a private seller on the East Coast who bought it from a veteran. Blueing is in very good condition. Nazi eagles clearly visible all over the rifle and bolt. Gun and bolt do not match but the bolt matches itself.  This rifle was made in 1942 in the famous Steyr manufacturing plant (bnz.). The stock is in good condition considering the rifle's age. The rifle also includes a brand new reproduction leather sling and 5 stripper clips for ammunition (see pictures). Does not come with a cleaning rod because the Germans phased out addition of the rods (no hole in stock for it). The rifle also comes with a spearate trigger guard with magazine spring and base plate. Please look at all the pictures as what you see is what you get (no suprises). The buyer is responsible for knowing his/her local laws and regulations. Non Russian capture rifles have all but dissapeared and this is a very good example of untampered with German engineering from World War II. I'm selling this rifle only becuase I need some extra money to help pay for school. The site only allows me to post one picture so feel free to contact me to ask for more.Must ship to a valid FFL. Shipping will be calculated depending on buyers location. No returns accepted
