It also has features such as a beavertail grip safety and a manually operated thumb safety. In addition to these two safeties, the Ruger SR1911 also has a sear disconnect, slide stop and half-cock position. Although Colt's 80 series developed a trigger operated firing pin block safety, and Kimber and Smith & Wesson use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety; the Ruger SR1911 pistol features a titanium firing pin and heavy firing pin spring, which negates the need for a firing pin block, offering an updated safety feature without compromising trigger pull weight.To improve quality, the stainless steel barrel and bushings are all produced from the same bar stock and on the same machine. Features such as an oversized ejection port and an extended magazine release enhance the performance of the weapon as well. The SR1911 also has a visual inspection port which allows for visual confirmation that the chamber is loaded.Manufacturer: RugerModel: SR1911Action: Single-ActionCaliber: .45 ACPBarrel: 4.5"""

Bottom line is that the pistol will flat out shoot as fast as you can.All parts involving screws (e.g., mounts) have been torqued to specification and reinforced with Loc-Tite. Currently, there is grip tape to the necessary locations to improve grip, but these are easily removed.I am not including any magazines with this pistol because the Volquartsen utilizes the same magazines, but Ruger 22/45 magazines are readily available.

If you'd rather have the laser etched DD Mk18 upper receiver, I can replace the Colt with that.

The frame is injection molded gray and was done at the Glock factory. It is NOT cerakoted. Other upgrades are an aluminum Agency Arms magwell which was designed for the medium backstrap (I currently have the medium backstrap with beavertail on the gun). I put a stainless back plate with an american flag on the gun, but also have the stock black back plate. I also installed a stainless extended slide lock which is made by Ghost Inc. and also have the stock slide lock. Gun comes with 3 mags and Glock night sights (the picture does not show that, but the night sights are currently on the gun).I have not put any rounds through the stock .40 barrel, but I have put approximately 200 rounds through the Storm Lake barrel. I am asking $1,200 cash OBO, but I am also open to possible trade ideas if you have something interesting. If the listing is still up, then the gun is still for sale, so no need to ask.Thank you."

The original metal finish is showing some thinning and the gas cylinder lock appears polished, but there is no rust or pitting. The seal is still present in the rear of the front sight.

From what I can tell, all parts appear to be matching with the same serial number (stock, bolt, receiver, magazine floorplate, etc.). This rifle design was heavily based on the German K98k Mauser. Unlike the more prevalent M24 Yugo Mausers, this rifle has the more “conventional” turned down bolt handle. The rifle shoots fantastic and the 8mm is a very effective cartridge. This is a great way to get an excellent looking and shooting Mauser rifle without having to pay the high prices commanded by German K98s.For an additional $25 I will include an M48 bayonet with scabbard and frog. The serial numbers for the bayonet and scabbard match each other. For an additional $175 I will include a can of 340 rounds of Romanian 8mm surplus ammo. This ammo is steel cased and likely uses corrosive primers, but I have not experienced any issues out of the ammo it has performed well. As long as the proper cleaning procedures for shooting corrosive ammo is followed (be assured I always did with this rifle) then this is an excellent opportunity to purchase a bulk of surplus ammo that is quickly drying up at a reasonable price. As a bonus, every round of this ammo is pre-loaded into stripper clips for easy feeding into the rifle! The best price that I have been able to find online for 8mm ammo (including surplus) is ~ $0.50/round. FYI, the rifle case shown in the photo is not included.Asking $475 for just the rifle, $25 for the bayonet, $175 for the 340 rounds of ammoIf you would like to purchase just one of these items separate from the rest, let me know.$675 for everything together.If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

This gun alone about $500 with tax (and higher at places like Gander Mountain and smaller shops). There are no visible marks or wear on the pistol as its been in a holster and only had a few magazines put through itThis version is definitely improved over the standard Shield 9mm in that is has high-visibility fiber optic sights (red front, green rear), a ported barrel and slide, and a smoother trigger right out of the box. I put  35 rounds through the pistol and really did not like the hinged plastic trigger and had the apex installed and put another few magazines through to test it out. It is definitely a little smoother and slightly lighter than it was out of the box and that should get even better with a few hundred rounds through it.Included with the pistol is a Desantis Cozy Partner IWB holster that is pretty comfortable (I wore it almost all day, every day for a few weeks) that is in great shape and just barely starting to break in. While the factory 7-round magazine is stock, the 8 round one has a TF +1 baseplate on it. I am still having a hard time getting the 9th round in it, but one it breaks in, that should be fine.I paid over $675 for everything including the holster, trigger,  and mag extension.  I am looking for $500. Comes with Factory box, cable lock, paperwork and test round. Will sell only to a Florida Concealed Carry Permit Holder/active police/military with ID or will meet buyer at local gun shop to have a background check (and will provide person-to-person bill of sale).Please reach out with any questions."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with, too many projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, the gain in velocity was not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was a new one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration, which I think is a bit high.  I do have a Hogue or Blackhawk grip and/or Magpul MOE stock I can add, if wanted, just let me know.
$1,400 in cash.  I think it was well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and cash or???  If wanting to trade, just let me know what you have and the overall deal and I will consider.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

This position provides a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly, instantaneously assisting the trigger back onto the sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible for an AK-47! The “Raptor” features a non-adjustable 4.5-pound trigger pull weight with zero take-up and no overtravel.

I wanted the lightest rifle I could possibly come up with. Unfortunatly he still can not shoulder it so I a selling it and putting the money toward some custom work on a pistol I am having done for him instead. Here are the details....The upper is a factory built flat top with dust cover and forward assist that was taken off of a complete rifle right in front of me in a gun shop. It is a 16 inch M4 style, matt finish, 1 in 8 rh twist in 5.56 mm and was made by PSA. I paid 269 for it with no BCG. I ordered a full auto premium bcg and a 7075 T6 charging handle combo directly from PSA for 98 dollars and change. I dropped this combo on a brand new Gen 2 Plum Crazy factory built leightweight poly lower assy complete with standard grip and 6 position stock. Again, I wanted the absolutely lightest carbine possible. This gun weighs 5.6 pounds with an empty mag inserted. The new Gen 2 lower was hard to find but is very nice. It is my 3rd one. Yes, even the FCG is plastic which I would change since it is only 20 dollars or so to change but I left it for its light weight for my dad. This rifle has not been fired or even had a round chambered. I have 540 in this rifle plus shipping, dealer transfer fees and call in fee for a total of 585 so it is right there with all the rest of the entry level ARs on the market. You will need to suppy your own sights as I did not buy any. Will come with 3 brand new 30 round mags as well which cost 14 dollars eachBest deal on Armslist for a BRAND NEW AR15........ $475 CASH.

It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification.

The extra mag I'm including is for the LCP II.  Ammuntion breakdown is as follows:95gr FMJ Blazer Brass = 438rds 90gr Speer Gold Dot = 50rds90gr Hornady XTP = 46rdsTotal: 534rds

The PPS43 (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev submachine gun) was born as an answer for the need of a weapon that would be more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, which was in use then by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews, mobile recon groups and paratroopers. In late 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new, more compact SMG. Designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942 and it was adopted under the designation of PPS42. Next year he refined the design and this final model was designated as PPS43. This SMG was manufactured in significant numbers, with nearly 2 million PPS43 weapons manufactured between 1943 and 1946. The PPS43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world and widely copied. The PPS43 was license-produced in Poland starting in 1946.   Today… Pioneer Arms together with, I.O. Inc., has redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters distance. The front sight is a fixed blade. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded closed position. this pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland by Pioneer Arms. All parts and components are Polish made. The PPS43-C pistol comes with a curved box magazine which holds up to 35 rounds."
