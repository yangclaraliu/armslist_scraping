Please read the following: NOTICE REGARDING EVO 922R KITS The EVO 922R PARTS AND FOLDING STOCK KIT (“EVO 922R KIT”) is intended to be used in conjunction with a CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol. Under federal law, attaching a stock to a firearm with a barrel less than 16” amounts to making a short barreled rifle (SBR). Prior to making an SBR, the owner of the firearm must first register the firearm with ATF and pay the appropriate tax. Additionally, federal law (the “922(r) statute”) prevents a person from making a rifle using more than 10 of the parts listed in 27 CFR 478.39 if the resulting rifle would be “non-sporting” under federal law. A Scorpion SBR would be “non-sporting” under federal law, hence the EVO 922R KIT. ATF has taken the position that an SBR is made when unassembled parts are placed in close proximity in such a way that they “serve no useful purpose other than to make a rifle having a barrel less than 16 inches in length… or convert a complete weapon into such an NFA firearm…” See ATF Ruling 2011-4. CZ-USA takes no position on exactly what “close proximity” means in the context of dealers and distributors of firearms. Purchasers of the EVO 922R KIT, including dealers and distributors, are solely responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the assembly, manufacture, and possession of SBRs and SBR components, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. § 922(r) and 27 CFR 478.39 and related regulations and rulings, and encourages you to consult with your attorney or to contact ATF should you have questions are your particular circumstance. Sorry, not interested in trades.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this kit online at www.copsgunshop.net."

The Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle, also known as the Semi Automatic 22 or SA-22, is a takedown rifle produced by FN Herstal based on a John Browning patent. The rifle is currently produced by Browning as the Semi-Auto 22. Production began in 1914 and continued through 1974 in Belgium and production continued in 1976 in Japan by Miroku.[1] It was first exported by FN for the American market in 1956. A close copy made by the Chinese company Norinco was formerly imported into the US by Interarms as the Model ATD. Remington manufactured a lighter weight version under license from 1919-1935 as the Remington Model 24 and then replaced it with the Remington Model 241 in 1935. Except for the barrel locking mechanism the Remington Model 241 is very similar to the Browning SA-22. The SA-22 was the first production semiautomatic rifle chambered in .22 LR caliber,[2] and is regarded as a classic firearm.[2][3] It has been offered in several ""grades"" of engraving and gold inlay, and is a widely collected gun, especially those manufactured in Belgium.[4] The Semi-auto .22 is a made from blued steel and walnut, and ejects spent cases downward. This feature was intended by the designer to keep the user's face ""protected from gasses and flying particles while firing"", at which it succeeds, but also allows the sizzling hot empty case to eject down one's forward-arm shirt sleeve. The lack of a side-mounted ejection port also leaves a large ""canvas"" for engraving.[2] Factory engraving was done by hand at FN Herstal, and is done by laser engraving with hand finishing at Miroku. It has occasionally been sold with a factory fitted hard case, or with scope mounting grooves on the receiver. Initial production models had a small loading port located on the top of the stock in contrast to later models which had the loading port located on the right side of the buttstock. Over half a million SA-22 rifles have been sold since 1914.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."

It's a fantastic companion if you also have an AR-15. The paint is easily removable and I can even do so upon request. I have run 400 rounds through and it's flawless. The optic has a lifetime transferable warranty without receipt. Spectacular optic. This is the light chassis model it has an MDT aluminum light chassis with a fluted medium bull barrel. It's a one piece chassis made out of a solid billet of aluminum and replaces standard polymer pillar bedding with an aluminum bedding. Also the collapsible stock has a locking cam system to take out the slack and make the butt rock solid. I have both .25 and .75 inch cheek risers that will come with the rifle. This model also comes with a pair of Caldwell 6-9"" bipods and a Silencer Co Trifecta Muzzle break(suppressor ready)I am moving in a week and I can't take this with me. If I don't sell it, oh well.

Chamber is 2-9/16"". It is a reliable, working shotgun. Never had a hitch. Shot some great trap scores with it. It has been detail cleaned and inspected. I also has a new recoil spring and friction ring. This is not gunked up clunker dropped off at a pawn shop.The 16-gauge (the ""gentleman's"" gauge) is great. It is a little harder to find these days. I buy online. Although many people shoot the 2-3/4"" shell in a shotgun chambered for 2-9/16"", I go ahead and buy the proper shells. They are pretty close to the same price. I get RST shells. Two boxes come with the shotgun.IMPORTANT! If you are truly interested, make sure your message includes something specific about this gun. Getting lots of robot replies which I ignore."

(yayyy/boooo)Here's the only catch: since the brake is pinned and welded, I could not take the barrel nut off when I took my upper apart and therefore there is a BCM KMR barrel nut on it, meaning if you buy this assembly and do not have KMR rail you are essentially obligated to buy a KMR rail (which I high recommend because they're incredibly light). When I put my 223 wylde barrel on, I bought a titanium KMR nut and transeferred my rail back to my upper. All you need to do install the barrel, torque it to 50 ft-lbs, and put your handguard on. OR you can figure out if you can drill/dremel with a pencil dye grinder through the weld and risk damaging the brake and muzzle threads to put whatever you please on there. Please note that assembly is a little dirty in the photos, I literally took it off 4 days prior to posting this and haven't had time to clean it yet.Cash only"

Here I have my Sig M11-A1. I would like to trade it for the exact gun but I need the digital sticker on the side that are commonly found on the military versions. (For some reason mine doesn't) I need it on there because of a shooting competition it will be used in with the military in the near future and the digital sticker is a requirement. I can add a little money if need be. Will possibly entertain other trades. Can meet anywhere in the Huntsville area and probably even further off.
