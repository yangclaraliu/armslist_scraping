Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.
Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.
The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.
If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact.Comes with all pictured"

Weapon is brand new and unfired, comes with box and papers and two (2) 7 round factory magazines. Pistol was purchased for a gun test project, but was never actually used, and I have too many other similar pistols. So, this one is just taking up space in my safe. I will sell it outright, or consider trades for other good quality firearms I can use in the pistol classes I teach.
For those not familiar with Citadel, it is made by Armscor, it is the somewhat fancier version of the Rock Island Armory pistol. It has a slightly better finish, and comes with two magazines (which are marked Rock Island) instead of one. This is a good, serviceable, all-steel 1911 style pistol at a much lower price point than a Colt or Springfield Armory gun, and is a good way to see if you like the .45 ACP cartridge and the 1911 without investing a lot if money.
Price shown is for cash and is reasonably firm (I can probably throw in a box of ammo), but please feel free to let me know if you have a trade to offer. Please have a current ID and be willing to give me a copy of it, and I will do the same for you. Thanks."

It also comes with a BladeTech holster that works great and a Don Hume holster that still needs to be broken in.Looking for $950, which is considerably less than what I have in it at this point.As far as trades go, I am pretty open.  I am looking for handguns, but I am not too keen on the striker-fired varieties. Trades should be equal value (think comparing MSRP) or I can take a trade plus cash depending on what it is. This pistol MSRPs at $1075, so please keep that in mind.  Not looking for long guns at this time.  I like 1911s and Sigs for instance (I already have a Legion).  Open to revolvers or auto-loaders.  Not interested in anything smaller than 9mm.  Thanks."
