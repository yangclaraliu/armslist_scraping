If the ad/posting is up, then the gun is still available. I will take the posting down when the gun is sold or traded. And please don't ask me if I still have the gun after putting all that down cuz you will be ignored. And I will not respond to those people that sends ""text me, call me"" replies (or don't ask for my number either, since it's rude and I don't know you). I prefer communicating via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. Face to face deals only. Kentucky residents only. Meet around Lexington only.  $500 FIRM. Trade value is $550. No low ball offers please. Low ball offers will not get a reply or will be ignored. Priced to sell. No drama, no BS. Serious inquiries only. I like this gun a lot and nothing is wrong with it. But I just want something else. Thanks for looking."

It has the hooded sight and the correct checkered butt plate for that year model.  I think it's a beautiful and fine rifle.

This is a service grade CZ-75 style pistol made in Turkey that holds 18 rounds of 9mm ammo, making it perfect for home defense or concealed carry for not a lot of money. I took this pistol in a trade for some other guns, and need a bit of quick cash worse than I need another 9mm handgun. So, this nice pistol can be yours at a good price. I'll even throw in a box of Turkish 9mm 124 grain NATO FMJ ammo in the deal.
I've test fired the pistol and it is reliable and accurate. Best of all, it uses plentiful and cheap CZ-75 magazines which are available in 17 and 19 round capacity. One factory magazine is supplied with this gun, which comes equipped with adjustable sights. Box, papers, cleaning and sight tool are included. This would make an excellent home defense gun, or a first pistol for a new shooter who doesn't want to take out a bank loan to buy a gun.
You can see the gun (and hopefully buy it) at my office just outside of Homestead. Contact me to make an appointment and bring your ID and your best offer. Go home with a nice pistol. Thanks for looking at my listing.
Price is flexible for quick sale, not really looking for trades on this gun."
