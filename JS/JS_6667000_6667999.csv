They all also come with rings, and one has the dual end caps.

My prices are all pretty firm and around the going rate on ebay. I am somewhat flexible though, but won't take a low-ball cash price unless you're including a trade.

Most sellers would list this revolver as new old stock, although we feel this revolver is well above most you will find outside box is not with tears and tape and since its 35 years old the pickiest of inspections may find something not to perfection so its being offered as used. Some sellers buy replacement boxes and transfer labels to make them look better we do not operate that way. The internal foam box is excellent and the paperwork is complete.

This gun is in solid shape for a used AK but does show some wear to the finish with no rust or pitting at all. The barrel is nice and shiny with strong rifling and shoots a little over 1inch groups at 60 yards on paper. Running Bulgarian mags I've had zero issues with reliability not once has this gun givin me problems with a variety of ammo. It also has a tapco G2 trigger group with a solid reset along with a solid side folding stock. I'm not sure as to who made this rifle considering it just say AK-74M on the receiver and a serial number on the front trunion but I believe it to be Romanian or even Russian made. I got it in a trade for a few things. Only minor issue with the gun is the folding stock has a minor wobble to it but still locks up perfectly fine. The front sight and gas block are perfectly lined up. Im looking for cash only but might entertain trades.  No shotguns, bolt guns, anything in 40 short and weak is a no go and no cheap guns."

These carbines were manufactured shortly after the Russian government sold the plans, material and tooling for the SKS rifle to China.
 
The first manufactured carbines were called Soviet-Sino the serial number contained a Russian Cryllic as the first character of the serial number as well as  a Tula star on the left of receiver in line with the serial number.
 
The Ghost was the next batch of carbines manufactured under semi direct Soviet supervision, before adopting the a Arsenal 26 triangle with the 3 Chinese characters denoting a type 56 military grade carbine in the later part of 1956. 
 
Ghost guns have Soviet QC/Proof stamps in several locations on the weapon and stock.
 
This SKS carbine is 100% matching excluding the stock and gas tube. No cleaning kit or sling.
 
The bore is bright, with sharp rifling, the action is tight, trigger is crisp.
 
Excellent piece of history. Not exactly pretty, but very interesting a great shooter to add to your collection.
 
The SKS is a robust over built weapon for its caliber. Proven in combat in several conflicts, and will outlast most other carbines in its class.
 
A very big bang for the buck.

Stainless steel, Fully adjustable rear sight, Single action, has a short trigger reset. This gun is made for target shooting where a heavier pistol with a target trigger is needed. This pistol will also work for home defense and plinking at cans but it is a serious target gun in my opinion. The magazine well is flared for faster and easier magazine insertion. The wooden grips are super pretty and there is a ambidextrous thumb safety. I have it with the Target, 2 Factory 12 round High Capacity mags with weighted bottoms, Manual, Box, and High definition grease. This pistol is simply stunning and it is not your typical P226 pistol.

Stainless steel, Fully adjustable rear sight, Single action, has a short trigger reset. This gun is made for target shooting where a heavier pistol with a target trigger is needed. This pistol will also work for home defense and plinking at cans but it is a serious target gun in my opinion. The magazine well is flared for faster and easier magazine insertion. The wooden grips are super pretty and there is a ambidextrous thumb safety. I have it with the Target, 2 Factory 12 round High Capacity mags with weighted bottoms, Manual, Box, and High definition grease. This pistol is simply stunning and it is not your typical P226 pistol.

Stainless steel, Fully adjustable rear sight, Single action, has a short trigger reset. This gun is made for target shooting where a heavier pistol with a target trigger is needed. This pistol will also work for home defense and plinking at cans but it is a serious target gun in my opinion. The magazine well is flared for faster and easier magazine insertion. The wooden grips are super pretty and there is a ambidextrous thumb safety. I have it with the Target, 2 Factory 12 round High Capacity mags with weighted bottoms, Manual, Box, and High definition grease. This pistol is simply stunning and it is not your typical P226 pistol.

Did u want 44 MAGNUM power out of it. With this conversion it is easily obtainable in just minutes by swapping out the barrel and spring. The barrel has a SS compensator pin and welded on so it is 100 percent NY legal. Do a little research and Google/YouTube 460 Rowland. It is AWESOME. This kit is brand new - I never even opened up the package. I also have 200 RDS of Georgia arms ammo that is extremely HoTT. 185 grain nosler jacketed hollow points traveling at 1550 fps. That equates to 987 lbs of muzzle energy (44 mag ballistics). This ammo is totally sold out on their website.  This combo is valued at $561 so the price is NOT negotiable at all.
