From GunBlast (I agree):
The Polymer Public Defender was easy to control, as can be seen in the accompanying video. It hides well in a coat pocket, or when carried in a belt holster such as the versatile Simply Rugged Sourdough Pancake. Loaded with PDX1 ammo for self defense, it is a rugged, reliable weapon that is easy to shoot, and easy to shoot well. Loaded with small birdshot, it is an excellent choice for use against poisonous reptiles in the woods, and if larger predators might be a problem, carrying two shotshells with three 45 Colt loads would be a good choice, especially in bear country. Like all of the Judge revolvers, this new polymer-framed revolver is a versatile, reliable weapon, and Judge Poly is my favorite Judge yet.

I always wanted the P07 and P09 since they came out. They are great guns. CZs have to be some of the most ergonomic guns ever made.After getting both the P07 and P09 I had the opportunity to pickup a SP-01. Many don't like the heavy all steal guns like the sp-01 but I do. Now I have 3 CZ pistols that all serve the same purpose. I need to downsize so these brand new guns are moving out.CZ P07 9mm Urban Gray Supressor ReadyThreaded barrel with protectorTritium night sights (new with full life)17 round capacityIt came setup as a decocker but it also has the parts to convert to a traditional thumb safety.It has high sights that allow you to peep up over a supressor if you have one or might someday want one.Comes with 2 magazines3 interchangeable backstrapsGun lockCaseCleaning toolsThis gun has never seen a single round of use other than testing at the factory! Amazing gun I just replaced it with its steal cousin because of my preference for it.

I always wanted the P07 and P09 since they came out. They are great guns. CZs have to be some of the most ergonomic guns ever made.After getting both the P07 and P09 I had the opportunity to pickup a SP-01. Many don't like the heavy all steel guns like the sp-01 but I do. Now I have 3 CZ pistols that all serve the same purpose. I need to downsize so these brand new guns are moving out.CZ P09 40S&W16 round capacityIt came setup as a decocker but it also has the parts to convert to a traditional thumb safety.Comes with 2 magazines3 interchangeable backstrapsCaseCleaning toolsThe gun is like new. I have only run a few magazines through it and found it to be the most accurate pistol I have ever shot. I think this is because of how well I can get a grip on it with my large hands. Amazing gun I just replaced it with its steel cousin because of my preference for it.

At this price you're basically getting the case, millwork and cerakoting for free. This model comes from Savage Arms originally with everything you see accept the case, cerakote and millwork and scope of course. The chassis is aluminum. I will not answer your 25 questions so please look up this rifle online for info but I will answer the 2 questions that I've been asked the most which is ""Is there anything wrong with the rifle because of the price?"" NO! ""Why are you selling it or why you selling it so cheap then""? Because I want to! Plus because it hasn't sold yet that's why I've drop the price already a couple times & basically you're not going to get back how much you put into a gun."

It also sports an Aimpoint T-2 red dot sight.Everything is in excellent shape. The Magpul forend was purchased through Impact Weapon Components and they installed the QD attachment near the end of it. The forend also has an IWC light attachment for a flashlight with a 1 Inch diameter body. Rifle also has Magpul MBUS sight, B.A.D. Lever, Magpul MIAD grip, Magpul STR butt stock and Magpul enhanced trigger guard. I have 7 Magpul windowed Pmags and a Blue Force Gear padded sling. I also have another 4 Magpul mags new, still in wrapper. The Aimpoint T-2 was purchased last year, sighted in and has not had much use. The sight is awesome. It was ordered through LaRue Tactical and came with the LT 660 mount installed.  I also have 2020 rounds of 55gr 223 PMC ammo and another 300 rounds of 55gr American Eagle ammo, for a total 2320 rounds.  I have about $2000 in this rifle. I am looking to get $1500 for the rifle, 7 mags, sling and case. If you want the extra mags and the ammo, I will work something out with you. The extra mags and ammo wil NOT be sold until after the rifle is sold and only if the buyer does not want it. I am also not looking to break this package apart.  While I understand and know that you do not need to have a long gun transferred through an FFL in PA, I will be looking to do just that. I will cover the cost of the transfer out of my asking price.Looking for a FTF at an FFL in the Allentown. Send me your email address for pics."

Gun has always been completely cleaned after a range sessions and is a blast of fun to shoot. Looking mainly to trade for something else fun to shoot. I like all firearms so feel free to send trade offers to 25six-five0five-7876. I have cash to add to some trades. I like SIG's bolt guns in precision calibers, Ars, aks, old war guns & 1911s Located in lake city and willing to meet half way. Must have FL I'd and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  I also have a clean Taurus 1911 to add to trade deals as well"

TGI only made these guns with NEW Bulgarian kits for a short time, and these are considered on par with Arsenal rifles (minus the price tag!)-Barrel is chrome lined, finished with an original Bulgarian chrome lined AK74 brake.-Furniture consists of a Polish bulged front end with a Romanian stock.  Both have been refinished and differ slightly in color, stock has had a small repair on the right side.  Colors and finish are very nice, really pops in the sunlight (see pic)-Grip is a standard bakelite-Sling is a standard surplus green canvas, NOS conditionOverall, less than 500 rounds through gun---Mags (all 30rd):-2x East German bakelites-2x Izzy bakelites-5x Bulgarian black polymer---Ammo:-450rds Wolf Polyperformance and Military Classic, all in 30rd boxes-60rds loose 7n6 surplusLooking to sell everything for $1250At this price, the package is a deal. The rifle alone (when they can be found) has been found going for $1k. Top that with mags at $35-40/ea, and ammo at $0.15-0.20... Do the math. Obviously, I don't expect ""brand new"" or ""gunbroker"" prices, hence my package deal being well below the total value.

FNH's barrels are world-renowned for strength, quality, superior lifetime, and is worth $300 just on it's own. An average shooter will probably never shoot out this bore. And if you think shooting a 16"" midlength is soft, try shooting a middy with the reduced dwell time in a 14""! Makes for a nice small CQB build. Get yourself a lower during the holiday deals and you can make a top tier AR for around $600."
