The pistol will come with 2 blued 10 round mags. This pistol is a all steel pistol so it is one tough and well made full size pistol. I sold one of these pistols a few years ago and the buyer emailed me and he expressed how much he loved this model CZ .45 and he said it shot like a dream and was very accurate and he said it shoots FMJ and Hollow Point ammo without issues. I know these pistols are very well made and what I love about the 97B is the shape of the grip, feels so good in the hand and I do like the way a all steel pistol feels as well.

Gen 3 Glock 30 (compact .45) with a bunch of extras! First off, it has a brand new, never fired Lone Wolf stainless match barrel. Again, never fired. The slide was professionally Cerakoted in Burnt Bronze. Also professionally stippled on the grip. It comes with three 13 round magazines with the X grip extensions. Comes with everything as new in the OEM box. There is also a Thin Blue Line rear slide plate/cover on it. If you don't support LE, it will also come with the original plain Glock rear plate. I will also throw in a Serpa OWB paddle holster.Okay, so a Gen 3 Glock 30 in good condition with nothing but two OEM 9 round magazines in the box runs $450-$475 all day long. Change out those mags to three 13 round mags with X grip extensions you add in another $135. Change out the OEM barrel and add in the stainless Lone Wolf match barrel and you get another $100. Slide Cerakote was $80. The pro stipple job was another $80. The police rear slide plate was another $30. The Blackhawk Serpa retention OWB holster was $40. Add that all up and you can see that a fair trade value on this pistol would be $915, which is what I have into this pistol. BUT, I know how it goes when one considers a customized pistol. No one is going to pay me $900 for a Glock so...I WILL TAKE $450 CASH FIRM AND YOU COVER THE FFL TRANSFER. I'd like to sell this asap, thus the reason the price is so low. I can meet at Washington Military Depot in Spanaway quickly. Their FFL fee is only $15.I will trade straight across at $750 value. I am looking for a quality full size or pistol AK. No WASRs or AMDs please. I really like I/O, PAPs, Krinks, RAS, etc. Let me know what you have. Any trade must come with multiple magazines and even ammo if possible. Let me know what you have.Hurry! This will not last at this price and you know it!"

The pistol is in practicality MINT condition. It has only been test fired a few times. Round count is far under 50. This example comes from Kimber's Custom Shop (at the time) and is called the ""ELITE CARRY"".ONLY 1200 OF THESE WERE EVER PRODUCED!!It has a 4"" barrel and checkered rosewood grips. By far the sweetest shooting Kimber I ever had the pleasure of using, it shoots just as smoothly as my Wilson Combat CQB does. My research tells me this is all hand fitted and on a series 70 platform with no Schwartz safety and is considered a series 1 example. I contacted Kimber and they told me these are very highly desired pistols because of all the manual attention put into it. It has night sights, 20lpi front checkering, and an ambidextrous safety. It also has some special kind of melted treatment done to it. Please look up the pistol on the Internet for all specifications. I purchased this as an investment as I was told it would go up in value. Some Kimber fans told me I could get about $1500 for this pistol in such pristine condition. I'm asking the same amount I put into it, $1150 + shipping (OBO). I do not have a local FFL that does transfers. Please make sure your FFL will take firearms from non FFL holders. Shipping with insurance to your FFL is about $85 via UPS. I will take a bank check but if you want to use PayPal, you must pay using the ""friends & family"" feature. If you would rather use the ""goods and services"" option, kindly add 4% to the total amount (shipping fee included). I will ship the same day as I have both a copy of your FFL and cleared funds. Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks for looking!!"

Unfortunately I did get a round jammed in it the second time shooting and scratched the bolt superficially trying to get it out. I did send it back to the factory and got it checked by them and they said it functions 100%I'm asking $2400 for it or at least $1200 cash and a decent new or used ar 15 or 5.56 rifle. I would ask 2500, for the rifle and ALL the extras but I'm asking less because of the scratch that I know can be cerakoted out for around $60.Also, in case you are unfamiliar with it, the NATO version (which this is) has 2 mag releases instead of 1 bolt release and 1 mag release ( where the bolt release would be is another mag release) however the up side is it uses standard ar-15 mags rather than Steyr factory mags.Call or text (text preferred) Josh at 6144569328Serious offers only, low balls and people who are obviously not interested will be ignored.Will need to see valid ID, CCW preferred however Ohio driver's license will suffice. Will need to sign a bill of sale."

This is one of the lightest carry guns you can find in a caliber that's great for CCW! I CAN accept Credit Cards and there is NO additional fee! Smith and Wesson has been putting internal locks on their guns for quite a few years now and this model 337 is from the early 2000s and was made just before the internal lock requirement was put in place. It is in great shape! S&W combined a Scandium alloy frame with a cylinder and internal parts made of titanium to produce a revolver weighing a mere 12 ounces The engineers at S&W found that the Scandium/aluminum alloy was lighter than titanium but had a tensile strength and fatigue resistance superior to both titanium and steel.
