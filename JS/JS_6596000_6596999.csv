The Ruger Precision Rifle is a highly configurable, in-line recoil path, bolt-action rifle. Chambered in 308 Winchester, this Ruger Precision Rifle offers outstanding accuracy and long-range capability.
 
Features
Medium contour (.75” at the muzzle) barrel features 5/8”-24 threads. Thread protector installed.
Barrels can be easily replaced by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges.
Highly accurate Ruger cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 5R Rifling at minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace and centralized chamber.
Equipped with a Samson Evolution Keymod Handguard. May be configured with any AR-style handguard.
20 MOA Picatinny rail secured with four, #8-40 screws for increased long-range elevation capabilities.
Magazine well front is contoured for a positive grip for bracing against shooting supports.
‘Upper’ receiver and one-piece bolt are precision CNC-machined from pre-hardened 4140 chrome-moly steel to minimize distortion.
‘Lower’ magazine well halves are precision machined from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging and are Type II hard coat anodized for maximum durability.
Multi-Magazine Interface functions interchangeably with M110,Sr25, DPMS and Magpul-style magazines and AICS magazines (works with some M-14 magazines); two 10-round Magpul PMAG magazines are included.
Three-lug bolt with 70 degree throw features dual cocking cams and a smooth-running, full diameter bolt body.

Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation, with 5/16”-24 thread for easy replacement. Bolt disassembly tool is stored in the bolt shroud for easy striker channel cleaning.
Inline recoil path manages recoil directly from the rear of the receiver to the buttstock, not through a traditional bedding system, providing maximum accuracy potential.
Extended trigger-reach AR-style grip and 45 degree reversible safety selector. May be configured with any AR-style grip and selector.
Ruger Precision MSR stock with QD sling attachment points features a bottom Picatinny rail and soft rubber buttpad. The left-folding stock hinge is attached to an AR-style buffer tube and accepts any AR-style stock."

These good Maine folks – most of whom are former employees of Bushmaster Firearms – offer many years of experience in the industry, and all look forward to working with you, to serving your needs, and to building you a great rifle. When the people who bought Bushmaster in 2006 decided to move it “lock, stock and barrel” out of Maine to New York in 2011, the original Bushmaster owner, Mr. Richard Dyke was left with both a dilemma and an opportunity. Almost to the day of the 2011 move, Mr. Dyke’s non-compete clause expired. He still owned the property where Bushmaster had been built, and knew all the workers – now laid off – who had helped him build it. He made a decision to “get back in the game” and promptly put an email out to many of his former employees and friends asking if there was interest in joining him for a new project. With a resounding “yes” of support, he gathered the financing in two days, and started bringing people back into their long-time Windham manufacturing home. Phoenix-like, Windham Weaponry was on the rise. Within three months, the first productions models of the new Windham Weaponry line had been perfected and delivered. Quality, fit, finish, durability, accuracy and value were all superb – giving credence to Windham Weaponry’s motto “The Quality Goes In, Before The Rifle Goes Out”. The firearms industry and consumers welcomed this new effort warmly, old friends and contacts were re-established, and sales grew. In less than a year and a half, Windham Weaponry had brought back almost 70 employees, benchmarked impressive sales numbers, and established their name as one of the pre-eminent firearms manufacturers in the country. The press heralded it as “truly an American success story”, and all due to the vision of its founder. Further growth for Windham Weaponry has already been planned and implemented. “The Quality Goes In, Before The Rifle Goes Out”. Windham Weaponry R16SFST-308 Model: R16SFST-308 Caliber: .308 Win.

The P226 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P226 SAO variant brings the same feature set to the table in a single-action only package.

The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.

Movement, grips are original, ALL matching serial numbers on everything checked 5 times over and verified. Some of the bling is worn, it has usage marks, but mechanically it could not be a more sturdy revolver.If you know anything about ww1-ww2 revolvers then you know what this is valued at, in 2012 they were 800 easy with missing parts, unoriginal parts, and rusted. This one is great condition considering the age.I saw fit with it being a model 1917, to sell it here in 2017 to wait for the value to be at its peak.Pics available on requestObviously the price is not 1$ but feel free to make an offer after you see it."
