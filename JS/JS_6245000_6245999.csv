I've had many calls about price, this is not the cheapened down new version stealth this is the original ba it's selling for well over 2000 on gunbroker and I'm including around 600 in reloading gear, I think I have a fair price not a steal but if u think it's too high make me an offer but I'll tell u now no I will not sell it for the same price as the stealth. If u want a stealth and can buy it for 1400 then go do so. Sorry if I'm coming across harsh but just tired of the comparison. Thxs for looking and have a great day."

I scrapped the project because it would be a significant investment in reloading materials, and think the idea is a bit impractical, and gimmicky. Beyond that, I won't be gauranteed that the rifle would even produce appreciable results. I think in that time, I've grown up a bit.I purchased the brake for $60 plus shipping, and it's mostly in the raw, but the ports have been media blasted. I think it has a pretty cool aesthetic, but your opinion on finish may vary. The device has only been handled minimally and has not been attatched to anything yet.Shown and not included, for scale, my Nitrolon G2 Surefire flashlight.I am however, looking to have my SMLE rebarreled with a GM barrel with a .310 bore, so if you're a gunsmith and would like this device as a partial trade for labor, I'm certainly interested in doing biz. I'll post another listing as time permits with my requirements there, as well.As usual, I offer 10% off of any of my asking prices for active duty military, law enforcement, or practicing Scout Masters and Eagle Scouts!"

It comes with both a rubber butt pad and metal stock hardware.This is a very early production M14A rifle made by Federal Ordnance in El Monte, CA in the 1980s. I selected ""Springfield"" because Federal Ordnance no longer exists and is not listed in the drop-down menu. This is an early 10XX serial # rifle with early USGI parts including a chrome lined 1962 H&R barrel, H&R bolt, op rod, Winchester trigger group and of course a dreaded ""shoulder thing that goes up"". It shoots very well and happily eats any kind of .308 or 7.62x51mm NATO ammunition you care to load into it. I am only selling it because I bought an early Springfield with similar parts.I am asking $1400 OBO, this is not a firm price but is indeed cheaper than a new-production Springfield which will have a cast receiver and inferior commercial parts. If you're considering buying one of those, this rifle is not only cheaper but superior in quality, which will likely reflect in better accuracy, reliability and long-term performance over a new production base model commercial M1A. I am also including 2 10-rd magazines and one 10/20."

Fully functional pistol as it comes, some milling by a gunsmith or machinist on the rear trunnion and the appropriate ATF filing and tax stamp and you can build what is about as near a factory M92 from Zastava as you are going to get. While the factory muzzle boosters where brought in en masse by Century Arms (~$20), finding a new production Zastava underfolder was not easy or cheap. This came off of an imported NPAP DF that was parted out, these stocks as surplus tend to go for over 3 digits.
