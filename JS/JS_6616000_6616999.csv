A Smith and Wesson M&P 40 Shield Performance Center. It's in excellent condition with no holster wear as I did not carry it often. I'm not sure of the round count, but it's fairly low (less than 500 rounds) and it cycles flawlessly. This is the model with the upgraded trigger, fiber optic sights, and ported barrel. Everything that came with the pistol is included, box, paperwork, 6 round and 7 round magazines, trigger lock, etc. I purchased this pistol new from Dick Harder at Harder Auto Parts in Clinton Twp last April 2016. The reason I am selling it is that I recently bought this same pistol in 45ACP to use the same ammo as my 1911. I don't need them both. I would rather sell this pistol outright, but I may entertain interesting trades (preferably hunting weapons). Take a look at the pictures and contact me with any questions. Buyer must have a purchase permit or CPL and a valid driver's license. Thank you for your time.  Price is $375"

Except this guy. I originally purchased this to make it into an SBR. But now I don’t want to do that anymore. I just want to buy ammo and training classes. I might trade for an AK rifle. No Century stuff though. Possibly an AR. Just ask. So, since these M92 pistols are sold out everywhere and there’s somewhat of a demand for them, I’m asking $750 for mine. I have fine tuned this machine and it functions flawlessly.It’s also featured in some videos of mine.Go to youtube and search for me, JustinoFundido, and look through my videos. You can see me shoot it, work on it, and paint it. I took the camo off so I could get it back to a more classy look."

Don't want to sell but trying to get rid of things I don't need. Valuing setup as $325 in ammo, $125 in scope and rings, and $450 for rifle. 405-TOO6ATE -23FOR2"

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

In development for more than four years, the VP series debuted in 2014 and is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP line, but the VP series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “precise pull”trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker-fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels—accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK’s patented charging supports—simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating VP pistols easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 pistols use the proven P30 steel magazine (15 round and 10-round capacity were required by law). The VP series has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel —made from canon grade steel —ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment (black) finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP series are a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this pistol online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Using special colorants added to the frame during the molding process, the new VP9 (9 mm) grey models have all of the highly regarded VP features. In development for more than four years, the VP series debuted in 2014 and is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP line, but the VP series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “precise pull”trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker-fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels—accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK’s patented charging supports—simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating VP pistols easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 pistols use the proven P30 steel magazine (15 round and 10-round capacity were required by law). The VP series has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel —made from canon grade steel —ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment (black) finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP series are a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And the VP is remarkably value priced.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this pistol online at www.copsgunshop.net."
