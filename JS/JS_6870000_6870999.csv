It has a threaded 20 inch deep fluted 1-10 twist barrel. It has the same flutes and barrel profile as the new 5r gen 2 models. It also has an adjustable trigger.  The factory stock was replaced in favor of a Bell and Carlson M40 Tactical stock with two sling studs. It also has a Wyatt's Outdoors mag system with a 5 and 10 round mag. I had a Badger Ordnance bolt knob installed. It also comes with a Harris bipod. According to the shot book, it has exactly 292 rounds through it. All proper barrel break in procedures were followed.  This rifle is flawless! It easily shoots 1/2 MOA with my 168 grain match loads. I have over $1500 in the gun minus the scope, rings, and base for a $2500 total.  I will take $1200 without the scope, base, and rings (I will throw in a weaver base). I will take $1700 for the whole package. I hate to part with it, but I'm trying to finance a new project. The build prices were as follows:Rifle: $775Stock: $271Mag system: $24910rd mag: $63 Bolt knob installed: $95Bipod: $94Total: $1547 (minus tax and shipping costs)Vortex Viper HS-T 6-24x50: $789Warne Tactical 20 MOA base: $119Vortex bubble level: $35Vortex scope caps: $40Vortex scope rings: $50Total with scope: $2580.00All accessories were installed by a professional gunsmith.

The stock has a 1"" spacer that makes it a standard 13.5"" length of pull as the shooter grows, or changes clothing according to their environment. A high quality recoil pad makes shooting the compact, lightweight rifle extremely manageable; and interchangeable pistol grips allow you to modify the angle of the grip for shooting from multiple positions. Additional screw placements on top of the receiver provide for a secure, rail attachment. The T3X uses a 2-lug bolt with a 75º lift that cycles smooth as silk. The 75º bolt lift aids in keeping hand and gloves away from the scope and speeds the cycling process. An enlarged ejection port facilitates feeding rounds one at a time. A single column polymer magazine feeds reliably, and facilitates in loading and unloading the rifle.

I only am using the receiver and about 7 inches of the barrel and magazine, everything else will be discarded/sold. I only need the reciever and about 10 inches to be safe in good condition. It has to be shootable, but other than that the details aren't critical. It's to be used as a ""grenade launcher"" for a Pulse Rifle build. The stock can be trashed and the front of the barrel can be FUBAR and it's fine as long as everything else works perfectly and the portion I need looks decent. Obviously I'm not looking to spend a lot, but if you have something that meets the above I'm sure we can come to an agreement. I am also going to put up an ad for a Tommy Gun M1A1, preferably pistol so I can avoid the stamp by using a brace setup, but will entertain stocked weapons for the right price. Again, stock can be trashed and sights gone and crown beyond repair as long as it has 10 inches of the barrel that is good and the gun runs flawlessly with a decent looking right side of the receiver."
