Designed specifically for military and law enforcement operators, the APX has been put through extensive testing and evaluation at the professional end user level. The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences. The APX’s aggressive full length slide serrations make slide manipulations easy under any conditions . To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous. The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta.Learn more at Beretta.com."

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 12.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The 12” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 14.5” pinned and welded Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip. IN STOCKThis rifle BRAND NEW! Comes with factory box and all factory paraphernalia. Feel free to email us with any questions."

Very accurate pistol. I have 2 mags..they hold 18 rounds of 22tcm or 17 rounds of 9mm. The conversation is very simple just swap the barrels and recoil Springs. You can use the same mag..a little info on the 22tcm. It's a 40 grain bullet put in a neck down 9mm case. It leaves a 5 inch barrel at 2100 feet per second. Look it up on YouTube it's a nasty little round. I have roughly 600 rounds of 9mm and half a box of 22tcm I can add for extra money.

At the same time, it can be used in various other applications, including as a clip-on sight, in a tactical system, and alone as a handheld imager.Unlike the IR HUNTER, the MARK II, is powered by the new BAE Systems MicroIR thermal core, which uses the latest 12 micron sensors to provide a 50% increase in magnification in a compact, military grade package. The new sensors also draw less power, which helps extend battery life.Resolution is a crisp 640×480, and the state-of-the-art processor passes a fully digital RGB signal with a smooth 60 Hz frame rate to the Emagin VGA 640×480 OLED display. This ensures a perfect pixel-for-pixel match with the sensor, providing a perfectly clear and sharp image with no upsizing or downsizing needed. Competing systems often cut costs by using analog displays.The processing power of the IR HUNTER MARK II generates detailed reticles and symbols with MOA accuracy that are easy on the eyes, even after hours of viewing. Simply sight in and quickly make the ballistic corrections the shot demands! Adding to the ease of use and accuracy, the MARK II employs turret knobs instead of buttons. Using this thermal sight is as familiar as using your day sight!"

$900 firm in cash, no less, or better in trade.  Might trade for a Glock 17 or 19 Gen 4 with bright night sights and $400 cash.  Ones with extra mags, better trigger etc. will get preference.  Not a Glock fan, just want one to go with my AR9.
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, depending on the deal.  Items I could use more of, AR FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger & Law Tactical Gen 3-M folding adapter.  Also, a 9""+/- 5.56 upper, a few side charging uppers, 9mm stripped lowers similar to the Joe Bob's Spartan I have now and maybe an AR pistol in .45ACP or parts.  Could also use several factory Glock 33rd. 9mm mags in new/like new condition.
Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  Please, no lowballers, scammers or flakes!
Thanks for looking!"

I bought this rifle new, it has <200rds through it.

Here are more photos: https://imgur.com/a/G2GGh

INCLUDED:
* 2 Tapco 30rd magazines. They rattle in the rifle, but function just fine.
* An Arsenal cleaning rod and surplus cleaning kit. 
* A front sight adjusting tool.

This rifle has a side scope mount and Tapco G2 trigger, which is pretty damn nice. From my experience, the rifle runs great and is more accurate than the iron sights allow. I easily shot ragged holes at 20 yards and got 2-3MOA groups at 100 yards.

The rifle has original wood furniture, which is a little beat-up, but has great AK-47/74 character. I replaced the original front sight post with a ‘fine ball’ aftermarket post purchased from Midway USA.

As you can tell this rifle can shoot sub inch groups out of the box. I am not selling the scope that is currently on it, but am including a vortex crossfire ii. The only reason I'm selling is because I am having my 300 win mag being worked on due to a manufacturing error (savage). I'm asking $600 or best offer. Put probably 25 rounds through it. Practically brand new. Have about a box of shells and leupold mounts and the vortex scope. If interested please email me or call or message me at 414seven three two 0892. Thanks for looking.
