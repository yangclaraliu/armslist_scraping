She is not a gun person (not opposed to guns just doesn't have any desire to shoot).  I, incorrectly, thought this would be a good way to introduce her to peak her interest in guns. That said, I now have a revolver which I fear will sit in my gun safe for eternity. I already have plenty of revolvers and don't need one more. If you are interested in a trade (+/- cash is fine) for this revolver, please let me know.  Not looking for anything in particular... just let me know what you've got to offer. Approximate trade value is $300 but I can be flexible. Thanks"

This one dates in mid 1970s. Gun is in excellent condition, trigger is incredibly smooth, shoots great.
In later production models Smith and Wesson stopped pinning the barrels and recessing the back of the cylinder. I was collecting guns in the 1980s and even then the Smith and Wesson handguns that were pinned and recessed were sought and a premium price was paid.
I got this gun with and early like new custom made by T L Tucker holster made with Ostridge skin.  This was an expensive holster.

I am looking to trade one of my optic setups.  Its an EOtech 512 that has been used on my AR for about 2 years. Its still in great condition and works flawlessly. Included with the EOtech is a GG&G rubberized flip-up lens protector. I also have a Vortex VMX-3T magnifier. It is practically new as I havent used it yet. It includes the flip-to-side base. This magnifier is crystal clear and has no blemishes or defects. I do not have the original packaging for these optics, but will include the pistol case that I keep them in. These optics together make a great setup and work together very well. I am mainly looking for trades at the moment. I am interested in 22/45, AR15 pistol uppers, 9mm AR uppers, other quality optics, 9mm pistols, 9mm carbines, Sig, Ruger, etc... Will entertain any reasonable offers.

I only say ""almost"" new because I did get a scratch on the turrets which is pictured in detail below. The scope was mounted and used for 3 range sessions. The scope was only mounted to 15 ft lbs with fix-it-sticks, so it was not over torqued at all. No other scratches on the scope, just very minor scuffs. Includes everything that comes from Vortex - it's all pictured below. I'm asking $2,400Trades:I am really only looking to sell this for one reason - so I'm only really willing to trade for that scope. I'm looking for a Nightforce ATACR F1 5-25x56 mil/mil with the new MIL-C reticle. Since it's such a new reticle that might be a long shot to trade for - so I MAY also consider the MIL-R reticle. I usually prefer new optics, so trading is my secondary preference. Please contact me to work out trade details, and of course with any questions about the AMG.Will trade for:Nightforce ATACR F1 mil/mil 5-25x54 with MIL-C or MIL-R reticles only."

In the pictures you'll see my KAC rail both top and bottom that's still in great condition with the pouch and ladder protectors this isn't a fake and can send better pictures upon request. Can break this up but would rather just get rid of all of it at once. KAC rail with pouch and rail covers 2 30 round mags with 60 rounds of 223 ammo a castle but wrench and a buttstock cleaning kit for an akm. All the extras are free if you buy the rail. This is great for a clone build or if you just wanna be tacticool. Check out the prices online most places start at 225 and go up. I'm asking 200 for everything. Also not pictured is 2 .50 cal ammo cans I can add for an extra $10 a piece of you need or want them. If interested please text REDACTED I do not respond to emails
