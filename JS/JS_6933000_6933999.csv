I got this rifle totally stock towards the end of last year thinking that I would be unable to find one in California again and then chose to upgrade it with in my opinion the best options made for the Scar, but now the money I am out in it is much more needed than the gun and I will not fire it since I am now choosing to sell it.•I am looking for $6000 in total value if everything is included or best offer.I might be open to off roster handguns as partial trade if they are cool guns, but I really need the majority of the deal to be cash. I can also sell without the scope/scope mount/flashlight/Surefire Warden/sling/and bi-pod to save the buyer a little extra money if needed.

Do you go all out and participate in the growing sport of Cowboy Action Shooting? Are you one of the many thousands of avid big-game hunters? Nod yes to any of the above, and you're ready to step up and grab hold of the new Henry Big Boy .44. It's big, brutal, and beautiful. Henry rifle owners were inquiring when we'd look back to our historical roots and our designers did just that. The result is the first American made .44 Henry lever action featuring a solid brass receiver since the original Henry rifle of 1860. The adventure and romance of America's Old West are imbedded in its distinctive 20"" octagon barrel, straight-grip American walnut stock with brass buttplate and brass barrel band. The solid top brass receiver features side ejection. The overall length is 38½"" and this powerhouse weighs in at 8.68 lbs. A nice 19th century touch is the use of a fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with white diamond insert and brass beaded front sight. The .44 is the cartridge that was said to have ""killed more game, big and small, and more men, good and bad, than any other in existence."" Our tubular magazine can pack ten of these powerful bruisers. The .44 Mag is a serious hunting tool, and has proven itself time and time again on all of the world's game. We trust the Henry Big Boy .44 will soon become a favorite of big game hunters due to its handsome looks, rugged reliability and proven knockdown power. The Henry Big Boy .45 Colt is also offered for you cowpokes who do Cowboy Action Shooting. The Big Boys have the smoothest actions of any centerfire lever action rifles on the market today. They work beautifully to give you competition shooters a leg up in any event you take part in. Take a close look at the Henry Big Boys. Cycle their actions a few times. We're confident you'll be adding one - maybe both - to your gun collection."

It has never been used. It was mounted on the rifle, was never fired, and been on the rifle for a year in a safe. I just took it off the rifle recently. So it is literally BRAND NEW! It has all the hardware and instructions it came with including both allen wrenches. The only flaw with it is near the rear sight. It came from the factory with some kind of glue towards the rear sight. (See Pictures) It is very small, very minimal and it didn't bother me at all. I paid $385 plus shipping for it, I am going to knock $100 off of list price. The only reason I am getting rid of it, is because the rifle needs to be more of a training practice rifle for family members. I also don't want to ship this, so please be local. I am firm on the price because this thing is NEW! I think $100 + shipping knocked off is a pretty good deal for this chassis."

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.
New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change.For more information call REDACTED or e-mail REDACTED"

I finally found a replacement for this carry piece and I figured I'd throw it up to see what's out there. For size comparison, the pistol on the left is a kimber micro carry 9mm. The pistol is in very very good condition. I did carry it every day up until recently. It is the all stainless model, which is somewhat hard to come by. I purchased the gun brand new and I have all factory items with it. The pistol has 2 dot rear sights with a green fiber optic front sight. Comes with 2 10 round magazines. If the for sale price is met, I will include a pelican case that I have for it. The case is just big enough to hold the pistol with inserted mag, and the other extra mag. I have shot quite a few rounds of all different types and loads through it and I've never had an ounce of trouble with it. I also have a galco leather owb holster for it. (It's the one with kimber embossed on it. I had this prior to getting this gun and it fit and it's comfortable so I used it.) I have a pair of hogue wrap around grips installed, but also have the original panels. I also have a pierce grip extension for one of the mags that is brand new in the package still.  For those who don't know, this is the 3"" barrel, double stack. i am am open to a variety of trades. Cash is best, as I have my eye on something else. Anything tactical rifle-wise, and anything compact and subcompact pistol-wise catches my eye. No full size 1911's. I will take straight trades, cash, trades plus cash from your end, or multiple firearm trades. I will not add cash. I will also not ship. Im asking 800. PRICE DROP. $700"

This is a Factory New Upper built at Troy Industries. There work is top notch, and there reputation for quality is well known. There work is beautiful, like the dimpling and staking of the gas block, almost nobody puts that effort into there barrels and it is hands down the best I have seen.

Thanks for understanding.You will need to add your BCG, charging handle, and slip in a gas tube($10) to finish off this upper package. I have stock charging handles, BCG's (take offs), and several BCM mod 4 charging handles, along with many new grips from magpul, Troy, Ruger, etc. You would have to spend well over $400 to buy these items from even the cheapest place online. Plus you would need all the small items like barrel nut, crush washers, proper tools, correct anti-sieze lube for the receiver, etc. Thanks for reading, and have a Great Weekend!"

This gun is in great condition and has only been fired a handful of times. I will also include 35 runds of Fusion ammo, 20 rounds of Remington Corelokt and 15 rounds of Federal Power Shok ammo. This is a beautiful and accurate rifle. It is a top of the line model and if you are not familiar with the features of this rifle I will list some of them:A very sophisticated bolt action.With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt II feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.BarrelThe barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.TriggerA chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.MagazineHinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine.Magazine Capacity Four in magazine, one in chamber.Lastly, Browning offers A-Bolt II rifles with synthetic stocks. The best known of these is the justly famous Stainless Stalker model. This was the first composite-stocked production rifle in the world, and many still regard it as the best. Certainly it is one of the most attractive. The Stainless Stalker has a silvery, matte finished, stainless steel barreled action and a well-shaped, checkered, black synthetic pistol grip stock made of a fiberglass-graphite composite. The buttpad is black rubber. This stock is supposed to excel in durability and thermal stability. Stainless steel sling swivel studs are standard.As for the scope: High-grade optical glass provides excellent brightness and clarity with lasting durabilityQuality, precision-ground lenses are larger than those of comparable scopes, for better light collectionIndex-matched, Hi-Lume® multicoating aids in low-light performance and glare elimination, increasing your success rateDurable, integrated-eyepiece design has no-slip grip for easy adjustment in the fieldPositive steel-on-steel adjustments assure repeated accuracyWaterproofNitrogen-filled scope tubes prevent fogging, even in cold and rainDurable, stress-free, solid 1-piece outer tube withstands shock and vibrations of even the heaviest-recoiling calibers1-in. body tubeGuaranteed by the Burris Forever Warranty™So grab this chance to get a forever rifle and lifetime warranty scope for a great price!!"

It runs flawlessly. It does have some COSMETIC defects (i.e holster wear) but again, NO functionality defects.Includes:-BlackHawk Serpa Holster -Three factory magazines-Original box, paperwork, lock, etc etc-Night sights (already installed)-Talon Grips, already installedSpecial features:-Laser egnraved ""M&P"" on the slide. Not sure why this one has it, I bought it NIB and it was there out of the factory. But it's still neat nonetheless. Other stuff you want to know:-One owner (me) for one year-Approx. round count: 300 factory brass (no reloads ever)-All the cosmetic wear and tear is from practicing my holster draws, could easily be blued up and refinished for cheap but it honestly doesn't even need it since the wear isn't even close to deep enough to seriously affect anything. NOT SELLING TO 18 Y/O'S.Must have: Valid Arizona DL/ID and current CCW/Pistol Permit. No CCW, no sale.

I am selling this Remington 870 Express synthetic that has been shot ONCE! Thats right it has only been shot one time. There are no dings or dents on this gun. It is mint.
The Remington® Model 870™ Pump-Action Shotgun is one of the most proven firearm's designs in history. The 870 Express® is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it one of the most useful tools that an outdoorsman can own. The versatile, no-nonsense 870 Express can be used for hunting waterfowl, upland game, and deer, as well as a home defense shotgun, and informal clay pigeon shooting. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and swing fluidly on fast flying birds. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun - Synthetic comes with virtually indestructible black synthetic stock and fore-end that are impervious to water, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A durable, rubber recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. All 870 Express shotguns function with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells interchangeably. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes.

Nightforce has combined all the durability and features of our tactical NXS line with high-power variable magnification and a wide selection of target and field reticles, which were born out of Nightforce’s Precision Benchrest Series. These hybrid NXS models make a significant departure from the tactical applications of its predecessors to offer long-range and benchrest shooters fast internal adjustment capabilities for precise and repeatable shot placement. The 8-32x56 and 12-42x56 NXS feature resolution and optical performance comparable only to high-end spotting scopes.

The rivets on the firearm are all seated perfectly and the fit and finish on this is second to none (no BS, I've purchased many rifles and this is the highest build quality of any of them). Reason for selling is I'm getting my CWP soon and I'd like to invest more into my handgun collection. This is my favorite looking rifle but I never use it because I've wanted to keep it 'mint'. I've shot 5 30-round mags through it total (150 rounds). It has ran flawlessly, like most Ak's, and shoots very well. I consistently get very respectable groups at 100 yards with the iron sights and I would not call myself a great shooter by any stretch. I'm fairly confident I'll never find a rifle like this again. The supply of A-grade Polish rifles is totally washed up on the retail market. You will see highly watered down polish kits on Atlantic firearms and others now and then but most don't have wood funiture and very few have the original wood. This is the prettiest 'ugly rifle' you'll ever see. Feel free to ask questions! I have many more pictures I can send on request.  *Cash or certified check - SC Driver's license"

Our B-14 rifles were inspired by the desire to bring the quality that Bergara was known for in the custom rifle world to production rifles made for all hunters. In the B-14 rifle, you will find a level of craftsmanship that surpasses all of the other production hunting rifles on the market.The B-14 HMR rifle features our integrated mini-chassis molded into the stock to give the rifle repeatable bedding and accuracy. It also supports a fully free-floated barrel to achieve optimal precision. The Bergara Hunting and Match rifles are built to offer a rifle for both hunters and competition shooters that can perform incredibly in either situation. The stock features an adjustable cheekpiece and length of pull spacers. Built in Spain at our highly automated and efficient barrel factory, this rifle delivers a level of quality and performance that is unmatched in its price range.The world-renowned Bergara barrel on this long range precision rifle is complemented by our own super-smooth B-14 Action, which is a two-lug system with a Sako-style extractor and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure a smooth feeding and extraction of the cartridge. Itâ€™s also outfitted with a Bergara curved trigger we designed to guarantee a crisp, clean pull every time you fire the rifle. The trigger comes set at about three pounds. It has been factory drilled and tapped to fit Remington 700 style rings and bases.The (#5) Bergara 4140 CrMo steel barrel is finished in matte blue and is available in 20 inches in the .308, which weighs 9.15 lbs . The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24"" and includes a thread protector.A 5-round AICS detachable magazine is standard with our HMR rifle. QD flush cups are included in the stock to allow for easy attachment and detachment of slings.

With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 7 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the user may require.  The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip. MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION* LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

These are a must have at the range and blow away normal earmuffs that block all sound and prevent you from having a conversation. You hear better then ever with these!
These work great although one of the battery terminals on 1 of the ears is a little corroded, so you have to make sure the battery is inserted properly, although I am sure it could be cleaned up as well.

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6933998,For Sale:  Help and Prayer Please! We are sleeping in my truck,"Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, June 9, 2017",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Good morning I am posting because I am in dire straights and I have never been in a situation like this before, I need help finding assistance with my rent cause I paid a medical bill after threatening phone calls saying they would take me to court so I paid it and then didn't have the cash for the guy who rents me the house so he could pay the landlord. I need help with $200 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in God but me and my family wont have a roof over our heads for our 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till next Wednesday night to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask God to take care of this thank you and God Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $200 then anything helps even if its a little! Thank you and god bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, I don't care if I have to give someone my bank card to hold and my social security card, even the registration to my truck just so you know I have to come back to pay if its a loan, I never use craigslist and posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, I have received messages saying people are cautious to meet in person, well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, God bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend"
