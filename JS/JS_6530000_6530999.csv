Its long, 15 rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Combined with a mid-length gas system allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.

The LW has identical features to the V5 and costs the same too, but the difference is the LW has a lightweight barrel, which cuts a third of a pound. The LW uses the Omega X Rail 12 handguards. These handguards are free-floating, so when the barrel heats up and swells they won’t press against each other. It has Picatinny rails running along the top, bottom and sides, which allow for easy mounting of optics or accessories. The top runs continuously and meets with the upper receiver and extends slightly after the front sight. But it is available with fixed sight, flip sights or not sights. It has a mid-length gas operating system, so propellant gases are caught in a tube near the muzzle, the tube guides it back to the bolt and then catches in another tube on the bolt. When the gas is caught, it drives the bolt back. This delays recoil until the projectile has left the bore. Mid-length means that the gas is caught after a medium distance in the barrel, so less pressure is used to push the bolt back (compared to the short-length gas system). Features include a chrome lined bore, a vertical fore-grip, a MagPul buttstock that’s lightweight and adjustable, a cold hammer forged barrel, so a machine carefully carved the grooves in the bore. This process produces accurate and durable rifling. And it has a sling swivel attachment points, so users can attach a combat sling, which allows them to sling it while carrying it at the ready. Daniel Defense recommends the LW for military, law enforcement or personal security. Manufacturer: Daniel Defense Model: 02-123-16029-047 DDM4V5LW Condition: New Caliber/Gauge: 5.56 NATO"

Rifle is in pretty good shape for its age. It definitely shows some honest wear and usage. Stocks have some cracks and dings but nothing real bad that effect the usage of the rifle. Bluing is definitely deteriorated but has some original still intact. I did replace the combination spring in the receiver due to it being broke when I bought the rifle sometime ago. Also have a replacement tang screw and escutcheon that comes with it. Would make a great collector piece or starter rifle for a new shooter to learn on and have a piece of history. It's a screw type take down with a manufacturer date of July of 1929. Asking $340obo. Just ask for more pics Thanks Brent REDACTED

Barrel and internals are beautiful in this gun. To have full disclosure I will add that due to its age and being in and out of a holster it does have slight holster and ware marks nothing one of these wouldn't have. This isn't your run of the mill Italian beretta we all see floating around with the weird mag release in the grip. So with that being said you get this beautiful peice of U.S craftsmanship 75rds of ammo and 5 magazines.  For serious inquiries only call/text 84three-504-802three price is firm only trades considered would be Gen4 glock 17 preferably in FDE.

Serial #732 of 1915 Guns made. In Metal Ammo can box with every bit of paperwork. The slide has been racked once by me to assure clear when I got it new. This fine pistol is unfired and unmolested! This single-action-only steel 92 has a frame-mounted safety and has the years 1915 and 2015 engraved in Roman numerals on either side of the Brigadier-style slide. The same numerals are featured around the medallion logo in the center of the premium-wood grip panels. The pistol, magazines, cleaning rod, and safety lock are contained in an ammo-can-style Beretta box, which also sports the anniversary dates. The Original Beretta 1915 Only a month after Italy entered the First World War on the side of the allies, Beretta patented the Model 1915, which was immediately adopted by the Italian military. Chambered in 9mm Glisenti, a rather mild counterpart of the 9mm Parabellum on which it was actually based, the Model 1915 single-action semiauto featured a cutaway on the slide and a minimally-protruding barrel—two features that would become a hallmark of Beretta pistols in years to come. Curiously, it also had two safety devices: one frame-mounted in the rear (similar to the one we have “copied” for the 92 Centennial), the other located above the trigger. The 92 Centennial tastefully imitates some of these features while also showcasing the very best of what Beretta has achieved in the intervening century. Must Ship to an FFL, I am not an FFL, so they must take shipments from Non-FFLs or buyer must pay the extra $50 for my FFL to ship.
