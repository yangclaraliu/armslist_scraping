Other than that, it's a stock Gen4. It may have around 750-1000 rounds through it, and has never had a critical malfunction or needed repair. The gun is as all original as the day I bought it. Looking to part ways with it as I now carry an M&P 40 on duty, and this thing just sits in a drawer. Im not itching to ditch it, but I'd like to get my hands on something else. With the gun comes a Blackhawk SERPA paddle holster, a Fobus paddle holster, and a comfortable Bianchi IWB holster.
If you are law enforcement, I could also throw in two Safariland 6360 ALS duty holsters, one in high gloss (albeit a bit worn) and one in STX/kydex to help sweeten the deal, or for a bit extra.
Shoot me a message if interested. A bill of sale must be completed.  Thanks for reading."

This is your last chance to own this one of a kind pistol in California. Awesome for home defense.  Hate to see it go, because we all know it will be worth some serious money soon. After December 20, 2016 you will NEVER be able to buy this weapon in California.I live right in between L.A. County & Orange County, near the 5 fwy & 605 fwy."

Still in like new condition. Completely coated inside and out for the best protection possible and seamless appearance. Custom sight, slide, and trigger work. Buttery smooth recoil (enhanced by the slide work), dead nuts (sight work), and runs every round every time (custom trigger and internal work).  All the internals including the hammer, trigger, pins, etc. have been changed out with original Beretta parts. The barrel and recoil spring/rod were retained (because they're better than the original Beretta 8000 parts). It's a badass. This version of the 8000 has the hardened steel spring rod and hammer forged barrel (as opposed to earlier models with a polymer spring rod and non-forged barrel). No low balls please. There's more money in custom work done than the gun costs new. I like the 8000 series pistols and the Stoeger's are the only ones (that are easily accessible anyway) with a rail. It was worthy of the upgrades and is an excellent pistol.  I just don't use it as much as it should be used so it's time to move on."
