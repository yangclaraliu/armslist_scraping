This tool is made to go on a 1/2"" drive rachet or impact wrench. It does not come in contact with any part of the gun except the barrel nut. Put this over the nut and use an impact wrench with the gun standing on the but pad vertically so you can press downward, and hit the trigger, and the nut comes right off with no damage and hardly any effort. Then you are ready to put on any muzzle device of your choosing. This tool can also be used as a 1"" socket so it is not worthless after you are done with it like all the other versions of this tool, that can only be used on the barrel nut then never needed again. These are hand machined to fit precisely over the nut and each piece is test fitted on actual KSG nut for proper fitment.The photo shows how it fits over the barrel nut but the nut is not included.I will ship to the 48 states for $4.50 and other places may be more."

It is all in perfect condition same as it was in the 1980's when it came in!!! The cardboard box is in perfect codition also. This gun is like looking into a time warp. These came in exactly like this in the late 1980's, and I have looked very hard thru the plastic, no rust or blemishes! Its an original Norinco Model 84S Para Rifle. This is an AK47 in 5.56 caliber rifle, chambered for the 5.56mm Nato cartridge. This rifle is new in the original box. All of the components are still sealed in their original plastic bags. This is why there are only a couple of photos. I did not want to open the sealed bags for better photos. The rifle has the underfolding  stock. It includes three 30 round magazines, a bayonet, a cleaning kit, instruction manual, and a sling, oil bottle and the allen key. All are still sealed in plastic bags with the white bags of chemical to keep it from rusting!. Last time I saw packages new like this was 1989 just before the ban."

It comes with the box, 2 mags, and I could also throw in a Lonewolf .40 conversion barrel ($600 for package). The great thing about the conversion is you only have to swap the barrel. The slide and even the mags work perfectly with .40 (because it's the same diameter as 10mm).This is the perfect gun to take for critter protection while hiking. I personally use double tap 200 grain. Some people actually hunt bear with this round. Powerful enough for anything that comes around with 10 rounds (or 15 if you want to use the Glock 20 mag and have it stick out a bit). Then at home you can swap for the .40 barrel, use it for home defense and target shooting that is MUCH more affordable than 10mm.Text REDACTEDI've only put a few hundred rounds through it (some 10mm but mostly .40). It is in great shape, and it's a glock, so it works perfectly every time."

Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law."

I bought it brand new 2 years ago and have put about 900 rounds through it. I disabled the mag disconnect safety myself.  I have never had any failures or jams of any sort with it. Has been a great gun for CCW. I painted the sights with glow on night sight paint. Comes in original box with original paper work, the gun and two 9 round mags.  I am selling it for a reduced price because it has recently developed a problem with the mags not locking into the gun. I'm almost certain that it is from mag wear on the part that locks into the mag catch and from so much use it has worn down to the point where the mag will not lock into the mag catch any more. NO ISSUES WITH THE GUN JUST THE MAGS. The gun still works flawlessly you just have to hold the base of the mag so it does not fall out during the recoil of the gun.  I don't feel like fixing the mag problem so i decided to sell it for cheap my loss is your gain !  I am asking $25 for shipping on top of the gun price !!! Thanks for looking !"
