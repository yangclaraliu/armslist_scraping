Wanted to buy 22lr pistols for qualification use. I am looking for a few serviceable shooters, not sentimental, safe queens. Condition not so much a concern but must be serviceable.  I  was hoping to get them in the $200 price range as that seems reasonable for these common firearms not in NIB condition. I am open to any offer and I will pay a reasonable price  within budget. I need 1 revolver and 2 semi-auto. I prefer intial contact by email. Please send make model and price. Not intereseted in dragging things out haggling as I can do that at the LGS. I will pay with cash, and happily provide ID and current CCP card. If you insist on FFL transfer that's ok too, but that adds to the cost. ideal are Ruger Mark series (or standard), browning buckmark, and Taurus revolver (as I have to teach about revolvers). I picked these because they weren't expensive new, are of good quaity (can handle the volume of a training pistol) and a lot of them were made. If I had to, I could get three of them new and stay in my budget, but looking to save as this is a new endeavor. The key requreiment is 22lr not make and model.  I am not a gun dealer/vendor so I only have the Standard Catalog of Firearms, BB of Gun values, common sense, and what I see in the LGS to help pinpoint price.  I can find mark III / and buckmarks used at the LGS all day long for 275-300 in great condition.  Sorry to seem crass, but that is what I find. I realize this may be unrealistic but thought I would give it a try to get some used and save money since it if doesn't work I'll have to liquidate them and I know the LGS offers 20% of the BB of guns listed value, if they even want them. Thanks for looking! I understand this may be unreasonable but thought I would try it first."

He had been in the service since he was 17 in WWII (had the underage vet pins too) and was a career navy guy with 40 some years in. I have always wanted one of these, but unfortunately it is too short! I am 6'2"", 250lbs, and this fits perfectly except for the length. As you can see in the pics, it is 26"" long from shoulder to waist, and I need a 27"" jacket at least. I wear XL in my motorcycle leather jackets, and a size 46-48 suit coat, so this is pretty spot on with its XL size tag. I am unsure as to the age of it as the family said he had had many of these over the years, but the shorter length lends to it being a bit older (not an exact dating method obviously).Jacket has a few spots on it from use, but nothing terrible, and has that older leather smell, but hey, its actual goatskin, so it should! The only real issue I can see is the gentleman removed the pocket buttons (for whatever reason), and one pocket flap is a bit wrinkled from storage, but it should be able to be ironed/pressed out pretty easily.Actual military issued jackets don't come up for sale as often, and this one has never had any patches put on it (which was a plus to me as I am not a naval aviator), and I am just looking to get back what I paid so I can put the funds towards one that will fit. I will also trade for a longer one in similar condition on the off chance someone has the opposite problem (a 2xl or size 48-50 would fit the bill I think)."

Like all War Sport firearms, we manufacture our AR barrels using only the highest, gun barrel-quality American-made bar stock. We treat the barrel, gas tube and bolt carrier group with Nitride—a chemical process that makes the surfaces slicker and more durable—to increase the GPR’s accuracy and lifespan. The upper and lower receivers, plus the rail, are Type 3 hard-anodized and are then finished with a Cerakote that resists abrasion, wear, and corrosion. With its lightweight design, the War Sport GPR is a top option for both hunting and competitive shooting. And this rifle will get you noticed. We hand-assemble every War Sport GPR at our state-of-the-art North Carolina facility using only American-made parts. The unique design of our rails and other components create a distinct look that stands out no matter where you are. Mid-length DI Gas System (Gas Tube & Low-Pro Gas Block, Nitride).
