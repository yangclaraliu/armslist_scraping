I am a new seller here, but used the sight for a fairly long time. I have held an FFL since 1985 and I have a 240 positive with zero negative on another auction sight. I am selling this item from my private collection. let me say I have been collecting sniper rifles since the early 1980's and I am not claiming to be the number one authority, however I do claim a fairly diverse knowledge in the area. Winchester M70 sniper with a serial number that dates the rifle to a receiver mfg. date of 1938. Standard model with the USMC contract J.Unertl USMC 8x optic serial number 2402. I believe this rifle to likely be an original example and I believe the supporting pictures and information available from some of Peter Senich's research as documented in a few of his books (""U.S. Marine Corps scout-sniper World War II and Korea"" and ""The one round war"") give strong evidence of the likely authenticity of the rifle. A few pages from the books have been put in the pictures of this auction for your consideration. The rifle has original blue finish That has some areas of slight patina showing through the finish in a few areas. The most wear is on the steel magazine housing likely from being carried. The barrel is the correct 24in. Winchester heavy barrel has an excellent bore and according to research the majority of the Model 70 rifles used in RVN were re-barreled and stamped with the year on the underside of the barrel just ahead of the receiver until 1956. This rifles barrel has a date of 55 as seen in the pictures. The receiver is in excellent condition and is correctly cut for the ""clip-feeding"" slot. The receiver is not electro-pencil marked US property however according to Peter Senich's book ""one round war"" on pg.83 ""Some, (but not all) of the Model 70 rifles fielded for sniper use bore the U.S. Property marking on the left side of the receiver ring"". The bolt is correctly electro-pencil marked with the matching serial number on the rifle as seen in the pictures. The bolt face is in VG+ condition. Acording to Peter Senich's book ""U.S. Marine Corps scout-sniper"" on page 45, 30-06 M70 standard rifles had been procured by the Marine Corps as a matter of course before and during WWII"". Some of these rifles had originally been used for competition and had ""Lyman Receiver Sights"" installed on the rear left of the receiver. (see Senich's book ""one round war"" pg.84. When these were converted for sniping issue, the stocks where the sights had been installed were repaired. This rifle has such a repair as seen in the pictures. The stock has also been bedded. The correct factory blue butt plate is also on this rifle, shows some finish wear and browning but is in nice condition. The stock is in VG original condition and is the correct type and finish for a USMC contract rifle. The optic is an original USMC contract J.Unertl sight 8x. with the factory blue finish. The finish, similar to the rifle is fading slightly but is still near excellent. The optic is clear and has the USMC thin cross wire reticle with the ""fine small dot"" in the center of the reticle. Correct USMC contract version J.Unertl target-type black duraluminum mount with hardened steel parts ""3-point suspension mount"" with the black/white contract USMC thimble adjustments. The bases are original J.Unertl contract front and rear, special for the Model 70 system and have the mount spacing notches allowing 6in. and 7.2-inch spacing. The scope also has the factory original ""threaded-type"" objective and ocular lens dust covers that are not commonly seen. As stated I believe this rifle to likely be an original Winchester Model 70 J.Unertl sniper rifle and as such, not a commonly seen item at all. Please feel free to email with any questions. FFL or C&R license is required for purchase. There will be a 3 day non-firing (following delivery) inspection period for the buyer. Full refund of purchase price will be accommodated but the rifle must be returned in the same condition as shipped. The Payment must be in U.S. bank funds or U.S. postal MO only.

What this means is that it fires when you pull the trigger and then fires again when you release it. It will fire as fast as you can pull and release the trigger. There is no physical modifications need to your AR other than to install 4 pieces (trigger group, safety selector, and bolt release). This will fit in all standard AR platforms due to just replacing parts that are already installed on your gun.   This is a blast to use on yor AR and will put a grin on your face when you get it all installed and rocking at the range.

Taking the previous owners at their word, I believe the total round count is below 1,000 rounds. I'm happy to take larger/additional/specific photos upon request.Not much more for me to say about this, so here are the details from the Nighthawk Custom website.=====The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. It has an officer frame with a commander size slide. It features a Nighthawk T3 magwell, Heinie Slant Pro Straight Eight tritium rear sight, and serrated rear of the slide to match the sights. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own.The T3 Thin has all the features you love about the T3 with a reduced grip circumference. It has a thinned front strap, flat mainspring housing, and thin alien grips, which is an excellent option for people that prefer a smaller grip to the traditional 1911.* Forged officer size frame and 4.25"" barrel* Match grade .45 ACP barrel* T3 magwell* Heinie Slant Pro Straight Eight Tritium night sights* Thinned front strap and mainspring housing* Ultra-thin G10 Alien grips with no logo* Serrated slide top* 25 lines per inch checkered front strap* Horizontal ""no-snag"" serrated mainspring housing* 40 lines per inch serrated rear of slide to match rear sight* Shortened slide stop and beveled frame* Crowned barrel flush with bushing* Lightweight aluminum Nighthawk Custom tri-cavity trigger* New ultra hi-cut front strap* Completely dehorned for comfortable carry* Checkered recoil spring plug======"

It is a 16in MATCH model. The rifle is new in box, was only removed to take pictures. It will come with everything it did new. The trigger is currently a nickel boron milspec from BCM, which comes factory until the ZEV SSR triggers ship. Inside the box there is a voucher to redeem your ZEV SSR trigger. PWS is a great company that revolutionized the production of piston ARs. They use a long stroke piston, the same length as the AK platform. The piston is part of a two-piece bolt assembly that disassembles in seconds for easy cleaning as well as less parts for longevity and reliability. PWS stands behind their product with a no BS transferable lifetime warranty. I love their product. I am only selling to fund another build. This rifle retails for $2100 when you can find them in stock. My loss, your gain. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Text or email is best due to work hours. REDACTED"

If you don't know about these let me just tell you it shoots better than any other handgun I've used. It is silky smooth action when firing rapidly and truely is a shooters pistol.

This rifle is ready to go out and hunt with right now. Here piggy piggy. I'm selling it because I have gotten into air rifle big time and am going to buy a high end rifle. The downside to this is to get the same amount of power in a higher end rifle, I'll have to spend more than double. This is a terrific value and the best bang for the buck. People have asked me about how loud it is. Reviewers on youtube seem to agree about the same as a framing nailgun, 160 or so DB depending on the ammo you use. There are many youtube video reviews on this rifle. The most extensive review was by ""Airgun Exploration and Advancement Channel."" There are great hunting videos of this rifle taking large tough game with heart lung shots in Africa out to 70 yards. This rifle is an exceptional value. I'm firm on the price. Mahalo."
