I know much at all about black powder firearms, the gun cycles perfectly, Locks up tight, if you have any questions I’ll be happy to answer them, come with the rig you see in the picture. Call me at 954+8I8+88IOThe Ruger Old Army revolver is unusual in that, unlike most percussion revolvers on the market, it was not based on a historical design, but was a modification of Ruger's Blackhawk model, which was itself based upon the cartridge-firing Colt Peacemaker.[2] The Old Army revolver accordingly incorporates many modern design features, though employing antiquated black-powder component loading.This design was built around the Blackhawk, but it takes its styling cues from the Remington Model 1858 cap and ball pistol. This is due to the frame being longer in front to accommodate the loading lever and pivot pin. Earlier models listed as .44 caliber, later as .45, but all use a .457” round balls or .454” conical bullets of pure lead.[3]Unlike the Blackhawk, the Old Army did not make use of Ruger's transfer bar safety; instead the revolver relied upon a series of safety notches between each chamber on the cylinder like some models of the Remington/Colt or other black powder revolvers of the mid-19th century had.[1]The revolver was tested by loading each chamber to capacity with Bullseye smokeless powder and a lead ball. While this might result in catastrophic failure in other firearms, the Old Army proved to be strong enough to handle the pressure."

I am open to offer's I am not interested in trades besides semi-auto compact pistols larger than 22's.~~~This site only let's me post 3 pics~~~ You can view all of them at http://imgur.com/a/n7zRg1) The octagon barrell - Asking 200 OBO - (INTERARMS Alexander VA) - should work but was never fired by either of us. It breaks open smoothly and all parts seem to operate correctly, trigger, pin, hammer all appear to do their jobs. I just cant verify it actually shoots.2) The pump - Asking 150 OBO - (Sears & Roebuck M200 12GA)- seems to be mostly sound. Clean gun but the pump grip seems to be loose, all i know about it, is my dad said it worked great then he let a buddy borrow it to hunt and he broke it, but should be an ""easy fix"".3) The double barrel - Asking 100 OBO -(American Gun Co, NY Genuine Damascus / Choke Bored- needs a good deal of work, it looks to be black powder, with a double trigger. The gun doesn't break all the way open and I don't know if it is supposed to or not, the trigger and hammers seem to work well but it looks like the hammers would strike a cap instead of a pin. Also the handle is loose and either needs to be replaced or fixed. Unless your serious about fixing it, it seems like it would only serve for decoration.4) The swords have been sold!5) Blow Darts - Asking 20, I'll probabley just give it to someone with purchase if interested - My dad bought these for me when I was about 12, at the IX outdoor expo, they are really fun and just a dangerous toy, it doesn't take much effort to shoot a dart threw my carhartt at about 20 feet accurately. I don't know what else to say about it besides that."

Selling only because of an old injury that stops me from being able to properly shoulder and fire rifles for long periods of time. I've decided to go with a 9mm light carbine for home defense/the range because they're a bit lighter.This is a Spikes Crusader lower (My favourite one they make), an Anderson upper with a Sota 1:9 barrel. Installed is a UTG PRO aluminum free float rail with M-Lok compatibility, (The actual really good stuff they make for guns, not the budget stuff a lot of people put on their airsoft) Magpul Mbus sights, Magpul B.A.D lever, Magpul CTR OD stock, Magpul M-Lok Vertical Forward GRip Magpul OD MIAD grip with all backstraps, Radian Raptor Ambi Charging handle, UTG PRO QD socket for sling, QD end plate behind buffer tube, and also a Molon Labe/Deus Vult dust cover that matches the lower. Rifle shoots great, is dead accurate, and is in excellent condition.Comes with 10 brand new Magpul Gen 2 30 round PMags still in the packaging, 2 Troy 30 round Batttlemags, one 30 round Hexmag. 3 of the mags are loaded, some with Wolf and some with Federal. About 80 rounds between the 3 of them. Also comes with the standard A2 grip, charging handle, dust cover, and a black MOE stock in case you don't like the OD Green look. I'll list everything that comes in this package below so you know this is a really good deal:Spikes Crusader LowerAnderson UpperSota 1:9 BarrelBasic BCGMilspec Buffer TubeBasic Lower Parts KitUTG Pro M-Lok RailMBus Sight SetB.A.D LeverMagpul CTR Stock OD GreenMagpul MIAD Grip OD GreenMagpul M-Lok Vertical Forward GripRadian Raptor Charging HandleUTG Pro QD Rail SocketQD End plate double sidedCustom Dust Cover10 Gen 2 PMags2 Troy Battlemags1 HexmagBlack MOE Extra Stock80ish rounds of ammoFactory A2 grip, charging handle, and dust cover.I'm asking $800 for EVERYTHING. That's one hell of a deal for one hell of a rifle. I've got quite a bit of money invested into this, but you never get what you paid back and I'd never try to rip anyone off. I see people listing rifles with cheaper parts for $1500 all day long, I'm not one of those idiots. When I'm done with something, I sell it at a fair price to give someone a good deal. I had my fun with her, and now it's time to go.I'm not really looking for trades right now, definitely prefer cash. That being said, feel free to make me whatever trade offers are on your mind and I'll consider them, the worst I can do is say no eh? Just please don't offer me .40's, shotguns, bolt actions, black powder, Glocks, or your lawnmower. I will sell to anyone over 18 which is following Michigan state law, but if you look young I may ask to see ID just to cover myself.FTF deals only, located in Northville but willing to drive a bit.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time or shooting me a PM on here, I'll generally be able to reply within a few minutes.Thanks for looking!- Mike"

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters. The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety Firearm Specifications Calibers: .380 AUTO Weight unloaded: 8.3 oz. Loaded magazine: 2.8 oz.

The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense. A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant's special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears Dan Wesson's popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there. The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads. It has a Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear.Buy Now"

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won't be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, the back of the mainspring housing is bobbed. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. The CCO has an undercut trigger guard and DW's ""chain-link"" grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. It is fitted with dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The slide and small parts are treated in DW's Duty Black finish. The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional.BUY NOW"

I will also include a custom kydex IWB holster that was made for this model with the safety, cost was $50.00 for the holster. Asking price is $600.00 for everything. I am located in the Margate/Coral Springs area and would like to keep this local. Might travel for a great deal/trade. 21 and over please with a CWP preferred, but not a deal breaker."
