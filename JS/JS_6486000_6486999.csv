Yes!  If there is an ad up there is still an AK in my posetion. 2)will you meet me in an ally and do a cash deal?  while I want cash for the gun,  I will not meet anywhere but a dealer to do a legal transfer that not only insures my safety but also my freedom to keep and use firearms into the forseeable future. 3)will you accept trades?  not likely, while I am open to the concept, I'm picky as hell and I know what I want to use the money from this sale for and you probably dont have what it is I want, so unless your in posetion of a bear br33 right hand bow and are also willing to toss some money in as well theres probably not much of a deal to be struck there. 4) is the price negotiable? That depends on how little you insult me and jerk me around before trying to actually make a deal.  I like this gun, I dont need to get rid of it, just trying to get something I can put more use to without going out of pocket.   5) You live a long ways from me, will you ship it or deliver?  No I wont ship.  I can and will meet you closer to you if and only if you are serious about actually buying it.   6) will you split up the package so its more manageable for me?  maybe, make an offer.  I know that bulk ammo sells quick around here since you cant ship it into our wonderfull state.  And if you do find bulk in stores its hardly a deal compared to on line prices.  But a package deal clears me out and sets you up to go play without having to track down the stuff that makes these evil big boy toys run.  seems like a win for you and I."
