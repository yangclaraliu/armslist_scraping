This rifle was built under contract by DWM for the South African Republic (Transvaal) during the Boer War. Due to the British blockade of Portuguese West Africa at the time, this rifle was sent back to DWM and resold to Chile (this is indicated by its ""C"" prefix). This rifle is in excellent condition especially considering it is almost 120 years old and has been to four continents. It features a Chilean crest on the receiver, there is minimal wear on the stock and receiver, and the bore is still shiny. Overall, these rifles are great shooters known for their light recoil and flat trajectory. A testament to this fact are stories of Boer marksmen being able to hit British soldiers almost 1000 yards away in the open Veld of South Africa. This is a great chance to own a piece of history, and would make an excellent addition to any collection of mausers or antique military firearms. Please feel free to contact Aaron for more information and pictures: 814 516 62-seven-nine"

This original Russian Saiga-308 Winchester features a heavy duty reinforced barrel trunion, thick wall premium receiver with side-rail installed, and a hammer forged chrome lined bull barrel. From the custom fluted 21.8 inch barrel to the premium GUN-KOTE™ finish, this is a true professional tactical conversion. It features premium components that complement the incredible reliability of the Russian Saiga AK47 design. The barrel was pressed out to start the process then the muzzle was turned down to install 14:1 metric left hand threads- these are mil-spec threads that allow any AK47 muzzle break to be used. The proprietary barrel fluting process is unique on this SAIGA .308 AK47 barrel! This proprietary barrel fluting adds rigidity for increased accuracy; increases surface area for improved heat dissipation; reduces overall weight; and adds a unique look found only on this custom SAIGA rifle. The trigger guard is moved next to the mag latch and a customized USA mfg. G2 trigger group installed. The heavy duty muzzle break helps to reduce felt recoil and gives you better shooting control. It has GUN-KOTE™ premium firearms metal coating & finish. This permanent thermal cured hi-tech finish sets it apart from factory and “air dried paint finishes”. Premium GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, and paint finishes in both durability and performance. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish helps to protect metal parts from rust, corrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and thermal-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized hard coating that meets ALL MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS for protective metal coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, and durability. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets the US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". It has a USA mfg. aluminum buffer tube, six position collapsible butt stock, and aluminum quad-rail forearm that is precision machined and custom fit to This SAIGA 308 rifle. pistol grip has finger groves and is made from a recoil absorbing compound.

This is one of Diana's recoilless rifles and is very accurate out of the box and even more so now. I commissioned this rifle to be built by Héctor J. Medina G.- Airgunsmith of CT Custom Airguns LLC. For you folks who don't know about Héctor, he is a wizard at tuning Diana air rifles and a great guy to deal with. This rifle was completed and delivered to me in May 2017 This .22 caliber 56TH has been completely tuned and here is a list of some of what he did: - Tuned the ZR scope mount - Installed and zeroed a new Vortex 6-24x50 Crossfire II scope - Best pellet identified as JSB Jumbo Express 14.3 grain pellets (see photo of various pellet groups @ 35 yards) - Installed a HMO piston and HMR breach seal to support heavier pellets - Titan XS spring with a moly infused nylon guide yielding 22 ft lbs of energy - Put the rifle in a Plano hard case for safe transport Hector put 1,200 pellets while tuning the rifle so it should be fairly stable and it is firing about 1/2"" groups at 35 yards. I listed this rifle as ""used"" on Gunbroker because of Hector's work. Since he completed the rifle, it has just sat in my vault and I have decided to sell it to fund other projects. In fact, I have not had time to even fire it. Thus, I am selling the rifle as you see it plus the hard case, original main spring, piston and two 500-count tins of the JSB pellets. Note that Héctor recommends lubing the pellets with T-9 liquid lubricant.

Feel the difference the second you pick it up! The Polymer80 PF940v1.5 features a rock solid pistol frame, injection molded from a fully automated system that was two years in the making.
This system is designed as a complete kit. There's NO expensive jig kits and parts to purchase - Polymer80's PF940v1.5 system is a COMPLETE, all inclusive package in one price!
Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard Glock styled pistol grip. Even better, this pistol grip includes a built in flared magwell for speed loading. This feature will surely be a favorite amongst competition shooters who require speed and accuracy.
The jig is included in the price of this system. The kit comes with drill bits and the end mill bit that's required to finish your Glock project the right way.

80% Polymer Pistol Frame
Polymer Jig System
Drill Bits and End Mill Bits

Feel the difference the second you pick it up! The Polymer80 PF940v1.5 features a rock solid pistol frame, injection molded from a fully automated system that was two years in the making.
This system is designed as a complete kit. There's NO expensive jig kits and parts to purchase - Polymer80's PF940v1.5 system is a COMPLETE, all inclusive package in one price!
