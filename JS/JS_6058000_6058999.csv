Bought in California so could only buy 10rds mags so I have five. Very accurate and handles the 40 S&W with ease with a 5lbs trigger cocked. The quality of this weapon is evident when holding it next to Glock, Sig or XD. No trades and will only meet in Tucson, CCW prefered but AZ DL a must. Have fun hunting, below is description from H&K site.The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

This is a sharp gun with an 8 round cylinder and comes with a leather lined Safariland holster. Also has the factory rubber grips for a low recoil and solid grip. I HAVE ATTACHED A SHORT REVIEW OF THE MODEL 941.     Forgas Taurus has been manufacturing revolvers in Porto Allegre, Brazil for over 50 years. They began selling their wares in this country in 1968, a year of great change and turmoil for the handgun industry in the United States. The first Taurus revolvers sold here were, for several years, of varying quality. Basically, the were looked upon as a poor man's Smith & Wesson. The guns also contained design features of other guns, but were generally viewed by the shooting public as a cheap copy of Smith's Model 10. The guns worked well enough, but had a few rough spots and lacked sorely in the area of ""Pride of Ownership"". However, if a shooter needed a cheap, reliable revolver, the Taurus would usually deliver. That was the 1960s and '70s, and since then things have definitely changed at Taurus. Taurus is no longer viewed by  knowledgeable shooters as a cheap copy of anything, but as a leader in modern  firearms manufacturing. Taurus now handles the import of its Brazilian made firearms through Taurus USA in Miami, Florida, and also manufacturers some of its guns at the Miami facility. Taurus recently sent to me for testing a .22 magnum revolver, which is the subject of this article. This particular revolver is built on their small frame. As has been the case for many years, when reviewing a new small-frame .22 made for what I call a ""Trail Gun"", I end up comparing the new gun to my favorite old Smith Model 63. I have written about the model 63 before, so I won't get into the details of the little sixgun here (see Jeff's article on the S&W Model 63 at Little Big Gun). In the basic design, size, materials, and weight, the new .22 Magnum from Taurus is very close to my Smith 63. Sadly, Smith & Wesson no longer makes the model 63 .22 Long Rifle or its .22 magnum counterpart. The Smith .22 revolvers now available are either made from light alloys or on a larger, heavier frame. That leaves Taurus filling a pretty important niche in currently available firearms: the rimfire double-action trail gun.  Taurus offers this particular revolver in a choice of blued steel or highly polished stainless. They offer this gun in .22 Long Rifle as the model 94, or in .22 magnum as the model 941. Finally, Taurus offers this gun with the choice of two, four, or five inch barrels. These guns all come with fully adjustable rear sights and ramp front sights. The front sights on the stainless models are supplied with a red insert. The guns also are supplied with a set of finger-grooved pebble-grained rubber grips. Taurus also offers this gun in a light-weight alloy frame model, but only with the two inch barrel. The .22 Magnum model 941 tested here was ordered with the five inch barrel. In a .22 Long Rifle trail gun, I think that a four  inch barrel is just about ideal, but to handle the extra power of the .22 magnum, the five inch seems better suited to the task. My first impression of the gun upon opening the box was that this definitely wasn't a Taurus of thirty years ago. The finish on this handgun is flawless, with a bright polish overall and a satin finish along the top of the frame and barrel. The rubber grips are  both hand-filling and comfortable, while not being bulky or out of proportion to the revolver. The barrel is made with a full underlug design that, while adding a couple of ounces, gives the handgun a nice overall balance. Another nice feature of this revolver is that Taurus has supplied it with an eight-shot cylinder, as opposed to the  traditional six chambers of most competitive guns. A feature supplied on Taurus revolvers, including this one, is their patented Taurus Security System. This unobtrusive device  consists of a round stud recessed into the hammer which, when activated by the supplied key, renders the handgun inoperable. To disengage the lock and ready the gun to fire, the key is turned a  quarter-turn and removed from the gun. The process takes about two seconds, and can either be left locked or ready-to-fire. Personally, I believe that one should educate children to not touch a gun without permission, and no mechanical device can take the place of a parent's attention. However, in the world in which we live today, the Taurus system may prevent curious little kids from firing the  gun. In effect, the Taurus Security System can be either used to lock the gun or ignored as seen fit by the gun's owner. As with any firearm, regardless of the quality of the finish or the price, the proof is in the shooting. I can say without qualification that I was genuinely surprised, even amazed, at the accuracy of this gun. .22 magnums in general are, in my experience, not as accurate as a good .22 Long Rifle. I was expecting this gun to group into the three-inch range. My interest was piqued when the first five-shot group measured only three-quarters of an inch at 25 yards. This revolver continued to display exceptional accuracy throughout the shooting session. I am very anxious to try every brand of .22 magnum ammo  available with this gun. I also want to point out the fact that 3/4 inch groups are about as good as I can shoot with any handgun,  especially when equipped with open sights.  While on the subject of accuracy, the practical accuracy of this gun was enhanced by its excellent trigger pull. The single-action pull is crisp and releases at  about three pounds. The double action pull is smooth but somewhat heavy, a  necessary requirement to ensure reliable ignition in a rimfire revolver. The 941 functioned perfectly during testing with no misfires of any kind. Excellent handgun velocity was obtained with Federal 30 grain hollow-point ammo, exceeding 1450 feet-per-second out of the five inch barrel, due in part to the tight barrel-cylinder gap on this revolver. This is good enough accuracy and velocity to engage small varmints and predators out to 100 yards. Overall, I was very impressed with this revolver. The 941, and its Long Rifle counterpart model 94, fill a void that has been left by the demise of the J-frame steel S&W rimfires, the Colt Diamondback, and the High Standard revolvers. This Taurus is a superb little revolver to pack along when walking through the woods, or for hunting small varmints and predators. The gun is light enough to carry unnoticed in a hip holster or backpack, yet has enough heft to balance well when placing your shot. With eight shots of .22 magnum available, it could perform double-duty as a defensive weapon against two-legged predators as  well. If you haven't handled a Taurus handgun in the last few years, you will be surprised by the quality of both materials and workmanship of the new guns. Taurus is a manufacturer who seems ready to meet the needs of shooters with a wide variety of products in a time when some other gun makers have let quality slip badly."

Outdoor Life - Gun Test  For the first time since we began doing our annual gun test, a single rifle has won both the Editor's Choice and Great Buy awards. So how did it do it? With its gleaming stainless-steel action and barrel and a laminated hardwood stock that echoes the sculpting of legendary stock-stylist Reinhart Fajen, the MK II certainly looks considerably more upscale than its price tag indicates. But good value alone doesn't win Outdoor Life's top award. To do so, a firearm must exhibit a level of performance consistently better than that of other guns in its class. The Savage MK II .22 RF we tested proved to be not just the most accurate rimfire we tested this year, but the most accurate rimfire we've ever tested, including some high-dollar rifles of exalted European origin. After the gun was sighted-in at 50 yards in a test tunnel, the first four 5-shot groups measured .191, .202, .263 and .260 inches, for an average of .229 inches. Yep, that's less than a quarter-inch! More remarkable is the fact that these tiny groups were fired with standard Remington/Eley ammo and an old lot of CCI Green Tag, neither of which are considered the ne plus ultra by accuracy fanatics. The smallest group of all was fired by team member Sam Arnett, who demonstrated his award-winning benchrest technique with a barely measurable .109 inches. By comparison, an eighth of an inch equals .125 inches, so go figure. Aside from its obviously super-accurate barrel, much of the MK II's shootability was credited to its weight and the solid way the contoured stock rides the bags. Testers' Comments: Incredible value; can't beat the price for this kind of accuracy; Trigger pull could be better; A tack driver; Savage can be proud of this firearm; Aesthetically very pleasing overall; a damned fine .22 rifle; I¿ll buy it.

The original owner fired 50 rounds through this pistol, and I've shot another 100 since buying it from him. The gun has been well cared for, cleaned, and greased throughout its life. Comes with everything included from the factory (box, two 15 round mags, papers, etc.), as well as an new recoil spring and original trigger.I've replaced the ""short reach"" trigger with the traditional fat trigger. If you prefer, I can swap the skinny trigger back in for you. Note that the short reach trigger is NOT the same as the short reset kit (SRT), which is included on this pistol from the factory.Specs can be found on SIG's site, but a quick rundown of features beyond a regular 229 is: aluminum grips with backstrap & frontstrap checkering, extended/upswept beavertail grip, forward cocking serrations, rabbit ear night sights, extended mag release, SRT kit installed from factory, and 15 round mags.
I'm not thrilled to be selling this, but I have to make up for some other purchases in my budget and I already have another pistol in this caliber and size. While I would normally be happy to hear any and all trade offers, this time I need to stick to cash. I'm also fairly set on the price- I've got no use for negotiation, I'm just listing the lowest price I can based on what I need. 
I prefer to transfer through I-5 Guns in Lacey; if you can make it out on the 13th they'll waive the fee, and I think it's only $30 or so anytime else. I'll meet you at Federal Way Discount Guns or anyplace reasonably close to south King county to split the cost, or I'll go out of my way (again, within reason) if you cover the fee.If you have any questions or if you need additional pictures, let me know. Thanks for your interest."

It is in like new condition. I don't care for crossbow as much as I thought I would. For this bow though, I will say that it is probably one of the best you can get. It groups 1"" at 30 and 40 yards all day. Match your target arrow weight to your broadhead arrow weight and you'll never miss a deer. Simply use a chronometer to see how fast your chosen arrows are flying, match that speed closley on the crossbow scope and your drop is calculated right into the markers on the reticle. This crossbow is the real deal folks. Shoots through a crossbow target at 30 yards no problem. Comes with 7 arrows, a nice crossbow case, original box, manual, string, cocking tool, string change tool, quiver and scope. Awesome package. I'm moving back to vertical bow. No trades. $650 firm.
