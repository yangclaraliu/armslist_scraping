It's a ruger 22/45, in pretty good shape but there are a few scuff marks on the muzzle from the previous owner. I have put maybe 100 rounds through it. I have 1 magazine and a padded case. It's accurate enough that I was planning on taking it squirrel hunting this year. Works very well with CCI standard velocity LRN's and remington golden bullet HP's. I really love this little gun, but I have a baby on the way and I had to choose between this and my other 22 pistol and this one is getting the boot. Firm on price. I will provide a bill of sale."

Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

I bought It earlier this year from a fellow HKpro member. It is marked G36C as I had intentions to SBR it, however I decided to abandon the build. The current setup has an ""e"" barrel that has been cut down to 14.5 inches and pinned with a flash hider for the 16"" requirement. All internals are in great condition! There are a few cosmetic imperfections, On of the ""b""s on the ""Heckler and Koch GmbH"" has been chipped out where Tommy put the steel plate for the mag well conversion, but in no way affects the function. The folding stock catch had been worn down and wouldnt lock a folding stock very well so I ground it down and machined my own steel stock catch that has been staked and pinned into the receiver, Id say is better than before!The package comes with:G36 extended magazine release (currently shown on rifle)XM8 extended bolt holdopen/release (currently shown on rifle)Hendsoldt 1.5x carry handle optic (currently shown on rifle)G36C top railG36 Original Folding stockG36K handguard w/handstopKNOCKOFF!
