Adjustible rear sight, oversized wood target grips (Ruger).  Comes with original box, booklet and a great Roy's Leather 19 SD belt holster with perfect stitching and very light scuffs.  You will not find a better gun."

The AR180 was designed by Eugene Stoner about a decade after he designed the AR-15 and after Armalite sold the design to Colt. It was designed as an easy to manufacture gas-piston rifle that could be produced in less industrial countries more readily than the AR-15 could. Trouble was, around this time (late 60s/early 70s) the US Government was giving everybody who hated commies crateloads of M16s, and so the AR180 never really took off. Later rifles such as the SA80 and G36 would essential copy the simple gas piston action of the AR180 to great effect. Armalite reissued the rifle in the late 90s/early 00s with a new polymer lower reciever, greater AR-15 parts commonality, and the ability to use standard USGI magazines, as well as minor changes like a different charging handle and removing the dust cover. This is the AR180B version complete with the polymer lower.
If you didn't feel like reading that history lesson paragraph, its a well designed rifle with some history. While it hasn't been made for years, Armalite still offers pretty much all of the internal parts on their webstore should you need a replacement.
Rifle is in good condition, less than 500 rounds fired. Only real blemish is a little bit of brass scoring in the star chamber from a doublefeed, which brings me to my second point: Rifle DOES NOT work with any generation of Pmags, you have to use steel GI mags of some sort. It might feed with Pmags but it won't hold the bolt open after the last round. If you need steel mags let me know, I have some PSA mags lying around.
I am not in a hurry to sell, so the rifle is priced accordingly. At the time of this posting there isn't a single AR180B on Gunbroker for less than 700 dollars, mostly because they haven't been manufactured in over a decade now. By buying this rifle you're basically saving me the hassle of posting it up on Gunbroker and shipping through an FFL.
Willing to meet anywhere within reason. Trades I would be interested in are any Bushmaster/Colt style AR15 with a carry handle upper, M4 or M16A2 style, any auto tactical shotguns, Scout style rifles, or lever action hunting rifles."

The Renegade is how POF does basic. The features in the Renegade go far beyond the low entry barrier that many manufacturers obtain but don’t care to surpass. This barrier of entry is known as MIL-SPEC. As you’ll see, it is anything but basic. In fact, the only parts that can be considered basic are the forged lower receiver and flat-top upper receiver. The heat sink barrel nut dissipates heat quicker than any system on the market. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block, with straight gas tube, let’s you tune this rifle to be as smooth and flat shooting as possible, no matter the ammo load out. At this price, and even well beyond it, you simply will not find features like this on any other rifle. The 14.5” Renegade rail with M-LOK compatibility and 4 integrated QD slots provides maximum comfort, hand placement, and accessory mounting options. Topped off with a 16.5” nitride heat treated barrel, you have a 1 MOA guaranteed rile suited for any patriot.      POF has positioned itself through superior engineering and design in making the AR platform the absolute best it can be. Each rifle is built with technology that is 100% unique to POF rifles. These enhancements are explained in detail on respective rifle pages. These are enhancements that no other manufacturer can claim, as most of them prefer their comfort zone of fitting standard parts together instead of delivering reliable innovation to those that need it most – our Patriots.       Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Excellent about mint condition pistol with matching numbers on frame, slide and barrel. Only made for a few years in the mid 1980's the Bren Ten was made famous as Sonny Crocket's first pistol in Miami Vice (a specially adapted Bren Ten in 45ACP to fire blanks in the show). The Bren Ten would be produced in limited quantities of around 1200-1500 units with just a couple hundred short barreled ""Special Forces"" marked guns, made in black like this one or super scarce two tone. This pistol shows little use with just light powder residue. Mechanics are perfect and includes a factory magazine. An expensive gun at the time for those customers willing to wait to get one. This is a nice one that includes the original manual."

Steel three-dot night sights. Composite frame, ergonomic and skeletonized controls. Just could be the ultimate 1911-380. Out of the box, it is ready for accurate, functional shooting and easy carry. But it goes a step beyond with its great looks derived from its composite frame with machined aluminum subframe, blackened stainless steel finish with silver polished flats. Then add to that checkered rosewood grips with gold Buckmark logos. The steel three-dot combat sights, dovetailed into the slide, are a fine finishing touch. The concept. The Browning 1911-380 combines two of John M. Browning's most lasting innovations - the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge - into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern ""pocket pistols"" that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The grip is compact, yet is long and wide enough to allow the shooting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort. Manufacturer: Browning Arms Co.

This gun comes with the original box and all original paperwork, and the serialized end tag is totally intact. It is wearing a set of genuine Smith and Wesson wooden target grips, but the original stock rubber grip is included. There is a set of these original factory grips on gunbroker right now priced at $189 just for the grips! The gun has long been out of production and the 8-3/8"" barrel cannot be bought even as one of the new (and very expensive) S&W Classic models. The bore and the chambers are perfect and shine brightly. From the slight turn line, it appears to have been shot very little. Factory original color case hardened trigger and hammer.  This revolver is below market and is PRICED TO SELL.  The listed price is FIRM on this stunning revolver. Face to face sale in Central Ohio. CCW preferred.  I am not looking for any trades.  If this ad is up, the revolver is available.  Thanks for looking."
