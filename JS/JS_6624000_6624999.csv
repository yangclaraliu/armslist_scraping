All military marks and proofs are present as seen in pictures. RE and Crown for Army. XXI stamp is for 21st year of Mussolini. Best M1934 I have handled. Previous owner claimed to have purchased from the veteran's widow where it sat unused in his sock drawer for 60 years. The previous owner never shot the weapon and could not show me how to field strip it for inspection. It looks brand new inside. If it was ever used it was very few times. Fit is very tight. It fires flawlessly. The slide grip edges are very sharp! Only flaw I can find is a light scuff on the slide serial numbers seen in the pictures. Check out the example picture on the Wanted M1934 ad here on Armslist, no comparrison on condition. Check the red dot on the safety switch, like it's never seen daylight. No holster. The second magazine is aftermarket, steel with a plastic foot and worked fine at the range. I am not a WWII collector, my kids are not gun enthusists, it sits in the Baretta isle of my safe. Hoping it goes to a good home."

A Chinese Security SKS is a Type 56 Carbine produced at one of three specific state-owned/controlled arsenals expressly for issue to soldiers of the National Public Security Forces and are marked as such. It has two Chinese ideographs on the right side of the receiver. Also, the bolt carrier is a very dull matte finish. They are identified by arsenal /26\, /416\, [0140], [0141], [0144], and were imported through KFS (Keng’s Firearms Specialties) located in Georgia. From what I have read, it was a very small (a pallet or two was the answer I got) lot that came through that importer.”
