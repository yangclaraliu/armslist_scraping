Used at the range 4-5 times, it shows only little use and has never jammed. This Rifle Comes with... 1)The RS Regulate AK mounting system(upper and lower) 2) Aimpoint ACO, great optic to leave on 24/7 for over a year with great dependability. 3) 18 Mags! 12 are 30 round steel mags in fair to good condition, 2 are 30 round black circle 10 waffle mags, 2 are 30 round Russian Tula Bakelite, and the last 2 are 20 round steel mags from Korea......... This rifle work great and has zero issues as far as I can see or have been told. Its been tastefully ungraded to be more functional but retains a very classic look. The internal springs are ALG, the trigger is a G2 TAPCO and is crisp and responsive, the grip is a US Palm which is the best AK grip out there, the muzzle device was upgraded to a AK-74 style break which makes it fire flat and rapid bursts with ease............ The rifle most importantly has a Solar Tactical mag well installed which makes the AK mag change a breeze in comparison to other AK platforms or even AR-15's in side by side comparison with a little practice......... The rifle was modified and upgraded by a Professional gunsmith in my area, the side optic rail is not found on the Black Poly model and this was a must for me so I had the springs, side rail, and furniture installed all at once. This wasn't cheap or easy but now brings the rifle up to speed with the best!........ This is a steal for so much firepower, enjoy!If interested call or text (202) 871-4827"

This is acopy/paste from Rifles Of The Red Star/sniper text area
 
""By the 1930’s the Soviet Union possessed a considerable number of sniper rifles. A Soviet document indicates that 54,160 rifles were produced in the PE form between 1932 and 1938. Production of the PE was very slow at first due to the complicated and time consuming nature of machining the mounts. Production in the first year of 1932 was only 749. In subsequent years, recorded numbers are as follows. 1,347 in 1933, 6,637 in 1934 and 12,752 top mount hex and round receiver PE/PEM’s in 1936. No data is given for production in 1935 as all Mosin production was slowed considerably that year. 13,130 top mount round receiver PEM’s were produced in 1937 and 19,545 of the new long side rail mounted PEM’s were made in 1938. No production numbers are available for the final two years of PEM production. (1) While many rifles were randomly selected for accuracy potential, there is an indication from my research and that of a friend/colleague (4) that “blocks” of snipers were produced at Tula. This is supported by a sampling of PE snipers all in the same letter prefix and serial number block indicating a planned production and not a random pull of rifles off the line. All Tula produced snipers, including the later version produced during wartime in 1943 and 1944, bear an accuracy mark above the five-pointed star logo of the factory. This proof is a “C” and an upside down “U” for lack of a better description of Cyrillic letters. This marking is the designation of “sniper” on Tula produced guns. The marking literally translates to "" Snayperskaya Provernnaya"" meaning tested for use as a sniper.""
This rifle is oddly enough, within 3000 serial number spots iof the rifle used inthe article lending creedence to the blocks of pieces built theory. This rifle is in good to fair condition with most of the condition issues being in the form of minor marks and flaking shellac. Par for the course with pieces this old. 
 
This is strictly my opinion, but as a focused Mosin collector for 15 plus years, i feel I am semi qualified to say that I believe that the unfinished/non converted rifles would be less common than converted/completed designated sniper rifles. Think about it some. How many full sniper rifles have you seen, me too, a metric ass ton of them. Now how many un drilled/tapped/unmolested have you seen? Personally, I have seen 3 in all of my collecting and research. You may disagree, but thats how i see things. 
 
I am usually asked why i am selling a gun, in this cae I'm selling off the last of my Mosin collection. My health is failing and i know I'll never be able to go out and enjoy them again, so i'm letting this last one go to a place where it will hopefully be the center point of another focused colection. I am open to trade as well."

Israeli Military manufactured ammo that features a dark gray tipped bullet loaded with a Tear Gas agent.  This ammo was produced in extremely limited quantities for a few months back in 1961.  It was designed to be able to deliver a dose of tear gas at much greater ranges than the larger caliber gas launching guns of the day were capable of (typically limited to about 150 yards).  The idea was to shoot at a hard surface near the intended target thereby releasing the Tear Gas agent.  Ammo comes in it's original factory box and is in excellent (near perfect) condition.  There are 20 rounds in the box that are loaded on four 5 round stripper clips.  The ammo you see in the pictures is what you get.  This ammo is ever bit as deadly as any standard military ball round so it's not a novelty and must be treated with the same care as any live 7.62x51 ammunition.  Price is $150 cash with pickup in the hudson valley area. Shipping is available via UPS ground about ($10). Actual cost will be determined by your location. You must be at least 18 years old to purchase. $150 is for one box of 20 rounds. I have a total of 80 rounds for sale. I also accept PAYPAL for payment.NOT BLACK TIP, AP AMMO, Armor piercing, Green tip, m61."

A 3 MOA dot promotes rapid target acquisition, while providing a precise point of aim—getting shots down range and on target fast. The durable, machined aluminum housing ensures the unit will stand up to whatever you throw at it. High-quality, fully multi-coated lens offers a clean, wide field of view. Our top-load system makes changing the CR 1632 battery a snap and alleviates the need to remove the sight when switching the power source. The power and dot intensity controls are conveniently located on the left side of the unit. Flush 1 MOA windage and elevation adjustments are super sleek and make sighting in a breeze. OPTICAL FEATURES Fully Multi-Coated Multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces increase light transmission. Premium Wide-Field Lens Exceptional edge-to-edge resolution. Brightness Settings Choose between 10 levels of brightness in manual mode or switch to auto mode. Parallax Free All red dot and holographic sights will exhibit some small amount of parallax. Matching current industry practice, this small amount would be considered “parallax free” and will make a negligible difference in the Venom's performance. CONSTRUCTION FEATURES Single-Piece Chassis Compact and lightweight. Waterproof O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust and debris from penetrating for reliable performance in all environments. Shockproof Rugged construction withstands recoil and impact. Hard Anodized Finish Highly durable low-glare matte finish.

The Flat Dark Earth version of the P-10 C. Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.
