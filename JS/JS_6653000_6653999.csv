All the German military proof marks are clearly visible, as well as the NATO stamps. The pictures show the appropriate cuts for the semi auto trigger housing have been made, as well as a full auto bolt block at the rear end of the receiver. As it sits, this MG3 is chambered in 7.62x51 (308). This weapon has a desert sand, cerakote finish. To give it a two tone desert sand and black finish, I have chosen to leave the booster con, bipod, charging handle, and top cover in the original factory finish. This MG3 is equipped with a higher quality milled BRP semi-auto bolt and semi-auto trigger. This MG3 is not a reproduction, but a real MG3 reassembled from an imported kit. What makes this belt, fed rifle stand out from all others is that at one point, it was a functioning machine gun for the German military. Without spending $40K plus, this is as close is as close to the real thing as anyone can get. The buyer will receive a taped 7.62 top cover with a Picatinny rail on top as shown in the pictures. You will have the ability to mount any optic you choose. I will also include a Yugo 8mm top cover and feed tray as well as an 8mm barrel. If you have any questions, please email me at REDACTED or call me at REDACTED with any questions.

Locking block has been replaced while I owned it, but it has a few rounds on it.I carried this gun in a serpa holster for 3 years driving an armored car so it has noticible holster wear. Holster wear does not affect function. If youre loking for a safe queen, this may not be your choice. If you want a solid, well maintained gun to Use, this is the best deal on armslist.Also includes 4 standard Beretta mags and 1 20 round MDS mag all in good functional condition.If you are interested, i will also include right and left hand serpa holsters, blackhawk drop leg platform, paddle platfoem, safariland duty mag carrier, desantis mag carrier, a bianchi military holster, and i may still have a box of ammo somewhere.Price is for gun and mags, accessories are free.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target.

Here are the specs off their website:Item number: UA-16-M-B-556""The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the m4 style handguards. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

So I have had this on a pistol lower, it was a lot of fun, very accurate with low recoil. I am just looking to get out of the AR platform and into a bolt gun. I also have a buffer tube cheek rest from Thorsden customs that I will include, which will drop onto any normal buffer tube. I have had about 200-300 rounds through it, with no problems. I have run everything from 110 gr to 220 gr bullets with a little adjustment of the gas block. This upper is ready to drop onto your pistol lower. The only problem is that the handguard was not made square, so the blast shield of the muzzle brake rubs a little of the end of the handguard. This doesn't seem to have affected practical accuracy, but could easily be fixed with a new handguard or just take off the blast shield."

Besides 12 and 20 gauge, this shotgun is also available with beautifully scaled-down actions for 28 gauge for a true premium-grade experience. Whether you take it to an upland hunt or to the clay range, the 686 Onyx Pro gives you the flawless performance and the classic looks of a Beretta. The 686 Onyx Pro Field is built on the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination."
