The upgrades were done at Browning as a recall/repair of the salt era guns, which this was. This rifle was purchased new by my father and returned to Browning within the first year for the repairs. My father never used this rifle, I don’t believe it was ever shot, except to possibly sight in the scope (unless bore sighted). The scope is a Redfield 3X9 of the same era. This entire rifle is in excellent condition. Stock has a high gloss finish, deep crisp checkering, Browning hard rubber butt plate, sling swivel studs in stock and no marks. Bluing is deep and glossy, 22” step barrel, trigger guard and floor plate engraved, bolt is beautifully jeweled and bluing has no wear marks or scratches. Caliber is .30-.06. All numbers match; receiver, bolt and barrel. It is tapped for the rear sight and screws are in the barrel. I was told Browning performed the upgrades (Medallion) to make up for the inconvenience to the customer, at least to the early customers."

This pistol started life as a commercial ""Government Model"" but due to the need for military arms was one of a small group transferred to a military contract and reworked to military configuration. The original commercial serial number was crudely removed by peening (both on the frame and on the slide) and a military serial number stamped over it. The pistols also received standard military proofing including the inspector's initials (G.H.D.), the ""P"" proofs, and the ordnance crossed cannons. The frames were also stamped with ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" and the military designation ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"". It is interesting to note that slide retained the standard commercial markings and the Colt commercial ""VP"" proof is still found on the left side of the trigger guard. Most of the commercial pistols of this period were fitted with the Swartz firing pin safety and these non-military components were removed, leaving empty the small milled out areas in the top of the frame and underside of the slide. Lastly, the pistols were refinished in the standard military parkerized type finish and fitted with the military style grips. All these things together make for a very unique variation of the 1911A1 pistol.This pistol is in good overall original condition. The frame and slide are serial numbered to match. The parkerized finish does show holster & handling wear with general thinning to the sharp edges and top of slide. There is no significant pitting however there is a ding to the right side of the rear sight. The barrel is interesting in that it is properly marked ""COLT .45 AUTO"" beneath the chamber but has no other markings, commercial or military. The barrel is finished dulite blue but polished in the white over the chamber area. The grips are in good condition, with normal wear, but no cracks. This pistol appears to be in perfect mechanical condition and everything functions properly. The bore however is rough and although there is some strong rifling remaining, it exhibits some pitting throughout. It comes with a war-time military contract magazine which shows some moderate corrosion along the sides"

Hartly and Graham was known for putting pearl and ivory grips on to guns they received from Colt. Judging by the fit and the age this is most likely the case on the pearls that have been added to this gun. This is a true collector grade survivor.

Most of the fire blue accents remain vivid with just some of it thinning. There is no turn line. The cylinder face is completely clean.

This pistol started life as a commercial ""Government Model"" but due to the need for military arms was one of a small group transferred to a military contract and reworked to military configuration. The original commercial serial number was crudely removed by peening (both on the frame and on the slide) and a military serial number stamped over it. The pistols also received standard military proofing including the inspector's initials (G.H.D.), the ""P"" proofs, and the ordnance crossed cannons. The frames were also stamped with ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" and the military designation ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"". It is interesting to note that slide retained the standard commercial markings and the Colt commercial ""VP"" proof is still found on the left side of the trigger guard. Most of the commercial pistols of this period were fitted with the Swartz firing pin safety and these non-military components were removed, leaving empty the small milled out areas in the top of the frame and underside of the slide. Lastly, the pistols were refinished in the standard military parkerized type finish and fitted with the military style grips. All these things together make for a very unique variation of the 1911A1 pistol.This pistol is in good overall original condition. The frame and slide are serial numbered to match. The parkerized finish does show holster & handling wear with general thinning to the sharp edges and top of slide. There is no significant pitting however there is a ding to the right side of the rear sight. The barrel is interesting in that it is properly marked ""COLT .45 AUTO"" beneath the chamber but has no other markings, commercial or military. The barrel is finished dulite blue but polished in the white over the chamber area. The grips are in good condition, with normal wear, but no cracks. This pistol appears to be in perfect mechanical condition and everything functions properly. The bore however is rough and although there is some strong rifling remaining, it exhibits some pitting throughout. It comes with a war-time military contract magazine which shows some moderate corrosion along the sides."

Barrel is 24"", fluted, and threaded for a suppressor or muzzle brake. I have a muzzle brake I can include for $50 that is unused. Bought it a month ago and never used it. Fits the threads on this barrel, just needs a crush washer and needs to be installed properly. Either way, the threads come with a thread protector. Has the oversized ""tactical"" bolt handle, 20 MOA EGW scope mount, 3 position safety, and accutrigger (adjustable for 2lbs - 6lbs). I bought this rifle new 2 months ago and am the original owner. It has under 100 rounds through it. Hasn't jammed or had any issues. Got 1"" groups @ 100 yards with Federal Gold Medal 168gr SMK's. This was for a DBM model that came with an accustock (4.4"" action screw spacing, top bolt release) and a 10 round magazine. Both of which you can buy on eBay. I sold the mags and the stock separately. Buyer to complete background check at local FFL, fees for which are included in ad price. 
I have priced stocks for this online at: Hogue stock $189, Laminated thumbhole varmint pillar bedded wood stock (looks very nice) $169, Choate ultimate sniper stock $177,Choate tactical stock $200, and you can find accustocks on eBay for around $100. 
Email, call, or text for photos etc. REDACTED. Thanks
P.S. I do not have a photo of it uploaded yet so I can only upload a photo of the factory rifle in the stock. This is for the barreled action only."

Early Hillsdale guns are highly sought after as they came from a period of incredibly built pistols.
The Concept IX was the pre-cursor to the current Commanche line of pistols. Made for a limited time only and obviously totally hand fit. Every part is numbered to the gun.
This particular .45 ACP version is built on a lightweight alloy frame with steel slide.
Pistol is in outstanding condition, especially considering it is 22 years old. There is one small dot on the right side of the frame to the right of the stop pin (see pic). There is a very minor mark on the left side near the takedown lever. Other than that, the finish is pretty much flawless. Night sights are dead.These rarely come up for sale and I will let this one go for $1550 Cash.... Not interested in any trades.
 
TN HCP/TN DL and simple bill of sale is required, period. Don't even ask otherwise."
