Buyers fell through. Nice gen 4 Glock 26. Need to sell ASAP. This was my edc and I have something different now. Love this weapon. Very accurate and never a malfunction of any kind. Well taken care of. I polished down the barrel so it appears chrome. Metal guide rod upgrade. Also a trigger job done. All this gives it some style and better function. Not much more to say, it's a Glock. It will come with the box and what came with it. Additionally, I have some excellent holsters for this weapon - Blackhawk leather CQC, mag pouch, Blade Tech Eclipse, etc (right handed). One IWB and two OTB. They will be included with the right offer. Also, 4 mags instead of the two that came with the gun. Additional pics will be texted or emailed to interested parties. Not really interested in trades but won't be offended at offers. Buyer pays transfer ($25 in Beaverton). $400 for pistol and two mags. $500 for pistol/holsters/extra mag/s.

There is space for 8 long guns, which are protected by felt-lined grooves. You can also add one long gun on each side of the felt-lined grooves, so this cabinet can realistically hold 10 long guns. This area also has a small shelf, which can be used to ammo, calls, etc.The bottom part of the cabinet has two doors, which lead to an area containing two spacious shelves.The cabinet, glass and hardware are in excellent shape.The top and bottom are screwed together...and come apart, making it very easy to move.This is a perfect piece to store your firearms and accessories, and would be perfect for a hunting cabin, your recreation room, or just in your basement.I only accept cash, and if you're reading this post, then the cabinet is still available for sale."

That is more than a fair price. The rifle with come with 1-30 round magazine, a Tapco Trigger, and an ergonomic pistol grip basically everything seen in the picture. I also have a bayonet for 1 of them and think I have the other as well I just need to double check. Orginal cleaning kit will also come with the rifle and I think I have the orginal box if not I have another rifle box that it will fit. If interested in buying 1 or both txt me at REDACTED.

These 45cal semi-automatic pistols saw action in WWII, the Korean War, and also Vietnam.   Unfortunately along the way, some idiot had this one nickel plated.  So, I rescued it,  stripped the nickel off and returned it to it's natural 1943 state - which is military parkerization.   This is NOT a safe queen, it's a wonderful example of a scarce and iconic pistol that perhaps your father or grandfather used in the military.  It's been given a new lease on life and now it can be yours to go out and shoot - just like Tom Hanks in ""Saving Private Ryan"".The price is $1295 or Best Offer.  I am not interested in trades."

It has wear on the body from being extensively used in the field. I have just replaced the intensifier tube with a brand-new Generation 2+ tube at the end of the last year ($700) and barely used it this year, which means it has most of the 5,000 working hours left in it (it took me approximately 10yrs of extensive field use to have the previous tube going dim). This monocular has a built-in close range infrared (IR) illuminator for use inside the rooms or basements with no ambient light source. Outisde it rarely needs an IR light - the tube is sensitive enough to pick up 1/4 moonlight and with 4x lens you are good for up to 500-600yds depending on the ambient conditions. Brand new it was $1,799. Selling for $700 firm just to recouperate the cost of the brand new tube.  Comes with well-padded protective carry case and front lens cover to protect the lens from bright light or damage.Works about 25hrs from a single AA battery! The unit has a bright light protection built-in and the image is edge-to-edge sharp, as good as it gets without spending $3,000 for a Gen-3 monocular. Tough as nails, I've used it in all variety of conditions, unless you drop it on a concrete or in the water it will not quit on you."

It has a 30"" full choke vent rib 2 3/4"" chambered barrel. The bluing isn't 100% and there's a small hairline crack with a few handling marks on the stock. It was well used for many years but not abused. This shotgun has taken too many birds and smashed too many clays to count. There is no rust or pitting anywhere just honest wear from use. This is a great shotgun with plenty of life left for use. I'm in no rush to sell this just seeing what's out there. I know what I have. This is one of the most sought after and desirable 870s ever produced being a great shotgun for both hunting and trap shooting. The only reason I'm looking to sell or trade it is because shotguns aren't really my thing and when I occasionally shoot trap I use one of my shotguns. I took this gun out a few months ago to shoot trap at my gun club and it didn't skip a beat. Other than that it has been sitting in my safe since it came into my possession. Please don't bother me with ""what's your bottom dollar"" and ""is it still for sale"" emails. If you're reading this, yes, it's still mine and with the right cash or trade offer it can be yours.

They are not cheap but you get what you pay for. I am no fan of lasers myself but this one rocks!
