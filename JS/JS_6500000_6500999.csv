This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned Condition. Featuring a wood stock, and a Full Poly Choke, this Winchester Model 12 Pump-Action shotgun comes with an average amount of wear/tear. This can be attributed to the fact that this shotgun was well taken care of, despite it's age, and the fact that saw regular usage. The stock has a fair number of light, shallow nicks and cuts, as well as some minor denting. There are no visible chips, cracks, gouges, staining, or discoloration, despite the other issues with the stock. Both the receiver, and the barrel have a modest amount of discoloration, associated with the age of the shotgun, but there are no spots of rusting, or staining, and there appears to be no pitting throughout the receiver, or barrel. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection.

This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned Condition. This shotgun has only minor wear/tear, which can be attributed to both the age of the shotgun, as well as the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular usage. While there are no severe scratches, scrapes, chips, bends, breaks, staining, or discoloration, this shotgun's wood stock does have a handful of very small, very minor dents, as well as light, shallow nicks and cuts. There is also the start of a small crack forming on the bottom of the shotgun, directly behind where the trigger is set. This shotgun's receiver is in great shape, and has minimal wear/tear. There are a number of small, shallow nicks and cuts, as well as some minor scraping on the chamber cover, but that is it! There is no rusting, staining, pitting, or discoloration, on either the receiver, or throughought the length of the 30"" barrel. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection.

Please make offers via PM.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

No trades please. Please make any offers via PM.Beretta 92 A1, one of the most popular military and police pistols up for grabs! 92FS: The World’s Most Trusted Military and Police PistolThe reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semi-auto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.Superior ReliabilityThe 92FS is a double/single-action semi-auto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period. Match-Grade Accuracy out of the BoxRegardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class."

This shotgun comes in Decent, Working, Pre-Owned condition. This shotgun has an average amount of wear/tear throughout, including on it's wood stock, on the receiver, as well as down the length of it's barrel. This can be attributed to the age of this shotgun, as well as the fact that it was previously owned, saw regular usage, and was not well taken care. The wood stock has numerous small, shallow nicks and cuts, as well as a small handful of dents and scrapes. There are no chips, or gouges to be found in the stock, though a small crack has started to form on the bottom of the shotgun, directly behind where the trigger is set. This shotgun's receiver, and barrel are in OK condition, though they do both have obvious nicks and cuts, as well as scraping, and discoloration. There are no signs of rusting on the receiver, though there is some obvious spots of rusting, as well as some pitting the further down the barrel you get. This shotgun's barrel ends in a Full Poly Choke, which also shows obvious signs of rusting. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection.
