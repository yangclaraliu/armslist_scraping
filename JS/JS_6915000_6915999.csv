This is a pretty nice gun and has a lot going for it even though it's a repro. All the numbers match including the bolt. The bolt is bent close to original style (not 100 percent exact but very close). The stock is refinished but is an original sniper stock and looks extremely nice. The scope is an original progress scope and the mount is real. The base is a reproduction. I can include the repro mount that came with it for free if wanted. The lens caps are original as well. I bought this as a gamble from gunbroker. It had a broken stock but had a real scope so had fingers crossed it was real. It isn't but it is still a very nice repro once I placed it into a new stock. 500 or trade.

The rear sight is an ameriglo claw, and the front is a HiViz Lightwave fiber optic. The trigger has been replaced with an Apex, but no other springs were replaced. I also have a kydex IWB holster made by SAS holsters. Price is $400 firm.  I am seeing what offers entice me, but I am in no hurry to get rid of this.  I am located in the canton/ massillon areaI would be open to trades (I can add cash), but would prefer the following:CZ 9mm pistols, but not the P-07-i already own one.

Overall it is in good shape, with some dents and dings on the furniture. I've put about 250rds through it so far, and it has worked pretty good, with a few failures to feed, but these may just be mag related.. The front sight post was slightly loose when I got it and I had to put in some shims to have it stay put. I Also had to adjust the rear sight pretty far to the right to get it zero'd. But it otherwise functions great now. Comes with the original box(a little beat up), the original paperwork, 1 mag, and an original bayonet and sling.
I'm located in Fairfax city.
As for trades, I'm mostly interested in milsurps, but I'm open to other things, so feel free to shoot me an offer.

I have shot no more than 200 rounds through the rifle and it shoots the inexpensive factory ammo very well. This rifle has one of the lightest factory trigger pulls i have ever felt (I have not modified it in any way). The rifle shoots great and was my first rifle used for hunting. It has killed many elk. This would make a great first rifle for your son or daughter. It is light enough to pack and does not kick very much at all. There are some light scuffs on the stock from shooting in the field but they do not effect performance at all. I can split up the scope and rifle if need be. I will ship also, I am not sure how to change the tag on the right column of this listing."

So for the most part I'm looking to sell it or I might trade it for a revolver but I don't really like the super tiny little snubbies they tend to hurt your hands when you fire them.Thinks she might do better with a little heavier revolver like a charter or a Rossi.

Has a vortex Sparc 2 and 3x magnifier mounted. $1550with optic $1200 without.Interseted in Sig Sauer Carry Nightmare plus cash, P226 and cash or multi gun trades. DANIEL DEFENSE V11™ (MIL SPEC +®)The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail. KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip. This rifle is finished in Mil Spec + Cerakote."

The one complete rifle I put together some months ago and took it out shooting and it worked and then the last round I shot through it tore the rim off the 7.62 round and threw hot powder in my face. I thanked Jesus for letting me keep my retinas, as I had my eyewear on. I then retired the rifle and did some research. Some websites said that incorrect headspace (distance between the bolt face when closed and the rear of the 7.62 round) can cause this to happen. Other websites said oversized headspace just reduces accuracy and cannot hurt anything nor cause the failure at the range that I had. Anyway, I checked the headspace with a method suggested on the web (stacking 3 pieces of tape on the back of a chambered 7.62 round, let the bolt go forward slowly and the bolt shouldn't go all the way forward to the point of locking) but mine did, indicating too many thousandths of an inch between the closed bolt's face and the back of the chambered round. Anyway, other sites said a dirty chamber will snag the brass and let the extractor pull the rim off of the round when fired...and that the problem indeed is not headspace. I don't know if headspace causes this or not, but I know this rifle failed the tape test from the internet, and that a rim was pulled off one time when I fired it....that was enough for me to put it down. I've never adjusted headspace on a rifle.The stock is beautiful and there are a lot of parts here, and a complete rifle; it's a steal if you want to fool with it. I'm selling about every gun I own, so I don't want to fool with it. I'm taking about 170 dollar loss on this, but so be it. I won't travel to give my guns away of course, you have to come to me in Graham in the evening, or to Burlington or Elon during the workday Monday thru Friday, for this price.I will answer emails in the order that they come. I don't expect to have this package for long at $190.00"

My email is down right now so please text me at REDACTED if your interested and serious. ( will concider all serious and realistic offers) It was made by wise lite arms using new &/or machined and re manufactured parts ( not a weld gun) it is a great quality rifle that is smooth operating and shoots great! I have only went out a couple times with this rifle to test fire as well as have some fun shooting it with others. This rifle is always fun and makes people smile when they are shooting it. Another positive note is surplus ammo is readily available and has come way down in price since the crazy spike of the past. Lol. There is also a good slection of different surplus rounds for what ever your need is. There is also available on the Internet anything you need for this rifle from parts , belts, drums, tripods and much more cool stuff to add to this rifle. And they won't break the bank. This rifle has a super easy quick change barrel system if you have a back up and need to cool the original barrel. It also has a built in bipod and one belt of loaded ammo that goes with it. In its full auto military form it was nick named the buzz saw due to the intimidating buzzing sound it made due to it extreamly fast rate of fire. I have read that it was able to run at 1300 up to 1800+ rounds per minute. It did its job all to well and kept soldiers heads down in place and not advancing. However this one is just for fun and will only shoot as fast as your finger can pull the trigger. But that's plenty. And you shouldn't have an issue with going to fast. Lol. Other then all the parts these rifles have been starting to dry up. Especially nice ones like this. I am asking $5800.00 OBO. Don't hesitate to make offers. I understand we all have budgets and we all want to feel we got a good deal that everyone is happy with. I can respect that and I will treat everyone with respect and kindness. I just ask we all do the same and if you are interested just be a serious buyer. I realize this is in the price range that everyone isn't going to be rushing to get one. But it is truly so fun that if I didn't need to sell stuff to down size life a bit for health reasons I would keep it. But it's just that time to be able to spend more time with my kids as they and myself are getting older.

This firearm is in excellent, basically new condition. It shoots very well, it's probably my most accurate firearm that I currently own. Includes the firearm, original cleaning tools, original box, mag tool, 2 original mags and 2 aftermarket mags. The original mags are a little stiff and are not as reliable as the aftermarket ones. I'm simply thinning out the collection so I'm not looking for any firearm trades. Would conisder trades of certain Festool tools. Please feel free to email for additional pictueres/questions."
