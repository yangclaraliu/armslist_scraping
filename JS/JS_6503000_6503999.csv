Night-sights, ambidextrous slide catch, ambidextrous mag release.. Extremely concealable, even in shorts and a t-shirt. Original case and two magazines included. Suggested retail new: $1041. The P2000 SK model is a small ""sub-compact"" version of the P2000. American versions of the P2000 SK will accept the longer USP Compact magazines which provide higher capacities; up to 12 rounds.This has the Law Enforcement Modification(LEM) package. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 lbs. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing.The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.Length - 6.41”Height - 4.55”Width - 1.34”Barrel Length - 3.26”Sight Radius - 5.18”Weight w/ empty magazine - 1.5 lbsTrigger pull - 7.3-8.5 lbs"

This is not the lower end Kahr .380 models, but their highest end micro pistol available. Im not going to put up all the specs as they are easily found online. I just bought this and picked it up from local FFL in Tulare, Ca 1/10/2017 and had plans on gifting it to my father for his birthday gift in Feb. My father put 6 magazines worth of ammo thru the barrel and said ""son, Id rather have something a little bigger, Im not going to pocket or purse carry"" So...now I need to sell this Kahr and get something else for him, not a micro pistol, and he wants a 9mm since he already has tons of ammo for his other pistols. As you can see from the pictures the pistol is in brand new condition, has the purchase date on the DROS paperwork. The sale comes with everyting seen, plus I can ""lend to a shooting partner"" (CA compliant wording) a few boxes of premium ammo that I bought for my dad to break in the pistol if you were driving from outside the area to sweeten the deal and help pay for your gas. I havent even cleaned the barrel since only about 40 rounds of ammo were put thru it. This was shot once on 2/18/2017 at Kings Gun Center Indoor Range. I am looking for a LOCAL buyer only in the Visalia/Fresno/Tulare area that can meet at a local FFL and do the transfer paperwork. All original papwework, warranty, boxes, etc of course are included. No trades. The price is pretty firm since it is probably the lowest price P380 in California. Im looking for a quick sale, not trying to get my money back or make anything. My mistake of getting a pistol as a gift before trying it on for size is your gain. I paid $699 + tax +DOJ fees, $40 UG pocket holster, and $100 in ammo, the rest of it anyway, that Im willing to part with.

This is a tough to find 1998 ""born on"" date Marlin MR-7 chambered in 30-06. In almost like new condition with absolutely no flaws, it has a beautiful walnut checkered stock inlaid with the Marlin bullseye, 22"" fully floated, crowned and recessed JM stamped barrel, almost flawless bluing, and a stunning jeweled bolt that was masterfully reworked by Skip Baldwin in Michigan. It is topped with a matching set of Leupold rings and bases and an awesome period correct Swift Model 656 3-9x40 scope. Here is a brief history of the rifle, which is touted as one of the finest and most accurate bolt rifles to ever be produced:
The Marlin MR-7 was only made from 1996-1999. It was only chambered in .25-06, .270, .280, and .30-06. It features a 3-position safety, a bolt face encircled by three rings of 4140 steel, a shrouded striker and high-visibility cocking indicator. It has an adjustable 3-6 lbtrigger, A forged, machined and heat-treated receiver and an extra-strong bolt lockup. The MR-7 has a hinged floorplate with a removable yet securely mounted 4-shot box magazine (The MR-7B does not). It has a 22"" barrel with 6-groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It also has a classically configured, cut-checkered American walnut stock. The later (1999) MR-7B was made with birch wood for the stock and the MR-7B didn't use a floorplate. It was a few $ cheaper and in 1999 the MR-7B was only available in .270 and .30-06 calibers.
The Ring of steel around the cartridge and the strong locking lug bolt-face was mimicked off of the Remington 700.The wing-style safety was mimicked from theWinchester Model 70.The ""Dogleg"" Bolt handle mimicked the Ruger 77The floorplate with the detachable mag was mimicked from the Browning A-Bolt.
This would be a special setup for someone's collection or a superb and accurate hunting setup. Also included in the deal is an extra factory box mag which is almost impossible to find available. Asking $550 sale/$600 trade, and I'll consider any nice firearms or a nice 6x10 utility trailer plus cash from me. Thanks for looking"

Besides offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge, it sports a tough and durable stainless-steel finish. As such, this double/single-action autopistol it is perfect for deep concealment or used as a backup second handgun. Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic.Easy to OperateThe controls of the 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.Convenient Tip-Up Barrel DesignTip-Up-BarrelThe 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.Easy to Conceal and Shoot Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat Inox were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense."

In its compact form, the P228 sports a shorter barrel assembly which allows for a shorter slide - these changes, in effect, making for a shorter overall weapon, hence its ""compact"" classification. While shorter in length, the P228 still retained a large magazine capacity which is often an appreciated quality in a handgun - particularly semi-automatic in nature. The P228 first appeared in 1988 though it has since been succeeded by the equally-compact P229 series on the SIG-Sauer lines. The weapon is known under the designation of M11 in the US military inventory while its use is accordingly global through various other armies and police agencies.
Overall, the P228 retains much of the form and all of the function of the preceding P226 series. Internally, the P228 actually shared much with the preceding P225 and P226 series of handguns. The slide encapsulates the barrel, chamber, firing pin and hammer to which the latter protrudes at the rear some. Sights are iron in nature and located at the rear and front of the slide - a notched rear being matched with the front post to show the user the weapon is in line with the intended target. The pistol grip and trigger unit are conventionally held under the slide with the curved trigger being set in a squared-off trigger ring. The grip is stocky and provides a firm hand hold while the rear sides of the slide are ribbed for gripping. Controls are within easy reach of the firing hand's thumb and includes the magazine release (mounted to either side of the frame as needed) and the safety. A slide release under the slide sides allows the weapon to be disassembled for cleaning. The firing action is a recoil-operated Double-Action/Single-Action (DA/SA) or Double-Action Only (DOA). Management of the slide introduces the first cartridge into the chamber which can be witnessed through the ejection port during the action. The P228 is chambered for the ubiquitous 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge and makes use of a 13-round detachable box magazine inserted through the base of the grip. The slide of the P228 is fabricated from forged carbon steel for maximum robustness. In all, the P228 continues the fineness of the SIG line of hand guns - both in style and functionality.
