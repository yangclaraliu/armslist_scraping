This Kimber is one of the original 1911s Kimber made at their custom rifle facility in Oregon, in the mid 1990s, before moving to Yonkers, NY. Serial number on the gun is 2,xxx putting it squarely in the first year of production. These original Kimbers were hand built custom pistols, and began giving Kimber the reputation they have today. At this time in the Mid 1990s, Kimber was also making the slides for Wilson Combat, until they became direct competitors. When you take down a Wilson 1911 from the same time period, you will not be able to spot an ounce of difference between it and this Kimber. If you like Kimber 1911s, this is an absolute must have for your collection, and is going to be a very sound investment. Gun is the full size government model, chambered in .45 ACP with stainless steel match grade barrel and trigger. Trigger itself is skelotonized, and incredibly crisp.

Thanks for understanding.Original owner and purchased in Nov 1994. 20"" heavy barrel with 1 in 9 twist. Stock A2 battle sights with 8/3 rear elevation turret out to 800m. Rifle length A2 stock with hinged butt plate field kit storage.  I've kept it around always thinking I'd shoot it more, but I think 23 years is long enough to say goodbye.  The only AR platform I shoot any longer is the AR-10 so the AR-15 is really not going to see any attention from me every again.    *Brand new Caldwell XLA Pivot 9-13"" bipod with a Harris #5 Swivel Stud adapter underneath for a rock solid fit on the front/underside of the heat shield. *Uncle Mike's padded shoulder case with 5 external mag pouches, middle slip pocket and front velcro. *4 each 30 round PMAGs, 2 each 20 round/1 each 8 round factory Colt aluminum mags. *2 slings: Condor Speedy adjustable 2 point web sling and a standard 2 point USGI with metal hardware. *2 front sight posts: KNS Precision Hooded Crosshair aperture front sight(.01"") post included which is really nice for center hold irons shooting, but it's currently outfitted with the stock .07"" front sight post that came from Colt. *Brand new Hoppe's .223 Bore Snake and also a .223/5.56 magazine well vise block to make cleaning a breeze.*Recoil pad which adds 1 1/4"" to the length of pull that I used on another AR which you might find useful if you are taller/bigger.  This Colt has spent the lions share of it's life in the safe and if I had to put a number on rounds through the pipe it's certainly less than 500 and that was over mabye half a dozen shoots. When you inspect the BCG, shell deflector and hammer face you will be hard pressed to discern it's even been fired. Took it out Sunday and put a mag through it the irons are set on mechanical zero and I hammered the silhouette steel gong at 200 repeatedly it's only going to get better the more time you spend dialing it in.

Upgrades include a Geiselle SSA two-stage trigger and Primary Weapons Systems PWS FSC-556 flash suppressing compensator. Shoots great, about 500 rounds fired. This rifle shoots sub-MOA groups with a good marksman and the right ammo. Personal best was .46"" group, though I normally shoot 1"" to 1.5"" at 100 yards with SMK 77 grain 5.56 ammo.The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.
The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.SCOPE AND MOUNT ARE NOT INCLUDED.  NO TRADES PLEASE.

The gun has a Glock OEM extended slight release, a Glock OEM extended magazine release, and OEM Glock night sights. The night sights are brand new with the gun and very bright and I have the standard OEM slide and magazine release. I got the Glock for $530 without night sights and most people change those parts anyways, so with the night sights, slide release, and magazine release, I think $475 is reasonable. For an extra $50 I will add a Glock 17 magazine and a IWB magazine carrier and IWB holster (all together worth $80). I will meet you in a reasonable location near the west side of indianapolis to sell the gun, please contact me if you wish to buy or ask questions"

The M44 is the shorter, carbine version of the venerable M91/30.  This gun has the original arsenal refurbished finish.  The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling and pronounced lands and grooves.  At the last gun show, I saw lots of these carbines selling for $350+.  I have many more pictures but Armslist will only let me post three.  $295.  Gander Mountain meet-up preferred.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale. Thanks for looking."
