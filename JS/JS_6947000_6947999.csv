The gun started as a police issue double action only. It has an incredibly smooth DAO trigger pull right at 8lbs. The gun comes equipped with night sights (about 20% life left, very dim) that can be sent in to have new tritium vials put in or the front sight drilled out for a fiber optic rod. I have also installed the factory sear and seat spring so that with the swap of a hammer you can turn the pistol into ""slick slide"" double/single action (no active saftey/decocker so the hammer has to be thumbed down to decock and still has firing pin block and is drop safe) With the standard hammer the trigger pulls become DA ~8.3 lbs SA ~4 lbs with the beretta D spring (common aftermarket swap on all berettas) the gun is incredibly accurate and very fun too shoot in both configurations with a slide action that's ball bearing smooth with no rattle. The gun was carried as a duty gun for armed security and will come with three 11rnd mags and a two mag carrier. Also included all internal parts to covnert from DAO to DA/SA (I will set up the gun in either configuration per buyers request and show process to chancge it over which is incredibly simple) a soft case, and 50 rounds of 180 grain target ammo. I have thouroughly enjoyed this gun and am letting it go to invest in other projects. This will make an amazing firearm for home defense, ""truck gun"", range shooter, or serve as a duty weapon again. The only flaw she has at the moment is the rubber grips began to dry rot and crumble so the gun currently has only non skid metal plates as place holders for grips. Factory grips can be ordered online for about $20 or you could choose to upgrade to some VZ or Wilson combat grips for a bit more. I'm not particularly interested in any trades as I have a few to many guns to begin with but I'll entertain reasonable offers. She's priced to seek and I think a great bargain for a great firearmIf you have any questions or would like to contact me please text or me at REDACTED. If I don't answer please leave me a voicemail and I'll get back to you as quickly as possible. I'm also willing to meet people within a reasonable distance to sell. Must be a mississippi resident to purchase and I reserve the right to withhold sale at any point. May consider shipping to FFL in other states at buyers expense"

Bolt action. Shoots 22 short, shv, long and lr from the same 7 round magazine. 2 mags are included (these were $55 each to buy).
This rifle was rebuilt from a basket case found in a basement behind a waterheater. The stock is a correct year-model/nos replacemnt. The front sight hood, both magazines and the red/green indicators are also, correct NOS. Everything else is original to the rifle. The scope & bi pod are from amazon. The scope was 'designed' for a .30 cal/heavier round & they just dont hold up to that beating, but on a .22 they flat out rock. I have had the same scope on my marlin papoose for years & it's as accurate/zeroed as day 1.
It has a massively thick bull barrel. Model s101 front sight  (the 4 sight option model) this is original to the rifle and in poor/meh condition, I can not find a NOS replacement anywhere, but it does have a new sight hood. Original rear diopter peep sights. Aftrmarket scope mount from Havlin that has the weaver/picatany style rail and not the origilal simple groove/rings that can be a PITA to get a scope to fit. Aftermarket bi pod and hi-rise/peeep through 6-24x50 scope. You can use the rear diopter/iron sights with the peek through rings on the scope.
This is the civilian model of the rifle used to train tropps/snipers in WW2. This is a very heavy rifle, so i addd the bipod and scope to make a wicked bench top shooter. Seriously, it's just too beefy to carry out hunting. But bub, I'll tell you this, it's one hell of a shooter. If you cant hit it at 100 yards with this, just hang it up man.
 I have many detailed pics before and after the rebuild. Email me. Reduced from $400 to $350."

The 586 is essentially the same gun as the model 686 just in blued steel instead of stainless steel. The 586/686 is a hefty framed revolver specifically designed to handle the abuse that the 357 magnum cartridge puts out. Also shoots 38 special. The dash 3 denotes a generational change. Most say the -3 in the 586/686 were the best made ones because they were after the new yoak but before the locks and they added frame mounted striker. The gun is in next to mint shape, only imperfections is a slight scratch on the trigger guard. I have the original box and a set of pacmyers for it along with the wood grips pictured.

783,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6947783,For Sale/Trade:  Custom MK2 Navy Ka-Bar WW2 knife.,"columbus, Columbus, Ohio",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 13, 2017",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I just want to post to see what the level of interest is on the piece. Its a MK2 Navy Ka-Bar knife from ww2. The blade has been moved from its issued handle and it has been beautifully and professionally customized for the man who carried it. The original leather handle material has been replaced with beautiful hardwood grip with a custom cast aluminum pommel, the cross guard has been brazed into place. The blade has some minor patina from age, the wood has some minor dings and such from use, and the sheath has been fitted with a braided leather band and there has been a hole reamed out for a leg tie. However it has been stored oiled and temp controlled since coming into my collection. This knife was brought back from europe by my great uncle and given to me with a standard navy MK2 navy knife when he and his wife died. I do not need to sell it, but figured if someone was looking for something this unique maybe they would want it more than i do.  Plus i have a new 5 day old baby boy at home so extra cash wouldnt hurt. This knife is built like a brick sh!thouse and would easily be a lifelong companion knife. It to my knowlege 1 of 1. This knife as issued in decent condition brings $250.00, so I am putting double that price as my advertised bottom line but if there is a large response or higher offers the price will reflect that. Pics of every angel and surface available on request, the only thing ever modified by myself was the tye hole, it was there but too small for any modern chordage so i used a reamer to open the hole up by about 1mm more."

I like the RPR a lot and had no intentions of letting it go, but have a chance to pick up an AI AT for a very good price and would like to lessen the blow by moving this one.  It's had 80 rounds fired through the 6.5 barrel.  The .308 barrel came from a local guy who couldn't find a 6.5, so he bought a .308 and rebarreled it.  He said he didn't shoot it with the factory barrel, but I can't confirm this.  He did however put a brake on it, but I'm not sure who's it is.  I've never installed it.  The rifle will come with the factory box, the original grip and the Ergo grip.  I also added a rail adaptor to use a Harris or Atlas. Payment by Postal Money Order if shipped or cash if local.  If your FFL won't accept from an individual, add $25. Scope, mount and Atlas bipod are not included."

I can't decide which I like more so I'm just going to see which one sells first. So first one is the full sized MC operator, this gun I feel like is basically a trp without the front strap checkered. I believe it is an all steel gun so it's balanced really well. It's also incredibly accurate, with a steady hand you can get a solid 2in group out at 25 yards. It also has a Wilson combat speed chute magwell on it and is wearing VZ operator grips. Price for this one is 1100$ firm second 1911 is the champion operator that's had a bit of work done to it, front serrations have been added, the tail has been bobbed as well which is great for conceal carry, the gun does have quite a bit of wear on it. It's been shot quite a bit but I did just have this one sent back to Springfield to be retuned and just got it back as of 6-12 so it is good to go. It is also wearing VZ operator grips and I'll be asking 1300$ firm for this one. Price drop on the champion operator to 1200$ firm leaning to let this one go over the other. This one is now sold, gonna go ahead and sell the full sized as well. Price is still firm on that one."

All numbers match, great shape overall, but NOT a safe queen.  I wrapped the stock in paracord and put a magpul grip on it to improve ""shootability"" (lol on an underfolding AK) but the wrap is easily removed and I have the original wood grip and screw.  Wood is all original and showing the most signs of wear.  Light scuffs and very light surface wear on the dust cover, front sight shroud, and receiver.  I have many many more pictures I can send you should you need more detail.  I have three Chinese mags (2 30rd and 1 5rd) that are also original.  No box or bayonet.  I'll throw in 80 rds of steel Tula ammo for free as I don't own anything else in 7.62x39.  In the essence of full disclosure, I don't need to sell this (I just want to) so I'm not going to entertain low ball offers.  I know how much these are worth and I think the price is fair considering the condition.  I see shooters on GB and Armslist for 1200-1500 and safe queens for 2000+ That being said I am open to fair offers.  If you want a $700 AK go to Cabelas and buy a Yugo N-Pap or Century whatever it is they make these days.  And no, I don't want to trade for anything.  Sorry to sound like a prick but this isn't my first rodeo on Armslist so I'd prefer to get that out of the way now.  Any questions please let me know."
