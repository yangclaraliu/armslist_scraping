It comes with all the mags pictured. I also purchased a recoil pad which is attached to the buttstock. To my knowledge and research, these 20 round Tapco mags are the most reliable and durable detachable mags for this rifle. I have shot this rifle twice since I purchased it and it has been in my gun safe since. I haven't installed it but it also comes with a muzzle brake designed to reduce recoil and increase accuracy, which I am including with this purchase. It is all in excellent condition! I really hate to let it go but my parents are in financial stress due to my mother's brain tumor and disablity.  This is for a local CASH transaction only! Willing to negotiate on price."

The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design. The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols. A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available. VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm. VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And like full size VP pistols, the VP9SK is value priced at $719 (MSRP)."

I don't really see any reason to keep this in my closet if I'm not going to wear it, at the time of purchase I loved it; but naturally I'm a human being and things change. It is SERIOUSLY in brand new condition, and if you're anywhere close to myself (5ft 7/8in-160lbs), it'll fit nice and have plenty of room for your favorite concealed carry firearm. I realize it's spring/summer, but I thought I'd give someone on arms list the opportunity before selling to someone who won't appreciate it.

Also included are two additional 13 round 9mm mags plus the one the gun came with, so three magazines total. It also includes the red lava rock grips as shown in the photos. It's only had about 150 rounds through the barrel. Because this is not the registered part of the gun I can ship it directly to you. Please be aware if you live in a State or locality that has magazine restrictions it will not ship with the magazines and there will be no discount. Price includes shipping to lower 48 US states. I am open to trades for 10mm, 380 acp, or 9 luger ammo plus cash or paypal. If you live locally and want to pick it up I will knock $10 off the price"

This trigger is worth $150 without installation. It is one of the most accurate guns you will find and with the new trigger system it is the nicest to shoot.  This deal includes:The 2 original magazinesOriginal box and manualOriginal M&P TriggerHogue M&P Backstrap grip (see pics)I think you will find this to be one of the nicest guns you can own for range time and home defense.  See pic of setup with tactical light (LIGHT NOT INCLUDED).Not interested in trades. No low ball offers.  I'm not going to give it away.Contact me with any questions.
