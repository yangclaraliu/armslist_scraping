The US ARMY used this unit for securing NVGs, Optics, and Ammunition Cans. It also comes with a rifle and pistol support rack which can be configured to store everything in the same unit. Has two pistol rods to hang pistols on as well as 8 rifle holders. Pictures are below. All Marvel UWR units meet both OPNAVINST 5530.13C and AR190-11 security requirements. I use an exact version of this in my gun room. This unit is fully welded and measures 61.5""x42.5""x16"". Cabinet can be ganged from the top, bottom, sides, or rear of other cabinets. It has bi-fold retractable doors that prevent blocking aisles or neighboring racks and maximizes efficiency of the issuance of weapons and gear. The secure construction incorporates perforated doors sides and cabinet back to ensure visibility of items inside at all times. Great for doing inventory checks. Retractable locking bars exceed military requirements for arms security of conventional arms, ammunitions and explosives. All accessories that come into contact with the weapons are either powder-coated, vinyl dipped, rubber or thermoplastic-coated, or made from polymers to ensure that weapons are safe from damage in transportation.This unit was part of a auction that I drove down to FT Bragg to pick up. I had a few of these last year and they were very popular. I have 7 similar UWRs as well, however this unit is the biggest and is the only one that has the optional full length shelving configuration as well as rifle and pistol storage in one. There are minor scratches from being moved around in an armory but as you can tell from the pictures below they aren't noticeable and the units are in excellent shape. No dents, dings or broken pars. Completely operational. The US Army manifest states that this cabinet was close to 2 thousand dollars brand new, I will include manifest in sale. Marvel ONLY sells to military and government agencies. I am listing this UWR for $480. I travel quite often so I will include free delivery 50 miles within 23462.

 It used to be that if you wanted a quality 1911 you would have
to trade an arm and a leg and still have to have a gunsmith run a
reliability package to ensure function with defensive ammo. All in
all most people would pick up a 1911 and feel frustration
immediately because they just would not run unless you dumped a ton
of money into them. Enter Armscor. Armscor is a Philippine Company
that manufacturers 1911's that are well built, use excellent
components, and are offered at a fraction of the cost of their
competitors. Armscor has a solid reputation that can be verified
with a little research for producing some the most reliable out of
the box 1911's available anywhere... The Rock Island 1911's. If you
are looking for a shooter and not a safe queen you will hard
pressed to find a finer 1911 at this price point than the Rock
Island 1911 family. Explore their full line of firearms and get
more bang for your hard earned buck with Armscor. The Armscor Rock
Island 1911 is ""Right on Target. Right on Price.""
Chambered in .38 Super and outfitted with smooth wood grips and a

The rifle's stock is a nice manticore folder, however, for CA purposes, the stock's hinge is removed and the buttstock itself is bolted on using the same mounting point as the hinge.  With purchase, the hinge will be included separately (as shown installed in pics for pre-ban style folding stock set-up) so you can change it out when you feel ready to do so, just unbolt the stock, and re-bolt on the stock with the hinge attached, that simple.  The parts aren't illegal to own, but with the new lame laws you just can't run around with a folding or collapsible stock anymore here in wonderful commufornia, but like I mentioned, I'll be happy to include them separately when you buy the rifle.  Mag is also a blocked 10/30 (10rnd capacity) with floorplate sealed in place for CA compliance.  This thing is BRAND NEW, perfect condition, has a very nice manganese phosphate base coat with teflon top coat finish and is an all mil-spec rifle... Yes!  Unlike other AK's, since these things are imported into the US as pistols, they aren't subject to 922R upon import.  When the conversion was professionally done prior to bringing it into CA, the simple addition of a tapco G2 trigger group (great trigger), the stock, foregrip, pistol grip (which also has the CA legal kydex grip wrap installed, see pic for example since the main pic I chose to put up is of the rifle's free-state configuration), and the barrel extension all count for 922R compliance.  This rifle is the real deal, totally legit, and my local FFL here in Paradise is happy to facilitate the private party transfer for you, just outside of Chico, CA.  There may also be some shops in Chico who will facilitate the transfer too, but I've noticed that since the law changed, some CA gun shops have just all together stopped helping transfer any 'black rifles', since they don't understand what 'featureless' means.  This rifle, with the grip wrap, fixed stock conversion, and no flash hider falls within the featureless category.  Our local, biggest gun/archery shop here in town is a well established, reputable shop that also has tons of black rifle accessories still up for sale which you can't find at corporate big-box stores in the city.  They've also got the new AR set-up with the quick-release takedown pin which legally allows you to actuate a special mag-release that actually functions faster than the old 'bullet-buttton' style AR work-around, NICE!!!    So, give me a call anytime, I'd be happy to meet up and show ya the rifle.  Thanks again!"

This gun was only made in .243 from 2002 to 2006. Great multipurpose round for coyotes or deer and a very accurate rifle. These rifles sold for over $1000 bare rifle then and still do in the current calibers. With everything included I would like to get $770 cash out of it firm. Not willing to ship!I'm not hurting to sell. It shoots great but I already have multiple dedicated deer and coyote guns.

Minor scratches on chassis (I can send more detailed photos if interested before final sale).  Cost of everything in this package new is $7700.  This extend long range engagement system is sold as a complete package with Everything you need except ammunition, already expertly set up and zeroed - truly ready to shoot out of the box. Every component is the best you could possibly buy (scope excluded - matter of preference). I am the original and only owner of all components of this system and personally acquired and installed them all. I am a professional long range competition shooter in the PRS and NRL and this gun has only fired my personal hand loads for its entire life, everyone near 2600 fps with 300 grain Berger Tactical Hybrid projectiles from Lapua brass (far below max pressure). The original factory barrel has 2347 documented rounds through it (less than 1/2 it's superior accuracy life) and it consistently shoots confirmed .226 inch groups at 100 yds from prone off bipod (SD = 3.7 – 5.8). I am happy to provide specific load data to buyer. The only reason I am selling this system (reluctantly) is that I acquired a Sako TRG M10, and cannot justify having two .338 Lapua Magnum weapon systems.   Included components:  1) Sako TRG 42 rifle (New 2013 model) chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum 27 inch barrel 1/10 twist, green chassis (Sako muzzle break, tools, stock spacers, instruction manual, and all factory parts included)  2) Sako TRG proprietary bipod (best bipod on the market IMHO)  3) Two Sako 5 round .338 magazines  4) Night Force NSX 5.5 - 22 x 56 Zero Stop MOAR reticle Scope  5) SPUHR Mount for scope - Specific TRG 42 interface (you can't buy a better mount!)  6) Accu-Shot Monopod integrally mounted to buttstock  7) Pelican Case (1750) with Custom Cut Foam for all components   I don't think you could buy a better weapon system for this application that you could shoot - out of the box - at this level of accuracy and precision - with everything you could possibly need - already set up - for anything close to this price - period. Take advantage of my upgrade without paying thousands more. Will only sell/ship to lower 48 states. Can take credit card over the phone or Pay Pal. Insured shipping is free."

There might be slight irregularities in the wood and/or minute differences in the assembly or finish from piece to piece.  I will never send out anything I would regard as a “second” or “blem” without stating so and pricing accordingly.Right now I am using the nicest, furniture grade, solid oak I can source. I might be able to get some more exotic woods in the near future, but for now, these are oak.  I hand paint each of these stands with a nice marine-grade polyurethane so the natural beauty and grain of the wood stands out.  I sand them after each layer of polyurethane and re-coat until I achieve a nice hard protective finish.Of course, any firearms shown in my listings are to illustrate the items intended use and are NOT included in the sale.
I have many more sizes and configurations to suite your needs.  Check out my other listings and take a look at ZoidsHandiWerk on Etsy.com"

The rifle's stock is a nice manticore folder, however, for CA purposes, the stock's hinge is removed and the buttstock itself is bolted on using the same mounting point as the hinge.  With purchase, the hinge will be included (as shown installed in pics for pre-ban style folding stock set-up) so you can change it out when you feel ready to do so, just unbolt the stock, and re-bolt on the stock with the hinge attached, that simple.  The parts aren't illegal to own, but with the new lame laws you just can't run around with a folding or collapsible stock anymore here in wonderful commufornia, but like I mentioned, I'll be happy to include them separately when you buy the rifle.  Mag is also a blocked 10/30 (10rnd capacity) with floorplate sealed in place for CA compliance.  This thing is BRAND NEW, perfect condition, has a very nice manganese phosphate base coat with teflon top coated finish and is an all mil-spec rifle... Yes!  Unlike other AK's, since these things are imported into the US as pistols, they aren't subject to 922R upon import.  When the conversion was professionally done prior to bringing it into CA, the simple addition of a tapco G2 trigger group (great trigger), the stock, foregrip, pistol grip (which also has the CA legal kydex grip wrap installed, see pic for example since the main pic I chose to put up is of the rifle's free-state configuration), and the barrel extension all count for 922R compliance.  This rifle is the real deal, totally legit, and my local FFL here in Paradise is happy to facilitate the private party transfer for you, just outside of Chico, CA.  There may also be some shops in Chico who will facilitate the transfer too, but I've noticed that since the law changed, some CA gun shops have just all together stopped helping transfer any 'black rifles', since they don't understand what 'featureless' means.  This rifle, with the grip wrap, fixed stock conversion, and no flash hider falls within the featureless category.  Our local, biggest gun/archery shop here in town is a well established, reputable shop that also has tons of black rifle accessories still up for sale which you can't find at corporate big-box stores in the city.  They've also got the new AR set-up with the quick-release takedown pin which legally allows you to actuate a special mag-release that actually functions faster than the old 'bullet-buttton' style AR work-around, NICE!!!    So, give me a call anytime, I'd be happy to meet up with ya.  Thanks again!"

There might be slight irregularities in the wood and/or minute differences in the assembly or finish from piece to piece.  I will never send out anything I would regard as a “second” or “blem” without stating so and pricing accordingly.Right now I am using the nicest, furniture grade, solid oak I can source. I might be able to get some more exotic woods in the near future, but for now, these are oak.  I hand paint each of these stands with a nice marine-grade polyurethane so the natural beauty and grain of the wood stands out.  I sand them after each layer of polyurethane and re-coat until I achieve a nice hard protective finish.Of course, any firearms shown in my listings are to illustrate the items intended use and are NOT included in the sale.
I have many more sizes and configurations to suite your needs.  Check out my other listings and take a look at ZoidsHandiWerk on Etsy.com"

There might be slight irregularities in the wood and/or minute differences in the assembly or finish from piece to piece.  I will never send out anything I would regard as a “second” or “blem” without stating so and pricing accordingly.Right now I am using the nicest, furniture grade, solid oak I can source. I might be able to get some more exotic woods in the near future, but for now, these are oak.  I hand paint each of these stands with a nice marine-grade polyurethane so the natural beauty and grain of the wood stands out.  I sand them after each layer of polyurethane and re-coat until I achieve a nice hard protective finish.Of course, any firearms shown in my listings are to illustrate the items intended use and are NOT included in the sale.
