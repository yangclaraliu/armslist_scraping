The S30V steel is extremely durable, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant. In addition to providing a camouflaged surface, the DLC coating offers additional blade hardness and reduces friction. 

This high-performance S30V blade is paired with textured black G-10 scales for a secure grip and excellent mechanical strength even under the roughest conditions. The scales are flat rather than 3D machined and contoured like those of the 0300. A locking liner secures the blade during use. The 0350 also includes ZT’s quad-mount system for complete versatility.

All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro 9 design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro 9 includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro 9 pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance."

As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…
This is a WWII Inland Division of General Motors M1 carbine that was given to the Rural Police of Lower Austria after the war was over. As the lend lease weapons went, these "" Gendarmerie "" carbines were the best kept and maintained of the lot. This rifle has matching serial numbers stamped on the trigger housing, slide, bolt, stock and handguard. If you are interested you can read a lot more about these rifles by Googling BAVARIAN CARBINES ....the website will come right up.  This rifle seems to me to be one of those sent to FN in Belgium to have all of the post war improvements made. Excellent condition overall. It seems to have all of the correct Inland parts inside. Six didget serial number, barrel date of 6-43. CANNOT SEE AN IMPORT MARK. $995 OBO. Thanks for looking.

Fits Gen 3 and 4 Glock 9/40/357 Pistols. The VanGuard 2 Advanced Kit is a capability upgrade to our venerable VanGuard 2 minimalist IWB holster.  Unlike traditional IWB holsters, the VG2 covers only the trigger guard of your weapon.  This unique design eliminates the bulk of a traditional holster, while providing a level of safety and security not attainable by simply sticking a pistol in the waistband of your pants.  The VG2 Advanced Kit’s inclusion of the RCS CLAW takes this system’s concealability to the next level, by leveraging the grip of the pistol close to the body, while still allowing for a clean, repeatable draw.
The VanGuard 2 Advanced Kit with the RCS CLAW can be equipped with either a Tuckable strut with overhook or Tuckable strut with soft loop, to allow you to choose the best belt interface system for your carry and mission type.  This combination is adjustable for ride-height and cant, is fully ambidextrous, and is the ultimate in deep concealment technology when combined with our proprietary tuckable struts."

Very hard to find!!
Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."
