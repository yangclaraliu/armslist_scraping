This is the ultimate in piston AR design, 14.5 inch barrel with a pinned muzzle device. This upper is pristine condition and PWS's design has been claimed as the greatest of all piston driven AR's. The MOD 2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyMod attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present. Everything about the MOD 2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver. This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyMod mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle. Additionally the MOD 2 has dropped the unnecessary Forward Assist streamlinging the profile of the upper. The MOD 2 comes with a new gas system with three easy to use gas block settings. Position 1 is recommended for all types of ammo, position 2 is for low powered ammo using the suppressor, position 3 is for normal ammo used with a suppressor. Contact me if you have questions or for more pictures.Contact me for any further information, pictures or offers."

Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.  Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.  Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol. Features Unlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models:  - Striker Safety - Disconnect Safety - 3-point Take Down Safety System - Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine - System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear - Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation."

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

510,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6552510,For Sale:  Brand New CZ 75 P-01 For Sale NIB,"Montgomery, Mankato, Minnesota",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, August 3, 2017",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Brand new CZ 75 P-01 for sale.Willing  to ship to an FFL for a shipping fee. If bought locally a background check will be required and you'll be reasonable for that fee.The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.
The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.
These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

This will be an opportunity for regular folks like us to purchase a fine rifle in a no-reserve, penny start, true auction. This rifle has been mine for most of the last three decades. It is a hunting rifle, that has been well taken care of. It does not really look it's age and is in good shape. I suspect it has been in my 'neighborhood' most of it's life. I am no expert on condition of blueing etc. so it is not being sold as a 'antique' or collectible. Has never been 're-blued' or touched up that I can tell. Bore is a bit dark, but at 118 years old, so what? It is just well-seasoned. Rifling is still pronounced and strong, and is very accurate, to a minute of dead-right-there on Minnesota whitetails"

I purchased this rifle last October and it's just been sitting in my safe. I never purchased the scope I wanted so I never fired it. This is brand new, never been fired and straight from the DD factory. I did add a small rail, Harris bipod, and purchased two additional 20 round mags. This rifle is loaded with quality, including a Geissele SSA trigger. I'll add link for you guys to do a little more reading on it then what I'm posting. This rifle will run you close to $3,000. With the rail, bipod, and 2 mags you will be over that. To motivate a buyer to grab mine then one at a store, I will part with this, the extras, and original paperwork and case for 2100. That is an insane deal! If you are looking for a 308 and this is in your budget, this is your rifle! https://danieldefense.com/firearms/ambush-hunting-rifles/daniel-defense-ambush-308-kryptec-highlander.html"
