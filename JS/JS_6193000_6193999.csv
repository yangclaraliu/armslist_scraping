Please read this next section carefully regarding the firearm itself: Awhile back I had bought a tactical flashlight for the firearm however it would not fit so I sanded the polymer. You can see the evidence of this in the picture. Also the rear sight while adjustible, has some difficulty moving around. I tried to order a replacement part for it but Taurus sent me the wrong product. The thing is the gun functions perfectly and I have had no issues hitting targets whatsover. I am just selling it because I rarely shoot it and really have no need for it. No trades please. It is a .40 cal so it kicks unlike the 9mm as probably you know. Sale only within Lexington.

ROCKEGROUP, LLC DBA ROCKE GUNS KEEPS ZERO PERCENT OF THE PROCEEDS.. NONE, NOT A CENT!! Mike Lamb (Force Recon, Mustang, CIA) of Stoic Ventures approached Rockegroup, LLC with the permission of the Kyle family to distribute these limited run rifles. After investigating the Chris Kyle Memorial Foundation and being assured by Lamb and the Kyle family all proceeds are actually put to good use we agreed. Units have a limited run of 160 which is the official number of kills credited to Kyle.. depending on the day you ask the Navy. In reality the Kyle kills are substantially higher with an undetermined wound count. BE ADVISED these memorial carbines are not being sold as a celebration of “kills” but rather acknowledgement that for each life Kyle took he saved the lifes of our own tenfold. Units are of the highest quality, fit, and finish. THE TI-10 PUNISHER SERIES UPPER AND LOWER RECEIVER are machined from 7075-T7351 aluminum plate, providing better resistance to stress corrosion cracking than the commonly used 7075-T6.

Comes standard with a mil-spec 1913 Picatinny top Rail, two standard 4 inch accessory QD rails and one 4 inch bottom rail, attached at the 3-6-9 positions. Engraved Chris Kyle Memorial Benefit logo, The Gun Company logo, and the TI logo. The Punisher Ti-10 is fitted with a 16 inch, 1:10 twist, 416 stainless steel match barrel, which has been lapped and polished for consistent precision. Our proprietary barrel contour reduces weight without sacrificing strength. This allows our barrel to maintain consistency regardless of heat or harmonics, without additional weight.

Factory specs below. No trades. No shipments. FTF local only. I bought 2 colts, only need one so I'm selling this one. If ad is up, it's still for sale. Thanks for looking. Colt is re-vamping the acclaimed LE6920 series, adding a new model, the LE6920MPS, equipped with Magpul’s MOE-SL furniture along with a full suite of other Magpul accessories. The LE6920 is based on the M4 Carbine employed by the bulk of the U.S. military.The base rifle is a standard 5.56x45mm NATO LE6920 with a 16-inch chrome-lined M4-profile barrel. Colt uses a 1-in-7 twist for their barrels for use with common and inexpensive ammo all the way up to heavy match-grade rounds.This is a great opportunity to own a quality factory-customized rifle, right out of the box,” said Justin Baldini, Colt’s product director. The LE6920MPS is replacing the older LE6920MP, which used previous-generation Magpul MOE furniture and accessories.The rifle is offered with black Slim Line furniture. Magpul’s Slim Line is equipped with M-Lok slots for direct accessory mounting and comes with a MOE-SL handguard, buttstock and pistol grip along with an M-Lok vertical foregrip, MBUS Gen 2 backup rear sight, MOE trigger guard and one 30-round PMag where available.It’s a standard direct-impingement design with a carbine-length gas system. The front sight is adjustable for elevation and the rear for windage.Everything else is pure M4, from the A2 flash hider to the front sight post assembly to the MIL-SPEC receivers and matte black hard-anodized finish. The rifle has an extended length 35.5 inches and collapses down to 32 inches. Even with the upgraded furniture the gun still weighs just 6.9 pounds, unloaded."
