Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel, medium weight barrels preferred, uppers or complete.  9mm lower, complete or stripped(preferred).  2-3 Law Tactical Gen 3-M or Dead Foot Arms folding adapters.  2-3 KAK Shockwave kits.  Side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 31+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe a couple of nice micro red dots.  Not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time at retail.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, no flakes, no POS scammers and no BS!

It is in Great/Excellent Condition with an approximate 500 rounds through it, so barely/not quite broken in. Some scratches and cosmetic wear but zero mechanical problems or damage. Sight blocks are very straight with no cant. I am selling the rifle because I have two and am looking to get into something different. Gun is stock with 2 exceptions:-Magpul Plum AKM handguard. The factory tan hanguard set will be included with the sale. -Krebs custom retainer plate. This replaces the ""paper clip"" FCG pin retainer. If you prefer the ""paper clip"" they are $5 and easily switched out, I just no longer have the one that came with the gun. The factory sling and cleaning kit will be included with the rifle. Please contact me via email with any questions you may have, I make a point to respond promptly. Reasonable offers entertained. Not looking for any trades with the exception of possibly a russian ak47 or 74.  Thank you for looking!"

Fired fine, but I'm looking to pick up another SBR upper.This is from PSA's premium line, so it has a chrome-lined barrel and higher quality parts all around. Since I cannot include a direct link, the SKU you can search on Palmetto State Armory's site is ""28087"" to see their exact specifications for this particular product.I also have a PSA premium HPT/MPI bolt carrier group (also used for 110 rounds) that I will include for an additional $50.I need to point out that comparing this to other PSA uppers you can find on sales at other websites is not a valid comparison.  When you find those uppers for $300 with or without the BCG, you're finding a less-tested carbine length system.  Both pieces for sale here are from their fully tested, premium line in a mid-length configuration, which shoots softer and causes less wear on parts (and shoulder).
You can consider the price ""OBO"" understanding that I do not have to sell this today.  Give me a good offer or a trade/cash for a higher quality SBR length upper in 5.56 or 300BLK (BCM, etc), complete lower, or a 9mm handgun like a Walther PPQ (would also consider .45 or .22 for that particular handgun)."

I am listing my very good condition Ultra Ten II by Kimber. This gun has only seen around 5 or 6 boxes of ammo through it and is in great shape. The frame is an aluminum reinforced polymer. It has a light texture all over and some comfortable but functional checkering on the front and back straps. The stainless slide has no noticeable scratches and is in wonderful shape. The gun has almost no wear at all and has been carefully maintained. This gun came from my grandfather after he purchased a pocket pistol  for easier carry. The gun also has Novak sight cuts and is currently equipped with tritium insert night sights. These are both in green and has a lot of life left. It's very easy to see these lights in the dark and know where you're aiming. This gun will come with 2 magazines (10 rounds each), a bianch leather open top holster, and potentially some ammo depending on the trade. I don't have the original box or paperwork because it came from my grandfather but he was the first owner and was unable to find it all in his house. If you would like additional pictures, let me know what you would like to see.
For this, I am considering most any AR or AK handgun trade. However, I am specifically looking for an FNX or FNP 45. I will potentially consider other handguns as well such as another 1911 (4""-5""), SIG, Beretta, Glock, and so forth. No shotguns or hunting rifles or the like. My pistol is in great condition and functions flawlessly despite the reputation some of the earliest models had. I've never had any failures to feed or eject or fire whatsoever. It's very light for a 1911 and holds an exceptional number of rounds. It has the same 10+1 capacity as the full size SIG P227 but is much smaller. Please send me an email for any questions or offers. I am free in the mornings on Monday through Thursday, most Saturday afternoons, and all day on Sunday. Include pictures and a description of your trade and we can go from there. I'm not interested in selling outright unless I can literally use it to purchase what I want brand new. Thanks for looking!"
