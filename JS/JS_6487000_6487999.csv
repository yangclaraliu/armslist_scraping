I've kept it well, lightly wiped down with oil, but I never hard scrubbed for fear of losing the patina.The metal is in great shape, no cracks or significant wear. The hand portion of the stock has a crack (cosmetic, not structural) and a there's a small small chunk missing on the right side above the trigger, right next to the barrel release lever. Only shot it a few times, had it displayed as an antique piece, looks great on the wall!The barrel is Krupp Fluid Steel, and it has been noted that these models respond better to lower powered shells (read that somewhere).I bought this gun as a sort of antique investment piece, but I've got too many guns now I think, so feel free to send me an offer(If you live far away and want to arrange purchase with paypal and shipping to an ffl, I'd consider it as long as you tossed a few more bucks in for shipping)"
