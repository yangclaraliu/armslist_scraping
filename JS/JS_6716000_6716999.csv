This is on the rare STAINLESS STEEL versions of the Springfield XD family in the very popular 9 mm caliber. 
Condition is pristine – I don’t know if I ever fired it.
Includes factory case, owners manual, instructions, test fired shell, warranty card, etc.  There is also the Springfield loader and clip grip kind of stuff that they throw in too.
Built with Springfield’s legendary reliability and workmanship!
FEATURES:
Proven 3-dot sights.  Fully Supported Ramp sights.  Front and rear sights are dovetailed into the steel of the slide.
Springfield’s famous comfortable ergonomics and grip angle.
TWO factory magazines that are HIGH CAPACITY: With the finger grip extension for a secure grip.
In the accuracy department, it is tremendous!   As good as a Glock Or better.
Safeties:  Grip safety, the gun can only be fired when the hand firmly depresses the safety located at the rear of the handle.   Patented Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, which guards against accidental discharge. The USA only allows the gun to be fired when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger, eliminating the possibility of an accidental discharge if the gun is dropped or bumped. The XD has a striker status indicator that protrudes from the rear of the steel slide when the striker mechanism is cocked. In addition, it has a loaded chamber indicator, which is a thin piece of metal that pops up when a round is in the chamber.
 
Picatinny rail for mounting a laser, light, and other accessories.
Dual spring and guide rod system  -  less torque is placed upon the guide rod and spring.
 
Weighing a little more than the Glock, the Springfield manages recoil more confidently than the Glock, enabling accurate “follow-up” shots.* * This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.

Using just one properly equipped long gun and one handgun the owner of this package can ACCURATELY shoot 12 different cartridges in the long gun and 6 cartridges in the handgun. That’s a total of 15 different cartridges using one long gun and one handgun: 12 ga, 20 ga, 410 bore, 22 Short, 22 Long, 22 Long Rifle, 380 ACP, 9mm Luger, 357 Magnum, 38 Special, 40 S&W, 44 Magnum, 44 Special, 45 ACP, and 45 Colt. This auction includes: H&R 12ga shotgun with beautiful case hardened receiver, factory ventilated recoil pad, 24"" cylinder bore barrel, factory iron sights, screw-in chokes, hammer extension, swivel studs, and nylon sling. Complete NIB (unfired) 8-piece set of Chiappa 8” rifled adapters for the shotgun. Also included is a Taurus Judge revolver 2.5” chamber, 3” barrel, matte stainless. Box & paperwork included. Four Short Lane smooth bore adapters for the Taurus Judge in 22 Short, 22 Long, and 22 Long Rifle, 380 ACP, 38 Special, and 9mm Luger. In a survival situation the ability to use whatever ammunition is available may be important.  The H&R 12 ga shotgun came from the factory with a 24"" cylinder bore barrel and iron sights. I assume that these guns were produced with iron sights to shoot rifled (Foster) slugs and this gun does that well. It also shoots sabot slugs accurately using a rifled choke tube (not included in this sale). I have extensive experience in using gauge adapters. I can say from personal experience that shooting pistol cartridges in a shotgun with a plain bead front sight is an exercise in futility. Having real iron sights like the factory rifle sights on this gun makes a huge difference when shooting pistol cartridges in a long gun. With this set, in addition to having the ability to use many different pistol calibers and shotgun gauges you will have the option to choose your choke using screw-in Browning Invector choke tubes. I had the barrel threaded for screw-in choke tubes by R&D Custom Barrel Service. This makes reasonable patterns possible whether you are shooting 12 ga, 20 ga, or 410 bore shells in this 12 ga shotgun. This sale includes seven Browning Invector choke tubes in a MTM Case Guard case. Choke tubes included: cylinder, skeet, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, full, and an extended knurled extra full/tukey tube. All in all these are pretty versatile guns. I will not separate the components of this set. Everything goes as a single package: one long gun, one handgun, 12ea gauge adapters, and 7ea choke tubes."

Made in 1912, receiver marked Deutsch Waffen Und Munitionsfabriken Berlin, chambered in 7.65 Argentine. The barrel has been cut down to 20in. Still has the factory sights. Receiver has not been tapped for a scope and bares the Argentinian crest. The bolt handle was cut, angled and welded at some point. The weld is a tad crude, but could be cleaned up. The action is as expected, incredibly smooth! Bore is in decent shape. Has original military stock cut down for the 20in barrel, and has a metal buttplate, and with sling swivels. Wood is in excellent shape. Only real downside to it is a previous owner Duracoated the receiver and barrel gloss black, making it a good candidate for a refinish. Not my personal tastes but it will survive being outdoors just fine. I've shot some milsurp ammo out of this and it has decent accuracy at 50yrds. As good as I can shoot it anyway.I picked this as a budget deer rifle and have since then changed directions, so I just no longer need it is all. Might be into trades for other guns, feel to make offer, but mostly just looking to recoup my money. Would make a nice budget deer rifle this season. Or a good base for a custom build as these actions are highly sought after.Asking $150 for the rifle FTF in Howell. But for another $50, will include - a Timney trigger. Has super light pull, and adjustable 2-4lb - a brand new Weaver Grand Slam 1-Piece scope mount for a Mauser 98 receiver - a factory 27in barrel chambered in 7.65. Its in A+ shape with factory sights and excellent bore & bluing."

Kimber Custom TLE II
Today, law enforcement officers around the country, including such elite units as LAPD SWAT, carry Kimber Customs. Military units with the option to chose pistols that can actually do the job trust Kimber with their lives. American shooters have made Kimber the best selling brand of 1911 by a huge margin.
 
The pistol carried by LAPD SWAT
The Kimber Custom TLE II .45 ACP is virtually identical to the pistol carried by LAPD SWAT since 2002. Important upgrades from the Kimber Custom Shop such as Meprolight night sights and 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap are also included. Based on the Kimber Custom II model, it has standard features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the authority of the great .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom TLE II could well be the best choice for duty, concealed carry or personal defense.

Turrets are finger adjustable and also lock so then cannot be accidentally moved.  Reticle is etched on the glass for durability and it can be shot without the illumination on or if the batteries fail (shows up as a norml black mil-dat reticle).  Scope comes with zippered carry case, bikini see through cover, and spare battery.Mount is a quick release style that is rock solid and returns to zero very well.  I had tried a lot of QD mounts and this one is one of the best designs I've found. Mount is 30mm but comes with adapters for 1"" as needed.I have one of these on my AR M4 and it works great, turn the reticle up bright at 1x for tactical shooting and dial it up to 4x for longer ranges!  The one in the pick is on my rifle, but the one I'm selling is the same and both the mount and scope are still new in box.PRICE REDUCTION  $150 for the scope and mount package!   FTF in Clayton or Raleigh is preferred but will ship on your dime if needed."
