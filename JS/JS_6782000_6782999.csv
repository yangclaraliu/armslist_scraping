The .308 Semi-auto is built like all Les Baer rifles. It's a true custom rifle that's hand built for a perfect fit, unmatched accuracy and unchallenged reliability. Because Les Baer's rifles are all about quality parts and thoughtful extra touches, both the upper and lower receiver are made from premium 7075-T6-51 billet aluminum and completely precision machined. The lower also includes a trigger guard that's machined in. Les Baer's obsession with quality and attention to detail are immediately apparent, due in large part to the LBC bench rest 416R stainless steel barrel with cut rifling, a feature that has become a hallmark of all Les Baer Custom rifles. Several models are available, all featuring:Upper And Lower Precision Machined From 7075-T6-51 Premium Billet Material • No Forward Assist • Picatinny Style Flat Top Rail • LBC Carrier, Chromed • LBC Precision Bolt, Chromed • LBC Precision Extractor, Chromed • Geissele Two Stage Trigger Group • LBC Steel Gas Block with Picatinny Rail On Top • LBC Precision Machined Free Float Handguard With Lock Ring • LBC Bench Rest 416R Stainless Steel Barrel With Precision Cut Rifling, 1 X 10 Twist, 24"" Long • LBC Custom Grip With Extra Material Under The Trigger Guard • Integral Trigger Guard Is Bowed On The Bottom To Allow Wearing Gloves • Harris Bipod • Two (2) Twenty Round Magpul Magazines • LBC Soft Rifle Case With Pouches • DuPont S Coating On Barrel

JP Capture Spring:
The “spoon over a cheese grater” sound emitted by modern sporting rifles whenever they’re charged or fired has always been one of the AR platform’s ugly blemishes and one we’ve worked ardently to eliminate.  After years of specially selecting buffer tube manufacturers based on the quality of their tubes’ interior finish, we opted to design and produce our own action springs with a perfect centerless-ground and precision-polished outside diameter.  These JP Custom Buffer Springs are an inexpensive way to see exactly why we have a reputation for having the quietest, smoothest rifles on the market.
Our pursuit of perfection didn’t stop with springs though and led ultimately to the creation of the patented Silent Captured Spring in 2012. Maintaining all the benefits of our polished buffer springs and proprietary LMOS™ buffer, this combination buffer-spring assembly eliminates the friction of standard buffer components resulting in outstanding smoothness and sound abatement. What’s more, the spring is removable from the assembly for custom tuning, and both the AR-15 and AR-10 versions of the JP Silent Captured Springs are functional in rifle- and carbine-length operating systems. The AR-15 version fits and functions in any gas-operated AR-15 variant, regardless of caliber and the AR-10 version should fit and function in any large-frame AR-10-type platform. The JPSCS is not compatible with any 9mm AR variant or any blowback system using a solid (weighted) carrier."

High precision stainless steel target and varmint model with the first Accu-Trigger ever offered on the market in 2003 that was a ground breaker and set the current industry standard for high performance trigger function - this was a significant milestone in mass-produced rifle history. Features fluted heavy stainless steel match barrel w/target crown, target-profile stock with beautiful laminited wood for stability in varying weather conditions, and Burris stainless steel custom scope mount bases that accept any standard rings. The caliber .243 was chosen for precision because it is a necked-down .308 (known for inherent accuracy) with higher velocity and extremely controllable low recoil with this rifle's weight, and versatility both at the range and in the field for varmints to medium-size game (only 22-250, 223, and 308 are offered in this model now - http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/12bvss). I special ordered this rifle direct from Savage with a wait for initial production when the Accu-Trigger was announced publicly, recognizing the importance of this development, and it was been stored in a low-humidity safe since received. An objective review and test of these rifles is found among other places at http://www.chuckhawks.com/compared_savage_varmint_rifles.htm. This package is as shipped from Savage with manual, all orig. paperwork, the shipping box, and also catalogs from 2003 for documentation. The current MSRP for this rifle is $1,146; the rifle I have is an historic example but brand new and an outstanding value for only $700 cash no trades."

Also a few shallow pitting marks on the reciver and bolt handle. But overall the rifle is mechanically fine and works. Definitly used in Combat.

I have kept this rifle very clean over the years and its been taken care of. Its got a shiney 2 groove barre, and has the 2 position simple rear sight (300 yard and 600 yard zeros). The magazine feeds very well and over all the rifle is in good shape. She isnt a looker though, there is a small section of the stock fore end that is ""chipped"" for lack of a better word. Also a few shallow pitting marks on the reciver and bolt handle. But overall the rifle is mechanically fine and works. Definitly used in Combat. The rifle was bought like this and must have happened before it came into the US through Century International Arms.

Rainier Arms is proud to announce our partnership with AXTS Weapons to introduce the first and only lower to incorporate a bolt hold back with the mag release button. This will aid the shooter to clear malfunctions quicker and get back into the fight. Rainier Arms forged lower receiver is made from 7075 aluminum. The best anodizing dies are used for a deep black finish. Features a upper to lower tensioning screw and a flared out magwell for quick mag changes. Battle Arms 45 Degree Selector Compatible Benefits:  Removes six steps from the Manual of Arms when clearing a double feed malfunction. The device adds the ability to use the right hand to lock the bolt to the rear while still leaving you the option of using the standard left hand method. Greatly reduces the amount of time needed to clear a malfunction. Unlike all other devices there is no need to learn to find a new location for your trigger finger as one experienced with the weapon already instinctively makes contact with the magazine release button first to clear any remedial action malfunction.  Trouble free simple design:  Can be field stripped with no tools. Only one additional part is required and is completely internal to the receiver. There are no screws to come loose. There is no weight added to the bolt catch that could cause it not to lock open on the last round like other devices which bolt on. Nothing to snag on clothes or other gear.  Safety:  Virtually eliminates the possibility of the user's finger unintentionally entering the trigger guard while locking the bolt to the rear. When used, makes it impossible to inadvertently lock back the bolt with a loaded magazine left in the receiver. This prevents the possibility of chambering a round in the event the rifle is bumped causing the bolt to drop. Nothing to accidentally trip the bolt release when reloading or clearing a malfunction as it is only a bolt catch. Allows you to keep a firm grip of fire control - making it much easier to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction when locking the bolt to the rear. Nothing obstructing any portion of the trigger guard - preventing any issue with snagging a gloved hand."

This is a stunning gun, with the highest grade wood and bluing that Winchester offered on the Super X shotguns. An exquisite example of one of the best auto shotguns ever made. Almost flawless and never fired to my knowledge (I inherited it from my Dad's collection). It does have one or two very minor ""safe dings"" on the stock, and a small discolored spot on the shell feed plate (no idea the cause). Otherwise, the gun is absolutely perfect. The wood selected for the stocks is just gorgeous, deeply polished and rich, with many complex patterns in the wood. The bluing is also excellent, with a very deep, mirror polish. The closest bluing I could compare it to would be the Colt Royal Blue on Pythons. It features a gold engraving of a mallard in flight and the words ""Mississippi Flyaway"" and ""1 of 500."" This very rare and beautiful shotgun would be a wonderful addition to any collection.Price: $1295 or best offer.Please contact me with any questions you might have. Thanks for looking!"

Great for custom builds. Included is - - the stripped G26 G4 frame- All four backstraps, backstrap tool and pins (backstraps work just fine with stippling) (medium beaver taile has a small crack) - Case that matches the serial number.Since this is the serialized ""firearm,"" we will have to conduct the sale as though it is a full firearm. Before we meet, you will have to send me your valid Driver's license and FOID so I can run the number through the ISP for an approval number. Once we get the approval number, we can schedule the meet up  at least 72 hours from the time of the approval number. When we meet at the Orland Park Police Station parking lot, I will have a bill of sale for both of us to sign and then we will be good to go! Should take less than five minutes. Illinois is very anti-firearm and the laws surrounding legal private transfers are particularly finicky, so I want to do everything as safe, legal and on the up-and-up as possible. If you have any questins, please feel free to ask and I will get back to you within a business day. Thanks!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DUE TO THE RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF SCAMMERS I WILL NOT SHIP THIS FRAME. LOCAL SALES ONLY. ORLAND PARK POLICE STATION WILL BE ONLY MEETING PLACE. PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT OFFERS THAT AGREE TO THESE TERMS!!! Price is negotiable. Will also straight trade for edc knives of similar value. Still have to fill out the paperwork if we trade!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
