If interested please call me at REDACTED, located in Henderson The CMMG MK47 Mutant Semi-Auto Rifle combines components of the AR-15 and the AK-47 to make a rifle that uses the hard-hitting, close-quarters AK round with the dependability of the AK, and the accuracy and modular ability of an AR. The MK47 uses a standard AR-15 style direct impingement, gas expansion system for cycling the action. The lower receiver on the MK47 has been lengthened to accommodate the 7.62x39mm cartridge and standard AK-47 magazines; magazine release is of the AK-47 style. (The takedown pins on the MK47 are set wider than the AR-15, to prevent interchanging with AR-15 uppers.) The fire control group, pistol grip, buffer tube, and stock of the CMMG MK47 Mutant are compatible with aftermarket AR parts. The CMMG MK47 Mutant Semi-Auto Rifle has a Keymod™ handguard, and an integral Picatinny rail on the upper receiver for the attachment of aftermarket tactical accessories.

ATTITUDE. PERFORMANCE.   Cobalt Kinetics loves firearms. We are students of their history and heritage. Cobalt Kinetics is fascinated by how they work and how they are made. We are inspired by the engineering and precision of a well-made weapon. Cobalt is driven to create firearms that are more effective, more reliable and more rewarding for the owner. We founded Cobalt Kinetics because, as gun enthusiasts, we were not satisfied with the status quo – rows of the same mediocre guns on every gun shop wall across the country. We wanted better firearms, but we knew the firearms industry had no real reason to change itself. So, we decided to change the industry. Cobalt Kinetics designs and builds firearms with bold aesthetics, cutting-edge technical innovations, state-of-the-art engineering and meticulous precision. Firearms that inspire a passion for shooting because they look, feel and work better than any others. Firearms that other companies only dream of building. The firearms we always dreamed of owning.   Cobalt Kinetics wants you to share our love of firearms, to own firearms that deliver beauty, quality, performance and value far beyond their price. We want your firearms to be a source of great personal pride and create a personal legacy that can be shared for generations. Above all else, we want you to experience shooting without compromise, to have the confidence you need to put the round on target every time whether you are in the field, on the range, on guard or on point. We want your firearms to be Cobalt Kinetics firearms. The ultimate combination of artistry, attitude and performance.   The Cobalt Kinetics B.A.M.F. redefines the AR-15. It is precision machined from aircraft grade 7075 billet aluminum to the tightest possible tolerances. Its revolutionary, patent-pending Dual Drop, multifunctional bolt release sets new standards for AR performance. And its aggressive lines and badass attitude puts it front and center, before the ranks of conventional ARs. Cobalt Kinetics has invested countless hours designing, engineering and refining its innovative features, ambidextrous controls and unique finishes. Its precision and quality are second to none. We believe the B.A.M.F. is the finest AR available anywhere.
