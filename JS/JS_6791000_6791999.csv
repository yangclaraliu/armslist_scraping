All 870 parts except barrels (which require a spacer) are fully interchangeable with these guns.As illustrated in the picture, I have taken the time to press the magazine tube detents out flat instead of drilling them, so there are NO HOLES in the tube for dirt and debris to find their way into the action.$600 cash.

I bought this originally a few years ago from one of my friends whose father carried it as a service pistol so to the best of my knowledge I am the only other owner. The gun has textured grip panels which make the grip slightly thinner and feels much better in the hands than the hard plastic grips you usually see on a p220. On top of this, the gun also has night sights which are still fairly bright. It is still in good shape and will come with one 8rd clip, leather holster, and a box of 50 shells. I do not need to sell this but I am open to reasonable offers so I look forward to hearing from you.

The 0301 also features a 0.375-inch hex head pivot shaft nut that makes field adjustments fast and easy with minimal tools. In addition, this dynamic folding knife comes with Zero Tolerance's Quad-mount system so you can configure the knife for tip-up or tip-down carry, left- or right-handed.
