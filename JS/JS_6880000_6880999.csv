8,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6880008,For Sale:  PVS-14 Gen 3 Autogated Night Vision Monocular w/ accessories,"Middleton, Idaho, United States","$ 2,200","Listed On: Saturday, January 6, 2018",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a PVS-14 Gen 3 night vision monocular in lightly used condition. It produces an exceptionally clear image with virtually no spots or blemishes, meaning it was probably hand selected for tube quality (it is within specs for even a new $3600 unit to have a few black spots around the edge of the image, which this one doesn't have). This unit appears to be autogated -- it dims when pointed at a bright light, which prevents tube damage. This unit comes with a dual battery housing, which gives it a longer battery life than the single battery units (65 hours continual use as opposed to 40 hours). It takes AA batteries.I was told by the previous owner that this unit has only been used for a few hours... the condition of the unit and quality of the image is definitely consistent with that. I have used it less than an hour myself, so it has the vast majority of its service life left, and will provide many good years of service.I was also told by the previous owner that this unit has an Omni tube, meaning it is mil spec and that unlike the ITT/Pinnacle tubes, it is rated for .308 recoil.It comes with the attached lens cover/pinhole lens (for testing the unit in regular lighting), a J-arm mount (used for mounting to a helmet or ""skull crusher"" headgear), as well as a weapon mount, for mounting the unit on a Picatinny rail either behind or in front of AR-height optics. It works great behind my Aimpoint PRO or Comp M4. It also works great in front of a scope that can adjust down to 1x.Get this very clean Gen 3 night vision unit in great condition for over $1,000 less than a new one would cost, or for the same as you would pay for a Gen 2 unit, if you want to think of it that way. If you have never used Gen 3 night vision, let's just say it blows Gen 1 and Gen 2 out of the water in every possible way... it's not even close. A unit like this gives you a massively unfair advantage in any low light situation.I would take $2200 OBO.I am willing to ship, with the buyer paying.Also, not interested in trading."

Green. I installed it on my Ruger 10/22 but want to go with a different stock. I put less than 200 rounds through the gun with this stock installed before I took it off my rifle. This stock can be used with both factory tapered barrels and .920 bull barrels. It comes with extra spacers to increase the length of pull and it can accept different height cheek pieces. I paid $123.00. I am FIRM at $100 CASH or make me a trade offer of similar retail value. Text is the best way to get ahold of me. You can message me through email but it will likely get a slow response.I also have some Ruger BX15 Magazines in a separate listing.

Comes with everything it had new, the case, paperwork, 2 Mec-gar mags, and mag loader. I also haver 150 rds of range ammo for the right deal. I got this on layaway as an alternate caliber supplement to my Sig P320, but I unfortunately had to sell the 320 to cover tax season expenses and could not change my layaway without losing my money. I am interested in trading for a 9mm pistol, something compact or full size preferably, I would also be interested in a basic (RIA, Tisas, etc) 1911 in .45. If you would prefer to buy, I will sell for $300 firm at this time. Have my CCL and will want to see a valid ID for my records. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred, but can potentially travel a little for the right deal after the weekend. Best way to reach me is by text to REDACTED. If the listing is still up, it is still available- if you send an email asking if it is still available I will ignore it as I have been receiving way too much scam spam that way. NO SHIPPING."

I purchased the before mentioned firearm brand new through my dealer along with several other ""impulse buys."" Again, this item is brand new and has never been carried, loaded, or fired outside of the factory test firing. My price is firm at $500 cash for the pistol, Glock hard case, three magazines, four backstraps, blackstrap holder, extended frame pin for larger back straps, cleaning rod and brush, Glock safety manual, lock, and Glock ""speed loader."" I am by no means am pressed to sell this and am not losing money by it remaining in the safe therefore my price is firm, no exceptions. Any offers below my price and all trades will not warrant a response as I do not have the time to respond to offers that are not within what I have clearly outlined above. Glock's MAP pricing for this item is set at $539 plus Ohio tax which means the cheapest you will find this new through a dealer is roughly $578. Buyer must meet at Kroger off of I-71 in Mason as I will not drive due to all of the flakes on here. Please do us both a favor and check your location in relation to mine (45040 zip code) before contacting me and also ensure you are committed to the purchase. I hate to be straight forward but unfortunately in recent years a lot of flakes and tire kickers have come out of the woodworks on this website. Buyer must also present a Valid Ohio Drivers License or Valid Ohio CCW License at time of sale to remain in accordance with Ohio Law, fellow CCW holders will take priority. All local and federal laws apply and cash only. If you are interested in meeting to purchase please contact me through this listing or by text only at REDACTED. Thanks"
