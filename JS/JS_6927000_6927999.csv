It represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology, and carries with it the same quality and service as SilencerCo’s other products. Every year, millions of sportsmen and women venture into the fields to hunt. While rifle and handgun suppressors continue to increase in popularity, shotgun owners have been without a real solution for ear protection. Some choose hearing preservation in the form of earmuffs or plugs for relief in controlled environments, but spurn their use in the field or in a home protection scenario, where the ability to detect other sounds is critical. The Salvo 12 is modular in nature — the shooter can add or remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight and length needs. At its full length of 12 inches, it brings sound down to 137 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe level set by OSHA.  Whether you grab a shotgun for hunting, shooting clays or home defense, the Salvo 12 fits most common shotguns — provided you have a choked barrel. The suppressor attaches to the the existing choke threads via an adapter. Due to differences in shotgun manufacturer and choke preference, it is important that you select the correct adapter. The Salvo 12 is just one more example of the type of innovation that has garnered a fiercely loyal customer base for SilencerCo. SALVO 12 CALIBER: 12 ga.

Sealed box 56 Grain FMJ bi-metal magnetic bullet with lacquered steel case and sealed primer and projectile WARNING - The factory loaded this ammo with a Russian mil-spec primer normally used for 5.45x39 military ammo and it is harder than a normal 223/5.56 primer which causes problems with ignition in most guns. It requires a deep hit to the primer and in an AR15 it will only work properly if you use a longer than stock firing pin known as an 'enhanced firing pin', and many guns will also require an extra heavy hammer spring like the wolff XP spring, and its possible that you may still have an occasional round that does not fire.  We recommend that it only be purchased for AR15s with both the enhanced firing pin and heavy hammer spring as these parts are available and seems to get the ammo to work well in most guns. On the plus side if you get your gun to work with this you never have to share the ammo with mooching friends at the range and the savings on 10,000 rounds will almost make the difference to pay for another AR15. For high volume shooters, machine gun rentals, commercial ranges, training facilities, and others there is a lot of savings to be had. It would not be a good choice for someone who was just wanting a single case of ammo who did not want to work on their gun to optimize for this ammo.
