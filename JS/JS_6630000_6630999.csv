The metal looks like it was blued over a pitted surface. It is really rough. Don't ask if it can be buffed and cleaned up. No The markings are weak but most are visible.

Great handgun and built solid as a rock. Minor flame cutting on the top strap but not a worry. The forcing cone also looks as though it may have been chambfered as some point in time so basically no forcing cone erosion.  Other than that the lock up is tight. It has a giant forcing cone and robust cylinder which makes it able to handle the hottest .357 loads. Original finish as well. I also have some cheap rubber grips but the magna grips look the best. Not in a hurry to sell just testing out the market. Also looking for a Beretta 92 so if you have one let's talk. Also willing to trade for anything interesting. This one doesn't get shot as much as my other .357 so I'm looking for something new. Text me at 505 four92-6833

Barrett M82A1 29"" 50 BMG 82A1! The listing price is for the rifle. The price includes the rifle, Leupold Mark 4 scope with BORS system. This item is, It has never been fired. From the manufacturer: After 25-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low perceived recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down. For more than two decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. the result is a feat of engineering so impossibly precise, it’s hard to believe it’s man-made. As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot. The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it’s transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. the rifle’s M1913 optics rail has a 27 MOA taper to take full advantage of the scope’s elevation travel. Barrett BORS System: This constantly adapting ballistics computer puts science at your fingertips. From environmental factors to the angle of your rifle, BORS instantly takes care of the data work so you can focus on the task of putting lead on target. The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob. drawing from thousands of tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors, it automatically gives the shooter the exact yardage at which a bullet will hit. In other words, it’s like having an army of ballisticians behind every shot. Once the distance to the target has been estimated, the computer can be put into action by simply turning the elevation knob until the LCD displays the target’s range. Three internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature, change in barometric pressure and aiming at an upward or downward angle. BORS even determines if the rifle is canted. The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic Software* that’s pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. It also includes a BORS data cable that allows the user to program custom loads on a personal computer and transfer them directly to BORS. Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of calibers and rifles. Shipping/handling is $50 for this item to the lower 48.

Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.Barrels:Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Internals:The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

You won't be disappointed. We could even set up a time for you to shoot it before you buy it if that helps. I'm asking 600$ for the gun. If you buy it at buds with the cash option you're looking at 633 plus the 25$ ffl transfer fee, and the 10$ state background check. That puts a new one in your hands for around 668$. I've put around 600 rounds through it at the range. Always with quality ammo. This gun is just broken in. Only reason I'm selling it is I just fell in love with the sig p226 legion sao and I can't afford one. So I'm going to let this one go. Ftf cash transaction only. I will not ship  (scammers on armslist have really become annoying). Please don't low ball me my price is firm. Also available for purchase at a discounted rate are chip Mccormick 8rd power mags.
