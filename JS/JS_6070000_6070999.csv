Bolt is very smooth, no sticky bolt. Includes an authentic 1940's Canadian manufactured magazine with brand new springs and follower. The second rifle is truly a collectors piece. It is an old demilled Canadian training rifle with the number ""12"" still painted on the stock in red. It has been welded with a plug in the chamber, and is not a functioning firearm. This rifle can never be converted into a working gun, and for that reason it technically is not one at all. It is missing the bolt, magazine, front site bloc and a few other smaller pieces. It DOES have the original, forged Micrometer rear aperture. Feel free to make me an offer for the pair, or for either rifle. I will entertain most fair trades, but do not expect me to simply give these pieces away at a major gain on your behalf.

This started out as one of the bed liner covered rifles, and has a 7.62x39 chamber insert to be able to shoot the more common round. It will not fire the original 7.62x45 safely because of the insert. The front metal furniture in light gray was also covered in bed liner, it was all removed, the stock refinished in several layers of shellac and the metal furniture was painted with heat resistant gray primer to protect it, the paint can be easily removed and the parts can be refinished or repainted if desired. Century arms covered these rifles in bed liner to hide cracks in the stocks, this one does have a crack in the handgrip but has had a screw or similar object punched through it and has no issues, I do not know if it was done by Century or the Czechs. It does not have the original butt plate, but otherwise functions fine and runs flawlessly. This is a great alternative to an SKS in terms of function and performance.

Built with reliable parts, the level recoil layout allows the shooter to hold on target with little to no effort.  Those who own an AR find themselves upgrading to the parts that are already provided on this BKA BAMF 15.For starters, BKA uses an adjustable bleed off gas block manufactured by Superlatived Arms.  The Superlative Arms patent pending ""Bleed Off"", direct impingement, gas block for the AR 15 platform adjusts the gas flow by bleeding the gas out of the block instead of restricting the flow like conventional adjustable blocks.  As a result, the pressure is reduced to the amount required to drive the bolt carrier back allowing the remainder of the gas to bleed out of the system.  This reduces the recoil and allows the system to run cooler and cleaner.  We use a sturdy 16"" HBAR barrel with a 1-9 twist chambered .223 Wylde with Phosphate finish and M4 feed ramp.  This is a sturdy barrel that has proven itself worthy to be a part of our design.  Where others failed, this barrel not only remained in one piece, but it continued to hold a tight pattern.  Another feature is the Magpul Stock.  The patent-pending Magpul ACS (Adaptable Carbine/Storage) is a drop-in replacement buttstock for carbines using mil-spec receiver extension tubes.  A streamlined anti-snap profile shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation and the extra-poer lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure by resisting spring relaxation.  Similar to the CTR, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that eliminates wobble for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy.  Dual, rear accesible water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options.  The ACS comes standard with a rubber butt-pad which prevents slippage even with body armor or modular gear. We also used the Magpul vertical grip.  The RVG (Rail Vertical Grip) is a basic, lightweight, cost-effective vertical fore grip that attaches directly to 1913 Picatinny railed hand guards.  The shape has been ergonomically designed for use as a traditional vertical grip,  or using the thumb break method of shooting.  The 10"" Midwest freefloat forearm is one of the best on the market.  It is indeed the ultimate 2-piece handrail.  It is billet machined from 6061 aluminum and has a hard coat anodized finish.  Its design is perfect for an adjustable gas lock like we have on our BKA BR 15 and this model our BKA BAMF 15.  It is also perfect for an upgrade to a top of the line piston system which we can instal by request.  The ease of access as well as its sleek design is what won out over other handrails we considered and tested. This rifle is also equipped with the AXTS ambidextrous Raptor charging handle due to its smooth design and function.  Our BAMF is equipped with the KNS anti rotation pins.  This rifle is equipped with several Magpul enhancements.  It has the ambi Magpul safety selector as well as the Magpul BAD lever.  We used th UTG low profile flip xup sights.  We have also included a  3x9x42 Barska scope set up on a quick release rail.  The receivers have a sturdy Cerakote finish which is the best on the market.  We also furnish a reliable PMag magazine by Magpul.  This rifle is ready to go.  No upgrades are required to have a top of the line rifle which others will envy.  It is lined up, ready to load and shoot when you receive it.  We are a two man operation and we take great pride in our work.  We do everything from designing to milling to sighting in the rifles we build."

932,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6070932,For Sale:  Walther G22 22LR Bullpup Rifle,"Cary, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 325,"Listed On: Thursday, December 8, 2016",Rifles,Walther                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a Walther G22 rifle in excellent condition, with the laser attachment, UTG bipod, original hard case, and two original 10-round magazines. I am the original and sole owner.The rifle is missing its original charging handle, and I have replaced it with one that I mocked up, as you can see in the photos. The replacement functions exactly like the original -- there's no play in it and it's comfortable to use. I also have additional long machine screws to fit the bolt so you can make your own version with plastic or metal standoffs if you want.Condition:The bore is in immaculate condition, but I was unable to get a good photo of it. There is a small patch of minor pitting on the top of the barrel where the metal is first exposed. It's very difficult to see in person. There's some finish wear on the barrel where it meets the red sliding safety indicators, and some wear on the ends of the disassembly pins. Other than that, there's not really any wear or cosmetic problems to speak of.The case (not pictured) is in good, functional condition. It shows plenty of use, including some damage to the foam inside, but is fully functional. I actually have been using it for lots of other smaller guns when I am not taking the G22 to the range.History:The gun has around 3000 rounds through it. Bulk ammo works well. I have had good luck with many different types of .22 LR. Early on, it didn't like Remington Golden Bullet, but either it ""broke in"" or Remington changed their ammo, because it seems to run fine with it now. Several months after buying the gun, I sent it off for repair because the trigger bar (connecting the trigger back to the sear) was able to bend too much, causing a ""squishy"" trigger. Smith and Wesson replaced the part and sent it back much better. I haven't had a problem with it since.Overall, the gun handles and operates very well and is amazingly accurate for a semi-auto. The main negative is that it's a pain to take apart to clean (similar to a Ruger Mark 2 or 3 in annoyance level). The good news is that a bore snake and an external wipe-down is really all that's necessary 90% of the time. The gun tolerates lots of internal dirt and fouling.I'd recommend the gun for any bullpup enthusiasts or for rimfire action competitions, due to its handling characteristics and super-short overall length.Asking $325 for everything. I'm in no hurry to sell the rifle, so don't waste your time with a low-ball offer. No trades.Pick up in Cary is GREATLY preferred. If you need it shipped, you'll need to add the cost of shipping and the outgoing FFL fee, which I would estimate at $55 total. I'll also need a picture or scan of your driver's license, regardless of delivery method.Thanks for looking!"

I'm in no hurry to sell the gun (I still really like it, but it's time to free up safe space), so don't waste your time with a low-ball offer. No trades -- I won't respond to trade offers.Pick up in Cary is GREATLY preferred.
