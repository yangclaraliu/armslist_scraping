This pistol is sold ""AS IS"" with no refund nor exchange. All sales are final.   This is a ""New In Box"" pistol that was never issued and just shows internal signs of test firing by Colt before it was offered to the public. The USMC Special Operations Command chose the Colt M45A1 Close Quarter Battle pistols in 2012. These M45A1s were rolled out to Marine Raider Battalions, Special Rescue Teams, Force Recon elements and other Special Operations units within MARSOC. 1000 pistols were sent back to Colt in 2016 for warranty issues dealing with Cerakote finish and sold through commercial channels like this one. Only 530 of these 1000 were unissued.  This is the first time USGI service pistols are available to the public since the DCM ceased surplus handgun sales in the 1960s.  And it is almost certain to be the last Colt 1911 adopted by the United States Armed Forces.  Once in a lifetime opportunity. Get it while you can before all of the 530 unissued M45A1s fall into collectors' hands! The package will include the pistol, one Wilson magazine, a Kraft box serial numbered to the gun and the generic Colt authenticity letter.

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

It is hard for me to let go of a gun with so much history, but my time and financial resources are required elsewhere. The mum has been defaced, but it is still clearly visible. The rifle is numbers matching and includes original anti-aircraft sights, although the monopod, dust cover, and bayonet are missing. I have shot the rifle 30 times, and have 10 unfired rounds to go with the rifle (as well as the 30 empty cases – I would recommend keeping these). All things considered, I am asking $400 for the rifle, although I am open to offers and trades."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

 
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
 
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
 
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.
 
The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another.

So we have here a norinco sks sporter. It's a carbine length(16inch barrel) sks that came from the factory using ak47 magazines as shown in the picture. It's the only sks to be made from the factory to accept ak47 magazines. It's in really good shape and It shoots flawlessly. Overall you will not regret buying this gun. Actually I am going to regret selling it because I truly love the way it feels and I can honestly say I could trust my life to this gun. So this deal is for the gun in the timbersmith stock as shown in the picture and also I am throwing in the original stock witch usually sells for around 100 dollars witch is also in the picture. Also you get 1 30 round magazine and a Soviet style sling. Now the price listed is for the gun and magazine  and I'm throwing in the extra stock and sling for free( the stock will need some re finishing) so over all this is a steal . You won't find a better deal for this some what rare gun. Now like I said I need money so this is cash only . Also buyer pays transfer fee and we can meet at the ffl of your choice as long as it's not to far of a drive from clackamas.

The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain.Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences. The APX’s aggressive full length slide serrations make slide manipulations easy under any conditions . To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous.The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta."

Original mags are hard to find, but yet again the LH9 is the same gun so it follows that you can just substitute parts and mags. This one has one original mag, two mec gars, and a smith and wesson 6905 mag which is compatible with this gun.I bought it used and put south of three hundred rounds through it. It has no noticeable wear so I would venture it has less than a thousand rounds through it.The mags are loaded in the picture because I keep it by my bedside.
