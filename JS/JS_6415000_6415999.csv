Please email me for better quality photos!
DESCRIPTION:
The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols, but in a more concealable design. The completely adjustable P30 grip feature - consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels - is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety; this model also has an ambidextrous safety/rear decocking button. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. This model uses a conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) trigger mode.

As far as I'm aware this rifle was supposed to go to the Z.A.R. in south Africa but got caught up in the British blockade and was sold to Chile instead(Per Ball's book MMROTW). It has a ""C"" serial prefix and a flat bottomed bolt like most of them do. This particular rifle is matching EXCEPT for the bolt which is mismatched but is from another ZAR C prefix rifle, It is also Non-Import marked. The cleaning rod is present and matching. The bore is very good, mostly shiny with strong rifling but, the last 4-6 inches are dark in the grooves. Not bad for a 110 plus year old rifle. I am asking $375 I will ship but it must go to an FFL/C&R! IF I am shipping payment must be made by USPS postal money order ONLY! No money orders from kroger or the piggy wiggly."

It's been with me for every deer season since then. It took my 8 point this year. It has a Nikon 2x7 on it that I put on this year. It previously had a Nikon 3x9 but the variable power locked up. It's zero'd about a 1"" high at 100y with Lightfield 3"" 525 gr EXP sabots. It does shoot the Hornady 300gr 2 3/4"" sabots better but I've not been impressed with the expansion. It has some knicks but on the stock but nothing crazy. No rust. I'll include whatever rounds I can find. I think I have one box of Lightfields. Reason for selling is that I've jumped on the 450 Bushmaster band wagon. Willing to meet half way within reason. Prefer a CPL holder, no trades please. Price is negotiable."
