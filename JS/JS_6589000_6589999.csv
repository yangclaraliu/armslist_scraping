The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts."

As I'm sure you gathered from the title this is an M91/30 Mosin Nagant built in 1936 in Izhevsk (Soviet Union). I had the barrel professionally cut down to 20"" to make it easier to handle in the woods and threaded for suppressor or muzzle break use. I never got around to installing either but the threads are in great shape. I have a thread protector on the end of the barrel at the moment. The serial numbers on the barrel and the bolt are matching.This Mosin comes with a Rock Solid Industries scope mount which has been bedded to the receiver as well as a Timney trigger. The trigger is adjustable from 2.5 to 4 pounds and retails for $115. The scope mount retails for $50. The Archangel stock retails for $170 and is one of the best aftermarket stocks I've seen for these rifles.  I also had the bolt professionally modified for use with a scope. The scope mounted comes with the rifle, it is a BSA Catseye 4-16 with a duplex reticle which I paid $90 for.The rifle is in fine shape and would serve well as a range toy or hunting rifle. I simply don't have the time to use it any more and find myself in need of some extra funds.I have more pictures than Armslist permits me to upload.
