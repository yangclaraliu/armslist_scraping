Only about 6,500 of these made. Slide and frame are both Commerical/Military trasnfer serial range numbers. But since they do not match is why I am only asking $2300. When in serial matching, they fetch $6,000 - $9,000. History: When Colt received the WWII contract a sudden need for pistols was needed. So Colt pulled what they had produced from shelfs for their commerical line for the Military contract. These commerical pistols had their schwartz safeys removed, commercial serials peened over and military serials crudley stamped over, other military markings added then parkerized. As seen on the slide in front portion, the darker color. This is from the re-finishing from Colt to ""Militarizing"" the pistols in parkized from the blued. In the time these pistols were flamed hardened in the front portion. This flame hardening becomes very visible when its re-finished. As it was from Colt to get them converted for the Milirarty contract.
Link of one with serial match sold recently:
http://www.pre98.com/shop/gone-but-not-forgotten/colt-1911a1-1943-commercial-military-very-rare-sharp/I do not have the story as to why of the million or so WWII M1911A1 pistols that were produced. That this pistol somehow has both seriallized parts from the 6,500 C/M pistols serial range (Commerical/Military). Only 453 seperate the two serials. This pistol may have been mixed matched in a arensal very early in its life or by colt. I can not say. Both the wear and aging is matching to both frame and slide so these two have been together for a very long while.If you have any other quoestions, please feel free to ask.If you want to text or talk, please email phone number.Cash only, and local face to face transactions only.

Parts.  Barrel is H&R dated 9/61, Bolt is Stamped HRT (H&R heat treated), Op rod is also H&R as is the trigger group/hammer.  National match front and rear sights, marked NM2.   Early Armscorp rifles are some of the best ever made.  The stock is a U.S.G.I. Fiberglas assembly, though I do have a very very nice wood stock, that I believe is from a Sprinfield NM rifle and it has a gloss finish to it.  It doesn't have any hardware though.  I'd let that go for an additional $65.00, but it's not for sale otherwise.  Overall condition is very good.  I've shot it, and cleaned it several times.  I'd be telling a lie if said how many rounds has been through it, but a safe guess is 800-1000.  The bore is beautiful, grooves are deep and it shoots very very straight.  This isn't some mystery rifle made up of unmarked and unknown parts.  It's been this way since 88.  No trades, cash only.  If it doesn't sell in the next week or two, I'll just keep it.   Please feel free to call or text me.  843 six seven zero 9636Comes with a couple of G.I. mags and a 5 rounder I picked up somewhere along the way."

These pistols are not offered for sale very often and especially not in this good of condition. This pistol has a blued surface unlike the current Berettas with the black poly-type finish. I am at least the second owner. I was lead to believe it was unfired, other than the factory test firing. I can't guarantee that it is unfired, but the breech face looks new and the magazine followers are almost new looking. It does appear to have had the slide racked a few times due to some wear on the barrel nose and locking block. The only flaw I've noticed is a very tiny mark on the bottom edge of the left side of the slide. It could have gotten that at the factory though. The pistol includes 2 magazines, the factory cleaning brush, factory blue Beretta plastic case, and owners manual and warranty info. The outer silver cardboard box is included although the previous owner applied red duct tape around the edges of the box. Only willing to sell face-to-face to Kentucky resident.

The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-TensionTM magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry and you'll forget it's there. Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn't have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S is a concealed carry pistol without compromise. Put an XD-S 4.0"" Single Stack in your hand today, and you'll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you'll find that it's Noticeably Unnoticeable."
