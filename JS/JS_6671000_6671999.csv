FG84467This is a great looking pistol built by one of the best Colt 1911 gunsmiths around. The nickel frame really stands out on this so be sure to check our pictures. If you are a serious Colt collector, adding an Armand Swenson custom built Colt will certainly help to fill-out your collection.As written by Jason Burton at http://www.coolgunsite.com/comm_pistols/custom/swenson/swenson.htm: “Anyone who has read enough gun periodicals or has been around custom 1911s at any length has undoubtedly seen countless references to Armand Swenson and with good reason. As many have mentioned before, Swenson was one of the greatest and probably most important 1911 ‘smiths since Browning himself. Not necessarily because Swenson’s work was cosmetically perfect or without fault but because he was, to a greater or lesser extent, the first to really bring out the custom 1911 in the fashion that we know it today… or at least the first person to be widely recognized as such. While parts, techniques, technology, and the overall build of the custom 1911 have no doubt been elevated to a standard much higher than anything Swenson did the heart and soul of the custom 1911 is still firmly rooted and can be traced back to Armand Swenson’s work. Swenson paved the way for the “bulls-eye accurate and combat reliable” 1911s we have come to know and every custom maker working today owes him for that…. at least a little.”.."

I also have a Beretta m9 and I prefer the PT92 due to the safety and decocker on the frame versus the slide.  It's just much more accessible,  however I'm just not a fan of nickel plating. Its in excellent condition and a great shooter,  just not my style.Will trade for any AR upper or a 38/357 revolver"

Only reason I am selling it is because I play a game of checks and balances regarding the size of my collection and I have a few new ones to put in it's place.I had a tough time trying to get an accurate current value on this gun, but I fortunately was able to go to the Tulsa Gun Show this past weekend and I ran into a guy that actually collects these guns. Unfortunately I did not have it with me at the show or I would have sold it to him after he told me what they are worth.Now I am looking for offers of cash or trade for it. Trade items I am interested in are Colt snakeguns, Older stainless/nickel Smith & Wesson revolvers and FN 5.7. Those are the ones I am interested in, but if you have something unique, feel free to ask. Please don't ask what I am willing to take for it because I will only respond to offers.Thanks"
