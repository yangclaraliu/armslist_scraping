Virtually all went to the German Police - except for the last 451 which were imported by Interarms – designated “P38 IV” instead of P4 to differenciate as a US gun.The P38 IV pistols were shipped by Walther without a serial number on the frame (presumably German law was satisfied by the s/n on the slide). This was not discovered by Interarms until some while later, and the remaining guns were sent out to have the numbers engraved on the frame by panagraph machine. The number consequently looks very neat, and was cut through the anodizing, so the numbers are bright in the bottom.** This P38 IV is one of the group that DID NOT get receiver or barrel lettering and the s/n is on the right side of the slide only. Receiver has some small proof marks but no lettering.Walther P38 production ended in 1982, the same year as this gun. The last serial number was 607,419. This gun is 607,180.Total German P38 production …….. 2 MillionP38 P4 production............................ 7400P38 IV Imported to U.S…………….. 451P38 IV without frame markings…… unknownAll accessories included, factory test fired only.

An early war, mid-year production rifle, it has standard features for the year and maker and appears all-correct, with proper Waffenamts(WaA26) on nearly all components, and all serialized parts, with the possible exception of the nose cap, and the bolt assembly appearing matching. Of note-the furniture shows no sign of sanding, but any cartouches have been worn away with no discernable markings. Composition is of blonde beechwood laminate with flat buttplate, and correct for a 1940 Borisgwalde. Showing signs of long service use, the rifle is in near prime collector condition, lacking import mark, this rifle was likely brought back by a GI returning from deployment in Europe. A fantastic specimin, this weapon would be well suited to the advanced collection."

(BARREL ONLY) s/l/lr. It's missing the peep on the rear sight. no magazine, action seems to work ok. I just shoved a round in this thing, pulled the trigger and it went bang. It ejected the spent casing just fine as well. There's no serial number on this barrel. From what little research I've done, back then they just didn't use them. I could be wrong but it would also appear that this barrel was manufactured somewhere between March 1935 and late 1937. This particular barrel uses a safety much like a Mosin Nagant where you pull the safety to the rear and twist it. In 1937 they went to a lever on the right side that pushed forward and pulled back to engage or disengage the safety. It has scope mounts on it, one of the mounts is missing a screw. Unfortunately, I can't determine if these scope mounts are factory installed. If they are, this barrel would be fairly rare because they didn't produce very many barrels with factory scope mounts before they were discontinued. A couple years ago I ran this barrel through GunBroker.com for my dad just to see what it was worth. You may find this hard to believe but in order for me to keep it I had to bid $155.00. The next lowest bidder bid $150 and had a $25 shipping fee on top of that and he may have incurred an FFL fee anywhere from $15.00 to $35.00 to boot. I still have a copy of the auction listing to prove it. He wanted it pretty bad. Buyer must be an Indiana resident and show a valid current state issued ID. CASH ONLY, NO TRADES. I can meet you within a 25 mile radius of South Bend. Thank you for looking."

As fate would have it, I dug this gun out to clean it up and carry to a possible buyer this morning, as I'm cleaning it the handguard pops off real easy, upon closer inspection I realize that someone had been annoyed by the same problem and had the handguard taped on at some point in the past.. Looks like the retaining tab could be bent or a new spring put in the gun to fix the problem. A plus for the buyer though as I have reduced the price yet again.

(LAST DITCH) made by my estimate in late 1944. All the numbers seem to match. It was built in the Nagoya Arsenal. Action seems to work ok, it is missing a few parts though, upper handguard, and screws. Here's the best part of this gun, the MUM is intact and near perfect. This is rare because the mum is the emporer's seal. It was considered dishonorable and an embarrasment to the emporer if a fighter allowed his weapon to fall into enemy hands with the emporer's seal intact so many of the seals were removed or defaced before surrender. The seals that remained did so in most cases because they were captured in the heat of battle and the fighter didn't have time to remove it before the firearm fell into enemy hands. I'm thinking this is most likely still in the Japanese 7.7 x 58 caliber. I ran this through GunBroker.com a couple years back for my dad to get an idea what it was worth, it fetched a $155 bid plus there would have been a $25.00 shipping charge attached so that's where I'll start. Buyer must be an Indiana resident and show a current valid state issued ID. CASH ONLY, NO TRADES. I can meet you within a 25 mile radius of South Bend. Thank you for looking."

Only lock 686 I'm probably interested in is the talo special edition 3/5/7 7 shot with the 5 inch barrel.Looking for a CZ75 P01 or SP01 prefer P01 with NSN and prefer all metal SP01.I've got cash, Glock and S&W firearms, AR/AK, and mags, ammo etc for all of them to offer trades on. Especially interested in that 686-2 that was listed in Lasalle. I'm on my honeymoon outside the U.S. until the afternoon of 12/11 and I think any armslist messages I've sent haven't gone through"
