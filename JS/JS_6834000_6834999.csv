Gun only has a few hundred rounds through it. All extras are a few weeks old and in perfect condition.This thing is fully loaded with everything you'd ever want, I'll list everything below and how much it cost me so you can rest assured this is a really good deal.The TFX sights use a patented design that has a tritium AND fiber optic rod, so they glow super bright during the day and at night.

I'm asking $850 for this package, my loss and your gain. I've gotten used to losing money on stuff I ended up not liking.I prefer cash, but I'm willing to consider all FAIR trade offers. Only exceptions are .40's, shotguns, bolt actions, .22's, or revolvers...I won't be interested in any of those.Stuff I'd almost definitely be interested in: Beretta's, SIGs (226, 228, 229, 220), SIG 1911 Fastback Nightmare Carry, CZ P10c, CZ Scorpion Carbine/Pistol, Lionheart LH9.Either way, let me know what you have.

Less than 100 rounds down the pipe.I don't mind if your 9mm only comes with two mags, but please, I do ask that it comes with some ammo (and preferably a holster too if it's full size, but it's not a deal breaker).

For trades I will consider quality 9mm pistols except for Glocks. Most interested in a carry-size CZ, but I will consider other CZs, Walthers, or Sigs -- and if you have something else QUALITY (no Taurus or Hi Point, etc), try me. NO OTHER CALIBERS OR NON-FIREARM ITEMS -- I'm not interested, don't bother. Please be prepared to add cash if your pistol is worth less. I can add some cash for other firearms, if appropriate. PTP/PTC and bill of sale required.thanks for looking"
