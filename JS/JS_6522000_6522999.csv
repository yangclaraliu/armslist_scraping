They are a small, high quality, manufacturer. Guns & Ammo actually visited their factory and had great things to say about Core in this review about their full sized ARs: http://www.gunsandammo.com/rifles/ar-15/core-15-hardcore-ar-review/Also, Tactical-Life chose this gun I'm selling to be 1 of the 12 of the Best 300 Blackout AR Pistols On the Market. See http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/300-blackout-ar-pistols-2016/#twmj16-arpistol-adamsStill not convinced? Core's warranty is unparalleled in the industry and applies equally to 1st, 2nd . . . 10th owner of their guns. See:http://www.core15.com/about-core-rifle-systems/the-core-warranty/ Not familiar with 300 Blackout? It is the fastest growing caliber on the market. Unless your target is 250+ yards away, it is far superior to the 5.56/.223 in many ways. Think of it as a 7.62 bullet in a 5.56/.223 case (hits MUCH harder) with powder that fully burns in a 10 inch barrel unlike a 7.62 or 5.56/.223 which don't burn completely even in a 16 inch barrel. If you want to know more about the 300 Blackout, message me and I'll reply with some links.This gun is brand new and has not been fired since it left the factory. Since the barrel is less than 16"" long and does not have a rifle stock, it is technically classified as a pistol.Specs:Weight: 6 lbs. 7 oz.Caliber: Chambered in 300 AAC BlackoutLower Receiver: CORE15® Mil-Spec Forged 7075-T6 Lower Receiver, Type III Class II Hard-coat anodized finish, beveled Magwell for improved reloading speed, machined chevrons in front of magazine well, bullet pictogram safety markingsUpper Receiver: CORE15™ Mil-Spec Forged 7075-T6 M-4 Upper Receiver, Type III Class II Hard-coat anodized finish, M4 Feed Ramps, (1913 Picatinny rail flat top) w/ dry lube internal finish and laser engraved T-markingsBolt Carrier Group: CORE15® Mil-Spec Carpenter 158 steel bolt, M16 Chrome Lined 8620 Steel Carrier, Mil-Spec Staked Gas Key, Tool Steel Extractor, Shot PeenedBarrel: 10.5” 1:7 Twist 4150 CMV Pistol Length Gas System Black Nitride FinishRail: CORE Keymod 9.5” RailGrip: Ergo Swift GripFlash Hider: Midwest Industries Flash HiderMagazine: 1 Magpul® 30 rd.

#1: Saiga .223 Rem, Russia Izhmash 30rd US Sporter, 20.47"" Barrel, price $599. Purchased new in 2008.  No box.  Comes with 3 30 round mags + factory 10 round mag.

The Saiga 223 Rem. AK-47 made in Russia by Izhmash was imported by US Russian American Armory Company Scottsburg IN. I bought one in 2008 new and the other in 2010 used, but it had very few rounds through it and was still in the box. I've shot less than 100 rounds through these myself. I love these guns, and am only selling them to pay for some more expensive projects.  These come with the factory 10 round mag and oil bottle and 4 Saiga Pro-mags (that sell for $25 each). Overall both firearms are in great shape with few signs of use/wear.
Butt-stock and grip is in good condition with no signs of use/wear. Receiver is in good shape with some light scratches from normal use found along the finish. Barrel is in good shape. Bore is in good shape.

The Beretta ARX160 in.22 L.R. is a faithful replica of the battle tested ARX160 serving with the Italian Military. The weight, balance, look, feel and most of the control placement and operation are just like the 5.56 NATO rifle. The .22 long rifle ARX160's almost twin appearance to the Italian service rifle make it an easy choice for training purposes and also makes a fun, reliable target rifle.  Features like an ambidextrous safety lever and magazine release, picatinny rails, reversible charging handle, collapsible folding stock set the ARX 160 apart from other .22 rifles. Couple those features with an 18"" barrel and you have a target rifle that can be enjoyed by both right and left-handed shooters alike.   Specifications and Features: Beretta ARX160 JXR21800  Ambidextrous safety Picatinny rails  Ambidextrous magazine release Charging handle convertible from right to left Collapsing and foldable stock Adjustable polymer flip up sights 18"" barrel Three (3) - 20 round magazines"

F.M.A.P. Argentine Air Force model 1911 (model of 1927).  Of approximately 86,000 D.G.F.M. F.M.A.P. pistols that were produced between 1945 and 1966 from Colt supplied specifications, supervised by Colt personnel at the Rosario plant in Argentina, only 4,200 were manufactured for the Argentine Air Force (Aeronautica).  The pistol has been Arsenal refinsihed as has approximately 90% of those imported.  There is some holster wear on the right side of the slide that is evidenced in the picture and was pre-refinish, but that is all.  It is a numbers matching, barrel, frame and slide, the only exception is the magazine is non-matching but period correct.  I have priced this well below last year’s Blue Book of Gun Values.  If shipping is required I will only accept USPS Postal Money Orders, no exceptions.  Shipping is a flat $25.00 USA only.  All NC Gun laws will be obeyed, buyer must have a NC CC Permit or Pistol purchase permit.   I have listed this as a Colt as D.G.F.M. F.M.A.P. is not an option in the list of manufacturers, additionally the pistol is eligible for C&R ffl.  I selected Colt as the manufacturer since D.G.F.M. is not an option."

Designed primarily as a defensive shotgun, it features a single 18.5"" barrel fed by two separate magazine tubes. A manual selector lever behind the trigger guard allows you to select which tube is feeding the hardened steel receiver. The KSG ejects downward to clear the chamber to give you more reliable operation when you need it most! The dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 3"" shells (6 rounds each) giving you some serious firepower. It will hold 14 rounds of 2-3/4"" shells and its simple reliable action can cycle shells as small as 1-3/4"" if you want to hold even more shots! A familiar cross bolt style safety, a pump release lever located in front of the trigger guard and the ability to clear the chamber without feeding a round are important safety features in any home defense shotgun. The Zytel synthetic forend and pump have top and bottom picatinny rails for mounting lights, optics and accessories. The synthetic stock has a nice thick soft rubber recoil pad to tame the recoil of this powerful shotgun! Take it to the range for shooting fun during the day and sleep peacefully at night with the KSG by your side!
