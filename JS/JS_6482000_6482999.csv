It's a fantastic gun, and I like the compact size, but I just don't want to have too many at once! This gun has been worked and looked over by Kenny Hatten at Superior Gun Care and he told me to shoot the hell out of it. I've put  probably a thousand trouble free rounds through this Arcus and have enjoyed the nice single action trigger - at least for a beginner. Plus, at this price and function, it's hard to beat, and for an all steel gun that shoots like a budget Hi Power, this is probably a great pick. Comes with two 13 round magazines, but is compatible with Browning Hi Power magazines of any type, including those terrific 15 round Mec-Gar mags. NOTE: I am not trying to represent this as a Browning pistol, but there is no entry for Arcus as the manufacturer! Poor Bulgaria. But feel more than welcome to inspect it as close as possible and put whatever ammo through it you desire. It's a tank, and suitable as someone's first gun or for abuse in a truck. These were popular in the Israeli civilian and second-line police markets, it seems, too, and I got this along with an Israeli-finished Kareen that's also made from Arcus parts. Willing to consider any reasonable offers, and interested in trades - see below."

This one is a 20 gauge, but they also made them in 28ga and 410/44xl cal. H&R only made about 5,000 of these guns, and they were manufactured between 1909 and 1916. This is gun number 280 of that approximate 5,000 that were made.Unfortunately, this gun was not shown the appreciation that it deserved, which has resulted in it not being in that great of shape, which is sad. It is totally shootable (and with the steel barrels it can handle modern ammo just fine), but it's beauty has been diminished through rough treatment. Regardless, though, it is a real gem of a gun, and a fine one to have in your collection of rarities.I was careful to get good pictures of the entire gun, being sure to capture any known flaws of the gun. If you have any questions, please email me and ask, and I will get back to you asap.I will do face-to face transactions or ship upon buyer's preference.  Shipping on this gun is $35 to the Continental US, or $55 to Hawaii or Alaska. I accept USPS money orders for payment for shipped guns.  Cash payment for face-to-face tansactions.This gun is C&R eligible! If you send me a copy of your C&R license, then I will ship it to you, otherwise I will ship it to a local FFL of your choice. I am not an FFL myself, so please make sure you choose an FFL that will receive guns from a private seller.Thanks for checking out my gun.  God bless."

Like those who are unapologetic about protecting their legacy, the SAINT™ makes no compromises when it comes to features, engineering, and operator experience. As the ultimate refinement of the AR-15 form, the SAINT™ combines innovations like the Accu-Tite receiver mating system with the relentless execution of core features. The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it. Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance."

Law Enforcement / Military are actively seeking lighter weight weapons from USG weapons manufactures. Try carrying around an 8-10 lbs gun all day. Gets exhausting and it’s no fun. Add ammo and optics and now its 10+ lbs! POLYMAR-15SC are state of the art. Comes with Midwest MLOK rail system made from high grade aircraft 7075 Aluminum. Titanium Bolt Carrier Group, Faxon Arms Match grade thin profile barrel. All internals are NP3 coated.  These guns are LIGHT LIGHT! SUB MOA accuracy, meaning they shoot ½ groups. They are far more accurate than a current military issued FN M4 or its Colt M4 6920’s predecessor. Robar can’t keep these guns in stock and are 5-7 month back logged. All guns are custom ordered per client specs. You VERY rarely see them sold on the private markets for a good reason. Owners don’t want to sell them.
Current selling prices through Robar come in at $1795.00. And folks once your order is placed it take 3 weeks just to get confirmation many times, and then months sitting around waiting for your gun to show up. This gun comes in at a very reasonable price of $1500 and is available immediately. Priced under market value, has less than 100 rounds. Was previously assigned as a demo model from an officer working for Scottsdale Police Department in Arizona.  You can get more information about Robar PolymAR-15 @ RobarGuns . Com
