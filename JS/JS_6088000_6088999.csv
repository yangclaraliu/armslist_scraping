I bought two of these and have carried one for almost two years, and in excess of a 1000 rounds of flawless rounds shot. ""Unbelievable"" accuracy for such a small barrel. Which is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled barrel. Info below. This one comes complete in box, two mags. $525. https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/kah...l-made-in-usa/From Khar's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

Broke in per Kahr directions. You don't see the P models come up for sale very often. Unbelievable accuracy. No shipping, don't waste time asking. I bought two of these and have carried the other for over two years with well over a 1000 rounds flawlessly.From Kahr's website:The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

NO MAGAZINES, can be ordered from MDT and other sites.   Nothing else included from picture 3.From MDT website:Our TAC21™ chassis system a combination of benchrest accuracy, superior ergonomics and specialized design. This chassis brings the bolt action rifles to the next level in versatility and modularity, with an instant improvement in accuracy.The chassis system is manufactured out of billet 6061-T6 aluminum, which has been hard anodized to mil spec type III for extra strength, and has been finished with Cerakote™ in Black or Flat Dark Earth (FDE).TAC21™ chassis is engineered to minimize warping and distortion. The rifle receiver only makes contact with the TAC21™ chassis on the V shape bedding and recoil lug area insuring the best accuracy and repeatability. The generous clearance on the fore-end makes any barrel (diameter up to the receiver size – 1.350”), free floating.Inherently the TAC21™ has a straight-line design, meaning that the recoil comes straight back instead of making the front of the rifle kick upwards. This results in more accurate and quicker follow up shots. This also translates to a decrease in felt recoil and comfort."

Beautiful vintage Smith and Wesson Model 19-3, pinned and recessed, 6"" barrel with a detachable Bo-Mar Competion full rail competition sight (sights are no longer made and are rare). Also has the combat trigger and hammer. This gun is an absolute beast and fires flawlessly. Also the most accurate .357/38 I've ever owned or shot. Cylinder lock up is tight, bluing is nice (not perfect, as it is almost 50 years old). Original walnut grips are in excellent condition. This is an absolute must for revolver lovers. It'll come with a full length leather holster w/ thumb break and roughly 300 rounds of mixed .357 and .38 ammo. I'm specifically looking to trade for an AR15 only, I prefer a package deal w/ mags, ammo and maybe an optic, since I'm willing to give a package deal as well. This gun alone is appraised at $750, another $150 with the full rail competition sight, and another $150 for the holster and ammo. I'll even include a speed loader. So I'm asking $1150 cash or trade value. No less. I love this gun, but have decided to part with it just in order to get another AR. If you're interested, please call or text me at REDACTED. I'm located in Spring and will meet within reason for the right deal. Thanks for looking!"

Nothing wrong with the advertised ammo except the steel is not hardened and only penetratrates a little better than lead. That type of ammo is used for military practice. Using soft steel insead of lead saves money. And the Chinese steel core stuff is not even real military grade ammo. The German ammo here is the real deal with a hardened penetrator. Zips right through 1/4"" plate at well over 300 feet and even 3/8"" close up. Being real military it is also more reliable and accurate than commercial ammo.

Includes the original hard case with all factory paperwork and accessories, Desantis discrete carry/concealment case, desantis pocket holster, Hogue contoured rubber grip which feels great in the hand, two factory 6 round magazines, and a Sig Sauer P238 7 round extended magazine which works perfectly in this pistol and gives you a full grip. (Sig cheaply copied the Mustang to produce their extremely popular *and expensive* P238) The Colt is made with higher quality materials and machining than the Sig. It is also 5 oz. lighter than the Sig P238 (11 ounces unloaded!) has a smoother finish and profile for comfortable  concealed carry and is a pleasure to shoot. This is a fantastic pistol and functions flawlessly. I can easily shoot it accurately at 25 yards and recoil is very manageable due to the polymer frame. I actually really enjoy this little pistol and I'm only selling it because I have more compact handguns than I realistically need. The sights are fantastic! Add up everything here and you will see the value. Enthusiast owned. As new condition and a ton of extras.  You won't be disappointed. Price is firm. Meet at FFL in Bend. You pay fees.
