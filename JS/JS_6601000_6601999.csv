Meopta now calls it thier EXT reticle. 1"" main tube, big 50mm front objective, fast focus eye piece and side focus to really dial in a sharp sight picture. Not a mark on the scope as I had it mounted in Burris Signature rings with the plastic inserts that will not mar a scope body.

Color: Black Chassis/ *Brand New* FDE Skins
Factory New 6.5 Creedmoor Conversion Kit Installed
I have my personal DT SRS A1 chassis with a brand new 6.5 Creedmoor kit installed up for sale. I just got a brand new one because of the dealer promo DT ran for us around Christmas. This one shoots great, but I don't honestly need 2 (though I seriously thought about it :-).
Light wear marks on the base pad of the monopod, and very light wear on the fore end of the rifle.  FDE skins are factory new, and were just recently replaced.  The used chassis has been given a thorough going through and cleaning.  Original owner of the rifle/chassis certainly used it, but didn’t abuse the weapon at all, hence why there is really only light wear marks on a couple of spots on the chassis.  The Desert Tech SRS-A1 Bullpup Rifle system is one of the most versatile and accurate systems on the market today, and this is a great chance to get yourself started on this excellent platform, without having to deal with the full-on sticker shock of a fully, factory-new rifle.
Cost for the rifle in 6.5 Creedmoor is $4195."

Very accurate and fun to shoot.  I have put around 400 rounds throught it, and have never had an issue.  Since this is my carry gun, it was cleaned after each shooting session.  My preference is to trade this gun.  But the only pistol I am interrested in, is the all black Springfield MOD 2 subcompact in 9mm.  Face to face with a CPL or purchase permit preferred.  I am willing to drive a bit for the trade or sale if need be.  There is an FFL in my area, if you would like it shipping, but the buyer would have to cover all costs."

I'm looking to trade, preferably straight swap. And for all of the nickel and dimers out there in Armslist land (of which I'm not one but you know who you all are), I paid $500 for this gun, brand new, last year so we'll call it $450 since it's in mint condition and only 50 rounds down the pipe. The custom holster is an $80 holster, specifically designed for this gun right in front of my eyes. The DeSantis holster was $25. The pistol came with two mags, and the third one was $35 (average cost of a P345 magazine). $450+$80+25+35=$590That should satisfy you number crunchers. That's not including the ammo. If we swap and yours is a .45 as well, then I'll be holding onto the ammo...it just makes sense. That all being said, shoot me a message, let me know what you have and maybe we can set something up.I wouldn't be totally averse to a cash offer, as long as it isn't a lowball offer, but I'd much rather trade."

Specifically, I'm looking for a 4"" 357 Magnum. Any brand would be considered*For sale is a Remington 700 ADL chambered in 308. The scope mounted on it is the factory scope. That's not an 800 yard scope, but it's served me well out to 250 yards (it can work farther, 250 is the farthest range I've shot at).  *It is worth noting that this rifle is NOT effected by the safety recall due to unintentional discharge*The ADL model does not have a detachable magazine, you load the internal magazine from the top, similar to many vintage rifles. I'm not an expert marksman by any means, but I can regularly do 5 shot groups and get less than 0.75 inch on those groups using a handload which consists of the properly sized case, CCI primer, 38.6 grains of Hodgdon Benchmark, and a 168 grain hornady match bullet.  Just figured I'd include thst information if a reloader happens to be looking at this.I don't want to sell this, but I recently had an unexpected emergency vet bill pop up, so I need to set my priorities to pay for the expenses. This rifle new is generally $450 or so. The rifle is in a very good condition with no evident rust, dents or scratches. With this in mind, I'd like to ask $375, but am open to offers as long as its not a blatantly lowball offer. I'm located in the Southwest Columbus area near the 270 ramps at Georgesville Rd (exit 5). I can meet around here, Hilliard, Grove city, or similar distance areas. Thanks"

When aiming down the sights you see no scratches or dings, the sight picture is excellent and EXTREMELY fast.  Set screws still have loctite on them and need to be loosened and tightened if you want.  Installation calls for loctite and set screw install but the fit is so tight you could tap it in like factory sights and that thing isn't moving. I filed them perfectly. Comes with front sight removal tool, punch, red loctite and allen wrench.  Asking $49. That's less than half of what I paid for them-you wont find anything on this site for that much of a discount. Feel free to email with questions."

Projector - Infantry - Anti-Tank Weapon    The British PIAT anti-tank grenade launcher was developed during the early stages of WW2 by Maj. Jefferis as inexpensive, lightweight self-cocking anti-tank launcher (“projector” in contemporary British terminology) that could throw HEAT projectile (“bomb”) to extended ranges and with decent accuracy. Its design was based on the so-called Blacker bombard, which also featured spigot type design. PIAT was manufactured in significant numbers by British company Imperial Chemical Industries, and used by UKand Commonwealth forces as light anti-tank and infantry support weapon since about 1943 and through WW2 and Korean war. The PIAT was indigenous weapon, simple and inexpensive, but also rather heavy (compared, for example, to US-made Bazooka rocket launchers) and with unusual and uncomfortable cocking procedure for first shot. It also produced heavy recoil when fired. Its positive features included lack of dangerous backblast and muzzle flash.   The PIAT anti-tank grenade launcher uses so called spigot principle, in which the simple “barrel” for propelling charge is formed as the long, tubular tail of the projectile. Total weight of the HEAT bomb is about 1,2 kg (2.6 lbs), muzzle velocity is about 80 m/s. The tail of the projectile is open from the rear, and the launching charge (made in the form of a special blank cartridge) is loaded into the closed front of the tail tube at the factory. Upon discharge, long and heavy striker (spigot) enters the projectile tail from the rear, powered by large and very powerful spring. Spigot passes through the tubular tail until firing pin on its forward end strikes the launching cartridge, setting its charge off. The pressure of powder gases pushes the projectile forward, while at the same time, throwing the spigot rod rearward, compressing its spring until the spigot is self-cocked by the sear, making it ready for the next discharge. Cocking of spigot for the first shot is achieved by placing both feet against the shoulder rest of the weapon and pulling the weapon up by the trigger guard. The movable shoulder rest is connected to the spigot and cocks it when pulled. This procedure requires a lot of muscular strength. After first shot, spigot is recocked automatically due to the recoil blast. In combat situations, PIAT was normally carried cocked and with safety on, unloaded. The projectile, which has large diameter warhead, is loaded into the open-top tray at the front of the weapon. PIAT was normally fired from the ground, using integral folding support of “inverted T” or “A” shape. Aiming was achieved by using folding iron sights of aperture type, with two or three apertures in rear sight blade (for 50, 80 and 110 or 70 and 100 yards ranges)."

The large quality padded soft carry case for this gun is also available.
Beautiful gun. Although 66 years old, this is the first rifle I ever purchase.  (Purchased 9 months ago).  This is the perfect Ruger 10/22 for the bolt action shooter. I have since purchased an automatic. This rifle is currently being sold at Gander Mountain, gun only for $459.00 and in many gun shops for $389.00. And then there is sales tax and sometimes shipping cost as well.Purchase the rifle alone for $279.00.

If you add this up, you can purchase all these items alltogether as a package $395.00.     Cash only.     You could easily pay OVER $699.00 plus tax for all this at retail - as I did originally.  Come, examine the items - they are in new condition. Ruger owner manual included, original carton box and packaging available if wanted.This purchase of rifle will require TRANSFER through a local FFL, subject to bacground check according to Federal and NYS law. The cost for this would proablly be $25-35 borne by purchaser.Call me at REDACTED cell or at my business REDACTED. We can meet at my business location for review.

I have a little over 500 rounds out of this bolt and its only about 2 months old. I want to get a dedicated 22lr gun instead, and shoot 223 and just have more guns. I can shoot perfectly well in a small gun range, and at 50 yards, I normaly get about 1-2"" groupings, so over all it is accurate , my gun is not sighted in for 100 yards, and it is a simple red dot sight and 10"" barrel AR, So I dont bother shooting long range. I have had the typical 22lr problems any 22 gun would have, but it takes cheap 22s or CCI or other better brands. I normally use remington gold plated hallow point rounds, which is not recommended but works. This is the better of the conversion bolts, as it is the stainless version.The bolt is in good condtion, a little dirty of course but well kept. this is a low maintence bolt, comes with the 25rd mag. I have been able to use other mags as well. It was bought as Bass pro which is curently on back order.text me at REDACTED"
