It has the manufacturer empty shell casing, which would show its functionality, but I never fired it. Comes with three 15 round mags. night sights which still work, grip pads, lock and the hard plastic SW case. One 50 pack of 40 cal from Armscor will be included too. I'm asking for $450.00, but would consider reasonable offers. BILL of SALE is required. You must have a valid Texas DL and or LTC, unexpired. No valid ID, no sale.Transaction must take place in front of my home in NW Houston. Look it up in Google Maps by typing 77066. I will NOT go to meet you anywhere. If you cannot meet like I have stipulated don't contact me and waste my time. No shipping will be provided outside to anywhere either. Again $450, OBO for this new MP40. No low ballers need to contact me. Also as long as you see this posting, the gun is available. Please don't ask ""if I still have gun"". Also if you are those kind of persons that wears pants half way down your ass and have limited vocabulary or ""swag"", please don't contact me. Will not sell to you.

Essentially the Kobra modified for carry for those who prefer commander size 1911's, but insist on complete reliability. 4.25 inch slide does not impair the legendary reliability of the 5"" Govt model. Frame factory modified with Bobtail housing reduces the projecting butt without sacrificing full size grip frame or mag capacity. It minimizes the print under your jacket, does not tear or wear coat linings and reduces weight. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative snakeskin treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering, is preferred by female shooters, and looks way cool! Kobra Carry is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different."

Gun was made by Northwest Action Works. They did some very good work on this build. With the exact powder load and seating depth, I’m able to shoot .2-.3"" groups. Picture on last slide is at 150y. I have some cases that have 5+ reloads, primer pockets are still tight and the brass still has elasticity without any annealing's yet. Gun has 480rnds through the barrel, barrel has a lot of life left with the load I've been using along with proper cleaning and maintenance. I haven't shot factory ammo through it but I'm confident due to the quality of the gun, factory ammo would shoot well under 1MOA. I've had guns with longer barrels and after doing some research, the loss in fps is well worth what you gain in portability in m opinion with regards to hunting. This thing is a tac driver out to 1300y which for me is the furthest I'd harvest game in perfect conditions; plus shorter barrels are inherently more stiff which leads to better accuracy with factory ammo or less guess work with load development. Included is all the items with explanations in the blue bubbles. Not included is the tripod, the U.S. Optics scope leveler, and the Hornady OAL Gauge. Gun weighs 13lbs. Gun Info: -Defiance Deviant LA in .338 Lapua single shot -20” Krieger Stainless Barrel MTU Contour / 1:9.3 Twist -Vortex 6x24x50 PST-Ross Schuler 3 port Muzzle Brake -Timney 510 Trigger -Badger Bolt Knob -Integral 20 MOA rail -Integral Heavy recoil lug -XLR Carbon Fiber Chassis w/front and rear picatinny mount. I have detailed reloading and tightening specs included with the gun as well as a cleaning regiment a couple competitors I know use. I also have a detailed Powerpoint with all info and more pictures if you would like that sent to your email. Price is very reasonable, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck with this system, price includes all reloading components, if you don't plan on reloading will sell components separately for lower price. Unfortunately duty station changes require me to sell. Feel free to call REDACTED or email: REDACTED with any questions. Thanks, J"

I have put less than 250 rounds of Remington Core lokt 180gr and Federal Premium Safari 200gr though it. The action is as smooth as they get and cycles perfect every time. I have killed multiple deer with this gun of all sizes and have never had one run, they drop every time and are dead before hitting the ground. This can be a hunting gun or a range gun and is a blast to shoot either way. This gun currently has a Swarovski 6-24X50mm Habicht mounted on Talley rings. The gun can sell for $4,000 with the scope, rings, and sling zeroed at 100yds, or $2,500 gun only. Either way it comes with 1 round of Core Lokt and 5 Rounds of Federal Premium Safari. Prices are negotiable so make an offer. Email me at ""REDACTED"" if interested. Willing to answer any questions you may have."

It is still in the original .310 caliber, with matchings numbers on the receiver, trigger assembly and stock. Cartouche on stock is visible. Rifle appears to have been re-barreled as barrel is marked Birmingham Small Arms Co. just in front of rear sight. Barrel rifling is clean and bright with good lands and grooves. Trigger pull is crisp but is harder than on my other Martini's. Original sights and sling swivels. No extra holes for scope mounts etc. A very nice Martini Cadet, with a very low serial number."
