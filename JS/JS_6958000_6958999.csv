This particular pistol has custom stippling on the grip as well as the slide, to ensure that you always maintain positive control of your modern day Mjolnir and are able to power stroke your slide hard enough to give Chris Costa a stroke. I love this pistol, I just need something that I can more practically carry, without spending additional money. It's had well under 500 rounds through it. I also have 1060 rounds of SS197 sporting rounds, if you want to buy fuel to keep your new nugget popper running. $1,200 for the pistol, or $1,600 for the pistol and ammo. That's roughly $18/box for the ammo, which is super cheap."

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating pusher rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Kochs famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately swagged with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission International Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm. Like the HK416, the MR556 is a major product improvement of conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. Using the HK-proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm. The MR556 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 series arms including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR556. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. Like the famous HK416, the MR556 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy for more than 20,000 rounds with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity.Specifications: - Action: Semi-Automatic - Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO - Barrel Length: 16.5"" - Capacity: 30+1 - Trigger: Standard - Safety: Lever - OAL: 33.9""-37.68"" - Weight: 8.9 lbs - Stock: Black Synthetic Adjustable - Finish: Black"

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

Jeff Cooper.
This gun is in like new condition. I basically got the scope dialed in and never got to shoot it again after that. Selling because I need the cash.
Comes with four polymer 10-round magazines and the 10-round steel magazine pictured (most people seem to prefer the polymer mags because they’re lighter and smaller for the same capacity). 
Installed a muzzle brake to cut down on recoil, and the difference is very noticeable. You won’t believe how easy and fun this gun is to shoot, especially given how light it is for a .308. And besides, who doesn’t love a light, fast-handling .30 caliber rifle in a beautiful laminate stock?
Pictured with a 2-7x Leatherwood scope with long eye relief (one of the essential elements of the scout gun concept), which allows you to shoot scoped with both eyes open. Not pictured is a brown Galco Ching Sling with matte stainless sling swivels (perfect setup for taking fast shots on the move from a bolt-action platform).
Considering how much money you’d have to invest to get this exact setup (with the scope, muzzle brake, sling, and magazines) this is a steal.
May also throw in a set of .308 reloading dies (never used) if you can use them!
$800 o.b.o. with scope and sling, $700 without.
Send me your best offer!

While I am not a big resident evil fan I have to say this company makes some of the highest quality lowers I have ever had, and the emblem is perfectly done. I now know why they sell out the same day after they go up for sale on their website. This lower is not only forged for increased strength but it is also FDE cerekoted. It is brand new in box and has never taken parts. If it is still listed it is still for sale so don't ask. I know the cost of lowers has dropped, but these are still selling for a mint and with quite a wait. Skip the wait and save $75. PA residents who can legally possess firearms only need reply."

Wilson Combat Match Barrel (http://shopwilsoncombat.com/Match-Grade-Barrel-9mm-for-Glock-19-402-Stainless/productinfo/647/)Stainless slide from Lone Wolf Distributors
Stainless guide rod
Dawson Precision sights with red fiber optic front
Polished and upgraded internals
If you want a gun that can pull dual duty as both a match-grade pistol and as your every day concealed carry, this is it. Legal for 3-Gun matches, IDPA’s new Compact Carry Pistol division, and probably also GSSF and USPSA. Use the same gun in competition that you carry around every day instead of splitting your training between two different weapons.
Willing to throw in an Overwatch Precision match trigger for free. Just haven’t gotten around to installing it yet. I can also install it before purchase if you want, but it shoots real sweet even with the bone stock trigger, which is why I’ve left it so far. I can also change the slide plate cover to a standard, non-engraved one if you don’t like the custom emblem on the back.
The barrel was hand-fitted to the slide and hasn’t even hardly been broken in yet. Round count 150-200 rds. max; still needs a good few hundred rounds to let the barrel hood, slide, and spring all wear in together to give you the perfect balance between tight tolerances and reliability.
Everything fits super tight, but all the moving parts slide around slick as butter. Trigger breaks sweet even in factory stock configuration (as mentioned, competition trigger and springs can be installed on request).
As long as you do your part, this gun will pattern a fist-sized group at 10-15 yards pulling the trigger about as fast as you can get your sights back on target. If you like to shoot steel, this gun will almost feels like cheating. As long as you put the red dot on the black and pull the trigger straight back, you will hear the satisfactory “TING” sound of lead hitting steel following every “BANG.” Anyone who can shoot to the mechanical limits of this gun will be doing very, very well in matches.
Comes with four Magpul G19 magazines, a Stealth Gear Onyx IWB holster, a BladeTech OWB holster, BladeTech magazine holster, Glock Sport holster, Glock Sport magazine holders.
Selling because I need the cash right now a lot more than I need another range toy. Let my poor financial forecasting be your gain."

This is the compact version, and comes with custom stippled slim grip panels, ideal for concealed carry and handling in high-stress scenarios.
You can look at all the positive reviews on this gun yourself, including the one done by M.A.C. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQYdVx7Oofo). 
Outstanding pistol, and very aesthetically pleasing to boot. Shoots like a dream. Slide moves like it’s on ball bearings. Everything about this gun exudes quality. By far one of the best out-the-box triggers I’ve personally handled.
On that note, this gun has a unique trigger mechanism dubbed “Double Action Plus,” which allows you to “decock” the hammer by simply pushing it forward. This gives your first shot a double action pull length with a single action pull weight, with all subsequent shots in SA mode. Best part: if you neither care for nor understand this feature, you can still use the gun just like you would a traditional DA/SA.
This thing’s been a safe queen ever since I bought it. Pristine condition. Often looked at/handled, but rarely ever shot, which is why I need to get rid of it. I need the cash more than I need another 9mm that gets left at home because it’s “too pretty to get dirty.""
Comes with one ten-round magazine, but you can buy low-profile 15-rounders on Lionheart’s website (just came out recently).Asking $450 o.b.o."

If you’re looking at this listing, chances are you know exactly why this is such an amazing gun. If not, here’s the skinny:
7.62x39 is plentiful and CHEAP. This gun was designed by the Czechs specifically to shoot cheap, steel-cased com bloc surplus ammo. If you do your part, it will pattern under an inch at 100 yards (yes, with 5-rd groups) with steel-cased Tula. I’m not kidding. Contrary to popular belief, 7.62x39 can be very accurate. You just need to shoot it from the right platform.
I’m a big fan of light, fast-handling rifles in wood/laminate stocks that can sling .30 caliber projectiles (see my listing for the Ruger Scout rifle for evidence of this affliction). This gun does all of the above, and looks darn great doing it.
It also has a super crisp and light set trigger, which you can stage for every shot so that the break is much lighter than the standard trigger pull (which is part of what helps the rifle get those sub-MOA groups. This doesn’t mean you get to be sloppy in applying your fundamentals).
Pictured with a Leupold 2-7x scope (which of course comes with their legendary lifetime warranty) and Galco Ching Sling (perfect setup for taking fast shots while on the move using a bolt-action platform).
If you buy the gun, I can also throw in the better part of a spam can of Tula and some brass-cased PMC for a very hefty discount. Let’s say 50% or more off retail, depending on your negotiation skills and friendliness. Also have reloading dies (brand new) for 7.62x39 as well as brass, projectiles, and other components if you can use them.
Asking $650 o.b.o. with sling and scope; $500 without."

This gun comes with 2 10 round mags and 2 grips; a black medium compact grip and an olive drab green large compact grip. The gun also comes with an Apex flat faced trigger which is FAR better than the factory trigger which has an awkward round trigger, but if you don't like the Apex trigger I do have the factory sig trigger also. This gun truly shoots fantastic and is the best running polymer pistol I have shot. The gun is of fantastic quality and is super tight. I have only owned it for a few months but I decided i ""need"" another 1911 after selling mine a while back. I will trade for a 1911 full size or camander in 9mm ONLY. mainly looking for a Ruger alloy model or a metro arms model. For the the Ruger I can add a little cash to make it fair. If you have a metro arms then I expect you to do the same. I am definitely open to others as long as they are a 1911 in 9mm. Cash price for the gun is 600 obo. If you went and bought this new with the extras I have you are looking at at least $700 after taxes."

It was made in 2015 to pay homage to the Liberty Bell B-17 plane. this rifle is the best of the best that JP has to offer in AR-10 platform. Chambered in .308/7.62 NATO 20 inch cryogeniclly frozen barrel with intergrated JP compensator. barrrel and brake are one piece, yes one solid piece of steel, side charging handle, large mass bolt carrier group, silent catch buffer spring, 2.5-3lb competition trigger which is amazing best trigger i have ever pulled. this rifle literally has the best parts JP has to offer front to back. factory cerakoted silver, red accents, and the stock and grip are od green, and the front of the barrel is black which fades to silver to mimic the oil smoke from the B-17. rifle came bare with no scope or bipod i added those. scope is a Nightforce SHV illuminated 4x14 power with JP scope mount, the bipod is a real Atlas BT35 5H all aluminum 5.5 to 10.5 inches. one of the best bipods on the market at the time. comes with original rifle box, manual, hat, stickers, JP rifle soft custom carrying case for the rifle, certifiate of authenticity signed by owner of JP, orginal box for scope, box for scopemount, box for bipod, bi pod mount everything. All the specs for this rifle can still be seen on JPs website jprifles.com. again just testing the waters here dont need to sell it just sits in the safe and never gets used. maybe shot 100 rounds through it total and i purchased it brand new. This is a mass pre-ban rifle aquired it before 7/20/2016 and have the EFA -10 to prove it. please do your research before contacting me and making an offer. I paid $4700 plus tax, shipping and transfer for just the rifle BEFORE THE BAN. Atlas Bipod was $449.00 before tax and shipping and the Nightforce was $1899.00 before everything, JP scope mount was another $250 so i have between $7500-$8000 into this gun and that was before the mass ban on all AR'S AND AK'S. so please do your research before making an offer. this is a one time chance to own one of the nicest AR-10S in mass and you will probably never see another JP AR-10 again for sale in this state let alone a limited edition 1 out of 25. all the prices i have listed have not been blown up or made up MSRP is right on JP'S website for the rifle and im sure all the other parts are easily searchable e. might be a little cheaper for the scope and bipod now being over a year ago but. NO TRADES AT THIS TIMEplease do your research before making an offer. i checked tonight before listing and didnt find one other of the 25 up for sale in the COUNTRY."
