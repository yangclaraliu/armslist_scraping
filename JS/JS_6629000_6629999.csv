I still have the box with this shotgun and it also comes with a very high end Modified Briley Ported extended choke that retails for about $100.  Browning BPS shotguns are built solid and the slide doesn't have slop side to side like some other pump shotguns on the market. Browning BPS shotguns were designed with ambidextrous features that work equally well for right or left handed people (I happen to be left-handed). These features include: bottom shell ejection, top tang safety, and a conveniently located slide release. This shotgun is in good used condition that I originally bought mainly for Turkey hunting.  I haven't hunted for Turkeys in years so I was thinking I could trade or sell this shotgun especially since Turkey season is nearly around the corner. This shotgun has a few scratches on the underside of the reciever from using a bore-snake.  I can provide more pictures to serious buyers."

Original YHM A2 rear sight. The handguard is nylatron and have a YHM tri rail that attaches to the gas block. Barrel is 11.5"" lightweight and chrome lined 1/9 twist. Muzzle break is factory ZM. comes with the ZM "" gangster"" grip (NFA rules apply) and ZM zytel grip, folding and collapsible stock, 2 extra stock hinges and a galil hinge, spare charging handle and D&H magazine (where legal) im selling it as a pistol, which is why its on a cheap Anderson lower. For the price im including the Trijicon TA01NSN, serial number 039621 (see attached email from trijicon) in a bobro engineering mount. If you're a 07/02 SOT I'll include the ZM auto sear and trip lever This is a rare and collectable AR variant. It can fire with the stock folded and is very well made and accurate. I am asking $3000 obo shipped/tracked for everything except the stripped SBR lower in the pics.

I could host us at my cabin. Leave the junk at home, but bring your rifles, shotguns, pistols, ammo, quality sites/scopes, mods, and gear and we can make a night out of it. Nothing illegal, don't want people to get the wrong idea. Just a thought, as I'm looking through the adds saying damn I need another AR, or that Aimpoint would work great, meanwhile in my back room I got a ton of gear, ammo, a few rifles and pistols just taking up space that I could part with in order to get something new and shiny.

This Savage also comes with removable magazines from the factory, this comes with 1 factory 4 round flush fitting magazine, and 2 Darkeagle Customs 10 round magazines. These are some quality aftermarket magazines, annodized aluminum and $95 each.This rifle is incrediably accurate. Much more accurate than I am. Truly a precision rig.Extras, the rifle has Nikon prostaff 5 2.5-10 power scope with a BDC reticle that could be inclused and I can include the carrying case for a bit extra.As with basically everyone here, I would like cash.

It is an RM-02 with a 6.5 moa dot. The mount is a center co-witness QD mount. The current battery has been in it for over 2 years, Trijicon says that's longer than one should last, but shes still going strong. If I was going to re-zero it to another weapon, I would swap out the battery. I bought this originally for a Glock 19mos, and it worked great on it. When I sold that pistol I kept the dot, thinking I would like it on one of my AR's. I was wrong, I realized I prefer the mini (T1 style) to the micro dot on the AR platform. So I've decided to sell it to fund getting another optic. New this would cost you over 700 for this setup. Asking 450 obo for the dot and the mount. Call or Text 502-9Six3-Two8Six9"
