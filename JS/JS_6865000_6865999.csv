171,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6865171,For Sale:  Feinwerkbau Modell 603,"Walla Walla, Washington, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Monday, May 22, 2017",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This was only used by our local ROTC Rifle Team for matches and practice.  It is in excellent if not near mint condition.  I comes with a very heavy Stainless Steel Case that is suitable for storage or shipping.  No special reporting or licenses are required.  Face to Face transaction is appreciated. The following was obtained online:  The FWB 600 included the following features:   A laminated hardwood stock with an adjustable cheekpiece and buttplate. The laminated stock was stronger at the wrist than walnut stocks used with the spring piston match rifles, and the distinctive appearance of the laminated stock announced a new era. The cheekpiece mechanism was simple yet easy to adjust. The butt-plate was vertically adjustable and could be adjusted for length using spacers.  A rifled barrel with a length of 16.6 inches. This inner barrel, however, was surrounded by a 25 long outer barrel tube that served several purposes. This arrangement allowed the loading port to be located near the rear sight, minimizing the time the slow moving pellet spent in the barrel, while allowing for a normal sight radius. The balance of the rifle could be adjusted moving (or removing) a sliding weight mounted on the outer barrel tube.  The cocking mechanism was hinged in the front with the power stroke on closing. This made it easier to cock than the Walther LGR, lessening shooter fatigue over a 60 shot match. It should be noted, however, that the cocking effort on the FWB 600 was greater than that of the spring piston match rifles.  An excellent two stage trigger, adjustable for pull weight and over-travel without tools.  A dovetail mounted match rear sight and an 18mm front globe sight. Sight riser blocks could easily be mounted to raise the line of sight.
While the FWB 600/601 ruled 10 meter match air shooting after its introduction in 1984, by 1990 Walther, Anschutz and Diana had all introduced pneumatic match air rifles with the same basic layout as the FWB 600. This stiff competition led Feinwerkbau to introduce the FWB 602 in 1995. Improvements over the FWB 600/601incorporated into the FWB 602 included:   Pull length adjustments were controlled by a hex cap screw, eliminating the need for spacers. The cheekpiece mechanism was retained by a cap screw, making it easier to remove for adjustment.  The ergonomics of the stock were improved. A three point bedding system was implemented for mounting the barreled action in the stock.  A dry fire mechanism was added.  The trigger was improved to decrease lock-time. The ability to independently adjust overall pull weight and slack weight was added.  A completely new and vastly improved rear sight was introduced. The front sight diameter was increased to 22mm. 
When introduced in 1984, the FWB 600 was billed as recoilless. But of course this was not strictly true. An 8.2 gram pellet accelerating to 175 meters per second causes an equal and opposite reaction to the 4.9 kilogram rifle. The resulting muzzle movement is nearly imperceptible for the club shooter. However, it is a different matter for the international shooter competing at the very highest level. These shooters drive technical innovation among the highly competitive precision air rifle manufacturers. Accordingly, Feinwerkbau introduced the FWB 603 in1997. The FWB 603 was very similar to the FWB 602 with the addition of a vibration dampening compensator to eliminate the miniscule muzzle movement caused by the accelerating pellet."

It’s not an arsenal rebuild like most you see, not parkerized, no arsenal rebuild stamps. There are traces of the original blue finish in the protected areas, but most of the bluing is gone. There's some minor pitting on the frame and slide, but overall nice condition for an original first year 1911. I don’t believe the barrel is original, but all other parts are correct, including the rare wood Colt factory M1911 grips. Rampant colt is in the rear and circled. I'll send more pics on request. Comes with authentic WWI lanyard loop magazine, and a factory letter from Colt archives. Price lowered to $2700 cash firm. If you find another first year M1911 in any condition for cheaper, let me know and I’ll reconsider my price.  I'll consider trades, other guns, Tahoe, Yukon. See my other ads.  I will not ship, please do not respond unless you're able to meet in person. I’ve had a couple dozen people ask me to ship to them even though my ad clearly says I won’t.

This one is an authentic Colt model 1849 pocket percussion pistol in .31 caliber. This one was shipped to Baltimore MD on March 23, 1861 according to the factory letter (the Civil War started just three weeks later on April 12, 1861!). Its very rare for there to be a factory letter for these according to the historian at Colt archives, but this is one of the rare examples of one with original shipping info. It's in incredible condition for being over 150 years old. The serial numbers on the frame, trigger guard, cylinder, and back strap all match. The barrel serial number is around 200 higher, so made the same year. Comes with wooden presentation case, antique percussion cap case, and a bag of modern lead balls. I've never fired it but it locks up fine, all trigger/hammer clicks are good, and it's been inspected by a gunsmith who concluded it would be safe to shoot, but I wouldn't shoot it myself. $1250 cash firm. I'll consider trades, other guns or a 01-06 Tahoe/Yukon. See my other adsEmail or text REDACTEDThanks"
