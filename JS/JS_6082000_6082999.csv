I then went and put a 20 moa rail to mount the scope on too, to maximize the most out of the elevation turret if needed. The scope also has a top cap bubble to make sure the gun is level before taking that shot ... I have a chart already made for they gun that is laminated and in the pouch so you can make long shots... the chart is matched with the ammo I shoot out of it which is 165 grain burger vld bullet ... I will give you the option to have the bullets I have for it already made with the load profile so you can copy them over and have the same results I had with this gun. The only reason I want to sell this gun is cause I want something that can push just a little bit bigger grain bullet without loosing a lot of volicity which is why I'm going with a 300 rum. I have taken many elk, deer and two bears with this gun from any where between 100 and 760 yards being the farthest. This is an awesome gun ... if you have any question please feel free to give me a call at REDACTED or my email , thanks!"

The Mannlicher M1895 is a bolt-action rifle, designed by Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher that used a refined version of his revolutionary straight-pull action bolt, much like the Mannlicher M1890 carbine. It was nicknamed the Ruck-Zu(rü)ck (German slang for ""back and forth"") by Austrian troops and ""Ta-Pum"" by Italian troops who even wrote a song about it during The Great War.
The M1895 is unusual in employing a straight-pull bolt action, as opposed to the more common rotating bolt-handle of other rifles. It consequently renowned for combining a high rate of fire (around 30–35 rounds per minute) with reliability and sturdiness.  Originally they were chambered for the round-nosed 8×50mmR cartridge, but almost all were rechambered to accept the more powerful spitzer 8×56mmR cartridge in the 1930s."

This gun began its life as a Colt LE6920, the gold standard for milspec rifles, being produced in the same factory using the same techniques as the ones made for the military. It has since been upgraded for improved ergonomics and controlability, however internally the gun remains composed of reliable colt parts. Instillation of the rail was done by the gun smith at West Coast Armory. I still have the original box and packaging the gun came with.I'm asking for $950, firm.

For sale is a Ruger SR22 chambered in 22LR. I have the original box, manual, and 2-10 round magazines. Gun has been cleaned after every session of use. Please respond in full sentances. I'm really crappy at reading slang/text message like emails. Please do not email me if you cannot legally own a firearm in the state of Missouri. Just because it's a private sale does not mean you can be under 21, not have a valid Missouri ID, etc. I will print out a Bill of Sale for both you and myself for our records. I'm perfectly aware that the state of Missouri does not require a bill of sale or ID when selling a firearm, but I'm not going to put you or myself in an uncomfortable situation. I don't have anything to hide and I'm sure you don't either. We wouldn't be trying to purchase/trade for a firearm if we could not legally own one, right?

I also have the factory box and manual.Please do not email me if you cannot legally own a firearm in the state of Missouri. Just because it's a private sale does not mean you can be under 21, not have a valid Missouri ID, etc. I will print out a Bill of Sale for both you and myself for our records. I'm perfectly aware that the state of Missouri does not require a bill of sale or ID when selling a firearm, but I'm not going to put you or myself in an uncomfortable situation. I don't have anything to hide, and I'm sure you don't either. We wouldn't be trying to purchase/trade for a firearm if we could not legally own one, right?
