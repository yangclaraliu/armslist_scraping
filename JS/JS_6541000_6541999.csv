It's made for a S&W SW40ve which also fits the SW9VE.    It should also fit the newer replacement of those three SD9VE and SD40VE.   I have heard it should also fit glock 19 size guns too but haven't tried.  This is the natural leather with combat cut.   It has very low usage on it you can tell because the leather isn't discolored.      There's nothing wrong with it I just sold the gun.

This one comes with the ""concealment wing"", which pulls the grip into the body more snugly, to minimize ""printing"". If you do not want the concealment wing, you can remove it...shorted screws come with the purchase to replace the longer ones on the wing. I had this holster for about 3 weeks, wearing it daily with my P320c. I am selling the holster because I sold the gun. With shipping, I paid $52.00. Price is $45.00.

Non matching bolt-but firearm operates and headspaces just fine. I've been shooting it for a couple years. Always use ballistol wash at range after firing corrosive ammo. Bore is dark, but strong rifling. Nice patina on steel, Chu wood stock . When I first got it, I tore down, removed all cosmoline from stock and steel, hand rubbed the wood with BLO. People who don't know always ask if its an M1 when they see stock coloring. No import stamp, not counter bored.
This rifle is a bit better than typical condition for a T53, maybe because I tried to take care of it. Bayonet and sling included. I also have the metal butplate, but your shoulder may appreciate the recoil pad I put on.  This thing always attracts attention at the range with its fireballs and noise.  I've babied it since I had it and it is one of my favorites to shoot, but I need to get the houses heat fixed. I'll miss it...but ya gotta do what you gotta do....
