All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro 9 design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro 9 includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory. Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro 9 pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.Learn more at KimberAmerica.com"

For sale is a Kodabow Alpha Strike. 125 lb limbs. Bought it off of a friend who was the original owner. It comes with the Mfo sight, an ergonomic hand grip that is very comfortable, raised cheek piece, and cocking accessory. It cocks more like an Excalibur now with this fixture. I prefer this because you don't have to collapse the butt stock to cock the bow in this configuration. Also includes all the normal accessories, cocking rope, stringing tool, decocking tool (not shown), instruction manual, DVD, allen wrenches and six kodabow bolts 20"" or 18"" your choice (not shown) and factory test target. Also included is a spare riser. It is fitted with 200 lb Bravo Zulu limbs. One limb has a hairline fracture at the attach point to the riser. Chuck at Kodabow was asked about this and he said it would be fine, just shoot it. He logic is that the fracture is running in the same direction as the split limbs. If the fracture was running perpendicular then it would be a problem. I've shot this riser and it does fine. But I'm throwing in these limbs for free. I just wanted to have full disclosure. So, a like new Alpha Strike bow, Mfo Sight with rangefinder, ergonomic grip, cheek riser, stringing tool, cocking tool, decocking took, instructions, DVD, 6 bolts with your choice of length and a spare riser. Sorry no trades. I accept PayPal (friend or +3.5%) and US Postal Money Orders only. I can provide addition feedback if needed. Please deal by PM or Email.Pics show complete bow, spare riser and spare riser limbs."

The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it. Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance. Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory®’s SAINT™ represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT™. When it comes time to defend your legacy, turn to the SAINT. It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be. The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT™ is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT™ from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT™ features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT™ will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT™ features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT™ is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT™ is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT™ includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT™ uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions.

I bought it last week to conceal carry it, but changed my mind. It has never been fired. It came with two 12 rd magazines, a holster, and SigLite night sights. Because of the night sights, it will be more expensive than the conventional plain Jane P320 SC.The P320 just got adopted by the army, and has the most crisp trigger of all striker fired handguns - I can attest to that. It beats Glock 19 hands down. So if you want the best striker fired handgun on the market today, this is it.I bought it for $648 with tax, and I am letting it go for $559. I am not interested in any trades, and I am firm on the price. Please call or text REDACTED if interested. If you see this ad, then it is still available."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.  Melonite Nitriding treatment turns a standard chrome moly steel barrel into a very slick, hard and corrosion resistant barrel. Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.      Item #: 162W8LBBL-MLMN"

These aren’t firearms and don’t hold their value like firearms; so I’m not looking to pay new prices for used air rifles. I have seen a couple of used rifles locally, but they don’t include a pump or a tank; these items are a must if I’m buying used. I’m looking for a complete package.I have cash or I can trade with firearms. Purchase or trade would have to be done within a reasonable distance from the Murfreesboro area.

Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship. Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

It comes with a Bushnell Banner 3-9x40 scope (duplex reticle) and rings already mounted. I bought this rifle new in 2009 and am the original owner. It is in very good condition with little to no wear on the exterior and light normal wear on the bolt. It has only fired about 250 rounds in its life and has plenty left to give. I am selling it because I got a good deal on a semi auto .308.
 
This rifle has a nice adjustable trigger that breaks very crisp with almost no take up and a light pull. This was included in the big recall on model 700 triggers but I sent it in to have it fixed so you won’t have to worry about accidental discharges when you let off the safety. It also has the hinged floorplate so unloading is easy unlike the ADL varients. The supercell recoil pad is everything they say it is and my wife has shot it without pain.

It has had 80 rounds of supersonic ball ammo through it, but I have not fired subsonic though it. This would be ideal for someone that had or bought a 5.56 upper as they can swap the uppers easily to have a gun that fires two calibers.I originally wanted an AK, but I wanted something small, light, and customizable so I figired an AR pistol chambered in .300 blk would be better, but I still want the AK so I'd like to sale or trade this to get an AK or a snubby revolver. Really looking for a revolver right now and not looking for an AK since I carry in the car or on my person more than I shoot. I paid just over $900 after taxes, shipping, and FFL fees, so I feel $750 is a great price and trade value for a gun in great condition."
