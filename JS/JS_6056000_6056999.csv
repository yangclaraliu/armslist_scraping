The barrel was removed. Then The action was ""blueprinted"" an operation where you rut the threads on the inside of the receiver and recut them to tighter tolerances than the factory. The receiver face then faced off so the barrel to receiver mating surfaces are perfectly aligned for accuracy. And the bolt lugs lapped to the bolt face is aligned perfectly with the breech allowing the case to be seated propetly in the chamber. Next a Schillen 1:10 barrel was threaded to match the receiver, had the chamber cut to .308 Winchester, and cut to length at 20 inches and had added a recessed 45 degree crown added. Finally the new barreled action was bead blasted and blued after a 320 polish to remove any imperfections. The next step was shaping the walnut stock from a blank and adding the ebony forend tip and the recoil pad.--All of the work to this rifle was done while I was at the Colorado School of Trades for Gunsmithing.

In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro 9 design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity.Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro 9 pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance..For any question and Bidding Contact the seller. Text...5304189079."

All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro 9 design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity.Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro 9 pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance..For any question and Bidding Contact the seller. Text...5304189079."

If you're unfamiliar with nitride barrels, read below. It is a barrel finish that makes it virtually corrosion proof. Also mounted is a $200 Nikon Inline BDC scope. I only shot this 5 times and cleaned it thoroughly the same day. I just haven't had the time to pursue muzzleloading like I had hoped - absolutely nothing wrong with this gun. For asking price, I'll throw in Triple 7 pellets and bullets, cleaning kit, accessories, and case. Everything you need to get started next week!$525 (this is a $575 combo with the scope, plus $100 in all the accessories you need to get started. $675 total in this package)From the manufacturer:The CVA™ Optima V2 PR2023NIKC combo package comes with a 3-9x40mm bore sighted Camo Nikon® Inline XR™ Scope and a durable 48"" rifle case. The Inline XR™ scope was designed especially for muzzleloaders, making 300-yard shots a reality for hunters shooting today’s increasingly accurate muzzleloaders. Featuring the patented BDC 300 reticle, the Nikon APG™ Camo Inline XR 3-9x40mm Scope offers five inches of constant eye relief throughout the magnification range, precision 1/4–MOA adjustments with Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets, quick focus eyepiece and fully multicoated optics for maximum light transmission.The CVA Optima V2 Package comes with a durable and compact camo stock. While the new Optima V2 shares the name of its popular predecessor, this second version gun has been re-designed with many new features. Modeled after CVA’s top-of-the-line Accura V2, the Optima V2 features the same trigger-guard with actuated breeching lever, internal parts, and neutral center-of-gravity trigger. This muzzleloader also features CVA’s Quick Release Breech Plug (QRBP), which is easily removed with your fingers, NO tools required. The Optima V2’s 100% ambidextrous stock, and CrushZone recoil pad make this gun one of the most comfortable you will ever shoot. The Optima has more quality features than any other muzzleloading rifle in its price range. Equipped with a 26” stainless steel barrel, the Optima V2 is easy to maneuver in the tree stand or in tight spots and comfortable to carry in the mountains. The V2 comes standard with a DuraSight® DEAD-ON™ one-piece scope mount and CVA’s solid aluminum PalmSaver Ramrod. When compared to its competitors, the Optima V2 muzzleloader includes many features you won’t find anywhere else for the price.The rifle features a Nitride-treated 416 Stainless Steel barrel, making it the closest thing to a “corrosion-proof” muzzleloader that has ever been developed. The Nitride finish technology, known as Salt Bath Nitride, is used to treat the barrel and offers exceptional wear resistance, unparalleled corrosion resistance in a scratch resistant, uniform black color. Already available in military applications, the nitride process hardens the outer layer of steel, making it both more durable and corrosion-resistant than chrome, which was previously the highest standard in bore-toughening techniques. Unlike exterior ceramic coatings, the nitride process penetrates both the inside and outside of the barrel, and can withstand thousands of shots. Best of all, Nitride is self-lubricating, thus eliminating the need to add oil to your rifle for an increase in muzzleloader velocities and greater ease in reloading follow-up shots."

Curtis E. LeMay .45 ACP semi automatic pistol. Made out of aircraft grade stainless steel with wooden grip plates. EXCELLENT CONDITION!   *SERIAL #: BF03111C - ONLY 361 GENERAL CURTIS E. LEMAY MODELS WERE MANUFACTURED AND THIS ONE WAS ONE OF THE LAST ONES MANUFACTURED WITH SERIAL # BF03114C BEING THE LAST.   THE CURTIS E. LeMAY 4-STAR PISTOLS In 1984, Randall expanded its line with the introduction of a true compact .45 auto, which was designed by Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay. Among his many accomplishments, LeMay had been responsible for establishing the Air Force’s Marksmanship Training Unit.   When LeMay created his pistol design, he intended it to be used by members of the Strategic Air Force Command. The general initially tried to have the diminutive .45 produced by Colt. But, that never occurred. As it happened, Art Hanke, who was the head of manufacturing and engineering for Randall, was a personal friend of General LeMay. It was through this liaison that Randall Firearms Company came to produce the LeMay model line of pistols.   First of the LeMay pistols was the A311. It sported a 4.25-inch, 10 groove barrel. The slide had a round top and a fixed rear sight. The handle and magazine were shortened by a half-inch, limiting the magazine to six rounds. Overall weight was 35 ounces. Exclusive to the LeMay models were factory-squared trigger guards.   In all, 361 of the Model A311 pistols were made in a serial number range of RF02011C through RF03114C. The first A311 was made on March 1, 1984, and production of that model ended on October 25, 1984."

770,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6056770,For Sale/Trade:  Civil War Soldier Marked Musket!,"Spartanburg, Greenville, South Carolina","$ 1,500","Listed On: Wednesday, November 23, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Up for sale is a very unique and great Civil War militaria piece. Overall the metal shows armory bright, as is correct, the lock plate having clear Springfield 1853 marks at rear and the Springfield eagle/US forward. Lock plate and hammer are smooth with smokey gray over silver. The barrel is generally a tad lighter silver/gray with an overlay of that powdery dark gray tiny dimpling from exposure and use, but with clear V/P/eagle proofs and clear 1854 date on the breechplug tang. The mismatched dates are TOTALLY CORRECT on a ""rifled and sighted"" model 1842. The guns were disassembled and the parts sorted without regard to which gun they came off of.
What makes this musket so interesting are the added markings put on by the soldier. Four small circles have been stamped around a central oval just forward of the bolster on the top of their barrel. This may be a rough representation of a Catholic symbol based on Jesus in a central circle surrounded by four other circles containing crosses and two human figures in each. Further evidence of religious symbolism is a clearly carved Christian cross on the left side flat, This cross has a Celtic flavor with half a circle incised above the cross arms. The traditional Celtic cross bears a complete circle, but this seems very close. The initials “GS” and “GHS” next to a “50 M..” have been deeply carved on the underside near the triggerguard, another “G” to rear of the lock.Best research narrows this down to either Massachusetts or Missouri (only two ""M"" states with at least 50 regiments of infantry). The likely owner in my opinion is George H. Spofford a 28 year old shoe cutter from Georgetown, Mass. He enlisted in the 50th Mass 9/19/62 and served his entire term of service until 8/24/63 when the entire regiment was mustered out of service. He then rejoined the 17th Unattached Company of infantry and served again from late 1864 through June of 1865. I believe the Catholic and Celtic symbols on the gun are more likely done by someone from the densely Catholic state of Massachusetts...
Asking $1500, or will trade for a M1917 revolver. This is your rare chance to have a Civil War musket with provenance. Additional pictures available upon request. Period-correct bayonet included."

I'm selling my BCM factory complete Recce 14 KMR ELW with a bunch of extras and upgrades. It is less than a year old with approximately 1000 rounds through it without any malfunctions or stoppages. It has nothing but incredibly accurate and reliable for me. Mechanically and structurally it is 100% with only cosmetic wear. If you were to cerakote it, it would look brand new. The barrel is a 14.5"" 5.56 BCM contoured lightweight barrel with a Surefire Socom muzzle break professionally pinned and welded to the muzzle. The lower, upper, BCG, barrel, and original alloy 13"" KMR rail are all BCM and as a factory complete it includes BCM's lifetime warranty. Also includes an Aimpoint T2, in almost new condition, sitting in a Seekins lower 1/3 fixed mount. Trigger has been upgraded to a Velocity 3lb single stage drop-in trigger. Sights are steel Magpul MBUS Pros. Includes a WML 200 lumens weapon light, Noveske/Magpul short throw safety, Magpul BAD lever, matching Grey Magpul K2+ grip and SL stock, VTAC grey wide padded sling, BCM KAG and rail covers, and ODIN XMR 2 extended mag release. As shown it weighs about 6.5lbs and includes everything you could ever need.More pictures available upon request. If you were to assemble this rifle yourself brand new you will spend over $3,000. I'm asking $2100 or will trade for a stock flat dark earth FN SCAR 16 plus a little cash on my end. I'm local in Denver, CO or will ship to your FFL. Thanks."
