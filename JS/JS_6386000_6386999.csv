The pistol is made from stainless steel, which has a polished finish on the flat surfaces and bead-blasted matte finish on the rounded areas. The 5 inch barrel is match grade and made from stainless steel. The slide features slanted serrations on the rear only. The mainspring housing is the original arched style found on GI issue 1911-A1s, but it includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol also has a standard spur hammer and standard grip safety. The single-sided, non-extended thumb safety and short military combat trigger are true to the original 1911-A1 design. The combat 3-Dot sights are fixed, and the ejection port is lowered and flared.

I have a Girsan Beretta 96 clone in 40 caliber. It's being imported by Chiappa so they only have their name and nothing else to do with it. This is an exact copy the 96. Part for part the same as Berreta. All magazines still work down to the firing pin. These Turkish guns are really well made. I'm off loading guns I don't shoot and only had two range trips with this pistol. Comes with 2 Mecgar mags which are great quality as well. Thing is way accurate and recoil is light due to the full metal frame. Thanks for looking.

I only took it to the range on one occasion and fired approximately 50 rounds. Traveling as much as I have I never made enough opportunities to take it to the range again, and that is why it hasn't been fired a ton. There has never been any damages or malfunctions with this weapon. I love this handgun due to its handling and weight distribution when firing. Again, I just don't have the time to show it proper love.   My foremost concern with the private sale of this weapon is that the person purchasing this gun is capable of doing so legally. Therefore, I prefer to sell only to those interested that have a valid carry permit. I understand that a permit isn't required, so at the very least there will be a bill of sale involved with this transaction. As far as meeting location...I am only interested in meeting in the vicinity of a law enforcement agency at an agreed upon meeting place.

I have anoriginal PVS-7B night vision goggles. I also have an actual issued magnifier that is extremely rare. These alone sell for $1000-1500... this is not the cheap $300 magnifier u can get online, this is the real deal with actual handwritten issued numbers on it. I also have an original manual with everything in it from basic functions to how to destroy it incase of enemy capture. I have the original green carry bag and the original case they used to carry it in planes that kept it pressurized. A few extra gadgets i have are some night vision beacons that attach to a D battery and can only be seen by night vision, and some headwear mounts. The beacons are great because u can put them on dogs if u hog hunt or you can set them out as markers to tell distances. Or you can put them on buddies so u can all see eachother. The night vision alone sells for $3500 brand new. The magnifiers and extras add another 1500. Just make me an offer and lets sell this in a cash deal tonight.Everything youre getting here is in great shape and is original. Feel free to text me at any time at REDACTEDI am happy to try to answer any questions and to send more pictures if u ask for specific pictures. I didnt list an asking price because i don't have one. I explained what the items are worth new and i don't expect retail value. With that said, all reasonable offers are appreciated and considered.

Consecutive numbers above 200 are not true sets. The finish on both is exceptional and they rate 99%+. When you look at the cylinder faces you can see that they have had very little use. About the only way they could be improved on is if they were truly factory fired only. The grips are in the same excellent condition as the guns themselves. The case is in good condition with a few light storage marks. If you have been on the hunt for a true cased set you will be well pleased with these.

Ammo has some discoloration as pictured due to casings being greased up (for belted RPD). Ammo was in a sealed can on belts. Fired one round to test it out and its functioning ammo. This isn't really ammo you take to the range and plink with. Really meant for hunting and for higher end 7.62 firearms.

The bolt has been modified to have a Remington style bolt handle.   2. It has a Bushnell 4-12 power scope on it, with see thru scope mounts.     3. The 1909 Argentine action has a high chrome content, and has been polished to a high polish. The 1909 Argentine is highly prized for building custom Mausers.   4. The 23 1/2"" barrel, which has less than 200 rounds thru it, is a custom barrel, was installed by a gunsmith (name available on request) that builds custom rifles, and was just recently professionally repainted with a matte black finish, and the finish is mint.   5. Both stocks have roughly 20 coats of high gloss polyurethane coating it, hand sanded between each coat. The walnut stock was taken off another gun and fitted to this one when I decided to sell it.  The birch laminated stock is a Boyds Brothers stock that I bought especially for this gun when I built it. You pick the stock you want – 1 stock ONLY is for sale.   6. The leather sling shown in the photo is included.
 I will ship only to an FFL. The sale is final, no returns. No sales outside the USA. No sales to Hawaii, New York, or California. I accept US Postal money orders only, no checks or credit cards. All questions will be answered if accompanied by your name and telephone number. If you don’t include those, you are a spammer and I will delete your e-mail without a reply.  More photos available on request.  Buyer pays $50 shipping via FEDEX to the continental USA, and it will be well padded. Shipping to Alaska will be as quoted to me by the carrier. I will ship the next business day after payment receipt, insured w/ tracking, and will forward you the tracking information. Buy with confidence, as I have a 100% positive feedback record on over 450 transactions on E-bay, User ID furnished on request.  IF YOU E-MAIL ME, INCLUDE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME AND A VERIFIABLE PHONE NUMBER, OTHERWISE I WILL CORRECTLY ASSUME YOU ARE A SPAMMER, AND WILL DELETE YOUR E-MAIL.
