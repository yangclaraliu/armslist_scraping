I'm not the original owner, and when I received her she seemed as if she was barely shot. The previous owner had installed a TacStar side saddle that I removed under the suspicion the side saddle was throwing the weight off causing cycling issues which is common with this model shotgun because they're inertia driven systems. That being said when I received it, I wasted no time to see if that was the problem and I removed it. It cycles flawlessly, the shotgun itself is in immaculate condition (See Photos).The shotgun comes with a handful of accessories & upgradesAccessories & Upgrades Include:Benelli Choke Tube (Steel Shot OK-IC)Benelli Choke Wrench Tool - $20.50Benelli Intercept Gun Case - $55.99G&G Rear Sling Mount - $30.00G&G Shotgun Magazine Follower - $28.50G&G Tactical Charging Handle - $26.00Lancer System Shotgun Extension Clamp (One Rail) - $39.99Lancer System Shotgun Tube Extension +4 - $89.99Original ForendOriginal Tube Extension W/ Clamp, Follower, Slingmount & SpringSpecter 6 Round Shotshell Loop Enhanced Universal Fit SOP 3 Point Sling - $43.20Surefire Model 617FA Flashlight Forend W/ Z10 Switch Blocker  - $200.00TacStar Side Saddle - $29.99Grand Total - $564.16"

The stock was re-worked first:  Its Lenghth of pull has been shortend by about 1.5"". Then it was hand worked by a local woodworker to look like it should. With the added benefit of smoothing it and the forend out and taking down any stock sharp edges that Rem left behind. Then, it and the forend were both stripped, blended again, and stained antique gray.   The Internals:  The internals were all cleaned, deburred, and polished up.  The mag follower is stock, but was also deburred and rounded so it moves smoothly with no hang ups.   Exterior of Shotgun and Interior Receiver:  The whole exterior of the shotgun, as-well-as, the interior of the receiver has been coated with KG-2400 Executive Gray colored coating. It also aids in lubricity because the coating is self lunricating. So, it requires much less oil and is easier to clean.  The whole shotgun is weatherproof at this point.   Misc:A +3 mag extension and clamp wasadded. Also, a Blackhawk! Receiver mounted single point sling point was installed.  It can be used single or double with a sling point up on the mag tube."

The 7825 stands for how many cubic inches of space they have. These packs are huge and well balanced. Internal frame. Look up any Kelty site or forum for reviews and specs. They are the light olive green models. Accomodate pals and molle gear. The side bags on outer shell can be removed as well as the top which can be a stand alone fanny pack or even a shoulder pack. I was looking to do a lonf distance expedition hike and we planned on using these. Never got around to it and age and health issues now prevent it. Check out youtube videos and reviews of these. If you know how to properly fit an internal frame to yourself (which these are adjustable) and know how to properly load a pack with gear, these can hold an impressive amount comfortably. These would also make excellent long range bug out bags. The best average price of these that I can find are around the 340$-350$ range at the moment. I am selling these for 275$ each. They have never been used on a hike and show it. They look just as good as the day I bought them.I am not shipping these and not going to hold on to them for weeks or such nonsense to pick up. Selling first come first serve. For the product and being a Kelty I do expect these to be around long. So dont call or text asking if I ship or to hold the answer will be no.Call or text before 9pm est please. ThanksREDACTED"

As the ultimate refinement of the AR-15 form, the SAINT combines innovations like the Accu-Tite receiver mating system with the relentless execution of core features. The SAINT's flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that's why the SAINT features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won't feel it. Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance. Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory's SAINT represents the next generation of America's personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it'll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT. When it comes time to defend your legacy, turn to the SAINT. It's the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be. The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That's why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It's shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you'll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility the SAINT will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it's designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you'll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that's why the SAINT uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions. The SAINT is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory's low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with half minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation. The bottom line? When it's time to protect and defend, trust the SAINT.
