This is a great lightweight tactical weapon. Excellent for home defense or social break down, especially for those among us who are smaller like some women and younger shooters! Great for close in situations like apartments or condos due to less over penetration like a high powered 12 gauge guns, rifles or powerful handguns. (We don’t want to be shooting innocent bystanders or our neighbors – right?!) Think about this, a 3” Remington Home Defense shell can send 5 of .41 caliper lead balls (10.4 mm) down range at 1125 FPS. One pull of the trigger and five 9mm sized lead bullets are going to hit your target! And at the range it does just that. It also likes 3” #4 shot and many other different loads. It would be your choice. That is why I originally got it for my frail little woman. Compared to her 15 round 9mm pistol, this would shoot the same amount of lead with 3 trigger pulls vs. 15 trigger pulls of the pistol!

Lone Wolf R&D LLC proudly introduces the TimberWolf Series Replacement Frame.
If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.  It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system. Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both. This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: G/19,23,32,38."

The Predator's Hybrid Match Chamber has tighter tolerances than a 5.56 NATO chamber for enhanced accuracy potential, while still retaining the ability to safely use both commercial and military surplus ammunition. The Predator features a rifle length Free Floating Tube Handguard with cooling slots for a comfortable off-hand grip that also removes accuracy-robbing influences from interfering with the barrel's harmonics upon firing. Accuracy is further emphasized by the barrel's 11 degree target crown at the muzzle."

According to my research, this indicates it has seen little use, due to not having to change out to a longer bolt head after continuous use and the headspace widening. Safety lever. Rear flip up sights out to 800 yards. Asking $550 OBO. Includes a sling. Also including about 40 rounds of .303 as well. Some handloads, some factory. Will consider trades for the right firearm as well. Let me know if your interested. Thanks for your consideration"

I purchased the Kimber new and have carried it quite a bit but fired it little. Thankfully I never needed to use it for self-defense, so the occassional trip to the range for practice was all. I would say it has about 100 rounds through it and there have been no issues. It has a small amount of muzzle wear from carrying, but is in very good condition. It has burl maple grips on it and comes with the original rubber grips, the included mag and a +1 extended mag. It also comes with a De Santis pocket holster, Kimber zip case, and the original box.
   The Glock is one of the most accurate guns I have owned, and I'm sad to see it go. It comes with a flush mag, an extended mag, and a 15rd extended mag with Xgrip. It has night sights and also comes with a De Santis IWB adjustable holster and the original box.  
   I am selling these pistols for $400 each, and if someone purchases both i'll let them go for $750. I can meet in the middle depending on the distance, and the sale must be face to face. Texas DL required and CHL preferred. Thanks for looking!"

They are extremely well made, and absolutely gorgeous. I keep trying to get into the 1911 lifestyle, but I guess it's just not meant to be. I'm just not a fan of grip safeties and single stack firearms apparently.The Guardian has an anodized aluminum bobtail frame, commander length-slide, and an aluminum mainspring housing to help reduce printing when carrying concealed and make it comfortable enough for full-time carry. It also has Dan Wessons amazing Duty Black finish that will take some serious punishment before showing wear. This is in UNFIRED and has never been carried. Not a scratch on her. This is the night sight model, and comes with 6 magazines, Below I'll list everything and how much it all cost, I feel that's important for really anything over valued at over $1000.- Unfired Dan Wesson Guardian 1911 W/Night Sights ($1400-$1500)- 1 Dan Wesson Mag- Factory box, papers, lock, etc- Wilson Combat 8 Round Mag ($40)- Wilson Combat 7 Round Mag ($40)- Kimber 7 Round Mag ($40)- Ruger 7 Round Mag ($40)- Unknown 7 Round Mag ($40)Asking $1400 for everything. These sell for $1400-$1500 unfired just the gun, but you also get 5 extra mags worth aboutt $40 a piece ($200) at no extra charge. Both Wilson mags have also been upgraded with low profile steel Wilson Combat pase pads which cost me about $40 total. This is a good deal, it's priced to sell..something this nice needs a good home and to not just sit in my safe collecting dust.**I also have 100 rounds of Federal HST 230gr HP defense ammo, and 300 rounds of Sellier & Bellot 230gr FMJ I'll throw in for an extra $160 which is a bit less than I paid for it. I prefer cash, but will possibly consider trade offers. Just please no 1911's, .45's, or 40's. I'm trying to not collect stuff I don't want/know I'll eventually get bored of and sell.Trades I'm interested: Ruger 10/22 Takedown w/Backpack and cash, IWI X95, CZ Scorpion Evo Carbine, SIG MPX, SIG MCX, SIG 556 Rifle, Steyr AUG, .308 PTR, DSA FAL, Mini 14 or Mini 30, Vector in 9mm or .45, or other 5.56/9mm rifles/carbines that are not AR-15's, with cash or extras to even it up. Would also consider Benelli M2 12ga, FN SLP 12ga, or other 12 gauge defense/tacitcal oriented semi auto shotguns. Also interested in 9mm handguns.I'll consider all other offers, the worst I can do is say no thank you! Located in Northville, willing to drive a bit but nothing crazy far.

735,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6617735,"For Sale:  M1 Garand, WW2 correct, good barrel","Fayetteville, Fayetteville, North Carolina","$ 1,450","Listed On: Tuesday, March 28, 2017",Rifles,Springfield                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"U.S. Rifle, Cal. .30 M1, Springfield Armory, 3360033           
This rifle is an 80% parts correct WW2 M1 Garand. This rifle is a valuable combination of historic WW2 period rifle and accurate shooter - ready for service rifle competitions. It has a solid and tight stock, and new barrel installed at Springfield Armory at the end of its military service.
This rifle, serial number 3360033, first built to fight World War Two in late 1944 at the National Armory in Springfield Massachusetts (not the same as the modern gun company of the same name). The Springfield Armory came out with the highest quality M1 Rifles every year since they started making them in 1937.
This rifle, as probably 98% of all M1s in existence today, has been rebuilt at a government armory. This one was rebuilt in 1965 and bears the mark “SA” made in electric pencil on the receiver under the wood to prove it. This is back when rifles were works of art; not Legos that are simply snapped together (M4s). Even though this rifle has been rebuilt it is still a nearly parts correct rifle! For it’s serial number range it has the correct manufacture – style - marking on trigger group and bolt, and correct WW2 gas lock. The op-rod is a Springfield style from even earlier in WW2 than the rifle. It has a correct WW2 sight cover. The only significant parts not from WW2 are the rear sight mechanisms and barrel.
You can see plenty of dings in the wood. This rifle may or may not have seen oversees service but if you have spent one day in the military or even just seen a war movie, you know that a wooden rifle stock would get banged up. However, this wood is solid, it has no structural damage and fits the rifle tight. This stock has a rich red color in the walnut as well as the typical dings from service in the field. I have refinished a couple old U.S. Military rifle stocks and with a little de-greaser, fine steel wool, and a fresh coat of linseed oil (the original finish) the walnut stock will look brand new (if that is the look you want).
I could not get a good photo of the rifling, but it is there! The barrel has been used but is in excellent condition. With a gauge the muzzle reads a 1+ and the throat reads a 2 – that means nearly new. The finish is Parkerization (as all M1s are) and it is in good condition. The Gas Cylinder is stainless steel (as they all were) and for that reason it is painted. Springfield didn't have a good high temperature finish for stainless steel so they experimented with many kinds of black coatings.
Included in this deal is an empty eight round enblock clip, and a rifle case specially made for M1s by CMP.
Why am I selling it? Well, it takes two hands to shoot a rifle like this, and there is another rifle I would rather put in my hands.
 
Remember, General Patton called the M1 the, ""Greatest Battle implement ever devised.""
 
            ""This is my M1 Garand Rifle, there are many like it, but this one is mine.""
           
Email me for more photos, I also have a photo of a shot grouping (no accuracy guarantees for the rifle)
            Sorry, not interested in trades.
            I will ship from and to an FFL."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016+ model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.FEATURESAmbidextrous Safety SelectorAmbidextrous Magazine ReleaseAmbidextrous(Reversible) Non-Reciprocating Charging HandleIntegrated Sling MountsPicatinny Rails at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o-clock7.7"" Cold Hammer Forged Barrel, 18x1 and 1/2x28 Muzzle ThreadsFiber Reinforced Polymer Receiver, Handguard and GripLow Profile Rail Mounted, Adjustable 4-aperture rear SightLow Profile Rail Mounted, Adjustable Post Front Sight10, 20 and 30-round Magazines AvailableINCLUDED2 x 10-round Magazines>Picatinny Rail Mounted HandstopBore-snakeCable LockOwners Manual"

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016+ model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.FEATURESAmbidextrous Safety SelectorAmbidextrous Magazine ReleaseAmbidextrous(Reversible) Non-Reciprocating Charging HandleIntegrated Sling MountsPicatinny Rails at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o-clock7.7"" Cold Hammer Forged Barrel, 18x1 and 1/2x28 Muzzle ThreadsFiber Reinforced Polymer Receiver, Handguard and GripLow Profile Rail Mounted, Adjustable 4-aperture rear SightLow Profile Rail Mounted, Adjustable Post Front Sight10, 20 and 30-round Magazines AvailableINCLUDED2 x 20-round MagazinesPicatinny Rail Mounted HandstopBore-snake>Cable LockOwners Manual"
