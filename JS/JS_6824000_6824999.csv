Thanks for understanding it just helps us cut to the chase and keeps my email volume under control.  Cash only and pick up in Hyde Park only please.  The only reason I'm selling this setup is b/c my new Pulsar thermal riflescope is useable in daylight conditions as well so no need for separate scopes.  Purchased everything brand new in December 2016 for a new 308AR dedicated to slaying hogs at night so only a few months of use. Sidebar:  Vortex offers full warranty coverage for life of the optic regardless of ownership stream don't even need to show a receipt so why buy new?  This was my first Vortex optic and while I still have a place in my stable for Zeiss I will own Vortex again for sure.  I'd put the low light capability of this scope well above Nikon, on par with Leupold and not quite as good as Zeiss for a point of reference.  I took this out to Manatee Gun and Archery and the 600 yard 10"" gong was worn out when I left with PMC 147g.  This is the most magnification I've ever owned at 16x, but that is way overkill for 600 yards and 10"" it's not necessary off a bench.  I didn't go out to 1000, but this would be easily doable on human size IDPA's at 1000.  The 10"" at 1000 might be tougher on a hot day with mirages.  - Vortex Diamondback HP 4-16x42 - Second focal plane BDC reticle.  Box, manual, sun shade, bungee covers and soft cloth.  Full warranty applies to you just as it did for me for life.- Vortex Defender flip covers for both eye piece and objective with lifetime warranty.- Burris PEPR cantilever mount for 1"" tubes and objective lenses up to 44mm.  2 sets of ring tops a smooth(installed) and picatinny for mounting whatever you'd like(green light).  Also comes with a spare set of rail nuts.  - 2000 lumen green light with adjustable objective zoom and picatinny rail adapter.  This light takes both regular and rechargeable AAA's(just put a fresh set of batts in).Thanks"

By maintaining quality control standards unheard of in the industry, the UHR delivers a level of accuracy formerly only available from high-end custom rifle gunsmiths.The UHR allows the hunter to realize the full potential of the components in their rifle system. By guaranteeing that the rifle itself is very accurate, the only variables left in the system are the optics, ammo and ability of the hunter. Keeping in mind the UHR is the foundation of a shooting system capable of extreme precision, a new scope mounting system is included with the rifle that matches the abilities of the rifle. When combined with quality ammunition, optics and practice, the UHR can significantly extend your range.Quality ammunition is one piece of the precision puzzle. Development of the rifle was done with DRT 200 gr. jacketed frangible rounds, and 165/168 gr. Hornady SST and Interlock bullets are a favorite as well.The Ultimate Hunting Rifle is also an excellent complement to a safari hunter’s dangerous game gun, allowing surgical shot placement on plains game.The UHR includes a set of 30mm aluminum rings precision machined to precisely align the scope and bore."

I have built this and took it to the range with match ammo to sight it in.  The Zero is set at 50/200 and the BDC reticle is set up this way as well. THAT IS THE ONLY TIME IT HAS BEEN SHOT.  All parts are built and installed to spec. All screws, fasteners and springs are in spec.  Bolts are torqued to proper weight.
This build is flawless, mint condition, no scratches or blemishes.  It has a mid-length gas system and a H1 Buffer.  All you have to do is buy, wait to receive, and shoot.  Everything has been done to get her ready to fight/compete.
The parts list below will show that I have approximately $2,000 into the AR, but you can have the whole package for $1,500 (SHIPPING INCLUDED TO YOUR FFL)
If you have any other questions please ask.  If you are local we can meet up OR I can ship to your local FFL.
I will accept PAYPAL GIFT or ADD 3% but no mention of firearm sale within paypal.  Again I HATE to sell this but I don’t have a choice right now.
ALSO:  IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE SCOPE OR THE MOUNT JUST LET ME KNOW AND WE CAN TAKE THOSE OFF.  OTHER THAN THAT IM NOT INTERESTED IN PIECING ANYTHING ELSE OFF AT THIS TIME UNLESS IT IS THE MAJORITY OF THE GUN PARTS.. EITHER WAY, IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN SOME PIECES (BARREL, BCG, SCOPE, MOUNT, ETC.) LET ME KNOW AND MAYBE WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT.

I dont know why the corrosive element in the primers scares some people, its in there for a reason, reliability in the worst conditions imaginable. Kalashnikovs were designed to shoot this ammo and are chrome plated in certain areas for this reason. No extra cleaning is needed with this ammo, and honestly I find it to be cleaner and much higher quality than all commercial 5.45.
