Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface.
The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.
The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.
The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.
The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.
The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.
Includes one 30-round Magpul® PMAG® magazine."

It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification.

This truck is for repair or parts only, it will not pass inspection until the brakes are fixed.Engine runs strong, 4wd works great, transmission is good, everything that makes it GO works good. Has a heavy duty towing package installed, including Reese trailer brake control unit. This was only used to tow a camper about 6 times, though, no heavy use or strain on the frame.Roof rack, moon roof, bike rack installed in the hitch, you can have as well. Comes with a third row of seats and a full size spare tire and wheel. Tread is good on all five tires, though two are a little soft at the moment.Some rust spots, the worst are on the rear bumper. Interior is rough, it's been through some kids and pets. Rear hatch needs some new arms to stay up.Driver's side door, the window does not roll up. Glass is intact, though. The door also does not close right. It closes and won't pop open on you, it just doesn't close flush. Bent hinges maybe.Minor steering fluid leak. The most major thing that will need repair is the brakes. There is a significant brake fluid leak roughly right under where the driver's seat is. I had this repaired about a year ago but it came back. Also the ABS light is on and the ebrake cable snapped.Truck has 235k miles but as I said, engine and everything that makes it Go works good and is strong. Definately has a few good years left in her with some tlc.I was driving this every day until the brake line leak appeared again. It's a good truck, super comfortable to drive, great in the snow and roomy. I thought about keeping it to put a snow plow on but the wife says no.I have a clean title. It's ready to go. I can not drive it to you, it is no longer registered.Take it away or next week it goes to charity."

From my personal collection a fantastic Kimber Custom Shop premium 1911 pistol in excellent condition perfect for concealed carry.  CDP (Custom Defense Package) pistols combine all the best carry features into a package that gives them their name.  The Ultra CDP II is one of Kimber’s finest concealed carry pistols with a match grade 3-inch barrel, stainless steel slide and compact aluminum frame with double diamond rosewood grips.  It is a pure pleasure to fire, especially in 9mm as the felt recoil is little to nothing.
Everything is as it came new in the box.  Comes with two magazines.  This is definitely one of my favorite pistols but I have my eye on something else so someone else has the opportunity to own this quality pistol. Must meet all legal requirements, be over 21 and an Ohio resident for Ohio Private Sale.  I keep records of all my firearm transactions so be prepared to provide a copy of your driver's license or CCW.

This is the RX06 model with the 12.9 MOA triangle reticle. It comes with the Trijicon flattop mount (RX14), which has the knobs so you can remove it without tools in the field. Also comes with a polarizing filter (RX20) which threads into the front of the optic, and the dust cover (RX21).Some of the things I like about it:Tritium reticle, meaning you will never need batteries!The triangle reticle makes it perfect for CQB to medium range, and you can also zero to the tip of the triangle for use beyond medium range.The mount makes it very easy to remove any time you need to, and it always goes right back to zero.Including the same gear, these sell for about $550 on the internet. My price isn't so low because there are problems with it; it's in very good condition. I'm just pricing for a quick sale so I can put a scope on my new long range rifle.
