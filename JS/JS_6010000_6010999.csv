It has the ETA enlarged safety, Nordic Components follower, Limbsaver recoil pad and grip tape decals over the handguard. The stock and handguard have 1"" sling swivels on the right side (left hand shooter) but can be reversed. The sling in the picture was hand sewn by me and modeled after the VTAC slings. It is adjustable near the rear and then at the front, you can pull the tab to shorten the sling for increasing accuracy or just pulling it tighter against your body. I also will include a couple of 6 round elastic shotshell cards. They attach with velcro instead of slipping over the stock like those garbage elastic sleeves. This shotgun has been shot a lot and well maintained but my wife doesn't like it and I'm much more interested in shooting my revolver and AR now. The price is $600. With upgrades and it's still less than what you'd pay new if you ordered it from Bud's Gun Shop or got it locally.I also have a 50 caliber ammo can full of pumpkin ball lead slugs, some fiocchi and various other brands of buckshot, 100 federal targets loads I just bought but didn't shoot. If you want to buy some or all of the ammo, let me know and I can give you a discounted package deal.The only trades I'm interesting in are AR things or partial trade for 22 caliber rifles like the M&P 15-22.

This has been my EDC pistol for the past 6 years. Never had a problem with it and its always reliable. The Kimber has 1911 style ergonomics with a single action, striker fire setup. Ambidextrious thumb safety and magazine release make it perfect for left or right hand shooters. Three dot sights, slim profile, light weight and compact size make it perfect for an EDC 9mm. The Solo is rated for 124 grain and higher loads giving it excellent knock down power in a very concealable package. Since it has been my primary carry weapon for 6 years, it does have some finish issues on the black frame. Recently purchased a Sig P938 for an edc so no longer need the Kimber. Unfortunatly there is no box but it does come with four 6 round magazines. Given the wear issues and extra magazines I have priced the pistol at a very reasonable $550. I would prefer the buyer have a TCP but if not then buyer must show tn id and be legal to own a handgun and sign bill of sale. Email or txt REDACTED for info.
