The EXP-556 utilizes a polymer lower which is mostly standard other than the buffer tube area which is solid and unthreaded compared to a standard lower. Other than the pins and springs the entire lower is comprised of polymer parts. The trigger is marketed as a 5.5lb trigger. In testing, the trigger is very good considering it is polymer. There’s no real takeup or slack and it breaks very crisply. The lower has an integrated winter trigger guard to ease gloved shooting. The pistol is shipped with one 30 round Tapco magazine.BoltAssembly The upper is also polymer and features a proprietary recoil spring system sitting over a somewhat familiar looking bolt assembly. Since it is spring dampened there isn’t a long bolt carrier like a standard AR, it’s carrier has an abbreviated length. The upper is also unique in that it features a reciprocating charging handle on the left side. There is no dust cover or forward assist on the right side of the upper.The front gas block has an integrated front sight post machined into it and the rear sight is a ghost ring fitted into a dovetail in the polymer top rail. Between the upper and gas block is a stabilizing rod which helps keep the upper aligned and supported.The 8.25” barrel features a very effective muzzle brake. The brake pushes the barrel length to 9.25” overall. Its so effective that when shooting, the gun actively pushes down and back against the shooter. This creates a flat shooting pistol with minimal recoil felt to the shooter. The flipside of this effective brake is an engulfing muzzle flash and a deafening concussion. This is definitely not a gun you would ever want to shoot without hearing protection.Features Lightest 5.56/.223 Pistol In The World Made In USA Compact Design With No Buffer Tube Ergonomic Pistol Grip Integrated MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny Rail For Easy Mounting Of Optics And Accessories Extremely Low Recoil – Can Be Held And Shot With One Hand With Virtually No Muzzle Climb Crisp Trigger Pull Of 5.5 Lbs Reversible Safety To Accommodate Left Hand Shooters Why Pay Extra For Parts?

It has the full canopy system with a nice camo waterproof top. However, you can take off the top, and the canopy and even the side rails to make it a lower profile or to fit your needs. The Bed size on it is 6 foot wide by 8 foot long. This is a smaller trailer than the more common m105 which is wider than most vehicles, but mine is the same width as my suburban which is nicer for traveling. It is a dump trailer, not hydraulic but instead you take out 2 pins, lock the mechanical brakes and put your vehicle in reverse and slowly backup and watch the trailer dump. Then simply pull forward to lower the bed back. It is a pintle hitch setup which I can include an adjustable height pintle vehicle mount for the right price. I also added a long travel trailer jack to make it easy to hook the trailer up and take it off from the vehicle. It has a breakaway emergency brake cable if for some reason (not likely since pintle is the safest trailer hookup) it becomes separated from your vehicle it will lock the brakes on the trailer. These were originally built in 24volt configuration. I changed it over to 12 volt for easy connection to standard vehicles, but still have all the old wiring and lights. I did a Bed liner spray on the inside of the bed for protection. It is a great trailer for a wide array of needs. Whether it be for landscaping, or for pulling a quad or side by side utv, or needing a box type trailer to keep things dry. Or if you want a bug out or camping trailer. It will do most anything you want. I initially bought it to make it into an expedition trailer for off-roading since it has such a high ground clearance, but have used it for camping, landscaping and everything in between. I hate to see it go, but I'm looking to downsize before I move. Call or text anytime, I have a ky cell but live in Georgetown Ohio. REDACTED, if I don't answer please leave a message and I will get back with you, I will not respond to missed calls without a message. Price is $1350 or best offer, and I doubt you will see a nicer one around. The pic with camo top on it is my trailer, other pics are generic from internet to show how system that can be taken off and how dump works"

It is also the older Rock Island 1911 with a more simple logo and from how this one was assembled done by one of the smiths that was skilled and having a good day. When I got the gun it was completely stripped apart and the entire slide and frame was lightly rounded over to give a better and more finished look. The gun was Cerakoted 4Bush Weapons Refinishing Systems. I think the bottom color is sniper grey and the slide and misc parts are done in either Armor Black or Graphite Black (can't remember for sure...). The front sight was swapped out with a dawson precision fiber optic. Ramp mirror polished. Wilson Combat 18 lb recoil spring installed. A trigger job was done and everything was assembled back together after Cerakote by Helix Gunsmithing. Grips and grip screws were replaced and grip tape installed on the front. This gun is reliable, accurate, and feeds all types of ammo (FMJ and defense HP such as Federal HST). Include the original box and (1) original 8 round magazine (black). Depending on the trade and condition of the revolver and any extra we will shoot for an even trade and $ can balance it out. I can also include (3) 7 round flat base Tripp Cobra Mags (7R-45-WG) with Harrison Design BP-001 Base Pads on them."
