This gun does shoot, however it does not feed right. I got it from a guy thinking I might make it my first 1911 project gun but I just don't have the time to mess with it. The original dumbass owner thought he would ""polish"" the feed ramp but he ground it down instead... so when the slide moves forward to chamber the round, it just jams into the bottom of the barrel. Perfect for a project gun if you like 1911's or good for parts. Asking $150. One mag included, no additional stuff with it. Its in decent condition, but does have wear on the slide and a few dings here and there. Text me anytime, my name is Ryan. REDACTED. Thanks."

Frames can be purchased on matrix for $290 for an anodized black p229. A complete upper 9mm with all upper and lower internal parts is $300 on that site. For about $600 in parts you can build a Sig P228 or P229. This cutter also is supposed to do 1911 rails. You can legally build your own gun in every state (as far as I know). In NY you have to inscribe a serial number on the blank frame, put it on your permit, then start cutting working on the frame. It's just about fool proof. Use slide cutter to cut rails and jig to drill 3 holes. (I used the picture off of Matrix. Mine is the same thing from Matrix, just without the black logo)To build one off of matrix it would cost $615 plus $300 for upper - $915 (plus shipping). I'm selling this kit for $120, so that's a build for $720. Supposedly matrix is going to building the p229 frames because the are running out of upper parts kits so now would be the time to buy. Build a High Quality Sig P229 with P228 upper for $720 or buy on in a store for a grand.Call, text or email matt (seven one six) 535-7431"

I didn't use it as much as I thought I would.  12ga with 28"" fixed mod choke.  This barrel also has a mid bead.  When I received this gun, it had a cut down stock and cracked / damaged forearm. I was able to buy a (new old stock) stock. The forearm has been professionally repaired with epoxy and walnut stitched Dutchman. Refinished to match the stock. It is fully functional and looks pretty nice (can send photos if requested).  eBay is a great place to find replacements if you so desire to make it whole.  The barrel is in awesome condition.  Since the forearm repair, I have put 50rds of mixed target loads through the gun.  No hiccups.  I may just be a moron, but I have not been able to get the bolt out of the gun.  Gun blaster has worked extremely well. Overall, a pretty and reliable shotgun.  This is my thought: I could parts this gun out on eBay and get about $250 for the butt stock and barrel alone, but I'd rather see it used instead of parts out.Trades - I would prefer cash, but I'm open to some trades. No pumps, single shots, Hi-points, or Cobra's."

The NOC is compatible with standard Glock 17 holsters which won’t need any modification unless you are running an accessory on the rail. The frame of the NOC is manufactured by Lone Wolf Distributors and was chosen by Agency Arms for a couple different reasons. The Lone Wolf frame has a slightly modified angle which is similar to that of a 1911 and it has a higher beavertail that enables the shooter to get a much better purchase on the grip.Technical Specs:Caliber- 9x19Mag Capacity- 15+1Barrel Lenth- 3.9""Slide Lenth- 7.35""Height Excluding Mag-4.560""Barrel Twist- 1/10Barrel Rifling- Pull BroachedSights- Dovetail Front & RearWeight w/mag 1 lbs 7.4 oz Noc Pistol Set:Agency Arms NOC Pistol2 Magpul PmagLonewolf Backstrap2 Recoil Springs (15lbs Sping Installed, 18lbs Springs)Product InsertNanuk 910 hard case"
