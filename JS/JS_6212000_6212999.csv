Made with the same materials and quality control as all GLOCK semi-automatic pistols, the G42 is a carry gun you can count on at the moment of truth. Internally, the GLOCK 42 employs the same striker, short-recoil operated, and locked-breech barrel as the larger framed GLOCK pistols, and uses a dual recoil spring assembly as the Gen4 pistols. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The rough textured polymer grip provides a solid hold, and while quite concealable, it offers shooters enough surface area for ultimate control. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The length, shape, finger rest, and size of the trigger opening are the same as the larger pistols, and the trigger is same size and shape as the smooth-faced triggers used on the Gen4 pistols, making them all familiar to those who already use GLOCK pistols. The GLOCK 42 Semi-Auto Pistol is a reliable, easy to maintain firearm that's perfect for everyday carry. The G42 comes with 2 ultra-reliable single-stack 6-round magazines.

I believe it was left outside.I removed all of the rust, coated the barrel with some matte green krylon and then clear coat, with my intent being to blue it later. I then refinished all of the wood with tru-oil, and proceeded to fill my freezer the past few years with small game. I have killed dozens of rabbits, hundreds of squirrel, and probably about a dozen groundhog with it. Functionally, it is perfect, but it certainly isn't pretty.The case colors show some very light pitting, and a little staining from the rust that used to be there.This was made by marlin after they purchased nef/H&R, and is the same as an h&r topper, so parts can be found everywhere. The only reason I'm selling it is because it made me very fond of the .410 cartridge, and so I went out and bought a very nice O/U, and will likely not use this one for much anymore.Makes a great hunting gun, locks up tight, clean bore, functionally perfect.
