That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family. #G-I-3315"

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family.#G-I-3317"

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family.G-I-3316"

Chambered in 40 S&W and comes with everything as it should, from the factory.  please call/text REDACTEDThe HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol."

I've carried it for a few years now and never had any issues. It currently has a Hogue grip on it but it also comes with the original grip as well. I will also include a box of  hornet he critical defense ammo and a De Santas pocket holster.  The original box, case and paperwork with stickers and all are included. There is a scratch at the front of the pistols polymer fame which is bound to happen being in a pocket. I will only do this the proper way so a CCW and/or FFL licensed are the only options.

The scope uses a glass prism optical system rather than a refracting lens system like traditional scopes, allowing for better optical quality in a much smaller package. With crystal clear optics, an adjustable focus lens, and a comfortable eye relief of 3+ inches, it is comparable to sights several times the price. The glass reticle can be illuminated in red or green, in multiple brightness levels for a clean sight picture regardless of lighting or environment. And, unlike red dot sights, the reticle is visible with or without illumination, usable with or without battery power. The S536P is 1.1 pounds in weight, 6.2 inches in length, 2.8 inches in height, and 2 inches in width. The illuminated reticle runs off one 3V CR2032 battery.
