NOTE: these units have NO external safeties; they are double action first round single action subsequent. Experts favor this version for duty or “condition 2” carry: in the holster pistol is decocked and always ready for use–the first round is double-action, while the subsequent shots are single-action. Upon reholstering, simply activate the decocking lever and the pistol is again ready for quick use when you need it. These DO NOT have external safeties, this will not allow you to leave the decocker in the “down” position which “disables” the trigger; they are alway’s ready to fire.  Full Wilson Combat action tune, full complete  trigger work hand honed, beveled magazine wells, five Beretta mfg (Italy) 15 round magazines, Pelican fitted case with upper and lower compartments, 92G owners manual.  IDPA Stock Service Pistol approved and USPSA Production Division approved. **CASH ONLY** No Trades At This Time."

I also want to work on a few SBR projects, and some of the weapon systems I am looking for will reflect that need as well, so if you see something crazy and think ""That's retarded to use for 3-Gun"" it probably isn't for it. I enjoy working on my own guns, so a stock weapon will always get the nod over a The only CALIBERS I am interested in are 9mm (for CZs), .38 Super, .308Win/7.62x51 NATO and 12 Gauge - obviously you can make major with 357SIG/40/10mm but that is not the way I am leaning right now at all, and it was I am/was used to.

Sometimes it would fail to eject sometimes fall to load, sometimes I would have to push the trigger forward to reset it and sometimes it wouldn't lock back on last round. I figured the gas port on the barrel was too small so I opened it up a little bit. Now it cycles better, but too hot and you get some sparks out of the block. I think an adjustable gas block would fix it but I don't have the time to try and fix it. My loss is your gain. I tried various things including buffer weights, different bcgs, reseating the gas block, etc. I can throw in the adjustable gas block for an additional $40 of food the right trade. This is built on an Anderson lower. Willing to trade for anything of good value including good optics. No junk."

It has only been shot 100 rounds, and is in excellent condition. This model originally came with an AAC Tirant .45 ACP suppressor,and retailed at $2,261.00, but I have opted to keep it. However it still comes with the original Pelican foam lined hard case, with slots custom cut for the pistol, magazines, cleaning rod, and barrel bushing wrench.This 1911 very closely resembles the production Remington R1 Enhanced, however, the AAC 1911 is finished in satin black oxide, and has gray VZ ""Frag"" AAC logo grips, and the slide is lazer engraved with ""Advanced Armament Corp"" on the left and has a light etching of the AAC ""skull and crossed guns"" on the right. The extended threaded barrel comes with a thread protector and allows for a tight, secure fit for a suppressor.Accuracy on this gun is very notable, and has a crisp trigger break at about 3.5 pounds. Sight alignment is easy, with elevated front and rear sights.This gun has been featured in the Premier Special Edition 2016 issue of Gun Show Magazine, and can be found online. I am providing everything that came with it, excluding the suppressor. This is a collectible piece, and if you pick up an AAC Tirant the package will be valuable to collectors!The price is $900 and is firm. It has been stored, and kept from the elements. There are no scratches and no rust.If you would like to call or text me, my number is REDACTED. Please text first,if you don't mind, as I am at work most of the day.

For this reason the magwell will not be included in the price. The gun shoots tight groups. I have run 150 rounds through this setup and it is a definite improvement over the stock glock. The trigger is is fantastic and breaks like a glass rod with no mush or slop. The reset is short and very positive. I am asking 900 for everything. All addons are less than a month old. Not interested in trades at this time. The total cost cost of everything was 1300.00 including the gun and the frame mods. It is all new and just installed. The gun is set up and ready to run. Needs absolutely nothing. Please feel free to look up the cost on the parts and verify. Will also come with the stock glock barrel. If you would like more pics please text me and I will send more.

I switched it out with an apex low-profile loaded chamber indicator looks much better and still serves it's purpose, this gun also has a manual safety.  I got it because I wanted to see what I thought a 40 caliber I don't mind it at all but I just don't see the point in losing one round over 9 mm, that is the only reason this gun is up for sale. Looking for $340."

The VP9 uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. HK's patented charging supports, simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide, provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

If you have been looking for a Hi Power you would not be disapointed in this one. All numbers appear to match and it has Fabrique Nationale Herstal Belgique on the frame. It really is very nice.
