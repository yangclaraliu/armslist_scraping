Also knows as the the AMAC and Iver Johnson. ** Im at least the second owner of this rifle so the exact round count is unknown. It includes a Millet 4-16 X 50 Illuminated optic.** It has both the original cheek piece and one that I manufactured myself out of 6061 aluminum. I found the original to be too high for a comfortable cheek weld so I made my own. I cerakoted the cheek piece in graphite black and added a section of Pachmayr PacSkin for comfort.Here is a cut and paste from the net to give ya some info on this rifle.....The .50 caliber Model 500 rifle was originally designed by the team, lead by the D. Haskins, then working at Research Armaments Prototypes (RAP), a small company then located in Jacksonville, Arkansas, USA. Developed at the request ofUS Armed forces during 1981-82, along with smaller Model300 rifle, Model 500 was purchased by US military circa 1983 in small numbers - about 125 rifles were initially delivered, and went to Beirut,Grenada, Panama, Iraq and probably several other places. The Model 500 paved the way into military service for numerous other .50 caliber anti-materiel rifles, such as various Barrett models. But it had a very controversial life of its own. During 1980s the design was bought from RAI by the Daisy Weapons Systems, then it went for Iver Johnson Arms. Iver Johnson sold the Model 500 as AMAC-1500, but when it went bankrupt, the parts and machinery were sold on auction. The AMAC-1500 rifles are still offered in USA by the Ultimate Accuracy Arms.During late 1980s the Daisy slightly modified the design, so it became convertible to three major ""big bore"" calibers, .50BMG (12.7x99),12.7x108 Russian, and 14.7x115 Russian. The model 600 was initially offered by Daisy, then by Redick Arms Development. In 1999 Redick Arms was purchased by Aurora tactical LLC ,which offered the Model 600, as well as improved, magazine fed version, Model650. For some time, M600 and M650 rifles were also distributed by RAMO Defence, before it went out of business.The RAP Model 500, Iver Johnson AMAC-1500 and M600 are all similar in basic design, being different mostly in the shape of the barrel, muzzlebrake, and bipod. All these rifles featured a removable ""shell holder""rotating bolt with three lugs. For each shot bolt was rotated and removed from the receiver, then cartridge was inserted into bolt face, and then bolt with cartridge were inserted back into receiver and locked. Fully adjustable trigger and adjustable buttstock allowed for some ""personalization"" of the rifle. Neither rifle was intended to be fired offhand, and thus had no forearm.Instead, each rifle was issued with folding bipod. For carry, rifle was easily disassembled into several major parts. Neither rifle also featured open sights -only telescope sights were used. According to some sources, the now famous Leupold Series M scopes were originally developed especially for Model 500rifle. On all variations, barrels were fitted with large and effective muzzlebrakes of slightly different contours. Model 650 rifles differed from those described above by having a 7-shot detachable box magazine, and anon-removable, manually operated rotating bolt action. Because of larger and longer receiver, M650 rifles are significantly heavier, than m500 and m600 rifles.Not interested in Trades.Rifle, Scope and both cheek pieces......$2,050.00"

379,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6936379,For Sale:  1934 Lefever 16ga A Grade SxS Shotgun,"NE Bend, Bend, Oregon",$ 575,"Listed On: Saturday, June 10, 2017",Shotguns,Taurus                                                                                ,16 Gauge                                                                                ,Side by Side                                                                                ,Shotgun,"The owner says that he has taken a couple dozen pheasants with it over the years and hasn't had any issues.Make no mistake, this is an 83 year old shotgun made before WWII. It has seen many owners and there is no complete first hand history of it.
Here is one that I have never seen before quite like it. Serial number dates it to 1934. Barrels are 26"" and are marked 'Lefever Arms Co. Ithaca NY' and 'Lefever A Grade'. No markings on receiver, but the barrels and receiver do have matching serial numbers.  It has been noted that the barrels may have been cut at some point and re-blued, but there is no first hand knowledge if/when this was done.
I'm guessing they used Ithaca NID actions to make some Lefevers? If anyone has any more information, I would be glad to update the listing.
Straight grip stock, single trigger, lever catch opens to the right, auto safety. The lock lever does naturally stay slightly to the right, as pictured, when you close the action. A gentle push to the left and it will center, but on its own it does stay slightly right. I have been told that this is a good thing, it means that the action is not worn (or it would be left of center) but I am not a gunsmith. Bright and shiny bore with extractors.
LOP is approximately 13-3/4"" to the unmarked buttplate, which is attached with modern, not original screws. The action appears to have been bedded to the stock at some point, see close up pictures. There are also two holes in the wrist that have been filled with wood putty. Don't know why they are there, but I personally cannot see a pin or a crack that they were put there to stop, but again, I am not the owner nor a gunsmith.
Chokes are Full and Modified, according to the numbers on the barrel flats.  However, if it was cut down at some point, the chokes are gone.  I dont have a choke gauge to measure for sure, but with calipers, the ID of the barrels at the muzzle are .648"" and .656"".
Selling on consignment, I have no direct knowledge of it beyond a visual inspection. If you would like more/different photos, please ask.  I am a licensed FFL dealer, so this will need to transfer with a background check, which is included in the price.  Asking $575, email or call 541-420-eleven twelve for more info."

Just a nice, well-cared for example that's seen some light use. You know, something I'd be proud to show off, but also not afraid to take the to the range and enjoy occasionally.

ALL of the ammo is FMJ, Brass, new factory loads from quality companies. Better than 'Walmart' loads from Fed/Win/Rem/CCI, etc. Some are significantly hotter (Chrono'd to compare). The Geco .45 and 38 loads are great and from the Swiss. I found Euro ammo from S&B/Fiocchi/Geco/Aguila/PPU to be more consistent, way hotter (recks Domestic in Power Factor..). I'm sorry to be a Shill but Rem/Fed/Blazer generally make watered-down, overpriced stuff and sell by name recognition. I want to shoot 'full-power' representatives of their respective calibers and I've had a lot better luck with import brands.  $15 - 38Special - 125 and 158 Grain (250-300 Avail) (Great ammo. Accurate, most relaxing/enjoyable shooting experience though a lever-action Carbine (Rossi 92, my favorite to shoot of 13 guns..). The 125gr Rounds are comfortable for small and new shooters, with a sharper report (9mm-like) and yields serious velocities from 4-6"" Revolvers/Carbines. All Rds are Truncated FMJ$13(?) 45 ACP - 200 and 230 Grain (200ish Avail, mostly 230gr) The Geco 230s are VERY consistent, bit higher PF than our domestics. Quality is apparent and they cycle so smoothly. The 200gr is FM and a nice change from the ubuititious 230. A good way for a .40 or 9mm-type experience and you'll notice the report, quicker impulse and Sights staying level.  $10 9mm - 115/124/135gr (250-350 avail) About 100 rounds is the 'reman' FM 124gr Hollow-Tip (FMJ, non-expanding) which is good, once-fired Brass w/ some nickle-plated JHP cases mixed in. 50 Rounds are new FM 124gr 'NATO' and have good power to sim carry ammo. 50 Rounds approx. of S&B 115gr which, by my chrono, were much higher velocity (150-200 more..) than the 'big-4' (looking at you, Fed Champion..). S&B, Aguila and Fiocchi have all surprised me w/ full-power and best value. The last 30 rounds are 135gr FM Reman and shoot fine. $20 for 300 Round box of CCI MiniMags, $15 with other ammo bought.Got too opinionated/preachy, I know, but my hope is more people get exposed to online ammo search engines and stop enabling the disgraced, investor-bought, shells of legendary American icons to inflate Ammo prices by name recognition alone. I'm a reasonable guy and the ammo needs to go so I'll do what I can to work with you to make a deal. Thanks guys. More pics, w/ more info: http://imgur.com/a/CKdCg"

Come by the store at 1320 West Sunshine, call us at REDACTED, or check out our website at https://www.kelleystactical.com/product/scar-17s-308-fde/ FN has set out to build the world’s best 7.62 rifle with the SCAR 17, which is short for “U.S. Special Operations Command Assault Rifle“. It is essentially the semi- automatic civilian version of the rifle issued to the Army Rangers. The United States has not fielded a true .30 caliber battle rifle since the Vietnam War when the M-14 was replaced — and for good reason. A full size cartridge like the 7.62 NATO has a lot of power and muzzle climb compared to the more subdued 5.56 round. Creating an effective infantry rifle capable of operating under those types of forces has been a major challenge. FN Herstal believes they’ve engineered the perfect solution, which the military is in the process of adopting."

You can find other M21As that an aftermarket golden pin pack has been added to the gun but this is the real deal from the factory which includes the gold engraving. The gun is fully operational and it will kill you at 7yds.  You can find INOX models on Buds or Gunbroker going for $500 which are just stainless; not sure why. This is a collectable piece or it can be a pocket or purse pistol, your choice. Willing to travel a reasonable distance to facillitate sale.

Built with titanium, stainless steel, and cobalt, these ELITE OTB suppressors deliver superior heat mitigation and durability. *ATF regulation requires SRM be purchased at same time as BPR.    BPR     The BPR can be used as a standalone, almost hear safe, suppression device (like a mini-can) for shooters looking for some sound suppression (see dB rating below), reduced recoil, no flash and minimal added length and weight.    SRM6   With the quick attachment of an SRM, sound suppression levels can be increased for a specific mission type or use. The combined BPR and SRM system delivers hearing safe sound suppression, flash suppression and unmatched heat mitigation – critical for full-auto fire use."
