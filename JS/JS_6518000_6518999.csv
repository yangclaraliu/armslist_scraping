The cabinet pictured above is pretty standard with soft close hinges, magnetic gun mount, and is drilled for adjustable shelves.  But I can offer any option you can imagine.  This cabinet does not lock but I can add locking hardward if desired.
What I would like to offer is custom cabinets that fit your needs.  Whatever size you would like.  For any application. 
I can build these cabinets with hinged doors or sliding doors for bigger cabinets.  They can range from small cabinets, just big enough for a hand gun to larger units, big enough for shotgun or rifle.
I'm not offering a standard base model at this point.  I am interested in building a custom cabinet for you!
 
Pricing will depend on what you are looking for and what options you would like.
Just contact me and I can get some drawings pulled together and let you know pricing."

The pistol was sent almost immediately to Evolution Armory (professional 1911 smith, you can look them up) to have a Wilson Combat Bullet Proof Ambi Safety installed, Wilson Combat flat trigger, and Wilson Combat one piece Bullet Proof magwell installed and blended. The gun has over 500 rounds through it, but under 600. I have 550 documented, but have shot a couple stray mags through it as well. The pistol displays a decent amount of bluing wear due to this being my EDC pistol since October 2016. It has also been drawn, reholstered, dry fired quite a bit. Much more than it's been shot. Otherwise it is in excellent condition. Comes with all original accessories documentation, plus VZ SIMINOCH grips. Original single sided safety and mainspring housing which are numbered to the pistol are included as well. Gun was over 1800 new, and has (I believe it was just over $500) worth of work into it. Quick sale at $1500. Trade value is at $1600 and ONLY trade will be for a STOCK gen4 glock 19 priced at $400 as that's what I can get a blue label for...possibly a gen4 G17 as well, same requirements.PLENTY of detailed pics available to interested buyer."

I bought this late last year and used it to load approximately 350 rounds of 6.5 Creedmoor. A friend who is getting out of reloading offered me his RCBS unit so I purchased it and I'm selling this unit. This unit works flawlessly and loaded rounds that shot half MOA out of the Creedmoor out to 900 yards. I always removed the powder after every use, and everything is included that came with it (box, manual, check weights, etc). The unit also comes with a custom machined brass insert for the dispensing tube. This helps with hitting the exact charge weight with extruded powders and works better than the popular ""straw mod"". The lowest retail price on these is currently $169 on Amazon. I will sell this one for $125I live in the Grant area and work in the Research Park/Gate 9 area, so I can meet near those locations or in between. Thank you for looking, and hopefully someone can use this as a nice addition to their reloading bench. -Mike"
