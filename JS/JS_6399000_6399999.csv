I will sell this entire lot for $185 for local face to face sales- this is about $.16 per round.  Shipping to anywhere in the USA will be 15 dollars.  If you need these shipped I will put them in baggies and label them with the load data and put them in a flat rate box.  This price is comparable to other rounds for local LEO/MIL practice range and I consider it to be a free box with the DIRT CHEAP purchase of 20 boxes.  I might consider a trade for two single shot shotguns or single shot .22s for a local customer as each of those items would be around $100 of value or possibly a .22 auto loader.  Might also consider a trade for 5 or 6 bricks of .22 ammo.  Hit me with other offers I may be interested in trading if you are local.

I have the box and all documentation for it also.The Burris Eliminator Laser Rangefinding Rifle Scope is a scope that does just about everything short of pulling the trigger. This scope ranges your target, calculates trajectory and an illuminated dot appears at the ideal holdover point. Hunting at long ranges has never been easier. The Eliminator also features an integral mounting system for mounting on a 1 or 2-piece Weaver-style base and comes with a remote activation switch that can be attached to the forearm of your rifle. The Burris Eliminator Laser Rangefinding Scope comes with an instruction manual explaining how to program the scope for your favorite cartridge and load.

This pistol appears all original, clean inside and out, and has an outstanding bore.   Looks like it spent the last 24 years sitting in somebody's safe as evident by the lack of wear on the barrel which is commonly seen with a high use Sig. This was not a law enforcement trade in.  The date code on this pistol is KD indicating 1993 manufacture making this pistol a Pre-ban pistol. This was the tail end of the pistols being made entirely in Germany and imported to the US.  For those of you unfamiliar with the current CT laws, having a ""Pre-Ban"" pistol is a huge plus.  Although silencers are legal to own in CT, it is illegal to affix a threaded barrel to any current pistol unless they were previously registered as an ""Assault Weapon"" under the legislation passed a few years back.  The loophole to this law is that any ""Pre-Ban"" (pre 1994) pistol is eligible to have a threaded barrel legally and without registering as an assault weapon.  With the current pending ""Hearing Protection Act"" it may get much easier and cheaper to own a suppressor making pistols like this very desirable.  With the Sig P226 being well known as one of the best/quietest suppressor hosts this is the one to have.  The fact that it was made entirely in Germany also adds value to the weapon as Sig fans consider these pistols to be the best and foundation for Sig's legendary following.  Magazine is a brand new Mec-Gar magazine which are considered the best and are actually the OEM maker for Sigs magazines.  Buyer must have a valid CT pistol permit, for Face to Face transaction in the Enfield area.  Price is firm, please no lowball offers."

Starts on 1 or 2 pulls every time. I used it to clear about 1/2 acre overgrown property, heavy brush, briars, small trees (up to 2.5 inches or so). This is not a grass mower, low rpm speed just blows grass over. Ideal for over growth. The project is over so I no longer have a need for the machine and want to pass along great savings to someone else for this purpose.Excellent for clearing brush, land management, clearing trails, food plots, hunting preparation, creek banks and many other uses. Handy to have around. My project is complete so no sense letting it sit. Honda makes the best small engine motors & Billy Goat is a top of the line brand, excellent condition* includes a brand new spare (extra) replacement blade also"

The host gun used in engineering the Vers 3-Lug is a German HK MP5 9mm submachine gun and we certify that it will work with any genuine HK 9mm three lug system. It will not work on HK .40 or 10mm systems and may not be compatible with certain copies that do not follow the HK specifications. If you already own a Bowers Group silencer, just unscrew the insert in it and replace it with this one to swap over to three lug goodness. As with any of our inserts, they can be changed at your whim so you can use the silencer on other hosts. Please note the Bowers Group 3 lug is a thread adaptive insert for use with Bowers silencers only. These are not designed to work with airsoft products or other brands of suppressors."

So finding one of these brand new in the box under $900 is now impossible. Check the auction sites.This one should be especially collectable because it was imported by Big Bear Arms that only handled these between 1993-1994 out of Dallas, TX. So with further reasearch this could be considered a Pre-Clinton Ban firearm. Easilly the cleanest importer marked AK reciever I have seen. An has the Izmash Arrow instead of Oval, as well."

The trigger finger moves from trigger to mag release to bolt release smoothly without moving the weapon from the shoulder. That is why it is call PDQ (pretty dam quick). When seconds count and your life and others are depending on you. Count on PDQ The PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™ Release is made in AMERICA, uses Military grade steel, hardened and Mil Spec 8526 Class 3 type 2 coated to last a life time of operational conditions. Reloading with PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™When performing an emergency reload a shooter will typically use his left hand to insert a fresh magazine, press the bolt release, and return hand to shooting position. When using the new PDQ the shooter can now move from mag insertion directly back to shooting position. The trigger finger releases the bolt while the left hand returns to the shooting position. Clearing a Double Feed with PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™While an advantage in firearms reloads, the PDQ advantage when clearing a double jam on the weapon is amazing. When a rifle malfunctions due to a double feed, the shooter will typically move the left hand to the bolt stop release and the right hand is now needed to activate the charging handle. This action is neither smooth or quick. Using the PDQ will allow the shooter to clear most double feed jams without ever removing his hand from the shooting grip. This action is not only faster but also more familiar. Whether in a competition or in a fight for your life the PDQ adds speed and reliability."

It is based on the M4 carbine, with which it shares 80% of its parts.[1] The 'M' model name is not a US military designation. Like the HK416, it features a proprietary short-stroke self-regulating gas piston system and bolt carrier/carrier key design, which prevents trapped gases from contacting the bolt carrier or receiver of the weapon, which reduces the heating and carbon fouling of the internals, simplifies field maintenance, and improves reliability."

The Apache Black stock is made of DuPont “ZYTEL” Plastic/Nylon - it also has surface scratches from normal wear; the nylon stock checkering is still sharp. The bore is clean and the rifling is very good for the age of the gun. This rifle has a “Shark Fin” front sight that has worn finish and is missing the rear sight. These rifles have a unique butt-stock, a tube feed magazine with a total capacity of 14 +1 .22 LR rounds. These earlier Nylon 66 rifles are well known for their performance, accuracy and flawless function. The Nylon 66 rifle is considered by many to be the Finest .22 caliber, semi-automatic rifle, Remington ever made. A little history for you -- Remington introduced the Nylon 66 rifle in 1959 in 2 stock colors: Mohawk Brown & Seneca Green. In 1962, they introduced the Apache Black color variation --- this is a must for your collection of classic firearms!  Don't hesitate to call at REDACTED with any questions.  Thanks for looking!"

The Helia C 3-12x is the culmination of 100 years of optics expertise and represents one of the most rugged and reliable hunting scopes on the market. Optics were revolutionized by the Helia C when it was among the first scopes to feature fully multi-coated optics and 100% waterproof construction. The AMV fully multi-coated lenses give the Helia C its ultra-bright image and extreme low light performance while the large ocular produces ample field of view and speedy target acquisition. While first focal plane reticles have become synonymous with target and tactical rifles, the Helia C features a FFP Mil-2 reticle that aids hunters in effectively ranging the game at any power magnification. The one piece aluminum tube is machined from some of the lightest and highest grade aluminum of any rifle scope. For the demanding hunter that is looking for the best there is, look no further than the Austrian crafted Helia C from Kahles."
