It is a first year 1952 Remington 760 pump action that originally was in .35 Remington but was rechambered back in the 70's by famous bench rest gunsmith and marksman K.E SMITH to now shoot. 358 winchester rounds. It is an excellent bear, elk, deer big game rifle especially for brushy country. The gun is used with marks, some scratches and freckling here and there but is still a great shooter. On top of the rechambering, it's also had trigger work done and has a very nice, light, crisp trigger. The only downside is at some point during our last move the detachable mag was lost, however any short action (308) 760 or 7600 mag will work and are easily purchased for around $20..

The receiver was slightly notched to easily allow loading of the slightly longer round. The bolt & action of the 1903 is also shorter than the actual 8mm Model 98. This is an intermediate length action and the bolt and magazine are 0.2 inches shorter than the standard length 98 action the receiver faces is 0.2 inches longer than a 98. other intimate intermediates include the M24 fn the Yugo Mausers and several South American contract rifles. This rifle would have had a pistol grip stock which is a change from the straight stalk of the 1893 the rear receiver bridge will also have a high hump the hump is there to handle the special clip and is also seen on the 1909 Peruvian. The Turks converted some Mausers that appear to be 1903s except for the missing hump. They even added a small piece to the receiver that supports their unique clips.Overall a very nice rifle with a shiny bore with strong grooves that should clean up nice.

The rifle is stamped all matching with a lineout on the butt plate and oddy the magazine. However the lined out number on the magazine is the same as the number that is stamped to replace it. The rifle is in perfect working order. The barrel is not counter bored. These are great rifles with a lot of history and built like tanks.

This is a special run made by Ruger. It has a grey thumbhole laminated stock and is very rare. This is new in box and never fired.   Ruger is weird about their special runs in that they refuse to provide actual production numbers. So there is no way to tell how many were made but a review of all the on-line gun sale websites will not turn up another one. I  looked!  
Disclaimer:

ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!

I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!

I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""

Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!

I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales

Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.

I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.

Cash only – no checks, charges, credit cards, payments, cashier’s checks, or promises of riches from a Nigerian prince, nor will I ""hold-it"" so you can run home and get ""permission"". If you don’t have ""permission"" and cash, don’t waste my time.

ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!

I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!

I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""

Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!

Disclaimer:

ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!

I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!

I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""

Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!

I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales

Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.

I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.

Cash only – no checks, charges, credit cards, payments, cashier’s checks, or promises of riches from a Nigerian prince, nor will I ""hold-it"" so you can run home and get ""permission"". If you don’t have ""permission"" and cash, don’t waste my time.
