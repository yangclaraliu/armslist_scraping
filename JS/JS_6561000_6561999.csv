I purchased this rifle as a backup in January of 2015. This rifle has been very reliable and only had about 900 rounds total through it. I have not shot this rifle much at all. The rifle itself is in very good condtion. Not very much wear at all. The only area that has a little use is the rail from adding and removing optics and it totally normal. The rifle will come with the original box, cleaning kit, and manuals. I no longer have the P-Mag it came with. I am asking $1350 and will not accept low offers. OD Green can be a little harder to find and new ones run between $1650-$1750 plus taxes, shipping, and or transfer fees. This is a good chance to get one in great condition for less.I am willing to meet F2F. I may consider shipping if the situation is right. If meeting F2F I will not sell to you without a valid Michigan ID. I also will provide two copies of a bill of sale. I also have a Michigan CPL so everything is clean on my end, I will also present ID. If interested please email the listing and we will go from there. Thanks!"

The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The .357 Sig is almost as powerful ballistically as the .357 Magnum and that was part of its initial design. 
This piece is carried by the Secret Service, the Federal Air Marshalls, Montana, Oklahoma, Virginia and Illinois State Police agencies to name a few. You can purchase this ammo on line at Lucky Gunner for $22.00 for 50 rounds of Lawman. Price is comparable to .45ACP.
Since the .357 Sig is simply a .40 caliber necked down to 9mm, therefore the barrel is interchangeable with a .40 caliber barrel and if you want to shoot it as a .40 simply purchase a barrel either from Sig or Lone Wolf, everything else is the same.
It comes with one mag which holds 7 rounds.  Has Nitron Stainless Steel Slide and SIGLITE Night Sights with short reset trigger along with Hogue Rubber Grips. Comes with original box and Sig Sauer holster and a box of 50 shells. Limited Lifetime Warranty.
The MSRP on this piece is $1108.00 on Sig's web site.Call or text Jim at REDACTED."

I'm asking $400 or best offer. Again, serious inquires only please. No low balls! I'm asking about $700 for both.This is NOT a Yugoslavian M48 or Turkish Mauser!
