Brand new, in box, and ready for the range! Through an ingenious and simple arrangement we have solved the main disadvantage of Bullpup rifles; case ejection. Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward ejection, like in the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. The bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments.NO CREDIT CARD FEES - SHIPPING IS $10.00"

It is not in excellent (Perfect) condition and it shows normal signs of finish wear but it functions flawlessly and is very clean as I keep all of my firearms clean before they go in the safe. This Model 28-2 was shipped from the S&W Factory in 1978 and has recently been used for home protection duty but, I have decided to pass it on to another deserving family.The rear sight blade has been upgraded to a White Outline blade, and the Wood Stocks are Altamont Wood Laminate with S&W Logo. It does not come with the original Box or Docs. Lockup is tight and there is no excessive wear on the forcing cone from shooting overly hot loads. It is a Large N-Frame revolver and will handle just about anything .357 Magnum that you want to fire. Being a .357 it also shoots .38 Special and .38 Special +P which tames this beast quite a bit.all I am interested in is a fair deal for a good quality and well-built firearm that will bring pleasure and function well, for years to come.I am not interested in traveling or shipping it. Please be prepared to provide detailed pictures with your offer. Georgia law does not require a bill of sale when transferring my property to another Georgia Resident but, I would like to see your Georgia Weapons Carry License, or Georgia resident photo ID (drivers license). By accepting this you also must admit that you are not a convicted felon and, legally allowed to own a handgun in the state of Georgia."

It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: adjustable cant, tuckable, excellent positive retention. The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™. When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate. The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm. Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw!"

I purchased the firearm new in 2013 and have shot approximately 1500 rounds through the pistol without a malfunction. I am selling the pistol only because I wish to upgrade to one of CZ's competition models in the future. A complete set of images of the pistol I am selling can be found here: http://imgur.com/a/bnJTrThis particular model is the CZ 75 SP-01, which features a manual safety, 1913 picatinny accessory rail, cold hammer forged barrel, tritium night sights, checkered grips, extended beavertail and full-size steel frame.

This listing includes the pictured magazines, which are:
-2 factory CZ 18 round magazines
-6 Mec-Gar 19 round magazines (high quality and reliability, $35 value each)-1 factory CZ 26 round magazine (functions just fine as well, $60 value)Also included is the original CZ case, CZ paper work and factory warranty (5 years), cleaning rods, 2 snap caps and manual. 
Overall it's a great pistol. It's a bit heavy for day-to-day carry, but it is incredible as far as reliability and minimal recoil goes. ***I am in Cambridge MN, however I am willing to meet serious buyers in either the St. Cloud or Twin Cities areas, or perhaps somewhere in between.  Call, e-mail or text. Price is $700. Cash only, no trades. I will require the completion of a Bill of Sale as well as a driver's license and firearms permit for this sale.***

It comes with the orginal case and 2 original 10round magazines.  The Sig 229 is the shortened version of the full size Sig 226, it's much easier for concealed carry and used by the Secret Service.  I've put a about 200 rounds through this Sig, not much really, it's nearly in new condition.I bought it new in Massachusetts in 2011 and have hardly used it.  What I love about this gun is that it's 100% reliable, never had any problems. It's well balanced and points easily. All of the controls are excellent and work flawlessly. My favorite part about the Sig 229 are the night sights, they are fantastic, bright and crisp.  If you've never had tritium night sights, thesewill be your new favorite night sights. I would stay away from the other version of this pistol with the DAK trigger, the DAK version is double action only.  This one is single action after cocking the hammer, or double action for firing the first round, single action for every round after the first. There's is nothing wrong with this Sig 229, I just have never shot it much, it's been sitting in my safe and I'd rather get a Ruger rifle. Preference is for Massachusetts buyers, face to face, cash, and I live north of Boston."
