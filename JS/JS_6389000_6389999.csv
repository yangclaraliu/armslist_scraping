(does require an adapter to mount an accessory to the barrel, available everywhere) Take down lever makes field stripping very easy. Rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.The full size M&P is a great fun shooter for casual plinking but is also designed to be a training aid for full sized M&P centerfires. I am the original owner of this pistol and have probably 300- 400 thru it. When I purchased this pistol it came with only one magazine so I purchased a second from Smith & Wesson.

This 6"" barreled 629-1 was manufactured in 1985, so it contains no MIM parts, no internal lock, etc.  This all-original safe queen has shot only 25 rounds of .44 Special since NIB nearly 32 years ago.  Multiple M29s & Mountain Guns were my shooters, this M629-1 was held in reserve.  Not a mark or blemish on it, the recoil-shield / breech-plate shows no cartridge impressions.  The smooth forged trigger and hammer are factory flash chromed - nice!  The fit, finish, and timing are perfect.  After owning 40+ S&W revolvers over the years, this M629-1 has the tightest lockup & minimal cylinder-to-barrel gap I've ever experienced, which maximizes the .44Mag cartridge performance.  Included is the original box, all paperwork, and complete cleaning/tool set as shipped from the factory."

No low end firearms like Taurus, Hi Point etc. I can text pics but you will need to send an email first with the following, trade information and phone contact. I will not sell, only trade. I do not have to trade just testing the waters so if I decline it's no hard feelings just not interested. Will look at Spikes, Noveske, Rock River, Stag, Ruger, Sig, Springfield, other Colts, BCM, Bravo Co. Maybe others just not into builds unless it's a matching build and something I can't overlook. Handguns would be Glock, Sig, Ruger revolvers, S&W, Kimber, Para, HK, Certain Walthers, other quality handguns. Like I said this is a Colt rollmarked with Colt Defense, M4 Carbine Cal. 5.56 mm, serial number LExxxxxx. Very nice gun, I know what it's worth I don't need any experts trying to quiz me or to argue with. Bottom line if you don't want the gun or don't have the cash to boot with a single Glock offer for example, then don't ask about the gun. If the gun is still listed then it's still for sale.

I am selling because I mainly bought it to build a relationship with a cousin of mine who is into older military rifles. He got me interested in older rifles as well but he is now moving away soon to Arkansas and so I won't have anyone to shoot with anymore, so I am getting rid of the gun. I'm going to attach a receipt of purchase from Cabela's to this listing. I bought it for 500 plus 50 dollars sales tax, so I'm already coming off the gun by $100."
