Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Key Features  Patended HK charging supports make pulling the VP slide rearward effortless Enlarged, heavy-duty extractor for reliability also fuctions as a loaded chamber indicator Low profile right side slide release lever Extended Picatinny rail rated to handle lights, lasers, aimers, and other accessory loads up to 5.6 ounces with no impact on performance Trigger Safety Latch Ergonomic grip profiels with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore  During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns.  Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame  A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70.

Grab it now while it is still not considered an SBS and you can avoid paying the tax stamp. It is in great shape have only put about 30 or 40 rounds through it.

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.     HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.     The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.     The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.     Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.   A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.     The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.     The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.     HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.     The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.     VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.     Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719.   Key Features:  Patented HK charging supports make pulling the Vp slide rearward effortless Enlarged, heavy-duty extractor for reliability also functions as a loaded chamber indicator Low profile right side slide release lever Extended Picatinny rail rated to handle lights, lasers, aimers, and other accessory loads up to 5.6 ounces with no impact on performance Trigger safety latch Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference  Technology  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore: During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame: A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.     HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.     The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.     The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.     Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.   A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.     The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.     The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.     HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.     The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.     VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.     Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719.   Key Features:  Patented HK charging supports make pulling the Vp slide rearward effortless Enlarged, heavy-duty extractor for reliability also functions as a loaded chamber indicator Low profile right side slide release lever Extended Picatinny rail rated to handle lights, lasers, aimers, and other accessory loads up to 5.6 ounces with no impact on performance Trigger safety latch Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference  Technology  Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore: During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame: A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

Originally deisgned as a means for persons with limited mobility to operate and fire the AR15 pistol, the custom adaptation of the Stabilizing Brace to the UZI PRO SB takes the application of large frame pistol control and stabilization to a new level. With the IWI brace's unique sidefolding feature, the UZI PRO SB can be fired with or without the brace extended depending on the shooters need. with the brace in the folded position, storage space required in your safe or range bag is minimized In all other respects, the UZI PRO UPP9SB is identical to the UPP9S, a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:  Manual thumb safety Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block  Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states where these magazine capacities are permitted. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard.

A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part.  PicMod Technology:  The Mod2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyMod attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present. This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyMod mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.  Adjustable Gas Block: The Mod2 comes with three easy to use gas block settings.  Position1: Position1 is recommended for all types of ammunition and conditions when not using a suppressor. Position2: Position2 is for use with low powered ammunition when using a suppressor. Position3: Position3 is recommended for normal suppressor use with normal and high powered ammunition.  Superior Fit:  Everything about the Mod2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.  Enhanced Trigger:  The Mod2 comes with an enhanced trigger, set from the factory at a crisp 5.5 pounds. Each trigger is custom adjusted at the factory, to ensure perfect performance, every time you squeeze.  The New Buffer Tube:  The new PWS EBT is impact extruded from 7075 to enhance strength and rigidity, and anodized in mil spec type3 to exceed standards in hardness and corrosion protection. They've added a new Ratchet-Lock Design to eliminate the need to stake the castle nut, and gives a rock solid lock up while being able to be removed easily if needed in the future.  Ambidextrous:  They've added ambidextrous controls for the safety selector, bolt release and mag release to enhance the ease of use.  Furniture & Magazine:  Every Mod2 rifle comes complete with a Bravo Company grip and stock, as well as a lancer magazine.  Specifications:  Weight: 5lb/8.8oz Barrel Length: 7.75"" Overall Length: 24.6"" Gas Piston System: Pistol Barrel Twist: 1:8"

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

There are mars in the stocks on the left lower pistol grip and the bottom rear of the fore stock. A chip has been professionally replaced on the left front fore stock. It has a Rocky Mountain blade front sight, as per letter, and also has a Marbles tang peep sight. This is not mentioned in the letter, but the comb on the butt stock has been either professionally cut back to allow for the it, or done at the factory, as the pictures show. Though the original finish is probably less than 30%, this is a scarce configuration of an ’86 becoming harder and harder to find. As an antique, it will require no FFL for transfer.

Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 4 inch Blue Colt Python, 6 and 4 inch nickel Python.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), chiefs special cs-9 like new, and an engraved unfired Smith model 29-10.Have several 1911 guns in brands such as Rock Island, Thompson Auto Ordnance, Ruger, Springfield Loader Operator MC, and a Para Ordinance 14 45 limited stainless double stack with 4 mags.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome. I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker.
