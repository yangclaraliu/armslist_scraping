This gun was purchased new about 30 or so years back and its only blemish is a mild cylinder line. Its action is very smooth and crisp and to my knowledge it has ever been fired except for perhaps testing at the factory. The grips are beginning to pleasantly show their age with the beginning of that mellow ivory look that only ivory itself can offer. The bluing is 100% and I don't see any blemish on the gun except the already described cylinder line. All the stampings are as they should be and the weapon locks up tight with each cylinder lining up exactly with the bore in the cocked position. All the original papers and the original so marked box will come with the sale. Collectors and the CCW folks may well show an interest here. Small light weight guns seem to be in favor now and certainly the .45 caliber takes no back seat in any deadly encounter one hopes to never face... I do very much appreciate this gun...you can mail me jamessamartini621@gmail.com

A LITTLE HISTORY:  The Remington Model 31 was introduced in 1931 as a successor to the Remington Model 17, and a direct competitor to the Winchester Model 12. Like the Winchester, the Remington used a milled receiver and was fairly expensive to produce. The Model 31 was, and is, known for one of the slickest and smoothest pump actions called, rather erroneously, a “ball bearing action” even though there are no ball bearings to speak of.  The Model 31 was discontinued in 1949 with less than 200,000 made.  Because of the smooth action, the Model 31 found success on the trap circuit where it dominated the classes.  The 31s only problem was Remington built it too well to compete with the Win. model 12, price wise... so they made the less expensive 870 (more stamped parts) and both the 31 and 12 went bye bye."

Maybe 500 rounds down the pipe and that's probably an overstatement.  Cash only and pick up only at my home."

I am selling my like-new Excalibur Ibex crossbow. Owned it for over a year, but only shot it for fun and never actually hunted with it. Had hopes to hunt, but life got in the way. Selling it because it's a closet queen. It comes with a scope, 8 bolts and field points, 3 NAP Spitfire broadheads, 3 4-blade Muzzy broadheads, broad head case and wrench, crossbow target, a cocking string, destringer, and soft travel case. I also installed the shock absorbers to reduce wear on the limbs. The Spitfires fly exactly like a field point. The Muzzys fly in a tight grouping, but require adjusting the scope to the drop. If I've got 100 arrows logged on this thing I'd be stunned. Asking $500 for everything. The crossbow alone is $650 MSRP. It's a very fair deal given everything included. Must pickup in North Raleigh."

I bought this for my girlfriend and she decided she like my Springfield XDS more than the this. So now I am selling this one since I already have a carry pistol. I have the box and everything that came with it and it has very few rounds through it. I am asking $275 and that is a lot less than new from a dealer especially since I don't charge tax. I also have a Kahr CW9 that I am getting rid of too. If you were interested in both I could sell for a packaged price.   I can send pics or answer any questions. Thank you for taking a look.

The 9.0's length stops just past a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures."
