For life. Reason selling, I currently have 4 long-range scopes  and do not need another one. Price paid was $279 from Midway USA. The scope is cheaper now, which I don't know why. The glass, bells and whistles for a third of the price or more. Again never mounted. Just took out of the box for pictures. I will take $130.00 for the Scope. That's the price. I am a avid shooter, so no bullshooting.  If you're looking for a scope that doesn't have the big-name with same or more features  Plus a lifetime replacement not repair warranty, This may be for you.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. Safety The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

There are no import marks so it probably is a ""bring-back"" from that era. As you can see in the many pictures the finish is in great original condition. This pistol is smaller and thinner that the P-08 and P-38 pistols of WWII and the Suhl Sauer was a favorite of the Luftwaffe and German officers who preferred a trimmer side arm. These pistols incorporated a significant amount of modern features and are extremely well made. This pistol was the major influence in all future SIG Sauer designs. Gun functions flawless and will come with one mag, and a few rounds of 32 ACP. REDACTED. Gun could be parted out at well above asking price but would be a shame to. The following has been copied from Wikipedia:The ""H"" in the model number indicates this pistol uses a shrouded hammer as opposed to striker style firing of earlier Sauer models. Other features included a traditional double action trigger, single-column magazine and an action spring surrounding a fixed barrel. A revolutionary feature was the first use of a lever that either cocked or decocked the hammer safely. The hammer on the Sauier 38H could be lowered for safe carry at any time. The cocking feature was necessary due to the shrouded hammer and the decocking mechanism was a safety feature. A hollow space on the trigger indicated if the concealed hammer was cocked; if completely exposed, the hammer was lowered. A small pin protruded at the rear of the slide as a loaded chamber indicator. Another advanced feature for its time was the magazine safety, a device that deactivates the trigger when the magazine is removed from the pistol. Almost all modern pistols manufactured by SIG Sauer today feature a decocking lever, including the highly successful SIG P226 family. Most modern SIG Sauer pistols feature controls in almost the same place as on the Sauer 38H."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have a Hogue or Blackhawk grip and/or Magpul MOE stock I can add, if wanted, just let me know.
$1,380 in cash or will look at good trade offers.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new. 
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

The bluing has been removed, stocks are not original, and there are no box or tools to be found. That said, mechanically and physically, the gun is in amazing shape. I put two boxes of ammo through- .357 and .38, and it worked flawlessly. True to the old school SW spirit, this gun shoots like a god damn dream. Double action pull is smooth and slick, right around about 5.5-6 pounds. Single action is alarmingly light and about a pound or so, and full power .357 was very easy to handle. .38 was laughable, like shooting a large .22 revolver.All that said, Pre model 28s fetch a substantially larger amount of money then there 28-2 or 28-3 counterparts, sometimes well over a grand for pristine examples. Seeing as the box, tools, stocks, and blueing are missing, this clearly isn't that gun; however, it could be. SW will refurbish any revolver to near original state for a little over 200 dollars- or you could rust blue it yourself for 50. Because of all this, I believe 850 is a fair value number- after all it is a shooter grade pre model 28. I will hear any reasonable cash/trade offer, however. As for trades- im looking to stay in large frame handguns, but im a sucker for cool trades so who the hell knows, whatever you got might just be something ive thought about in the past. I will obviously accept cash and trades should your value be lower. Send all trade offers/questions/picture requests/serial number questions BY TEXT to 4eight0-seven10-seven707This is a C&R gun as well, so if you should hold a C&R FFL i am happy to ship out of state.

Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter 9mm and .45ACP.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and $300+/- cash, since I can buy those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  Can ship the upper anywhere for $20 more."

These knives were discontinued by Spydero years ago and they have become hard to acquire collectors pieces. The carraca mechanism works just fine on this one, unlike many others that are listed on ebay. It also has the original box and paperwork. Features premium s30v steel with a 3.8"" blade that I have given a custom 20 degree micro bevel and 15 degree back bevel as recomended by Spyderco. This helps maintain the edge much longer than a thinner edge, but allows for more efficient cutting at the same time with the thinner back bevel. Only wear is on the left side of the bolster, and it is some very minor and light scuffs. People are asking between 200-400 dollar for this knife on ebay and you cannot find them in stores. Face to face cash transaction only. ""First noted in 15th century Spain among Gypsies and Gitanos, the Navaja folding knife was used for work, utility and protection. They’re shaped similarly to barbering razors or novacula, meaning razor in Spanish. Modern definition categorizes it as a modified clip-point with an unsharpened concave spine swedge. Unique to the Navaja is the Carraca or ratcheting sound produced when opening or closing the blade. It announces the knife’s presence and is believed to raise anxiety and anticipation, deterring criminals. Ed Schempp’s modernized Navaja has a carbon fiber handle, stainless steel bolsters, pocket clip and the Carraca (ratcheting sound), maintaining the mystique of the Navaja."""

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago or so and just sat in the safe.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have a Hogue or Blackhawk grip and/or Magpul MOE stock I can add, if wanted, just let me know.
$1,380 in cash or will look at good trade offers.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new. 
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

I have since moved on to a bigger handgun and am looking to make a sale. I have put somewhere to 700-1000 rounds through this handgun and it worked every time. I have never had a malfunction, and I have only used Winchester white box hollow points and FMJ's. I have cleaned after every use as well lightly cleaned and lubricated weekly while being used as my CCW. The trigger feels great and it really disappears on your person. Perfect for those who have their LTCF or looking to get their LTCF and are interested in the single stacks. There is slight wear on the front, top of the slide from the holster, but barely noticeable.The gun comes with a blade tech holster and an extra magazine(45-50 dollars in value). I personally very much liked the Bladetech as a small holster at a very reasonable price. It is super durable. Also the orange dummy magazine, magazine, nice Ruger clothe pouch, and gun lock that came with the gun is included. 400 dollars and there is a ffl dealer in my area that can do a transfer for 20 bucks. Thank you!"

Regular MSRP is $399.99 My loss, your gain.  Here is the description from BSA:The Tactical Mil-Mil is not your average BSA. Made with premium components and designed to withstand the rigors of tactical use, this scope features fully multi-coated lenses and a glass etched first focal plane reticle. The side focus makes parallax adjustment a breeze while the resettable finger adjustable turrets allow you to easily return to zero. This scope features resettable 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a MRAD reticle. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the MRAD reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each long line is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 MILs low the shooter needs to convert the MILs to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With this rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 MILs low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 MILs or 15 clicks. The MRAD reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is. These features are usually only found in very expensive scopes, but BSA brings you this exclusive high quality scope at a very reasonable price.
