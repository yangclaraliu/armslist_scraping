It comes with one orignal 14 rund mag and another with the thicker base plate, plus a case but not original to the gun. This was the first attempt by S&W to produce a 14 rounds double stack 9mm beginning in 1971 and the early productin models had some jamming issues, this one is a late serial number probably produced around 1980 so functions perfrectly from what I've seen and shooting it with hollow points and FMJ.

The bolt carrier itself is plated with Titanium Nitride, which is the yellow-gold color you see in the pictures below. TiN is an extremely hard ceramic material, often used as a coating on titanium alloys, tool steel, stainless steel, carbon steel and other metallic components to improve the substrate's surface properties.  Common applications include aerospace parts, military components, medical implants, cutting tools, industrial parts, manufacturing dies / molds and dental and orthodontic appliances.  TiN is a beautiful gold color and is often used as a wear resistant alternative to elemental gold plating.  Applied as a thin coating, TiN is used to provide a hard surface to protect cutting and sliding surfaces and for decorative purposes (due to its gold appearance).  It is also used as a non-toxic barrier on the exterior of medical implants and jewelry.  TiN has a low coefficient of friction and an operating temperature of more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  In most applications a coating of less than 5 micrometers (0.00020 in) is applied.   We apply TiN using a technique called cathodic arc PVD, or physical vapor deposition.  This method is environmentally friendly and produces a functional coating unlike some other methods which are strictly decorative in nature.  Our coatings comply with aerospace specification AMS 2444A. Benefits of TiN coating:   Hard, scratch and wear resistant Lubricious, corrosion and chemical resistant Beautiful gold color No appreciable build-up to interfere with firearm operation Cost effective alternative to Gold plating"

We machine the 17-4 into the Surge 762’s mount and expansion chamber. This provides an unmatched strength-to-weight ratio, while minimizing the distortion normally associated with heat treat and welding processes. Its baffles are made from Stellite™ for peak heat and abrasion resistance. And finally, we strategically place the engraving over the thickest cross section of the tube for fast and easy replacement should the suppressor become damaged beyond repair.Introducing our Unconditional Lifetime Warranty.If something happens to your Surge 762—say you drop it from a mountaintop—Rugged will fix it or replace it free of charge.West Chester Firearms LLC7738 West Chester RdWest Chester OH 45069(513) 443-2224https://www.facebook.com/WestChesterFirearmsLlcwww.westchesterfirearms.comMonday-Friday 9:00am-6:000pmAll firearms listed on Armslist are also available in our store.

The removable booster extension allows the user to configure the length of the suppressor to fit their needs. The silencer is user serviceable ensuring long, high performance service life. The front caps can be interchanged for smaller calibers with 9mm and 22 caliber front caps, available separately. 17-4 stainless heat treated baffles, with anti-rotation (Return To Zero) Geometry features, ensure maximum strength and sound performance. The booster assembly includes a piston for a turnkey suppressor system out of the box. Included take down tools allow for an easy and satisfying end user maintenance experience. Additional pistons, fixed barrel spacers, an integral 3 lug adapter, and fixed direct thread mounts are available to support the Revolution in any configuration the end user could desire. High quality, industry leading performance, strength, unparalleled feature functionality, build quality, and price make the Revolution a clear winner in the modular class of silencers. The Rev 45 can also be configured into a short (K) configuration by removing the stainless black oxide external booster housing extension and collapsing the booster housing or 3 lug assembly into the silencer tube. This configuration is best used wet. By adding 5cc's of rem oil, wire pulling gel, or some other ablative medium sound suppression can be dampened extremely well in the short configuration. The Rev 45 is shipped in it's full size configuration with an included .578x28 booster piston to run on your 45acp pistol barrels. However the user can swap out the included piston with other pistons for use on 40 S&W, or 9mm. Additionally our integral 3 lug 9mm QD assembly can be interfaced if desired to run on 9mm MP5's, AR carbines, or any 9mm wearing a standard 3 lug coupler. The Revo 45 is also rated for 300 BLK Subsonic with use of the Revolution Fixed barrel spacer (available separately). The Return to Zero baffles key together so that every time you disassemble the silencer and put it back together you can achieve the same baffle orientation so that your point of impact shift will remain the same negating the need to re-zero your carbine or pistol after servicing.

An early hit for Colt, when the Lightning was introduced in 1884, it was regarded as handy and relatively reliable sporting arm. While popular at first, the model was quickly surpassed by the lever guns of the day and retired in 1904. Now highly sought after by collectors, examples in this condition are quite uncommon in the collector's market and this rifle would make an excellent addition to the advanced collection. Is excellent with the rifle showing no rust or pitting on any metal surface. Bluing is better than 95%, with only mild fading and light spots of oxidation. The markings are legible and generally crisp, with the roll marked address and caliber marking appearing weakly struck or possibly buffed. Walnut furniture is in excellent condition, with wood standing proud of metal at nearly all points of contact, the furniture remarkably appears all-original. Beautifully figured, it features very fine hand-checkering that shows little signs of wear, apart from one sizable abrasion on the left of the slide. Mechanically, the gun appears flawless."

Designed in 3D CAD and CNC machined to +-.001 tolerance. All critical features as referenced from the front pivot pin. Includes two sizes of pins (small for engraving, and large for milling), and the hardware to hold the lower to each half when it's laid on its side for engraving/drilling. These are trued blocks prior to machining the locating holes, so the user has the utmost confidence when referencing any plane for setup. The method of using 1/4"" pins in the jigs to hold the lower in place is far more accurate and reliable than a through bolt design.   To mark the FCG holes, you would drill a 1/8"" bit through the three respective holes. You could then hand drill/ream the holes to final size (trigger, hammer, selector).   $50 shipped CONUS.
