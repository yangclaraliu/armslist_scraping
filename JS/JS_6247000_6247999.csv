The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed. Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability. Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics. Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired. Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface. Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.

I did not bother to photograph the factory box and papers, but I do have them and they will be provided with the gun. You can even register the warranty with Smith and Wesson as the owner, because I have not yet done so.
I purchased this firearm for use in a training class, but it was never actually used, and has never been loaded, carried, or shot. It is new in all respects and has lived its short life with me in a gun safe. I just do not think that I will get a chance to use it in the classes I teach because I have many other smaller revolvers that are more popular with students. So, I'm going to sell it  or possibly trade it for something else. But for anyone who wants a top-of-the-line heavy frame .357 Magnum built with no compromises, this is the gun for you.
So here is the part I hope you will read carefully. This is a NEW gun, and is NOT being sold at used gun prices. If you purchase it from me, you will save a significant amount of money compared to buying it over the counter in a retail store. If you did that, you would be paying over $750 out the door. My price is less, but if you send me a lowball offer, you will just be wasting your time and mine. So let's be reasonable.
The next thing I hope you will read and understand is that the only place you can buy this particular revolver from me is at my office in Homestead. Even though I put this in every ad, I am still contacted by people who apparently cannot read, asking me to bring them the gun somewhere else. The answer to that is NO. I have mobility issues and cannot travel very far. So, if you do not want to come to my office in Homestead to do the transaction, I can't really help you. I can be very flexible about appointment times for you to come here though.
With all of that said, if you want to buy a new gun, and save some money while doing it, contact me. I will give you a fair deal, but I'm not desperate and not gving this gun away. Buyer needs to have a Florida Driver's license, a Concealed Handgun Permit, and must be legally able to own a firearm. A Bill of Sale will be provided.
I'm open to trades on top quality firearms, usually handguns. Feel free to let me know what you have. Deals that are part-gun, part-cash are welcome as well."

Great collectible piece of military history. Has a nice cartouche, great wood, and good metal. Bluing has turned brown/patina in some places. Bore appears to have decent rifling but shows some wear as I would imagine a 115 year would. Looks like a soldier lightly inscribed the name ""Lee"" in the stock. Action is buttery smooth and functions perfectly. I have fired this and it shot fine. This has the 1901 sight which can adjust for windage which is awesome. The rear sight is missing a screw on the slide lock, which isn't noticeable or a big deal. Face to face transactions only, no felons, must be WI resident.

This stock is one of our most accurate stocks, the current version is guaranteed for ½ MOA accuracy. It also takes Accuracy International magazines. The bolt and the receiver are nitrided too.""  Further according to them, ""it was made before we converted to our new ERP system so we cant track back that far. It was made approx. 4-5 years ago, which is when we had changed over to the new system and when we stopped using Remington actions in our rifles.""  The TFM™ designation stands for ""Tactical Force Multiplier"". For those in the know, this rifle is aptly named. Over the last two years, the TFM has gained some quiet traction with the tactical world. The price tag is expensive. However, this truly tactical rifle performs to the very highest of standards.  There is simply nothing like the TFM™out there. The full-length integral rail, with 20 MOA taper offers the operator the ability to dial any number, for any ""long distance"" call. Lighter weight for faster deployment and extraction. The design of this rifle is unparalled. HALF MOA accuracy is guaranteed. The machined bottom metal accepts AI magazines, and others. Many manufacturers might call a modified hunting rifle a tactical rifle. But we know the difference. The TFM™ is a purpose-built tactical rifle; built for the world of uncertainty that's out there.Bolt-Action: based on Remington 700.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.
One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.
On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.
During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS.

It's the smallest, most easily concealed 1911, and is loaded with features you'd expect from a superior firearm. The 3"" stainless steel match-grade barrel delivers outstanding accuracy. The long, aluminum, match-grade trigger breaks cleanly at 5-6 lbs. The fixed, low-profile combat rear sight and dovetail front sight have three tritium dots for easy viewing in low light. A dual-spring, full-length guide rod recoil system makes the EMP pleasing to shoot and cycle flawlessly. Forged aluminum-alloy frame with durable black hardcoat finish reduces weight. Forged stainless steel satin finish contrasts nicely with the handsome thinline cocobolo hardwood grips.

This stunning Browning A-bolt Medallion is manufactured in Japan by Miroku using premium walnut for the stock and the unmatched quality of Japanese steel for the remainder of the gun. This particular model had a very limited production run making this a collector's item as well as a gentleman hunter's ideal rifle. The Medallion boasts a muzzle break to aid in recoil control due to the lightweight frame of the rifle chambered in the extremely powerful .325 WSM cartridge which has had immense success in both North America and the African plains for larger more exotic game. Additionally, this rifle has brand new Leupold dovetail mounts and rings alongside a Burris Fullfield III 4.5X14-50mm optic with a paralax adjustment. This added bonus is backed completely by the Burris ""No Questions Asked"" lifetime warranty on the optic meaning that any issues or damage to the scope can be covered in full after a short drive to Greeley to their facilities! It is extremely rare to find this rifle in captivity let alone finding one with an optic at such a low price!"
