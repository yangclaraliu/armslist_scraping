Want to extend your effective shooting range at distances where bullet drop and wind drift become critical? Take a look at the Viper HS LR riflescope. The LR stands for long range — and we mean it. This riflescope features an exposed target-style elevation turret built for dialing elevation at extended ranges. The capped windage turret maintains the scope’s sleek lines and prevent it from hanging up on clothing, rifle cases or pack scabbards.
Viper HS LR riflescopes feature an advanced optical system highlighted with a 4x zoom range for magnification versatility. A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily. Built on an ultra-strong 30mm one-piece machined aluminum tube for increased windage and elevation travel and optimal adjustment."

I tried a few in a bolt gun, they chamber fine, a little on the tight side, so it may be advisable to run them through your own full length sizing die before loading just to be sure since there can be variance from die to die and chamber to chamber.

Great gun but I now hunt in rifle territory. Have Leupold Ultimate Slam with BDC reticle which really makes a great combo.  Cabelas has the 212 listed @ $750 new  Ultimate slam @ $299 = $1,050 TOTAL.  I'd sell both for $900.  That's $150 off a gun that has only been used once target shooting on the range at the farm.  Plus I tested out every major brand of sabot slugs to find the ones that shot the best which were the 2 3/4"" Federal's w/Barnes Expanders (you can see the grouping in my picture I posted)(this is another couple hundred dollar expense you can avoid since I did all the testing for you)  I also tested Winchester Supremes, Remington Accutips, Hornady, Brenneke you name it I spent probably $200 on every kind of sabot I could get my hands on & the Federal's shot the best out of this gun in particular.This is a really great shotgun for those who hunt in ""shotgun only""  I had the 212's predecessor the 210F which was accurate as can be.  A friend of mind had the 210 before that & shot a deer @ 253 yards with the laser range finder (true story).  What can I say, the accutrigger is amazing.  The camo finish is great.  Ergonomics feel good in my hands.  Once sighted in this thing shoots where you point it & the BDC reticle on the Leupold scope works like a charm  I set mine to 200 yards and would feel confident shooting a whitetail at that range any day.Sadly right after I bought this gun I bought my own house with acreage in rifle territory and let's be honest... if I can use a rifle I'm going to.  But for those that are in ""shotgun only"" territory... this is the slugger for you."

If you have a used/pre-owned firearm for sale, we can talk via email- and, depending on condition, color and usage, etc, I will make you a reasonable offer and/or you can let me know what kind of price you're looking to get for it.I am serious buyer that's in the market to buy one of these firearms VERY soon so don't hesitate to contact me if you have one for sale or trade.I would also consider trading a S&W SD9VE (9MM PISTOL) + cash for a CZ Scorpion. The SD9VE is literally brand new as I just spent $325 for it last week and it has not been used or even cleaned, or anything of the sort. It has no blemishes, and includes everything that it came with from the factory: two metal mags, a lock and two keys, the original S&W box, and all original paperwork.

As a result of that discussion we designed and made custom tsubas for authentic Katanas. The tsuba has the Nakwach, a symbol for brotherhood (top); the Eagle Feather, a symbol for honor (right); and the Oak, a symbol for strength (left).  We bought the swords from a Chinese sword maker who used modern techniques to produce reasonably accurate blades. This is a dual forge folded carbon steel katana (pattern welded). It is constructed by layering two different monosteel billet, forged and folded 6 to 7 times to generate a Damascus appearance.. The tsuka (handle) is pegged and hand wrapped with black cord over rayskin. The saya (scabbard) is traditional black lacquered wood. These swords are great for display and also fine for light cutting.I still have a few of these swords. This would be an awesome thing to give your son or anyone else you consider a brother. My cost for the sword before making the custom tsuba was $200 and that's all I'm trying to get out of them. Swords of this quality sell for $350 - $500.FTF cash preferred but I will take Paypal and ship for an additional $25"

All control can be used on either side and the bullets eject straight down by the butt of the stock. It is incredibly lightweight and rugged and has a 4 pound trigger pull, unlike the Tavor's extremely tiring 10+ pound trigger pull. In my personal opinion, this bullpup beats the tavor our in every way, but that is just one man's opinion. In side by side reviews of both guns being used on a course, there is no definitive winner but the RDB DOES cost a couple hundred bucks less and can be used ambidextrously without casings flying in your face. (NOT INCLUDED) angled foregrip, lantac dragon, windowed Pmag, and OPTIC.The first pisture is my personal RDB and the second picture is my wifes and THE ACTUAL rifle you will be gettingMy price is $1,250 FIRM for this BRAND NEW rifle. I will NOT accept lower offers, I am NOT interested in trades, cash only. Lowballers will be ignored.I'm sorry, but I don't care if you ""think"" you found a better deal online. The only online Store that still has these in stock is Kentucky Gun Co. and they have it for $1,441 OTD so i'm BEATING their price by OVER $160, plus no Form 4473 hassle for you. Auction websites ""Say"" they are less but then when you look at the ""Buy it now"" price it's much higher. Plus they ALWAYS post it at the ""CASH PRICE"" so if you use ANY OTHER payment method, the price raises exponentially. AND, people time and time again fail to take into consdieration that all those auction vendors charge tax (if they are in Texas), a 3-4% credit card fee, $30-$50 shipping, and you STILL have to pay your FFL fee!!!Don't message me saying  that you found a better price. I truly DON'T CARE. BUY IT... if you really did. Message me at 210TWO68FIVE131 I am located in San Antonio but will be in houston tomorrow (1/26/17) around noon for a few hours. We can meet somewhere around I-10 and Sam houston tollway intersection. Can meet around here.PRICE IS $1,250 FIRM!!!Buyer MUST have a valid TXDL and must NOT be a felon.
