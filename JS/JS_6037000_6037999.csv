Keltec is one of the newest and most innovative firearms builder that has come along in a long time. The Kel-Tec SU16CA is a rare find in this area. With a 30 round clip in the main feed and holding two more 10 round magazines in the stock it's the only rifle I know of that holds 50 rounds as part of the weapon. The SU16 fires .223 carbine rounds (5.56x45). This rifle is light weight polymer framed, easy to operate and very accurate. It is gas operated semi-automatic piston driven and has the best features of both the AR and AK as it uses the same piston/op rod as the AK  but the bolt/breach lock as the AR. The action sees no gas or debris and runs clean for many hundreds of rounds before cleaning. Chrome lined barrel fires brass or steel case ammo equally as well. Light 4.7 lbs. stock weight magazines are interchangeable with AR clips. Best Grab and Go rifle made with patented folding stock only 26"" when folded fits in backpack for hiking. Comes with extra purchased Bushnell red dot aim mounted see pic and three Kal-tec 10 round magazines. Three 30 round mags pre-ban are available for an additional  $30.00 each. Also equipped with a fire suppressor barrel tip see pictures. Only one box of rounds fired through this weapon, mint clean like new condition. Many options for sale by Kal-tec see their website including pistol grip AR15 type stock but still folding stock. Priced to sell. I bought it for my girlfriend but too much gun for her. My loss your gain."

The barrel uses the popular and versatile 223 Wylde chamber, which has a longer throat than the SAAMI spec for 223 Remington to allow for the safe usage of 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and enhanced reliability. However, accuracy potential is also greater than a 5.56 NATO chamber due to slightly tighter tolerances, making the 223 Wylde an ideal compromise that retains the benefits of both of the other two chamber options. This Medium Contour Barrel is manufactured from 416R Stainless Steel and uses 5R Rifling with a 1 in 8"" Twist. It is fluted along its length for greater stiffness, faster cooling and reduced weight. Additional features include a Mid Length Gas Port, M4 Feed Ramps and 1/2""-28 threaded muzzle. Barrel extension and locator pin are both included and installed at the factory."

Will trade for pretty much any other firearms since I have acquired something else for alternative method hunting and will never use this. Will take a shotgun rifle or pistol. It does not come with scope or mounts but is drilled for mounts. Email with offers. Thanks
