As far as I know, she spent her entire life working on a farm in Gainesville, Georgia. In 1978, the farmer who owned her decided to take her apart, perhaps to restore her after 25 years of service. Something must have happened because the farmer never did put her back together and she sat in the barn from 1978 until 2010, when the barn caught fire and burned to the ground. Fortunately, Jolene was saved as she was rolled out of the barn before she herself caught fire. In 2011, a fireman named ""Kyle"" bought the farm and moved onto the property. Jolene was included and he decided it would be best to find a new home for her. By chance he drove by the Village Garage shop in the East Village of Atlanta and spotted a very similar 1951 Dodge on the property, so he went in to talk to the owner of the shop, ""Mike"". Mike was into vintage cars and 2 months later, they had Jolene trucked over to his shop."

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less, sorry.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

This was my edc and it is comfortable in both iwb and owb holsters. This is the slim line the frame is thinner than the 30 and the 30s is just a 30 frame with a 36 slide. So it's thinner than both of them. It feels really good in the hand and as I said shoots great. If you were to buy the gun sights and connector it would cost you 785 give or take a few dollars for taxes. So 570 is pretty fair as far as I'm concerned.

The AR15 Lite Rail III™ is the third generation of Lite Rail from Daniel Defense. The improved design enhances the rail’s structural integrity, improves functionality, ergonomics, aesthetics and ease of installation to the weapon system without compromising its best-known attributes, one of which being the lightest rail system on the market. Enhanced features include a machined one-piece design, replacing the previous two-piece welded design of the 1st generation Lite Rail, and uses Daniel Defense's patented Bolt-Up System. The AR15 Lite Rail III™ requires only 4 bolts instead of 6 and has tabs that aid in alignment to the upper receiver during installation. Front and Rear Sling Swivel Attachment Points are integrated into both the left and right side rails and are designed to limit the swivel’s rotation preventing twists and tangles in slings.
AR15 Lite Rail III™ 9.0 free float rail system was designed to work with Mid-length AR15 gas systems and its exceptionally light weight makes it perfect for short rifles where size and weight are crucial performance attributes."

The Colt M16K looks and functions just like most modern day tactical folding pocket knives, however, it is also a cleverly built automatic knife that fully conceals the optional spring-action release.Use the thumb-stud to slowly strut the blade out into the open position, or, press on the hidden lever and the blade quickly snaps out under spring pressure with a symphony of clicks!The closed length is 4½ inches with a blade length of 3½ inches.The housing is made of lightweight aluminum with a black Magna-grip rubberized coating that resists moisture and insulates against extreme cold while providing a secure grip.It has a belt/pocket clip that is embossed with the world-famous COLT logo, and their Stallion trademark is also etched on the blade.In 1999, when Colt released this unique switchblade to the public, they only made a limited production run before selling the patent to another knife manufacturer. These knives are no longer in production. As as shown in the photo, two of these knives are available. I am willing to sell individually or as a pair. The knives are in great condition. Blades are pristine. Only minor scuffs/scratches on the handles. Original black boxes included (one is damaged).

Also included are a set of Ahrends Red Stained Maple grips ($90 new, I think) and a Bianchi leather holster ($65 new).

You're getting a hell of a deal. Will sell just the revolver for $750, HiViz sight includedhttps://www.smith-wesson.com/firearms/performance-center-pro-series-model-686-plusI can also add 500 rounds of 357mag ammo - Geco 158gr FMJ in an ammo can - for $200As a bonus bit of knowledge, I have a friend who has several of the Colt Snake guns. Says the single action on this gun beats his Colt Pythons and the double action is a close second. I never got to appreciate a good trigger and it's affect on performance before this gun."
