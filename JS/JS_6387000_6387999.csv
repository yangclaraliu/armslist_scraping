I bought it a while back for $450 off a buddy. It has an issue with double feeding; sometimes the spent casing doesn't eject quickly enough and the next round will jam trying to feed. Also the forward assist is tight as hell and gets super jammed. Unfortunately I don't have the time or knowledge to keep trying to figure it out, and would rather just get rid of it at cost or take a loss on it.  I suppose I will have to just live with my other two AR 15s.

It has not been converted or had been fired very often. it does need a new dustcover (dirt cheap) because the first owner tried to install a cheesy pic-rail cover to mount a scope. The receiver does not have mag dimples, which i've been told mean it has a reinforced front trunnion. Bore looks pristine, action is smooth. I haven't gotten around to converting it because i just don't care for shooting SA rifles as opposed to shooting shotguns, pistols, revolvers... just about anything else. I'm more tempted now that .223 is back around and cheaper than it was.I don't know exactly what to ask for the rifle, but it is in good shape and matching, except for the dustcover which is no big deal, theyre practically universal. It was less common than other calibers of Saigas and they're forever banned from pruduction. So i'll simply entertain offers. I couldn't even find one for sale online that was comparable to get a starting point. There's not another online i can find! I'm not a fool though, i see these goingfully  converted for high prices. theyre popular with the split AK/AR crowd who want the better 5.56 of the AR along with the better long-stroke piston driven action of an ak that gives it such reliability. rifle is very accurate for an AK too. I'd put it up against any AR that's not specifically made to be a high precision rifle.thanks for looking!email is the best way to stay in touchREDACTED"

$980 in cash or best trade offer.  Bud's has this one for $1,160 right now, so after your FFL fee, you still save over $200 on a like new(except for being fired) pistol. 
Prefer cash, but will consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others.  AR-15 & AR-10 receivers, parts, FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers etc.  Law Tactical Gen 3-M & side-charge upper receiver.
AR uppers in 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel.

Has polished barrel and feed ramp, and is equipped with 3 - 15 round mags, and Warren Tactical fiber optic sights, Oversized plain Back rear sight and red ultra bright front sight for easey sight picture. The gun has a ZEV Technologies Fulcrum Ultimate Trigger. If your not familair with ZEV. You need to do some research. The ZEV Fulcrum is THE BEST on the market and currently holds several world records. The Fulcrum Ultimate Kit comes with all the components to replace the entire factory firing assembly. New Stainless Strikerwith striker combat spring, Stainless Safty Plunger and spring. Currently pulls 3.3-3.5 lbs. I also will include the 2.5 lbs trigger for you gun nuts that love to tinker.  The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy. Because of ZEV's proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.The trigger's crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user's ability to ride the reset to improve follow up shot speed and placement.The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.The overall trigger travel is pre-set to allow for a shorter pull, and faster reset.ZEV Ultimate Trigger system 255$Warren Tactical Sights - 90$Battle Worn Glock 19 - 599$Extra Mag - 25$Will include all orginal parts for the gun as well. Looking to see what is out there.Love the gun and open to cash offers but I do NOT need to sell.
