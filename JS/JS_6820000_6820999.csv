Great gun, smooth bolt movement, crisp trigger, smaller bolt throw than my Remington. I want to say 60 or 70 degrees? Comes with EGW rail installed. No scope, saving that for a later project. Would make a fantastic long range shooter, as the .260 shoots like a laser. Very ballistically similar to the 6.5 Creedmore. Can include the tilting bipod for a little extra, else it's going on my varmint AR. Absolutely gorgeous gun. Definitely going to build up one of these in the future, but it isn't in the budget right now, so it's got to go. Thanks for looking!"

I checked these out on Numrich and the total was silly, well over $300 when a complete revolver was only around $150+. Don't want to separate so buy what you need and have some spares or sell them yourself. Price includes shipping. Everything is in good shape except the cylinder (22 Mag) shows a little wear and the bluing on the end of the 4-3/4 inch barrel (inside holster RH) shows bluing wearing off. The barrel looks very good inside and doesn't look like it was shot much. Every thing else looks good, normal wear on the grips. Will ship directly to you as there are no serial numbers. Shipping will be the same or next day that I receive a USPS money order in the mail. I have done several deals on Armslist and have not had any complaints. Serious only please, email me with a phone # and I will call or text and answer any questions and give you my address. Thanks"

I bought this gun due to the popularity of the 1911, but have not shot it once. After doing more research, I'm just not a huge fan of the .45ACP.I have the gun (like brand new condition), case, two 8 shot magazines, and a box of 50 rounds of round ball ammo.Thanks!Please contact me if interested, or have a trade in mind.REDACTED (Text)"
