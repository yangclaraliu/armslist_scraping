I had no problem with drilling out the x-ring of a standard NRA target at 7 yards. Similarly, a steel plate rack at 10 yards can be cleared with no problem. Even at 25 yards, head shots on a silhouette are easy to come by. This is due in part to the revolver’s excellent adjustable rear sight, and high visibility red ramp front sight. This revolver is also set up for using moonclips, which hold all seven rounds as a single unit for ease of loading and unloading. A discussion of the pros and cons of moonclips is unfortunately beyond the scope of this article. The utility of moonclips in a defensive revolver is open to debate–but there is no drawback to having the cylinder cut to accept them. With this 686 Plus, you have the option of using moonclips or not.  Even with the short barrel, this 686 Plus offers strong ballistic performance with Magnum loads. I tested four different brands of premium defensive ammo, and all produced average muzzle velocity in excess of 1,100 feet per second. At these velocities, you should be able to expect excellent performance from modern expanding jacketed hollow point bullets."

Great addition for any collector or anyone who likes a quality handgun.  The 686 ""No Dash"" Models where the very first 686 models to hit the market back in the early 1980's. Pre-Lock is prior to S&W installing hammer locks, which have a fear of locking up a gun during use. This revolver features a 4 inch Barrel, great all around size for accuracy and carrying. The Stainless Steel finish is beautiful as are the original Wood Grips. It is chambered in .357 Magnum.
I've tried to show the overall condition in my photo’s, no surprises. I do have many more, just email me and I will send these to you.   I shot this handgun twice (approx 50 rounds total) since I purchased it 3 years ago after the original owner passed away. Shoots very well and accurate. These triggers are phenomenal to say the least. I have another 686 that I customized and shoot often.   These 686 ""No Dash / Pre-Lock"" Models keep going up in value it seems like literally every day. Smith & Wesson Revolvers are becoming the new ""Gold Standard"" among investors in this condition and including the original paperwork & box. It's a great time piece for any collector.Thanks for looking."

The pistol will come with all of the factory items as well as a full box of Hornady Critical Duty 9mm +P ammo, a factory Glock extended slide release, and an IWB holster from Reign Tactical. The holster is a right hand, fixed 30 degree cant, in the waist holster in Reign's Battledrab Carbon Fiber. For those unfamiliar with Reign, they produce a very high quality kydex product which requires roughly up to a 3 month wait to receive your order. New I paid $75 for the holster plus shipping and tax. Total in all of the above I have $725 including tax and shipping fees and no I will not separate the above items. My price is FIRM at $500 cash and any offer below that will not warrant a response because of your inability to read.

If you can find these they go for 250-300 and it has over 100.00 worth of ammo with it and additional mag(25-30.00) steel guide rod(12.50). It's a Fair deal!

I will also include the 922r parts kit minus the stock that comes with as well, if you want it. I have used this stock for about 6 months and put about 500 rounds through the Scorpion with it attached. I managed to find a complete 922r kit for a non-inflated price and picked it up, so I don't need 2 stocks for the same gun. The stock does fold and lock up nice and tight and has no blemeshes on it at all. All mounting parts are included. Please do note that this is a stock and not a brace, adding it to your Evo is creating an SBR. I cannot be held liable if you do not have a completed form 1. I did have this posted before but some of the responses were way out there so I remade it to be more direct. I may be willing to ship but payment for both the stock and shipping costs must be received upfront."

A further evolution of the 75 B Ω, the new Convertible version allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.

Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions.Some of the hardest guns for me to sell as I consolidate down to just a couple are the ones that would be so difficult to replace. That is the case with the oldest model of a Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special that I have owned. It is a pre-Model 36 version J-frame built in 1956. That's right...this classic snubnose revolver is sixty years old but you couldn't tell it by looking at or shooting it. Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this pre-Model 36 Flat Latch J-frame Chiefs Special has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder and can be fired in single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a blued finish and has the original diamond-type wood grips with serial numbers that match the round butt frame.This classic S&W revolver is in great condition for its age. There is some honest holster wear on the bottom front of the frame and muzzle and a small chip in the bottom of the upper portion of the right wood grip. This gun was carried some but only occasionally fired. Very clean and shiny bore and cylinders with no rust or damage on this gun. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.I have fired 50 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is one that is of the age it could be put away in a collection to fondle and admire, but is also dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures."

Mdl: 051815490    3.625” Barrel     MSRP: $639.99
Browning’s 1911-22 has made .22 popular again. This high strength, light weight, A1 style compact is constructed with a polymer frame design and was originally introduced in 2011. Gun reviews have been favorable attesting to the design and contruction holding up well. Weighs under a pound when loaded and fits both large and small hands while still retaining the safety and “manual of arms” of the original John Browning 1911 full size with blowback slide action and single-action trigger.
Standard features include stainless steel barrel block, target crown, machined aluminum slide, fixed sights, detachable steel 10 round magazine, manual thumb and grip safeties. But this gun comes in a compact 6.5” length overall which is approximately 85% the size of a full size 1911.
The “Black Label” models have enhanced features such as laminated and stippled grips with checkered frontstrap, matte black finish, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, Beavertail grip safety, Commander style hammer and extended slide release.
This gun is New In Box and never shot or registered for the warranty. Comes in the original ABS factory case with all factory options and documents. Local delivery in Wichita or the surrounding communities available if purchaser has a CCW. Otherwise gun will be shipped from my FFL for a flat rate of $25.00 paid by buyer in addition to purchase price shipped to your FFL. Buyer is responsible for his/her own FFL fees.
At the most recent Wichita area gun show there was only one 1911-22 and that wasn’t a close match to this gun as it was a used, earlier specimen with the first generation “flat” black finish selling for $525 without the case and paperwork.
Yes. The base Browning 1911-22 with pink grips or the tan frame is available at various stores for $499.99. But add to that tax. And then consider that it is the base model without the “Black Label” enhanced options. You’ll especially appreciate the Beavertail grip safety on the one for sale."
