Pistol is in good condition with some light signs of use. The pistol functions flawlessly, the only issue is with the magazine. The mag is a preban which holds 32 rounds of 9mm, but is damaged. If you only load 20 rounds or so, it functions perfectly. If you try to load more than 20 rounds, the mag gets bound up and the pistol jams. It'll keep jamming every shot untill there's 20 rounds remaining. Once the mag has about 20 rounds remaining, it fires perfectly. I confirmed that the mag is the issue (not the pistol) with a friends' tec-9 mag, it worked flawlessly. These mags can be found at just about any gun show, they're not that expensive.

I wanted to make sure I built a rifle with no issues as some 7.62x39 ARs have and I accomplished that goal. It's surprisingly light weight and very comfortable to shoulder and carry around on a sling. However, I'm thinning the herd of my ARs, currently have 5, and my 6920, .308, and my trainer 5.56 AR with a FN barrel are the ones staying.Just the rifle, 2 20 round magazines, and Magpul Pro iron sights is $600.00SERIOUS BUYERS ONLYTrades: ACOG, snub nose revolvers: specifically LCR in .22LR or Chiappa Rhino in .357 mag.

The furniture is all iron.  Case colors are very good.  Wood and wood finish are very good.  The barrel is slightly fading in color.  Overall an excellent Schuetzen rifle that has recently been shot competitively and can be again."
