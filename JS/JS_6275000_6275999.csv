Have you wanted a rifle that accurately shoots a bullet over 80g in weight? How about the ability to train with ammo that costs under .30 cents a round? If you're answering yes to these questions, you need to own this 6.5 Grendel rifle! This rifle started life as your typical 5.56. After doing several month of research I decided to build three 6.5 Grendel rifles. This is one of those. If you were to ask Bill Alexander what is his ideal barrel length for the round, he would say 18"". To him, it gives you the best balance, with the lowest sacrifice to velocity. Why am I selling it then? I built a 23"" 6.5 AR, and I own a 16.5"" 6.5 VEPR. I have my short and long covered, so this one really doesn't get used. If you wanted to buy into a 6.5 AR, and experience the best overall, with a significant savings, this is the perfect choice! Lets talk about the rifle, and what you are buying. It was built on a Spikes Tatical Punisher lower. Inside the lower is the Spikes Enhanced lower parts kit, LaRue MBT trigger, KNS anti-rotation pins, Spikes D2 Enhanced buffer, MFT Minimalist stock, Yankee extended takedown pins, Houge grip, and Magpul BAD lever with trigger guard. Topping the lower is Midstate Firearms upper with Gen II slim handguard. Im including the original 16.5"" Government Profile, Mid length gas, 4150 1:7 twist, Nitrided 5.56 barrel and bolt that I replaced. What sits in it now is a Matched Odin Works 18"" SS 6.5 Grendel barrel and bolt. Matching your barrel and bolt at the manufacturer helps to guarantee accuracy. Odin Works hand lapps each barrel after final turning. They aren't shy on the quality, as each barrel comes with a 1MOA guarantee! You will also get the Mueller 3-9x40 Duplex scope in Nicon mounts, 45 degree offset sights, 6.5 Compensator, bipod, and 5 ASC high cap mags! Everything, yes Everything pictured is included! Have questions, please ask! Approx. Round count is 100! Just enough to properly break in the barrel! I can accept payment via OayPal friends and family, or USPS money order! I ship in hard cases, fully insured!"

The Trijicon ACOG is the official medium range weapon sight for both U.S. Special Operations Forces and the Marine Corps as well as being the optic of choice for law enforcement agencies across the country. What sets the ACOG apart from the pack is what it offers to its users, increased hit potential regardless of light conditions. This is due to the tritium/fiber optic illuminated reticle found in most Trijicon ACOG riflescopes, this automatically adjusts illumination of the reticle based on available light. With a wide array of magnification levels, reticle designs, and reticle colors available — there truly is an ACOG for every mission. Trijicon ACOG riflescopes come in the following magnification levels: 1.5x16, 1.5x24, 2x20, 3x24, 3x30, 3.5x55, 4x32, 5.5x50, and 6x48. Features:   Superior Quality Glass Lenses Multi-coated lenses provide superior clarity and light transmitting capabilities with zero distortion.   Rugged Aluminum-Alloy Housing Forged 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum-housing provides for a nearly indestructible sighting system.   Fixed Magnification Less moving parts than a variable optic equals increased durability and reliability. Seven magnification levels are available.   Waterproof up to 100 Meters Dry-nitrogen filled to eliminate fogging. Five times more waterproof than military standard requirements.   Both Eyes Open Design The ACOG can be used as a CQB sight when shooting both eyes open utilizing the Bindon Aiming Concept.

Also included is (2) 20rd p-mags, (1) 30rd p-mag,  (2) 30rd black metal mags (BCM & Palmetto State), and a chamber brush if you wish.The cash price is $1,000.00 for everything above (negotiable), trade value $1,100.00 firm.

Nightforce has combined all the durability and features of our tactical NXS line with high-power variable magnification and a wide selection of target and field reticles, which were born out of Nightforce’s Precision Benchrest Series. These hybrid NXS models make a significant departure from the tactical applications of its predecessors to offer long-range and benchrest shooters fast internal adjustment capabilities for precise and repeatable shot placement. The 8-32x56 and 12-42x56 NXS feature resolution and optical performance comparable only to high-end spotting scopes. Like all NXS scopes, both NXS hybrids deliver performance exceeding that of other riflescopes."

This particular one has been mounted but never fired while in use or carried in the field.The rifle was assembled about 4 months ago and has seen only one range trip with less than 100 rounds to check for functionality. I haven’t had the time or the inclination since to take it back out after our sunny weather went away.Christmas bills force the sale unfortunately…. (damn I hate the holidays). I’ll be including the black 30 round P-Mag pictured and a bonus 100 rounds of Federal XM193 5.56, in 20 round boxes.That’s about as sweet as it gets price wise. The Vortex Spitfire alone retails for $250. I only ask that you take care of your own transfer and background check fee. I live in Sandy and will be willing to meet as far as Portland. We can decide a meeting location somewhere between us if necessary—otherwise we have a great gun shop here in Sandy, Rapid Firearms. I'm not looking for trades at the moment.Thanks for taking a look!

As with our previous compact range finder (CRF) models the CRF 1000-R is small and compact. Perfectly molded for easy, one-handed operation and small enough to fit in a pocket. As the number in the name implies, the unit will range targets effectively out to 1,000 yards, but the CRF 1000-R adds a new and exciting twist as well. The Leica CRF 1000-R not only offers lightning fast line of sight distance to target, but also accounts for angle of inclination/declination, to provide Equivalent Horizontal Range (EHR) (using ""rifleman's rule"") from as little as 10 yards out to 600 yards. This makes it ideal for the bow hunter in a tree stand taking a short shot at steep angle, or for many rifle shots taken in mountainous terrain as well. The CRF 1000-R will replace the existing CRF 1000 models and will be offered at the same price in the market. As such, it remains an affordable option for the shooter who wants Leica precision, but does not require the advantage of extended range and/or the ballistic capabilities provided by the Leica CRF 1600-B and its sophisticated Advanced Ballistic Compensation (ABC) system. Not surprisingly, the physical specifications & dimensions remain the same, only the functionality & versatility have changed. We expect our friends in the archery market to especially appreciate the new twist though!
