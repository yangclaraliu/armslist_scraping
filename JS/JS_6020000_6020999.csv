It is from 2001 and they said very few of these models were produced. Most Superlights had straight stocks and this one has a rounded pistol grip. They also stated that this gun is valued at $2400. I am the second owner and have never fired the gun. The original owner only shot it a handful of times. It was more of a collectors item for me. It is in MINT condition. So if you are a collector or want an incredible skeet/trap rig, this is the gun for you. I'll entertain all serious cash offers as well as trades that equal the value of this gun."
