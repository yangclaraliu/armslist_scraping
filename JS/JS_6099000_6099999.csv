The rifle I customized it from was the 700 VLS. I've put a lot into it and kept the brands to a minimum so it is not a frankengun.The original parts on the rifle are the barrel which is a 26 inch 1/11 twist varmint style with only about 50 rounds through it, the receiver which is the legendary 700 action and the bolt which is jewelled. I had an oversized bolt knob installed by Short Action Customs out of Wellington Ohio. Everything else I did myself and torqued it to the proper specs. This is a very solid and very accurate rifle. Here is what's in it:*Weaver 20 MOA Scope Base  $20.00*HS Precision M24 Stock  (model PST007). The stock has both adjustable cheek comb and shoulder length. It is also aluminum bedded $600.00*HS Precision Detachable Magazine system (gen 2). $300.00* Two HS Precision gen 2 five round detachable magazines $160.00 ($80.00 per mag)*Timney trigger (model 510) set at 1.5 pounds $140.00*Blackhawk Picatinny bipod adapter  $25.00*Greenblob  (Atlas clone) bipod $70.00*Oversized Bolt Knob machined by Short Action Customs  $100.00I'm asking $1,700.00 for the rifle which includes everything listed above. The scope, scope rings and flipup caps displayed in the picture are not included. The Rifle is kept in pristine condition and shoots sub MOA at 100 yards. This rifle is not affected by any Remington recalls but I decided to put a Timney trigger in anyways because of Timney's excellent reputation and reliability.If you are interested feel free to text me day or night at REDACTED. no calls please.

""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions.""I have for sale a beautiful circa 1984 Smith & Wesson Model 36 (no dash) nickel-plated snub nose .38 Special steel revolver that is in wonderful condition. Even if you aren't interested in buying it, the pictures are worth looking at and that is free ;-)Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this Model 36 J-frame has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder, case-hardened trigger, and case-hardened exposed hammer with single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a bright shiny nickel finish and has Smith & Wesson wood grips. This thirty-two year old classic revolver is in beautiful condition. The original owner fired three cylinder's worth of rounds before storing it. I took it to the range after I bought it and fired thirty-five factory-manufactured rounds through it, keeping the total of the rounds fired through this gun at fifty. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is an accurate and fun gun. While this gun is pretty enough to just put up somewhere and admire, it is dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun.There are a few very small light surface spots on this revolver from time in careful storage over the past more than three decades, but I am not sure any of them even show up in the non-retouched pictures. The location of the spots are mainly at the bottom of the revolver by the serial number. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures."

These rifles are designed to perform like new rifles but have the Nostalgic Battlefield look and flavor! Built with an original military surplus Romanian parts kit and new US barrel, Fire control and receiver yield a unique blend of New & Old for a cool look. Barrels are high-quality 4150 Nitride-treated and rifle also has side rail for adding a scope mount or Optic. These are battlefield pick-ups so they may have trench art and look battle worn. This is a great conversation piece for a collector or first time owner. Amount of wear on metal finish and wood will vary from gun to gun. Comes with one 30-round mag. Each gun is checked for canted sights and test fired to insure function and reliability and backed up by Lee Armory. In the early 1960s, the Romanian Army used mostly PPSh-41, Oriţa submachine guns and imported AK-47 rifles. With the development of the stamped Type 4 AKM receiver, and the Soviet Union's call to each of the Warsaw Pact's nations to produce their own assault rifles chambered in 7.62mm, be they AK-47 pattern or not, the Romanian State Arsenal developed an AKM clone featuring a forward-pointing front handgrip molded into the lower handguard, called the Pistol Mitralieră model 1963.   Must be 18+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $879.99 each"
