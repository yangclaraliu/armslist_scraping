This is a nice 1911. Crimson This is a great full-size option for everyday-carry. The controls and sights are just about perfect.

We are sleeping in my truck,"Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 200,"Listed On: Sunday, June 11, 2017",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am posting because I am in dire straights and I have never been in a situation like this before, I need help finding assistance with my rent cause I paid a medical bill after threatening phone calls saying they would take me to court so I paid it and then didn't have the cash for the guy who rents me the house so he could pay the landlord. I need help with $200 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in God but I  wont have a roof over our heads for my 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till next Wednesday night to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask God to take care of this thank you and God Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $200 then anything helps even if its a little! Thank you and god bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, I don't care if I have to give someone my bank card to hold and my social security card, even the registration to my truck just so you know I have to come back to pay if its a loan, I never use craigslist and posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, I have received messages saying people are cautious to meet in person, well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, God bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend"

This is a very rare color combo that, to my knowledge, is no longer made. I bought this gun a little over two years ago to take with me on out-of-state fishing trips because it could fit in my fishing vest, but I've never used it. It is brand spanking new, and has been housed in its case, inside the original box the whole time I've owned it. In addition to the case and box, the gun comes with an owner's manual, padlock, one magazine with several extensions, a Galco leather holster, 50 rounds of Winchester target ammo, and 20 hollowpoints. This is a gorgeous little gun in pristine condition, and I'm asking $300 firm. Locals only and cash only please... I will not ship this firearm."

Of those only the first series included the ""step slide"" which was a weight reducing feature used to better balance the pistol. As you can see the original Beretta 92's also have a 1911 style frame safety which many shooters prefer(The new limted edition Beretta Centennials also include this feature). In addition, They have a euro style bottom mag release, rounded trigger guard, and rich dark Italian bluing. I have only ever seen one other of these for sale stateside.

This is a very unique weapon and I pretty much built it from the ground up. The rifle is based on a single shot heavy Savage competition target action. The trigger is a savage target trigger tunable down to about 1/2 pound. It has an HS Precision stock with a custom rubber like paint job in olive drab with black web. Photo taken before paint job.The barrel is a custom 24 inch McGowen full bull barrel with a 1 in 11 twist to stabelize 40 grain .204 rounds. Muzzle has a flat recessed crown. Built into the foregrip, under the barrel, is a custom barrel tuning device which is adjustable by turning a screw head built into the end of the fore grip. The concept is the exact opposite of reloading. Every gun and barrel has a unique set of vibrational characteristics. Reloading allows the shooter to fine tune the round around the gun for best accuracy. This barrel tuner allows you to pick your preferred ammo and fine tune the barrel around that ammo. It took me one afternoon and a couple boxes of ammo to tune the barrel.The optics is a Bushnell elite DOA rifle scope 6500 4.5-30 x 50mm with a 30mm tube held in place with Burris signiture zee rings.The rifle has a nice Harris bipod and hard carry case.The rifle has about 200 rounds through it and I don't know of anything wrong with it. I have developed a severe carpel tunnel condition and my shooting days are over, except for maybe a pistol in a real life self defense situation. But no more recreational shooting.I have included a picture of my best 3-round group shot at 100 yards off the bipod, with the barrel tuned and under near perfect conditions, except for about a 2-3 knot left to right breaze. That's a 1/8"" group. one ragged hole. That was my best group but I rutinely shot 1/4-3/8"" every time at the range.If you were to build this gun yourself, it would cost about $2,500 with competitively priced parts. Local transfer only. No trades or shipping please.Thanks for looking,"
