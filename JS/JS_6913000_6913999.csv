GLOCK's new slimline pistol has taken the single stack 9mm segment by storm, outselling even the most popular contender.
The new GLOCK 43 has transformed how shooters thought of single stack carry guns, no longer were they uncomfortable and hard to shoot. Now concealed carriers have the ability to practice with their carry gun without discomfort and an unpleasant shooting experience that some other single stack 9mm pistols offer.
Shooters are flocking to the GLOCK 43 thanks to new and refined features like a finger groove-less grip perfect for all hand sizes and a reversible magazine catch coupled with the all too familiar GLOCK feel. Recoil is kept in check with a dual spring recoil system and the ever-present Safe-Action system ensures that the trigger feels just like the GLOCK 43's bigger brother. Thanks to the new one-inch wide design, the GLOCK 43 will disappear under clothing like it isn't even there.

I am not pressed to sell it and I know what I have so lets keep it reasonable and civil. I have a 2008 production standard model DSA FAL factory gun back when they used LMT type 1 receivers. I have an Email from DSA giving me a short history on the rifle. It is in great shape having had less than 800 rounds put through it in its life time. Very accurate and reliable. I have replaced the recoil springs with new springs and the tool to do this task will come with it. I replaced the bolt carrier with an inch ""sand cut"" bolt carrier but I have the original bolt carrier with it. I have a sight adjustment tool for it as well as around 13 military surplus magazines with about 10 being isreali and these mags all perform 100%, they have been cleaned and instpected. I have found no rust or dents. They are almost unissued they are that nice. I also have around 1000 rounds of Hirtenberger in unopened boxes. The only real marks on the gun are the typical hits around the ejection port from the ejecting brass. All laws apply. Local sales only. Not interested in trades just cash."

FEATURES: Safeties:  ambidextrous safety on both sides of frame. 
Military style sights.
Loaded chamber indicator along side barrel.
Single and double action. Single action has a nice clean break -- it’s short, light (about five pounds) and crisp!
Real hammer fired – this is the classic hammer you can pull back with your thumb and actually feel and see firing the gun, a feature favored by many shooters as a more authentic shooting experience.
Breech-locking mechanism uses a Walther-style tilting locking block.
Construction: Steel barrel and slide.  Sturdy metal alloy frame.
5 inch barrel and military/ergonomic frame achieves legendary pointability and accuracy.
Recoil is very manageable. Strong, planted grip with checkered wood grips means that the recoil does not snap or kick  --  more of a ""push"" and really cushions the recoil.  Even shooters accustomed to a lighter round will be able to handle it very easily.
Beautiful Brazilian Walnut Grips!
Double stack, high capacity magazine.
Field stripping is a snap, using Beretta’s sure-footed, quick lever takedown that easily removes the slide from the frame. From there, the recoil spring, guide tube and barrel are easily removed.
Unbeatable Taurus lifetime warranty (transferrable to all subsequent owners).
** The features, fit and finish of its more expensive cousins that it easily rivals. Note the absence of machine marks, a characteristic of higher end firearms.
 
Carry options: Drop the hammer all the way down and carry it chambered, hammer down, off safe for a first double action shot.  You can also keep the safety on, then thumb it off with and have a first double action shot.  If you are a 1911 fan, then you can also carry cocked and locked which is the hammer cocked, safety on with a first shot being single action.
Includes high capacity magazine.* * This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.(No trades. No silly low offers – these messages will not be returned.)"

I'm looking to sell or trade a like-new Compact Zero 1. (Somewhere between 50 and 100 rounds through it, no scuffs, dings, or scratches.) Why? I bought it as a possible carry piece for my wife, and it turned out to be not as much smaller than my Zero 1 Standard as I thought it would be. So it's too big for her, and I'm left with essentially two of the same gun. This would be excellent as range day toy, home defense gun, USPSA production division gun, or carry piece for a large man. Has an ambi safety and mag release (good for southpaws), and a decocker, so you can carry it DA/SA or cocked-and-locked SA, as you prefer. Comes with original case and manual, and two 15-round magazines.  For another 50 bucks, I'll throw in a suede-backed Black Arch ACE-1 IWB holster (right-handed), also in like-new condition. (She almost never wore the thing.) I don't really need the money that badly, so I'm open to trades. I'd especially like to trade it + (probably a lot of) cash for a high-end 7.62/308 semiauto rifle, or a 50AE desert eagle, but if you've got something else you think I might find cool, go ahead and offer. If you are reading this, the handgun is still available."
