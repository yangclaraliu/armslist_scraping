Rock River Arms Billet NM frame, beveled mag well
Forged NM slide, double serrations
Lowered and flared ejection port
Beavertail grip safety with raised pad
Serrated flat mainspring housing
Match Commander hammer and match sear
Tuned and polished extractor, extended ejector
Checkered slide stop, ambidextrous safety, polished feed ramp
Throated NM KART barrel with NM bushing
Aluminum speed trigger with crisp 3.5 lb pull, standard recoil guide and plug
Heine fixed rear sight base
Rock River Arms full profiled dovetail front sight
Walnut grips, lustrous blued finish, with one magazine
Tuned for total reliability, guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards
I contacted Rock River via email regarding the specs of this gun and was told it is a Standard Match that was special ordered with the arched mainspring housing and Novak night sights…so that confirms this gun is in its original configuration as it came from Rock River (I will give you the print out of the email conversation). Also, during a phone conversation with the representative, he said it is a very early production gun and had to go back to archives to pull the info on it.

The trigger guard was very ""chewed up"". Gunsmith did the best they could to file it out however it could not be completely filed out and as such still has pitting on the inside bottom of the trigger guard. Good news is that if taken care of it should rust no more. Gunsmith advised that the internal parts are in great shape and is now a good shooter with further upgrades such as a trigger job still possible.This would be a great gun to carry hunting or home protection or just target shooting.price is an asking price, reasonable offers entertained.Perry arms LLC is a licensed dealer and as such all ATF AND PA STATE LAWS APPLY.

I don't know what chokes it has and I don't have the gauges to measure it. One tube is 0.005"" bigger than the other. Shotgun was kept in those crappy old vinyl outside, soft lined cases, for years and not taken out much to be oiled. So it has a few small spots of rust on the bluing, but nothing terrible and nothing that effects function. Most of it will probably clean up fairly well. Other than the finish issues, this one is in good shape and locks up tight. I would guess that this is from the 60s / 70s era but I really don't know.From what I can find the ERA is the same manufacturer as a current Stoeger SxS, but I'm not sure if that is true. This is a fairly nice looking shotgun. Nice bluing and the wood is looks good with nice checkering. Wood has minimal wear, but does have some small dings from years of sitting around, but probably not much use. On the bottom is says ""Made in Brazil"", on the barrel is says ""Made in Brazil for F.I.E. Miama FL""Price lowered to $300email for more pictures."

ADJUSTABLE SIGHTSThe front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPENThe slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETYGlock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 4. FINISHAll Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATIONInstallation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.6. ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY THROUGH ADVANTAGE ARMSWarranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship.GLOCKMEISTER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WARRANTY ISSUES. PLEASE CONTACT ADVANTAGE ARMS FOR ANY WARRANTY RELATED ISSUES.PLEASE NOTE THAT USED KITS CANNOT BE RETURNED OR EXCHANGED. Advantage Arms conversion kits and their associated magazines are very high demand items. Due to extremely limited production Advantage Arms products are rarely if ever in stock. Back order times for the conversion kits can be months. You are not charged for a back ordered item and there is no penalty to you to allow your order to remain on back order until we are able to fill it in the order it was received.DO NOT USE STINGER OR ANY OTHER HYPER VELOCITY AMMO. DO NOT USE REMINGTON “THUNDERBOLTS”Over the years CCI 40 grain round nose MiniMags have proven to be the most consistent and reliable brand of ammo. Other brands tend to vary from one production run to the next, they may work fine one time, however, the next time you buy them you start experiencing feeding and cycling problems. If this happens, it’s more likely the ammo causing the problem and not the kit, in this situation you should try another brand of ammo.Recommended Ammo for the following kits:17-22, 19-23, 26-27- CCI MiniMags (40 grain round nose not hollow points), Remington Golden Bullets 550/525 round Bonus Back, CCI Blazers.20-21, 29-30 - CCI MiniMags (40 grain round nose not hollow points), Remington Golden Bullets 550/525 round Bonus Back, CCI Blazers.NOT Recommended: CCI MiniMag hollow points, any Winchester ammo, any Federal ammo, Remington Thunderbolts, CCI Stinger or any other hyper velocity ammo.Note: The Remington Golden Bullets work quite well, however, you will get more light strikes and inconsistent loads than with the other recommended ammo."

Taking the heavy steel and wood from rifles of yesteryear, it's an M14 that shrunk in the wash. Because it's a scaled down battle rifle, it handles the little .223 Remington round perfectly. Ruger has offered the Mini 14 is a variety of configurations: stainless finish, synthetic stocks, tactical models, other calibers. The coolest, by far, is the side-folding stock models of the 1980s (famously adopted for service by television's ""A-Team"").The serial number on this example puts it as having been manufactured in 1985. The more modern telescoping stock models are all fine and good, but there's nothing like folding the stock, locking it down, and ending up with a nice, little package. And the rifle fires with the stock folded, too!This Mini has been previously loved and improved upon. It's now sporting a beefy muzzle brake and a side-mounted scope rail. We're throwing in a 40-round magazine with this one because we like less time between having to reload.We will ship (to FFL holders, of course) for an additional fee, but there are no extra credit card fees, so feel free to use plastic.Contact us with any questions you might have about this or any of our other Armslist listings.Phone: REDACTEDEmail: REDACTED"

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.  Redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.  Made in U.S.A."
