It has a new style Ruger wood stock, with Ruger wood handguard. The handguard alone would fetch $100 to $150, as Ruger hasn't made them in a long time. Lots of guys with plastic factory hand guards would love to have one, as they complete the M14-M1A look.If you don't care about the Garand/M-14 look, you could sell the wood hand guard and replace it with a $15 Choate handguard, lighter, cooler running, and much better looking than the Ruger factory plastic handguard that has the stupid lawyer mandated shield over the op-rod. It has upgraded sights, a Tech sight rear with .040"" insert and a Choate winged front sight/flash hider combo. The Tech sight/winged sight combo gives a great sight picture and the Tech is much more easily adjusted than the stock Ruger peep. All Mini's come way overgassed from the factory, launching brass a good 45 feet. Toning that down by use of Wilson 1911 buffers fore and aft on the op-rod softens the clanging when cycled, reduces the ejection distance, is easier on your brass if you reload, and adds some accuracy benefits. Trigger group has been professionally polished but not lightened, as this is a military style carbine, not a competition or benchrest gun. Pull is around 5 1/2 pounds.I had the barrel shortened to 16 inches, for with a Mini a shorter barrel is a stiffer barrel, less whip, and increased accuracy. A re-crown, which almost always improves on the factory crown, and hanging a flash hider on the muzzle also helps accuracy, and greatly reduces vertical stringing.Whereas  a Mini ( or an AR ) in 5.56mm does better with an 18 or 20"" barrel ( or longer ), the 7.62 x 39 catridge of the Mini-30 does better with a 16 inch barrel. Powders in this cartidge seem optimized for shorter barrels, and ones I've done into a 16 inch barrel actually get more velocity than the longer barrels.It will shoot 1 1/4 inch groups at 100 yards with the best loads, namely Hornady SST. When using quality Boxer primed brass cased ammo like PMC or PPU, groups are still a respectable 2 inches. I scope my Mini's ( I have three of them ) when working up loads or doing accuracy tests, as my eyes aren't that good anymore shooting with irons. But I prefer Mini's with red dot sights. A scope just makes the Mini heavier and less handy. A scope or red dot can be mounted on the bases built into the receiver, as this is a Ranch Rifle Model. I will include 2 Ruger  20 round factory magazines ( the only kind worth buying). Also included is 180 rounds of Hornady SST loaded in new Lapua brass, worth a good $180. This load shoots great in all of my Mini-30's, best load I've found. Great controlled expansion bullet for deer hunting or defensive use.My first Mini project was a Mini-14, but after getting my first Mini-30, I sold the Mini-14 and now much prefer the Mini-30 and 7.62 x 39 cartridge.I'm selling this as I still will have two others to shoot, and don't shoot this one as much anymore as it is currently iron sight only, but as I said can be scoped or a red dot added. I have no use for a sling mounted on the bottom of the carbine like the factories provide. Those are good for casually carrying the gun to a deer stand but that's about it. Mounting the sling on the side of the fore end, and at the top of the buttstock in back, allows either a across the chest carry for quick deployment, or across the back for when you need both hands free, without the 20 round magazine digging into your back, as it would if the sling was mounted factory style on the bottom. I have the sling on the right side in front, for right handers, and a short polymer rail on the other side, for mounting a weapon light or laser, but could change it over if you are left handed.I spent 20 years in the Army, mostly in Infantry units, and am very familiar with the AR-15/M16A2/M4, but much prefer the Garand style action, for it's ergo's, compact receiver size, and reliability. All the carbon stays up at the gas block. You can shoot these 500-600 rounds, and carbon build up will not be an issue.Nice low mounted sights, not jacked up high like other platforms, safety right in front of your trigger finger, no need to add a bunch of ambidextrous parts like some other types.I am very knowlegeable about the Ruger Mini, I know as much as anyone about setting them up right and making them shoot sweet.Whomever buys this will get whatever support they need, all questions answered, good advice on ammo, etc.The Mini-30 gets a bad rap from the uninformed, if you use crappy aftermarket magazines or crappy Tula ammo, yes, you will have poor accuracy and failure to fire.If one insists on using inexpensive steel case import ammo, I have found that Red Army Standard or MFS brand, is much more accurate, faster and way more reliable than Tula, and just as cheap, $5.99 a box. (If you happen to have a few cases of Tula laying around that you want to use, you can fit a quality longer firing pin from FiringPins.com for about $35 and 15 minutes of your time, that will reliably ignite those deep seated Berdan primers that Tula ammo has ).I like the M1A, get to fire them often, as several friends have them, but I prefer the Mini-30, not as long or heavy, less recoil, cheaper to shoot, but still has an effective range of 300+ yards.You'll have to see and handle this to see how sweet it is.This is a 189 series Mini-30 made around 1990. I bought it last year from a ranch couple who kept it in their safe and never shot it. When I got it, and took it apart for the first time, the gas block screws still had the factory staking and inside the gas block, gas bushing and gas pipe were clean as a whistle. I have shot it maybe 60 rounds since then. It still should have a few hundred rounds shot through it to be properly broken in.Reasons to buy this one instead of a new Mini-30 ?1) A good $200 less than a new one.2)Quality control was better back then, new Mini's have had issues, especially the 582 series. Older Mini's like this don't have near the machine marks and rough surfaces that new ones do.3) Has a better rear sight than the new Ruger peeps. Much more easily adjustable, more like a M1/M1A/Garand sight4)Has a better sling set up than the factory ones, and has a G.I. web sling.5) Trigger might not be much lighter than a new Mini, but this one has been polished for minimal creep and overtravel.6) Has an effective flash hider, only the more expensive new Mini Tacticals have a flash hider.7) Mini -30's were never made with the skinny ""pencil barrel"" like older Mini-14's were. Mini-30's have always had a fatter .625"" diameter barrel, same as the new ones. Only the Tactical model has a slightly heavier barrel. Just the older Mini-14's with the ""pencil barrel"" had accuracy, vertical stringing and overheating issues. None of my Mini-30's have those problems.8) The excellent SST ammo included and the wood hand guard are worth $300+ alone. So you are getting the Mini for cheap.More photos available if interested, I can e-mail them to you.Only trades I'd consider is a S&W PC Shield in .40 cal. or maybe a nice Uberti/Cimarron six gun in .44-40 or .45 Colt.It says right at the top of the ad, ""No shipping"".

I'm not listing them all seperate here becasue that means I need to make about 14 separate listings. That's a PITA! Put ""Guns for sale"" in the subject line of your email. I'll send the list of guns and how much ammo in each caliber and amount of empty brass for each caliber and what he's asking. A ""reasonable"" asking price for all guns at the same time would be nice.I'd prefer he sell them all in one shot, as I need to be there with him and I'm not looking forward to helping him sell 14 guns on 14 separate occassions, lol. I've better things to do with my time. He dosen't know how to list things online and he's apt to take payments, trades, etc. My mother-in-law put her foot down and said ""NO! CASH only and get rid of them!""  SO, just as a preemtive strike: no checks, no trades, cash in hand. No deals out of state and NO, I don't want to meet your uncle Billy-Bob from FLorida with an FLL who says he'll send his uncle's- brothers-sisters-son to pick them up.  And  if you ask what is the least amount he will take for them I will ask: what's the most amount you'll give for them. I'm a straight shooter, so let's just get these things sold and out of my hair. His wife wants them gone and I don't need/want them.If you're cool with that, email me, I'll send you the list and his asking price.

I'm not listing them all seperate here becasue that means I need to make about 14 separate listings. That's a PITA! Put ""Guns for sale"" in the subject line of your email. I'll send the list of guns and how much ammo in each caliber and amount of empty brass for each caliber and what he's asking. A ""reasonable"" asking price for all guns at the same time would be nice.I'd prefer he sell them all in one shot, as I need to be there with him and I'm not looking forward to helping him sell 14 guns on 14 separate occassions, lol. I've better things to do with my time. He dosen't know how to list things online and he's apt to take payments, trades, etc. My mother-in-law put her foot down and said ""NO! CASH only and get rid of them!""  SO, just as a preemtive strike: no checks, no trades, cash in hand. No deals out of state and NO, I don't want to meet your uncle Billy-Bob from FLorida with an FLL who says he'll send his uncle's- brothers-sisters-son to pick them up.  And  if you ask what is the least amount he will take for them I will ask: what's the most amount you'll give for them. I'm a straight shooter, so let's just get these things sold and out of my hair. His wife wants them gone and I don't need/want them.If you're cool with that, email me, I'll send you the list and his asking price. We can set up a time to meet at his place and he'll crack open his fire-arm safe and you can have a look-see. Walter"
