From the extensive Baby Hammerless collection of the actor, Gary Burghoff, best known for his long playing role of Radar O’Rielly on the hit television series M.A.S.H. Accompanied by a hand written letter from Mr. Burghoff, on his personal letter head stationary dated “9-30-09”, attesting to the genuineness and rarity of a sequentially serialized pair of Baby Hammerless revolvers. Mr. Burghoff states that he had “collected Baby Hammerless Revolver(s) for many years and (had) NEVER SEEN A CONSECUTIVE PAIR!” These pistols were manufactured more than one hundred years ago. They are serialized #627 and #628. They have a nickel finish, hard rubber grips, 1 5/16 inch barrels, 6 shot fluted cylinders, checkered cylinder pins, and fold away triggers. These were pocket revolvers in a time when a bit of “ready protection” close at hand could be comforting in difficult circumstances. The top straps are stamped ""PAT. FEB. 2.92-FEB. 4.96 / BABY HAMMERLESS / PATENT PENDING"". Each pistol is fitted with two-piece checkered, bird’s head grips featuring the circled ""K"" imprint at the top and a stylized fleur-de-lis at the bottom. Complete with fine mahogany case with red velvet lining. Condition is “fine to very fine” according to Mr. Burghoff. The revolvers retain 97% of their original nickel finish with some very scattered minor flaking. The grips are excellent with some minor handling marks. The grip checkering is crisp. The mahogany case is very fine with some minor handling marks and some minor wear to the lining. You may never have another chance to own such a pair of wonderful First Model Baby Hammerless revolvers!!"

It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.phone number REDACTED"

I've put around 1,000 rounds through it without a single issue. The gun was always cleaned after each trip to the range. I purchased this gun right before the election not knowing who might win (thankfully our gun rights are safe at least for the next 4 years). At the time I purchased this AR15 I really wanted either a Sig MPX or MP5 variant, but the price for either gun shot up way past $2,000 before buying accessories and extra mags!   I am deciding to sell this gun now because the Sig MPX and MP5 style rifles have come down to their original prices (no more crazy markups due to demand). Everything that came with the gun new is included as well as all the below listed extras. Since I will be switching to a non-AR platform rifle I want to sell it as a package deal. The only thing I will consider separating from the gun is the optic.  I am not looking for trades at this time. The transaction will be carried out at an FFL where they will do all of the paperwork and run your background check for the transaction (your expense - usually $25-$30). This is CASH ONLY, no other payment is accpted and I will not ship the rifle. You may call or text me with any questions REDACTED. I am happy to send a lot more pictures as well, I could only post three becuase I do not have a paid account.    The Spikes Tactical Crusader::: http://www.spikestactical.com/crusader-w12-mlok-dynacomp-2-p-1319.html  The Spike’s Tactical Crusader is a 14.5”(16”OAL) Lightweight Mid-Length Rifle Package. This rifle contains a selection of our finest components and at its core is our new ST Crusader lower with Integral trigger guard. This weapon balances the fine line between tactical and competition, Light weight and Dependability! The 14.5” Light weight Mid-length CMV barrel with ST Dynacomp 2 pinned and welded for compliance makes for a very smooth shooting rifle with extremely fast follow up shots due to reduced recoil and overall balance of the rifle is perfect. Included features are our Enhanced lower parts kit with the ST Battle Trigger, ST Billet Latch Plate, KNS Anti-Rotational Hammer and Trigger Pins, ST Ambi Safety Selector, Billet Mag Release Button and new Pro Grip. The combination of Lightweight NIB BCG and our Spike’s ST-T2 Tungsten buffer completes the package and makes for an extremely smooth shooting rifle. On the fore end is our new ST- 12” MLOK Rail system. With an unloaded weight of 6.65lbs and smooth shooting of a Mid-length gas system the Crusader is a Versatile Rifle at Home or on the Competition flat Range as well as the Two Way Range. And of course each component is backed by the Spikes Tactical Lifetime Warranty.  NOTE:: Check your state & local laws, it is 100% your responsibility to ensure the gun is compliant with your state (it is complaint for PA)  Features:::

New - with blems.Important: If you buy a lower from a non-dealer.. someone at some point had to originally buy the lower from an FFL and declare it to the ATF as either a Rifle or Pistol at time of purchase. If they filed it as a rifle (or is a rifle take off part) then it can not ever be used as a pistol build (only excetion is SBR route).But if they filed it as a Pistol on the original form.. then it can be used as either a pistol or rifle build. Convert back and forth, you choice.So if you are buying a lower today be sure to find out if the lower was originally filed as a pistol or rifle; it matters!The only exceptions to this rule are 80% builds which you make ourself (and can't ever sell) or are the original purchaser and buying from a FFL; in which case you would then make sure to check the box on the paperwork ""pistol"" and not rifle.Details:Pistol Filed Lower - Can be used either for pistol or rifle buildsPolymer Lower - Frontier ArmoryPolished Trigger Group (nice trigger with stock pull weight for ignition reliability)MFT light weight stockErgo rubber pistol gripMil-Spec Buffer and SpringMil-Spec (heavy duty) 7075 buffer tubeAll USA made componentsTotal Weight: 1.8 lbs.Vic.. 775 three four six 2345 Possibly open to trades.

The reason is because some moron welded the cover to the receiver so that he could zero in his scope. The rifle shoots perfect and is amazingly accurate but as it sits cannot be dissassembled.
