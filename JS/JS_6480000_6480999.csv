The trimmer will also come with 2 spare blades - the blade currently on the unit itself should most likely be replaced, but I'm not 100% definite on that. The trimmer has been used a good bit in the past (by me), but I've opted for a more traditional trimmer (and I really don't like spending $40-60 on trim dies) at this time. Blades on the Dillon website are $20/each, the dies are ~$50-$80/each and the trimmer itself retails for ~$250 (Dillon has stopped making the RT 1200 and replaced it with the RT 1500 - slightly bigger motor, but this thing still runs just fine). The trimmer is complete in the sense that it has the power cord (and toggle switch) and the vacuum hose adapter for trim dies. This trimmer will mount to any standard press, progressive or single stage. I'm asking $245 (plus flat rate shipping via USPS if needed - usually $5-10) for the trimmer, all dies and the spare blades - trimmer is located in northern NV, but can/will ship anywhere in the US on buyer's dime (as stated above, I try and ship via USPS and I think this will fit in a medium flat rate priority box). I accept paypal (+3% unless gift, then no fees apply, but ensure that you do not mention anything firearm related) or USPS money order. I will take personal checks on two conditions, one being a good feedback rating on this site (+10 or more) and buyer will wait until the check clears my account. If interested, please send a PM - my email account is hit or miss on when it gets messages through to me from ARF. I'm headed out for about 4-5 hours today (2/19/17 at 8:45 AM PST), but will check messages periodically and get back to any interested parties ASAP. Please feel free to send questions and/or offers, though I don't know how much lower I'd honestly be willing to go."

The rifle has about 200 rounds down it. I'm more of a AR guy so looking to trade towards that. The SCAR is in excellent condition and doesn't have a single scratch on it. This will come with the factory box, paperwork and 3 factory FN FDE magazine. The Aimpoint is not included. I'm looking for a factory AR and not a home built gun( took one on trade before and was a POS). I'm looking for a simple AR with a A2 front post, with a mid length or carbine gas system(carbine preferred). Extras isn't necessary but will look at it. Basically looking for a M4 rifle. Colt(not the colt expanse), BCM on top, LMT or just about any maker.  I'm not looking for anything beat to hell and the rifle must be in excellent condition( no scratches) and not looking a 3k AR. I will need some cash on top depending on the trade. $2300 is a fair value for the scar. I've got a itch for a Bravo a company so that will be on top and will be my first choice if offered."

The .30-06 cartridge was packaged to meet the requirements of the military user at the end of the supply chain. The riflemen of World War II received bandoleers with 8 round block clips for the M-1 Garand, in cloth bandoleers with one clip per pocket and six pockets per bandoleer. The bandoleers were, in turn, packed into ammo cans or wooden crates.
When packed into bandoleers, there was a cardboard sleeve in each bandoleer pocket that gave a little protection to the bullet tips. These have to be the right size -- the right length for the cartridge and the right width for the type of clips. The light cotton bandoleers and cardboard sleeves were thrown away after use or after the rounds were transferred to cartridge belts with sturdy canvas pockets. Bandoleers could be slung over the shoulders to carry extra ammo, more than the cartridge belt can hold. Riflemen were generally issued one or two bandoleers during resupply."

The description is in the pictures, but these blinds fit 2 big people or 3 regular people and even a camera and chairs. Please be close to Woodbridge and if ad is up, blinds are still for sale. These go for $150 each and mine are brand new, boxes never opened and will take $80 each or buy both and I will let them go for $150 cash. That is a great deal!!! Thanks for reading!"

This is the Mossy Oak camo pattern rifle. It comes with 2 detachable factory 10 round steel magazines. This is a wonderful rifle and it is a friggin tack driver! The accuracy of this rifle is just simply amazing! Super fun to shoot all day long. There is literally no noticeable recoil and is extremely quite to shoot. I'm a stickler for hearing protection and I only use the foam ear plugs when I shoot this and the only thing you can hear is a quiet snap and the sound of the action cycling!!! The rifle has original front post and rear adjustable blade iron sights along with the factory weaver rail mounting system to directly mount your choice of optic. Everyone who has ever shot this rifle falls in love with it! It's great for the beginner just learning basic firearm safety and fundimantals or the experienced shooter looking for a less expensive way to get in more range time. This model is chambered for .22LR and it has successfully cycled every single type/brand of .22LR I've fed it! Everything from Remington Thunderbolts to CCI Mini-Mags! Throw a little lube on the action and your ready for a full range day of fun & excitement! This rifle is in great condition showing no signs of wear. I have thoroughly cleaned and maintained this rifle after every use. Thank you for your interest!
