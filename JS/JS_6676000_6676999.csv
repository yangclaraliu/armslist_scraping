Bought this ak pistol right before Christmas to turn into an NFA project sbr with tax stamps. Never did any of that. What I did do was mount a cheap red dot to the hinged dust cover, stain the hand guard and sand down any sharp corners. Also filed off the thread protector so an extension can be added with a stock while you wait on the government to approve a short barrel. Have never fired it, so the dot isn't zeroed. Included are a sling that only attaches in the front (because there is nowhere to mount it until there is a stock on it - after paperwork or an extension), 3 magazines (2 steel, one plastic. All 30 round capacity.) and over 200 rounds of .233/5.56. Decided I would rather fix my truck than have this in my closet. Not in a hurry to sell, but gladly would."

Model 6280 is the base for this holster design as it utilizes the unique SLS rotating hood design for a smoother single motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The 6360 is classified as a Level III Retention holster with the SLS as the primary security system; it also includes an internal locking device that retains the weapon in all directions when the primary device is open. This holster's design offers three distinct design differences from previous models. First, once the weapon is holstered, it ""locks"" it into place, providing an extra measure of security from standard Level II retention holsters. Second, the holsteris completely operable with the thumb, makingit very instinctive to use.. Finally, once the retetion devices are released, the weapon can be drawn straight out of the holster with no twisting or other motion required. The 6360 features a tensioning devce, molded sight track and SafariSuede lining to protect the gun 's sights and finish. Its wraparound construction and SafariLaminate Structure provide the strongest design combination available. The rigid UBL (Universal belt Loop) anchors the holster and stabilizes it on your belt with hardened aerospace fasteners. Fits: Sig Sauer P229R DAK w/Bobbed Hammer, P229DASA w/Full Size Hammer"

It is equipped with a picatinny rail mount, Harris Engineering Bi pod (6-9 inches), over sized tactical aluminum bolt knob and a 6-24 x 50 piney illuminated rangefinder reticle long range scope. The barrel is a crowned, 26 inch heavy contour barrel with a 12"" twist. The stock adjusts for a perfect length of pull and cheek weld. The stock chassis allows the barrel to be fully free floating, which is optimal for barrel harmonization and long range accuracy. Do you suffer from ITFS (itchy trigger finger syndrome)? Are you tormented by the lack of recoil in your life? There is hope. Ask your doctor if this rifle is right for you, as it may not be for everyone. Side effects may include higher testosterone levels, more chest hair, grilling raw meat on a wood fire, patriotism, lots of woman trying to crawl into your bedroom window, being promoted at work, freedom, pouring whiskey on your cereal, and witty James Bond one liners. You will, for the first time, begin to understand the Constitution of the United States and feel the hand of the founding fathers rest on your battle scarred shoulder in approval as the recoil from a .308 caliber hunk of lead greatness beats the wimp out of you. This rifle solves problems that you didn't even know you had. Did your Saturday just get taken away by that miserable baby shower? Not on my watch. Now you're going hunting. What are you hunting you say? You're killing off that woose side of you that didn't say no to a baby shower. Its time to get your balls back. Its time for the sweet song of .308 recoil therapy to play you a symphony of precision destruction. What's that you say? Why do you need all that firepower? Look here snowflake, if that's your attitude, you'd be best to just keep scrolling; You'll find the skinny jeans that you're looking for on another website, next to the pretty pink coffee mugs that your wife likes on Pintrest. This marvel of American innovation eats terrorists for breakfast. Is this rifle made of light weight recycled plastic? No, it's a heavy contour 26 inch barrel, because you need to weed out the weaker pansies on your hunting trips that whine about the ""cold weather"" or complain about the ""land mines"". This rifle understands you, and as you take command of the aluminum forged bolt, you become more and more aligned with the patriots of old, the Marines of Tunn tavern, and Chesty Puller himself smiles down on you from heaven's gates of pearl and concertina wire. You will piss napalm. You won't need to take protein shakes anymore because your muscles are already exploding from your new all-bacon diet cooked from the 800 lb wild boar that you just killed. This black beauty has a textured surface on the grip to ensure that you get a firm grasp with your blood soaked fingers. The Harris engineering bi pod will hold your death machine securely on atop your red white and blue zodiac vessel during night time amphibious assaults. Are you really just going to sit there and let your 2nd amendment get wasted on buying some piece of junk .22? How sad. Carlos Hathcock would be rolling in his grave. But you won't be one of those ""men"". You'll be the personified hammer of Thor, bringing the pain train to all the enemies of our amber waves of grain. Heck, don't just do it for your country, do it for all the sad lesser men who are trapped right now, as I speak, at some tea brunch with their mother in law. Do it for all of our fellow brothers who are trapped in the friend zone. Do it for your future generations of children, so they can tell they're own children how they're dad didn't rob them of the sweet smell of gunpowder in the morning. If you feel like you just don't have the testicular fortitude to take charge of this masterpiece of modern engineering, then hey, I get it. I understand. You're probably right. Wouldn't want to interfere with your Yoga routine, now would we. Your vegan hippy friends will be happy that you settled. And if your tiny brain was somehow thinking about outfitting this death merchant with some kind of obnoxious pearl grip pads or some weird decorative Indian feathers, pump the breaks there Pocahontas;show some respect. I already told you to move along! If you feel like you are interested in it, but aren't a serious buyer because you want to ""sleep on it"", then do me a favor and wait until your balls drop before you send me your pre-pubescent pleas to lower the price. The price is as firm as my... well its really firm, let's just say that. You won't pay any extra taxes or fees on this rifle because I am not a communist. Shipping is free for my fellow marines. If you don't think that's fair then go write a letter to Nancy Pelosi. If you require shipping then I will insure that this boom stick is mailed to an FFL near to your house. If you do not have a gun store near your house, then you are likely from socialist California and I cannot help you. I reside in Kennesaw, GA where the law requires that every male head of the household own a firearm. *bald eagle screeches in background*. Oorah. Yut. Echo 5 Romeo over and out."

This is suitable for most applications. Because of unlimited eye-relief with the E/D sight, you should provide at least three inches of clearance between the end ofLed & Mirror Housing and your eye when shooting. Set the rail onto the base so that the rail claw aligns with the crosscut grooves. Work the claw into the base until the cross-bolt seats into the groove. Securely tighten the locking screw with an Allen wrench included in the E/D sight. Zeroing: Select the reticle you desire by turning the reticle selector knob and set the intensity at the best position for you.

This is coming out of a collection of a couple dozen AKs and I am only selling this one because it's a duplicate. This is a great shooting rifle and is as reliable as you would expect an AK to be. None of the others are for sale. Rifle comes with (1) 30 rd Romanian steel magazine, new Romanian sling, cleaning kit, and oiler. If you have any questions feel free to ask I'm very knowledgeable on the platform. For $600 you won't find a nicer AK, this is not a WASR.This rifle was built in Romania by RomArm/Cugir Arsenal and imported by Century. Century added the trigger and pistol grip, they did not do any real work to the rifle which is the main reason it's higher quality than a WASR. Mags snap in nice and tight and the sights are straight. I can text additional pictures for those interested. Again, no trades and price is firm."

The Hitchner Corporation cast a heavy revolver frame using 4140 Steel, app. 10% more substantial than its contemporaries- Ruger Blackhawk and S&W. These Dragoon revolvers were built to very close tolerances and hand fitted and individually tuned and lock up tighter than almost any other single action ever made, similar to the individual quality of the colt line of Pythons. The large bolt and cylinder stops contribute greatly to these quality features. A Swiss Safety was incorporated into the design along with cylinder dots drilled to the left and right of one bore to indicate the empty chamber, also quite unique to the Dragoon. The revolver has adjustable rear sights with walnut grips that show no sign of wear. Other features include one piece back strap, brazed front sight, recessed cylinders, coil mainspring, internal firing pin, split grip panels, and unlike Ruger, Interarms used a locked firing pin busing on the Dragoon. The list price in the early 80's when this was made was 280.00 whereas the Blackhawk, 10% less substantial in structure, was only 200.00. The cost of hand fitting and tuning each one of these Dragoons individually along with other excellent unique features left the Dragoon at a price point of $80.00 above the MSRP of the Blackhawk. These extras put an impact on the overall sales of the Dragoon and production was haulted in 1985."
