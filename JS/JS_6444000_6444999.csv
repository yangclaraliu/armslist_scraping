I've seen the rifles, but I've never seen a case with one, they're usually only with higher priced shotguns etc. The pictures show a little rust residue on the foam in the case, and theres some on the book. It came from an old SxS black powder shotgun that was stored in it! I really freaked out a little when I saw it, but I checked the rifle over really well and it is clean! If you have any questions or want additional pictures let me know!"

There aren't that many out there that are for sale that I can find to see what the market is. But I took the gun to a local gun shop, and the older owner told me it can be worth anywhere between 300-400 in the shape it is. So im asking $350, I think it's fair for what I have.

Honestly I would prefer a trade so I can have a new toy to play with. I am not much of an AR guy so I will explain it as best I can. The rifle will shoot 5.56 or .223. It has less than 200 rounds through it and it is in like new condition. It has a flip up sight on the back, a sling, adjustable stock, and it has a 30 round magazine not pictured. It shot flawlessly when I tried it out. I got it on a different trade and I don't really have much use for it. I'm more of a handgun guy. I'm open to ideas, not looking for anyting in particular. Let me know what you have. I might do a 10MM Semi Auto or a Big Bore revolver (.454 Casull, 44Mag, .460 etc.). I would also do two compact 9mm's. I like S&W Shields or something similar.

The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, This unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability at the user level.The Barrett MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new trigger module that is easily accessed for maintenance, adjustment, and replacement. This match grade trigger is drop fire proof and combat ready. The thumb operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.Integrated into the Barrett MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a Picatinny M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. At 21.75 inches, the rail offers plenty of space for in line night vision devices. Configurable side and bottom rails allow for mounting a number of other accessories.The Barrett MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action, the rifle is the same width overall, folded or extended. Made of a temperature resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle to user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its multi-positional quick-detach sling sockets to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment-every detail of the Barrett MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own."

It has the semi- bull barrell with ""slab sides"" (flat sides) rather than full round barrel. It is a great looking gun that I had painted green. It was supposed to be a bright green but it came back kinda OD green with off white grips. I also had the trigger and hammer painted gold. I have shot it quite a bit so it shows some wear and bare spots but it shoots great. Barrel length is 6"",This gun would be good for children or women as the grip is pretty small but I have pretty big hands and I shoot it just fine. I like long barrels and this one is very accurate. Rear sight is adjustable for windage but  not elevation. (It shoots where you point it now though). I am selling  because I have other 22's that I enjoy shooting more. (One a shorter barrel with an ugly grip but it feels better to me).Price is negotiable somewhat.Contact David @ (214)   334 - 3539 Don't email as I don't have access to the email address any more."
