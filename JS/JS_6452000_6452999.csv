Known for unparalleled accuracy and reliability, the SLR was hailed by Mikhail Kalashnikov himself as rivaling the best milled Russian AK's.This specimen was purchased new in 1999 by a Y2K prepper and is in excellent condition.

Included is the five round factory magazine, tactical mounted Mini Maglite, and original owners manual only.The buyer can be confident with his/her purchase, whether as a sound investment or a small arm capable of regular use, rapid fire, abuse, or neglect.I also have an identical model available with $100 discount due to canted front iron sight (as original from factory). Pin needs pulled/drilled and replaced after front sight centered. The leading AK specialist in St. Pete ballparked it as a $40-50 adjustment to do it properly, or you can do it the Soviet method which is whack it with a dead blow hammer wwhile cradled in a vice (plenty of Youtube videos showing either way). It is the one with the bumpfire stock currently installed, but will have original installed at time of sale.I would CONSIDER parting with both, with the negotioation involving Bumpfire Systems stock with adapters to fit most AK's (stamped, Zastava, etc.), FILLED mags. 75 rnd drum, 4-40 rounders, 11-30's, another 5 round, a dozen or so boxes, etc. A piece of that cache could be part of the sale of one rifle.

I appreciate the cash offers I've gotten, but if cash is my goal I'd just as soon go with one of the auction sites.I have a Ruger Speed Six 2.5-inch blued revolver in the very rare (for this model) and very desirable 9mm Parabellum caliber.  I picked this up recently after bidding on it through an internet auction site, which I placed without even realizing the seller was actually our local Hoover Tactical Firearms. It is a Ruger Speed Six, one of three variants of Ruger's classic ""Six"" line of revolvers that also includes the terrific Security Six and Service Six. The ""Speed"" Six was the variant intended for concealed or plainclothes carry duty, having the shortest barrel at 2.5 inches, streamlined and snag free fixed rear sight (as opposed to adjustable sights), and a streamlined, more concealable round butt (rather than squared off) handle.  The Six line of Ruger double actions is, in my opinion, one of the all-time classic double action six guns -- easily the equal of such contemporary offerings as those of Colt or Smith & Wesson. I like to think of these three competitors as ultimately all equal in an all-around ranking sort of way, but that they are also nevertheless significantly different. Not different, again, in overall quality but in this way: I would view those deluxe offerings of Colt like its Python and Diamondback as the height of elegance but at significant cost of functionality, as the Python is somewhat to be babied due to its high value, tendency to fall out of time with heavy use, and high cost of professional maintenance. With the S&W a kind of perfect middle ground, I consider the Ruger offering the perfect vice-versa of the Python: truly the most utilitarian of the three, with a strictly functional lackluster finish and conspicuous safety warning on the barrel making it anything but elegant, but its chunky, perfectly solid frame and transfer bar and coil spring utilizing action probably the most nigh invincible you can acquire. Of these three classic revolvers, I would rate the Ruger as the most indestructible and reliable. Whereas I've seen more (heavily used) Colt revolvers out of time than not, and my share of S&Ws in the same way, I can't say I've ever seen a Ruger out of time and honestly don't know if you could put one out if you tried. At the risk of committing sacrilege through analogy, I'd dare call it the Glock of double action revolvers.  So while I do not know if I could choose a favorite among these competing revolver brands, out of the Ruger Six line specifically I do consider the Speed Six probably my favorite. It is roughly in the same service niche as the 2.5-inch barreled S&W Model 19 or Model 13, which together make up S&W's mid-sized (or ""K framed"") .357 Magnum offering. The 19 would be their K framed .357 with adjustable sights and enclosed ejector shroud, while the 13 is the same gun but with fixed sights and without a shroud ensconcing the ejector rod. Having owned both of these, I’ve always wondered why S&W could not have offered a sort of hybrid of the two: a fixed sighted gun with the enclosed ejector. While S&W never readily offered such a beast (with some rather obscure exceptions), it turned out Ruger already had with their Speed Six. The Speed Six is also just a bit beefier than S&W's K frame and just enough as to be, in my opinion, ideal. Whereas they used to and still advise you not to shoot full power .357 frequently from an S&W K frame (a popular saying going that you should shoot .38s for practice and load .357s for defense), I've never heard such a warning about the Speed Six. S&W later offered the L frame for this reason, but for a snubby CCW revolver I think they might have gone a little too far. On my belt and in my hand, the Speed Six has always felt to me to be just ideal in all these ways -- the perfect configuration, the perfect size, the perfect weight. (And I never realized how perfect until I shot it as a 9mm, specifically with some Speer Gold Dot +P+ 9mm defensive loads that made me wonder what the .357 has even done for me lately.)   I picked this particular Speed Six up with the understanding that it is something of a rarity, in that it is chambered for the 9mm Parabellum rather than usual .38 or .357 caliber. This would be unusual in a couple of ways; one being that Ruger only made so many of these, and that Speed Six 9mms are therefore often considered extremely desirable, both from a collector standpoint as well as for shooters in general. The other sense in which this gun is a rarity is that you don't often find wheel guns chambered for the 9mm cartridge in general, as being a rimless round designed to be used in automatics, there is some difficulty even getting it to work in a revolver. In this case, the fix is in the utilization of half or full moon clips which secure the rounds together and drop into the cylinder along with the rounds themselves to allow extraction after firing. This is a little less convenient as far as the fact that a kind of a middle man has been added to the loading process, and that you can't just drop the rounds straight into the cylinder from the box anymore, and also that you can't extract spent or misfired cases individually anymore. However, this is only a little more involved a process than using your average speed loader, and in the ways that a speed loader makes loading your revolver more convenient, I'd argue that these moon clips are even further convenient still. With an HKS speed loader, for example, you would have to insert the loader while finding such a grip on the gun that you can also hold the cylinder from turning while also managing to twist the loader's knob to release the rounds, then pocket or discard the loader before you can get back to loading and shooting. With a full moon clip you need only drop the whole six rounds in one piece into the open cylinder and you are done. The whole loading process is as simple as loading a single round. For concealed carry purposes, this is probably the fastest possible and therefore ideal method of reloading. Combined as this fact is with the fact that this is possibly the most ideally sized and configured revolver for this purpose I've so far encountered, and I’ve gained some understanding for why these 9mm examples are held in such high esteem.  So that's my best pitch for why you should want to offer me something really cool to trade for this revolver. (For collector purposes, I’ve settled on a different Speed Six that is unique variant built for and once carried as a US Postal Inspector's duty gun, and don't so much need two of this specific model revolver in the collection.) Here's the bad news: the finish on this thing is not the best. I don't know exactly how it'd be rated as there's clearly bluing left, but almost the whole thing is freckled all over with a kind of a light pitting. I imagine someone must have stored it for the very long term in a holster at some point -- just as they tell you not to -- and then scrubbed away the resulting rust leaving it looking a little like Edward James Olmos. One more small nugget of good news is even the pitting is now filled by a kind of, one might feebly attempt to argue, ruggedly handsome patina. (I may be crazy, but at least when I first saw it, I wasn't put completely off by the finish. I actually kind of like the weathered look of it.)And again, keep in mind that in perfect condition, a 9mm Speed Six seems to be regarded as a collector item of sorts and in online auctions it nearly always fetches final bids that approach or exceed the quadruple digit mark. A shame that, as these are revolvers that deserve to be shot and shot plenty. So this might just be a rare opportunity to have one at a non-collector price that you can therefore enjoy for non-collector purposes. And I hold to my statement that Rugers are nigh invincible, so while this gun is anything but new from a cosmetic standpoint, it is nevertheless still in entirely correct mechanical condition and is virtually guaranteed to remain that way -- at least, unless it were to be subjected to abuses even far worse than it has already. I therefore, despite the poor cosmetics of this Ruger, nevertheless would still place it at around $400 in terms of trade value. Maybe less, maybe more -- factoring in the value of the nicely barky sambar stag grips. I am pretty confident this is as cheap as you’re ever likely to find a 9mm Speed Six in any condition, nevermind mechanically sound, so if you want one on a budget, this could be the best or only chance you're going to get. It would in this way make an excellent platform for customization.
Again, the cosmetic damage to this gun is entirely composed of light pitting, without any significant dents or gouges such as from being dropped, and it is mechanically sound. (And I am reasonably confident by now that I am able to tell when a revolver is timed correctly, having made enough mistakes by now buying examples that aren't.) I also suspect that Ruger might be able to restore the finish to ordinary (refinished) condition, and I believe they currently offer this service for $175 which isn't bad in today's market. I'm actually considering having them do it just to make it easier to sell -- if anything I'm most afraid that if I do I will then be compelled to keep it.  Depending on your desire and your offer, I can provide this gun with either of two choices of grips (or with both). Option A is a pair of black rubber Pachmayrs branded with Ruger medallions, which are in my opinion the best grips ever offered for a round butt Ruger as far as pure feel and function, especially for concealed carry. Ruger offered these as a factory option and separately on their site for a limited time and they can be hard to find now especially new in the orginal packaging as these are. Option B is the exceptionally attractive and well-fitting Sambar stag stocks pictured, which are among the more opulent grips I've ever come across for this particular model gun. These are probably a >$125 value in and of themselves. I suspect I'd get as much for them on ebay, but I'd like to keep them together since they fit so very nicely (which, at least from my own experience with custom revolver grips, has always felt a crapshoot to say the least.)Sorry for the wordiness, although I didn't make you read it."

There are a couple places on the bipod where the finish has come off, and a very slight amount of rust discoloration in the Bohica logo (I kept the whole thing thoroughly oiled but the logo engraving was difficult to keep from discoloring). It's not pitted, just discolored. I have the original fitted box (cardboard) with the foam inserts, and the manual as well.The lower is a Bushmaster lower with DPMS LPK with the above mentioned modified hammer and heavier spring, and standard A2 stock and grip. Nothing fancy there."
