Draw your pistol in an old west fast-draw and protect the villagers against the local gang of bad guys. Multiple scenes and outcomes keep shooters on their toes. If you simply want to perfect your sight alignment, sight picture and trigger pull then there are plenty of traditional paper and metal spinning targets available as well.

These kits will create about 85% of live fire recoil for the long guns and deliver great performance using 12 gram CO2 cartridges with a beltpack or you can attach th small air line (about 1/8"") to a 20 ounce paintball bottle and get thousands of rounds very inexpensively. These kits have an MSRP of $2,495.00 new so these are availabe at a significant savings.I only have a few of these left, so hurry if you want the best selection. These air recoil kits can be adapated for use on any modern firearms simulator, can be paired up inexpensive web cam ranges, and are also great for simply getting in a lot of trigger pulls to improve and control your trigger control. These kits also make it 100% for you to practice holster draws and cycling your weapon, something you can never do with live fire ammo.Any of thses kits can be easliy installed on your weapon, take a minute or less to install, and requires no permanent modification of your weapon. Drop in the kit, practice, and convert back to your regular firearm with ease. Some people will refer to these as drop in recoil kits, air recoil kits, or air recoil systems. Finally, please don't let the term ""tether"" worry you - these are nothing like the tether on the FATS systems - rather, it refers to a very small air line that goes into the magazine. You can still easily work with a holster or sling for motion practice and they will not restrict your movement in any way."

Austin.  Shipping may be possible, at additional cost.  Thank you."

This ammo comes in 15 round boxes then are sealed in a metal ammo ""spam"" can then wrapped in a wood crate for longevity and protection. The spam can is easy to open not like the Russian ones. This has a pull open instead of twist open with a tool. This says corrosive but I have been shooting for over 10 years with no problems. I guess only downfall was use of corrosive ammo needed the barrels to be cleaned after shooting. I've shot 200 to 300 rounds and left uncleaned for 6 months at a time and had no problems cleaning. I always use Hoppes cleaning solvent with 100% cleanability. Casing, primer, and general bullet are quality made as the Yugoslavs took/take pride in. This is great target ammo or general purpose ammo which I have shot in many ranges in my area or outdoors on my property.More pics available to serious inquiries only.*Cash transaction only*Price is firm, no trades*If listing is still posted then ammo still for sale.
