I know the ammo business is a low margin endeavor and sales tax is not a value added fee for retail sales vs web based it's a tough proposition for brick and mortar businesses. That said I have called every shop in town and they are so exorbitantly more expensive even before sales tax I was about to give up, but figured I'd give ArmsList a try thinking perhaps a dealer might want to move some product in bulk.  I can bring you a sizeable order if the price is right.  While I thank you for alternative offers we are not interested steel cased ammo of any kind, any reloads of any kind or high end match grade.Thanks."

Upgraded Wilson combat trigger spring and original with it. Also included is two boxes of ammo to get you started at the range.  Well balanced and accurate it really tames the recoil of the heavy, hard hitting 45 ACP round.

Includes all factory goodies, two mags with pinky extenders for those of you who don't have tiny baby hands which this gun was designed for apparently. For asking price ill throw in a box of self defence rounds and I may also have a box of regular .380 in the safe I can throw in as well. Low round count, this thing is in pristine condition, previous owner only shot it a handful of times and didn't care for it.Any lower and I'm keeping the ammo for another rainy day. Really just trying to get back what I put into it. Travel wise I am willing to go a reasonable distance, but I'm not too keen on going much further than tacoma unless you're willing to add extra funds to cover that."

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. THIS REVOLVER HAS THE HI-VIZ SIGHTS!!!!!! GREEN REAR SIGHT AND RED FRONT SIGHT!"

It is a male very handsome and strong. Kept in kennel all night to sleep and does really well. Looking to get rid of him because he is just not the right personality for my family. I have young children (one of them 1) and he jumps way to much and because of my sons size he knocks him down every time, causing issues. He does not bite and is absolutely not aggressive, just overly energetic and jumpy, which again just isn't working well with our family. Other wise very friendly dog. His name is Scout. I paid $600 for him about 4 months ago. This breed is known to be good hunting dogs when trained to do so."
