NOTE: 2 OUT OF 4 CASES ARE ENTIRELY INTACT , I.E., THE TIN ENCLOSURE THAT PROBABLY WATERPROOFS ALL 28 BOXES HAS NOT BEEN OPENED.  SOME PEOPLE PREFER TO HAVE THE CASE INTACT. I WILL KEEP THOSE 2 INTACT IF YOU WISH, BUT I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF THERE IS ANY AMMO MISSING.  IF YOU WISH TO COMPLETE THE SALE WITH THAT CAVEAT, THAT'S FINE WITH ME, HOWEVER, IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE, THEN WE CAN OPEN THE CASE WHEN WE MEET TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION IF LOCAL OR DIRECT ME TO OPEN TO VERIFY BEFORE I PACK UP FOR SHIPMENT.   Due to my agressive pricing, the buyer will have to pay shipping.  Hopefully, you live in Wichita and that will not be an issue. Of course, no sales tax.  Everything i have read in the reviews of this ammunition is very positive:  no failure to fire, no ejection problems, and  some even saying it is the best AK-47 ammo they have ever used.  This ammo was invented & perfected in laboratories in Europe designed for maximum penetration & kill qualities. I need to liquidate much of my ammo supply and my firearm collection due to a personal family situation in which my financial help is crucial, therefore I am a very motivated seller.

Full-power 10mm loads easily exceed 1300 feet per second and approach magnum revolver ballistics. The compensator and integral, supported feed-ramp barrel ensure that the highest performance ammunition available can be safely fired in the Hunter.When chambered in .460 Rowland, the Hunter offers .44 Magnum performance out of the time-proven 1911 platform. It’s almost a half-inch slimmer than a typical large-caliber revolver, with an easy-carrying flat profile and superb trigger for which Wilson Combat pistols are known. We’ve tested the Hunter with 185, 200 and 230 grain bullets and all shot essentially the same point-of-impact, making it an ideal hunting handgun with an eight-round capacity.Whatever cartridge you select, the Hunter will enable quick, accurate shooting on game with the benefit of quick follow up shots."

The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Uncle Sam's original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America's favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you're looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you'll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finshes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application.

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

It seems that the model 62's slide must be moved rearward a short distance before any movement of the bolt occurs, and this must have rubbed someone the wrong way... so in 1938, a change in action was authorized, which would revert back to an action more like that of the Model 1890.When this change was implemented, the gun's forearm (pump handle) was lengthened and given more grooves - and the gun was re-named the Model 62A.This rimfire rifle will cycle and fire 22 Short, Long, or Long Rifle ammunition interchangeably. Its barrel is round and tapered, with a nominal length of twenty-three inches (mine measures about 1/8"" longer).

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, CZ's Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests they get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to their polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07's safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09's updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 they've had to date.

With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionality identical to the CZ 75B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well. CZ 75B is used by more government, militaries, police, and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.  All steel construction (exception alloy framed compacts) High capacity double column magazines Hammer forged barrels Ergonomic grip and controls Unparalled accuracy Slide-in-frame design for better recoil 3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available) Smooth double action and crisp single action Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials Firing pin block safety  Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6"" bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the Nato-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ's corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checking in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribuation of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcemnt duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005's IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Trigger work, action trued and match chamber. The rifle was then sent to a master engraver. Every surface on the rifle has been engraved to include a matching pair of scope rings. No expense was spared on this rifle. It has never been fired since completion more than twenty years ago. No handling marks, no imperfections , it is as new. It's just too nice of a rifle to carry to the woods hunting. It needs to reside in another collection.I am looking to trade more than anything else. No shipping face to face in Montana only.
