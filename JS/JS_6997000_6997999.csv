Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 4 inch Blue Colt Python, 6 inch nickel python, and 4 inch nickel Python (shot 6 times, amazing looking).Have a nice unfired factory engraved Smith and Wesson model 29-10 with factory wooden display box and a Walther PPK/s with 2 mags and matching box (smith and wesson).Have several 1911 guns in brands such as The rare unfired Colt El Cen 38 super listed above, and a rare unfired Remington R1 1911 Pearl Harbor edition, only 300 ever made, still has factory preserve oil on it.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome (low or high end guns). I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker.

This rifle was my dream build, but due to budget constraints, I have to sell her. The heart of the build is the PWS upper, with the long-stroke (AK47-style) piston system. The upper less than a year old, but is no longer in production. Consider this upper to be better than the current production, because the bolt carrier and piston are nickel teflon coated and the current production PWS uppers are not. This upper also has one more gas block position than the current production does (2 positions for standard shooting, 2 positions for suppressed shooting). She's had less than 100 rounds through her, just enough to properly break in the barrel. Great rifle, super easy to clean, and PWS is known for their reliability. 
Tech specs and parts:
PWS MK116 upper with a 4 position gas block, melonited 1:8 twist barrel, chambered in .223 Wylde (5.56 and .223), PWS flash hider/ muzzle brake, keymod rail with 2 moveable picatinny rail sections
POF anti-tilt buffer tube
Magpul stock and grip
CMMG Lower parts kit 
Hand-polished trigger parts
Single-point sling end plate
Large winter trigger guard
KAK H2 buffer and buffer spring
30 round USGI mag
Also included is a gas block instruction guide, gas block adjustment and removal tool/ front sight adjustment tool
 
Just because I know I'm going to get low-ball offers, I have to state this. THIS IS NOT THE CHEAP CURRENT PRODUCTION PWS UPPER. This is the original Mod 1 series. The MSRP for the upper alone was $1450 before PWS discontinued this model for their cheaper Mod 1-P upper. This rifle is seriously priced to sell. My loss, your gain. 
Thanks for looking."

From what I can find online, there were fewer than 1000 of these guns produced in the late 90s. I've also read that some folks in the Kimber Custom Shop say the Combat Carry is the best gun they ever produced. I don't know if that is just hyperbole or actual statements, but I can say I've shot a lot of guns, and this is a great gun. Mine is the only one in the country for sale on Armslist right now. This is an amazingly accurate smaller 1911 and is one of my favorite guns to shoot. But I don't have a real use for it now; so it is (regretfully) up for sale.A prior owner paid over $300 to have it professional Cerakoted in tri-tone (black frame, gray trigger and safety, silver/chrome slide), and it is really gorgeous. Unfortunately, the Cerakoting undercuts the collectibility of the gun. However, it's still a very rare, premium gun and is in terrific condition. On the range, it runs like a champ. It is very consistent and accurate and is a real joy to shoot. The size, and the nice Carekoting, make it work very well for carry, too.Includes: + Original Kimber clamshell box.+ One 7-round Wilson Combat stainless magazine.+ One generic 8-round stainless magazine. It does *not* include paperwork or original factory magazines. This is not a collectible; it's a premium, rare model handgun in excellent condition.Specs:+ Compact 4"" barrel.+ Officer size alloy frame.+ Weight 28 oz, empty.+ Match-grade aluminum trigger.+ Kimber Meprolight Night Sights (a little dim, but still work).+ Right-hand safety.+ 30 LPI checkered front strap.+ All edges are rounded/melted to reduce drag.I'm not wild about selling this gun, but I've added a few to the collection recently, and my wife tells me some guns have to go. Please also see my other listings.Asking $800 OBO. LOCAL SALES ONLY. MUST BE ABLE TO MEET FACE TO FACE IN THE TRIANGLE. Cash or certified funds only. Prefer to sell, although I will consider a few specific guns for trade. You must have a concealed carry permit or valid pistol purchase permit. I have a concealed carry permit in the event of a trade. I'm an attorney, so don't waste your time or mine with scams."

-------------------------------------------------------
Ok, now that the raw data part is over. Here's the deal: I won this in a raffle. I am NOT a shotgun person. I'm a rifle/pistol guy. Marine Corps rifleman / certified civilian pistol instructor.
I have zero use for this shotgun. I loaded it once thinking I'd use it on a coon that had been hanging around. Coon didn't show up that night...unloaded it...that's the most action it's seen.
But having it sitting around got me thinking that local 3-gun matches would be fun (kinda need a shotgun for that).But this is a hunter shotgun. It would be wasted on 3-gun. Too nice to waste on that sorta thing.So, who wants to trade for something more appropriate for a 3-gun shotgun? Not professional level or anything...a reliable 20-gauge semi-auto would be nice."

The knowned process for milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but NOT these rifles. Each SAM7R-66 semi-auto rifle is produced stronger with finer-grained steel and internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process from Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging system. To describe the process for each forged receiver blank, it requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly alone that makes it a complex and time-intensive production piece, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers unequalled strength, precision and durability for each milled receiver SAM7R-66 Rifle.SAM7R-66 BackgroundAfter successfully fulfilling military requirements, for the first time, the SAM7R-66 semi-auto rifle is being made available to the public with Arsenal’s latest design Picatinny Quad Rail Handguard System.

The PR-01 Picatinny Quad Rail Handguard System was designed and manufactured to meet and exceed the following stringent military requirements:Ability to accept cleaning rod with the rail system installed – achieved with stainless steel internal guide railTo easily align the rail system with both milled and stamped receivers – achieved with a pair of precision machined tabsAbility to constrain debris from entering into the receiver from under-rail openings – achieved with sealing caps of the rail systemMinimize weight, while providing maximum strength – achieved with the triangular support design and utilizing aircraft grade durable aluminum materialProviding the maximum number of rails – achieved with optimum design with 14 rails on the bottom and the sides, and 9 rails on the topIdentification marks for repeat attachment of devices – achieved with clearly marked numbering system on all 4 sidesProvide comfortable grip to the shooter – achieved with compact system profile and smooth finishRifle Summary: SAM7R-66 | 7.62x39mm caliber semi-auto rifle, featuring Arsenal's Mil.
