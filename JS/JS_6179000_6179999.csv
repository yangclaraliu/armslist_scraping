Also I put an extended magazine release on, makes it a breeze- drops right out. All upgraded Stainless steel pins. I have put on an extended slide release, best improvement other than the sights. BUT WAIT THERES MORE!! I have also upgraded the Glock slide take down tab. All alftermarket parts are stainless steel! I have invested a lot into this gun and I would like to get what I have in it because it is barely used, meaning I have only been to the range ONCE with it. This gun is IMMACULATE. If you think this is priced too high well then please keep looking because I am in no rush to sell this perfect firearm. I am asking $850 cash.

It was a bolt-action based on the reliable Mauser action (Mossberg figured if it worked for rifle in WW1 & 2, it would work for shotguns afterward) and according to Wiki, was produced from 1950-1955. It shoots 2 3/4"" shells and has a 2-round magazine that I bought separately online after purchasing the shotgun. It has a muzzle brake and Mossberg's C-Lect-Choke which allows you to change the choke by just twisting the choke near the muzzle.Overall the gun is in great shape for its age, no splits or gashes in the wood stock. The action feels extremely solid and is pretty smooth after I oiled 'er up--trust me, you'll want to fondle this thing all day just smelling the stock and cycling the action. It has a bead front sight. The butt pad has a crack at the toe, this is more of an aesthetic issue if anything as you can't feel it when you shoulder the shotgun. I went to the range to confirm it fires properly, and it does, as anyone would imagine with a bolt gun.Included with the shotgun is the magazine and an Allen soft gun case."
