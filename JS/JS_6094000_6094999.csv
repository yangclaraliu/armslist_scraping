I got this rifle in a trade from an dishonest person, and think I have decided to get out from under it. All it needs is a new barrel pin, evidently Centerfire Systems and Century Arms both had issues with weak barrel pins that break during installation. Half of it is still installed, and the barrel is still in place. Nothing is loose. Not 100% positive on what happened here, but as far as the rest of the rifle goes, it's near immaculate. Being a barrel pin, I would definitely recommend getting headspace checked as well. A parts kit plus receiver and 922R parts is going to run at least $500, then you'd have to pay someone to build it and coat it...all the work is done, but the barrel pin. Comes with the shown ""cheek rest"", underneath it's a standard AMD-65 stock. These CAI builds can bring up to $850.Selling to fix my car, so not interested in trades, and not interested in taking any less than my asking price—this is already a steal! I'll include a couple 30rd magazines as well. $600."

Everything on it is factory from BCM except the handguards, what is on them, and this does not come with charging handle and BCG. It does have about 2,500 rounds on it, which in reality for our group is rather low, but take it how you like. It is still going strong and I have never fired steel case ammo through it.
As stated earlier the the barreled receiver is completely factory from BCM.
The specs for that are:
BCM Receiver
BCM lightweight barrel
BCM Gunfighter Mod 1 Compensator pinned to legal 16"" barrel length
Mid-Length Gas System
No BCG or Charging Handle
The handguard is the Fortis 12"" Rev rail with picatinny going down 12 and 6 o'clock. 3 and 9 o'clock are keymod mounting slots with a small section of picatinny and QD attachments near the muzzle end. In addition to that is the Magpul XTM handstop and QD mounting point.
