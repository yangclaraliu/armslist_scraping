AIM's NIB carrier. .936 gas block and Timber Creek tanker break.Matrix Aerospace 13"" free float.I'll include the Bushnell trs-25 red dot but the case pictured does not come with the Rifle. I will include the pictures ammo. 81 rounds total. 60 rounds of Rainier HP 335gr, 7 rounds of Rainier fmj 335gr, 14 rounds of 400gr flatnose. I'll include a metal 20rd mag which fits 7 rounds of Beowulf. I'll even give you an anti tilt follower. I haven't had any issues with the regular follower but I hear it helps with 500+ grain ammo to not tilt down. It is painted in aged copper. I put on 5 coats and baked in the oven. If you don't like the color, acetone will take it off, but I've gotten nothing but compliments on it. As a note, you can not use pmags on Beowulfs as the mags have a little plastic notch to separate 5.56 rounds. Since Beowulf will be singlestack, metal mags work best. I'm asking $1050 cashFor trades, I like M1 Garands, 308 ARs, and will consider all offers. The worst I can say is no. Just don't lowball me and don't offer me a 10/22 as a straight up trade."

I am looking to sell because I have too many firearms and no longer interested in completing them all. I am selling it at 40% off of what I paid. I am not in a hurry to sell, please dont try to lowball me. The ONLY two trades I'm interested in are an Elcan SpecterDR 1-4 5.56 +$1000. I would also be willing to trade for .223/5.56 ammo-but if its a trade, then I would want to trade value for trade value-which means that I want $4400 of ammo that will end up being around 12000 rounds-give or take a few thousand, depending what you have (at bulk prices, since its a bulk amount). Right now pmc xm193 is $380 for 1000, and m855 is $340 for 1000. This setup has basically the best possible everything for an MK12. This and the KAC SR25 are the two best semi auto snipers in the world. Everything in this is new except for the scope which is very low round count, in perfect condition. I am not interested in parting anything out. This includes:BCM MK12 Mod 0 SPR upper with BCM mod4 charging handle and BCM BCG ($1400)Nightforce NXS 2.5-10 with ADM recon QD mount (MOAR reticle) ($1800)Magpul PRS stock with A2 buffer tube ($250)Custom SASS trigger (Single stage, no travel, 2.5 pound pull, Ultra crisp break and assisted reset) ($350)-capable of near full auto speed and extreme precision. BCM lower parts kit ($80)Vltor Bipod ($180)stainless muzzle brake ($100)Total: $3910 not including shipping or taxes (my actual cost was around $4450)I am asking $2800 (40% off of my cost)This is a $4400+ setup for $2800. With the right hand loads this rifle can hit a pie plate at 1300 yards. With mk262 ammo it can do 1000 all day long. These rifles are known for 1/2 moa or better and push the ballistics of the 5.56 round to its absolute limit. A lot of internet warriors say the 5.56 isnt capable of 1000 yards, and even if you hit at that distance it wont do damage. This isnt 1970-Load this rifle with black hills 77gr tmk polymer tip. It goes transsonic at 1150 yards out of an 18"" barrel. At 1150 yards it will penetrate the chest cavity of a large animal, and because it is a hollow tip it will then proceed to shred the internal organs."

In fact, the 92 has a lineage that goes back directly to 1951 and the introduction of Beretta’s Model 951. The 92S magazine release is located at the rear base of the left-side grip panel. While this location was common on many of Beretta’s pistols, it is unique to many American shooters. Rather than using the thumb of the shooting hand to operate the magazine release behind the trigger guard, on the 92S you would be best off bringing up your support hand and using its thumb to press the release while cupping that hand around the magazine to catch it as it is released (or let it drop free if so desired). We are told that these are Police trade ins from assorted Italian Law Enforcement Agencies."

It's the newer model that is slimmer and lighter, fits under most rails (including my BCM KMR). It retails new for around $125. Works really well at sending that blast and sound downrange, ideal muzzle device for shorter barreled AR's. I've only shot through it a few times and it's like new. Cleaned after each range day.Don't need to get rid of it, just feel like changing it up and trying out a muzzle brake instead of a flash can. Ideally I'd like to trade for a higher end muzzle brake/compensator, but will also sell it if someone really wants it. They're pretty hard to find and usually sold out so don't lowball me if you want to buy it. I also need a light for my p320 so if you've got a Surefire/Streamlight/Inforce or something else higher end I'll probably trade for that too.

Keep your holster, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips. LaserMax is the only maker of an internal guide rod laser. Our patented design has been proven in over 20 years of street and combat experience by SWAT, special forces, federal agencies, presidential security services, and many other armed professionals. It’s the most technologically advanced, hardened laser system you can buy. This product IS compatible with the M9A1 full size.  It is incompatible with the 92A1/96A1/90-Two and all 90 series compacts.
 
Accuracy assured.
The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight installs as close to
the barrel of the firearm as possible. This ideal positioning
ensures the closest, most consistent relationship
between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI)
over all shooting distances. This is important in stressful,
real-life situations when the assailant is likely to be moving.
 
Alignment, factory-set and permanent.
Your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight comes permanently
aligned from our factory for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards.
It will never drift out of alignment. And there is no need to
re-zero it after changing batteries. 
                        As rugged as the gun itself.
Because the LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight fits wholly
inside the firearm—just replacing the gun’s standard guide rod—
it’s as tough and durable as the gun itself.
 
Torture-tested and unscathed.
We've subjected our guide rod laser sights to our own tough tests,
including extreme live fire (20,000 rounds and up); five-story
drops to concrete; crushing by 20-ton vehicles; freezing in blocks
of ice; roasting in flames; in explosions and more.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security blowing-sand test
U.S. Navy and Marine Corps salt-water corrosion test
Extreme high-temperature (120? F.) and
low-temperature (-15? F.) tests
U.S. Navy SEALS test, submersion to 66 feet in
salt water for two hours
U.S. military and National Institute of Justice (NIJ)
live-fire test
Department of Justice and NIJ six-foot drops to
concrete from various angles of gun
                        Pulsating for increased visibility.
Scientific studies have confirmed that our eyes detect
pulsating objects more quickly than constant-on objects.
That’s why ambulance and road hazard lights pulsate.
The LaserMax beam pulsates for increased visibility for both
the shooter and the threat. Even in peripheral vision,
you’ll always know where your gun is pointed.
  
You’re in total control.
With the Guide Rod Laser sight, it’s your call if the beam
is “on” or “off”—a must in situations when you don’t want
to reveal your position. A convenient “on-off” switch is
easily activated by right-handed or left-handed shooters,
without altering the grip. With the  Guide Rod Laser, the
activation switch is exactly where your index finger should
be for safe operation, without interfering with laser beam.
                        Installs in minutes.
You won’t have to visit a gunsmith to install the Guide Rod Laser.
You just field-strip your gun as you normally would for cleaning.
Then replace the factory guide rod and take down lever with
our Guide Rod Laser sighting system. It’s that quick and easy.
 
                        Fits like a glove.
Because LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sights don’t change your
pistol’s dimensions, you know your handgun is going to fit
perfectly into its holster."
