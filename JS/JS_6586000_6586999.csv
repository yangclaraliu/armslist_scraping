PTR (Precision Target Industries) has acquired original Heckler and Koch tooling to produce quality US made G3 type rifles. These rifles are very simple to use, clean, and maintain. I have used a wide variety of ammo in this rifle and have never had a malfunction due to a problem with the rifle, I’ve had two failures to fire due to the very cheap ammo I was using at the time (both of which fired on the second strike). Firing the powerful 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge (.308 Win), and utilizing a delayed blowback roller-lock operation system, the PTR 91 is an exceptionally accurate battle rifle. I have only put about 300 rounds through it. There are a pair of small scratches on the barrel just below the threads that occurred during maintenance but will not affect the performance of the rifle. Below is a list of the upgrades that have been made to the rifle and the prices are based on what I’ve found on HKParts.

The only improvement that was made to this pistol is a traction grip overlay which resulted in a nice rubber texture on the grip and It looks awesome- in the opinion of many it is one of the best looking semi auto pistols out there.The SR series Ruger pistols have proven to be very reliable, while having the softest recoil compared to other competitive pistols which will make it much easier to coax your wife or daughter to train with it. It sits very low in the hand, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise and the ergonomics is perfect for both long and short fingers. The combination of low bore and tight barrel lockup produce an extremely accurate and shootable big bore pistol.

That is why Wilson Combat® hammers are manufactured from the best quality steel to keep that clean crisp trigger pull shot after shot. Considerable attention has been paid to the geometry of our hammers, particularly to the location of the strut pin hole which has been re-located to aid in obtaining a light trigger pull. Experience has shown that our advanced hammer design enhances reliability and the ability to consistently produce a crisp, yet safe trigger pull. All Wilson hammers have been narrowed to provide adequate slide/hammer clearance and some are skeletonized to improve lock time. It is worth noting that skeletonizing a hammer improves the speed that it travels, which in turn reduces lock time. It does not effect the trigger pull. When you build as many custom pistols as we do, you learn the value of a quality hammer. You can count on Wilson Combat® hammers. The Skeletonized Ultralight Hammer is fully CNC machined from solid stainless steel bar stock and heat treated to R/C 48-52 to produce the finest 1911 hammer on the market. This hammer features a skeletonized spur for minimum weight and fastest possible lock time, hammer hooks cut to .020"" with 8 RMS ground finish and narrow half-cock notch to prevent sear nose damage. Combine with our Ultralight Trigger (#190) and Deluxe Sear (#314) for the ultimate trigger job. Minor fitting required."

I'm not sure what to list this for as far as price with the current market but in my research on this gun since it was first released up until now this gun has never been cheap, even if it has been fired. I've seen this gun sell for over $1,000 in the condition it's in and this gun will only continue to increase in value seeing as there were only 1,776 of the pistols made. I'm only looking to sell this gun to get some of the funds for a revolver I have a guy out of state holding onto for me so please no trade offers, I'll listen to reasonable cash offers and if I get anything that I feel is a low ball offer knowing what I know about this pistol I'll respectfully decline and to specify what I mean by low ball I mean any cash offers under $1,000, honestly $1,000 for this gun is on the low end from what I've seen in my research on this pistol. Keep in mind although this is a quality Sig it's also a collector's grade Sig and they're no longer made. It would be perfect if you're looking for something new to add to your collection or if you are looking for a top quality, accurate shooter this would be perfect as well. Serious inquiries only please and thank you! I also have 2 boxes of Hornady 9mm Luger 147 grain XTP ammunition for sale as well if you're interested.

This gun is in excellent condition and has not been fired by me whatsoever so this is unfired outside of the factory. The Trijicon HD night sights are still bright. I'm not sure what to list this for as far as price with the current market but in my research on this gun since it was first released up until now this gun has never been cheap, even if it has been fired. I've seen this gun sell for $1,000+ in the condition it's in and this gun will only continue to increase in value seeing as there were only 1,776 of the pistols made. I'm only looking to sell this gun to get some of the funds for a revolver I have a guy out of state holding onto for me so please no trade offers, I'll listen to reasonable cash offers and if I get anything that I feel is a low ball offer knowing what I know about this pistol I'll respectfully decline.Keep in mind although this is a quality Sig it's also a collector's grade Sig and they're no longer made.

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

This has been my personal shotgun since I bought it new and I've used it for duck/dove/skeet shooting. I can't tell you how many times this gun has been shot because I haven't kept track. I would say definitely over 1000 shots but it still spits them out without a problem. This is your opportunity to have a high quality 3 1/2 shotgun. The gun comes with full/modified/improved cylinder chokes. The improved cylinder is stuck in the barrel. I haven't taken it to a gun smith to get it pulled out because I've always used improved cylinder. I'm sure a gunsmith has the right tools and penetrating lubricants to get it out. It has a hi-viz sight on the barrel (no bead). I'll throw in a floating shotgun case with it. Asking $700 obo. Don't be afraid to make an offer! All I can do is say no! I will only meet in a public area and will give you a bill of sale and get your Drivers License # (you can have mine too)."

Gun has less than 50 rounds through it so it is very new. I will also be including 50 rounds of hornady hollow points in the sale price which is about a $30-$40 value depending on where you find them. This pistol is one of the best if not the best shooting pocket pistols I've ever shot. Long but incredibly smooth double action trigger, decent three dot usable sights (not just blacked out notches like the lcp), and very accurate. I myself am able to get about a half dollar size group at 7 yards. Makes a great pocket pistol, backup gun, and a great gun for women. Only selling to fund a 44mag Ruger I want so no trades unless you have a new model Ruger Super Blackhawk 44 Magnum. Asking $300 with the ammo. No email as I do not check it often.

This brand new Ruger Enhanced Precision Rifle in 6.5 Creedmoor comes with enhancements that make the rifle even better. These models feature a new Short-Action Handguard to provide increased scope clearance, a Hybrid Muzzle Brake that reduces felt recoil and a Billet Aluminum Bolt Shroud, which adds an upgrade that has become popular with Ruger Precision Rifle owners. Enhancements  Short-Action Handguard Hybrid Muzzle Brake Billet Aluminum Bolt Shroud  Medium-contour (.75"" at the muzzle) barrel features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Hybrid Muzzle Brake to effectively reduce recoil while minimizing noise and blast to the sides of the shooter (thread protector included).   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 5R Rifling at minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace and centralized chamber. 20 MOA Picatinny rail secured with four, #8-40 screws for increased long-range elevation capabilities.

The left-folding stock hinge is attached to an AR-style buffer tube and accepts any AR-style stock. Barrels can be easily replaced by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges. Magazine well front is contoured for a positive grip for bracing against shooting supports. Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation, with 5/16""-24 thread for easy replacement. Bolt disassembly tool is stored in the bolt shroud for easy striker channel cleaning. Also features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Billet Aluminum Bolt Shroud. ""Lower"" magazine well halves are precision machined from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum and are Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Patent-pending multi-magazine interface functions interchangeably with AICS and M110/SR-25/DPMS/Magpul-style magazines (works with some M14 magazines). Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger is externally adjustable with a pull weight range of 2.25 to 5.0 lbs.; wrench is stored in the bolt shroud.

It also has AP flip up sights. The Gen 2 Aero Precion lower was purchased stripped along with PSA Premium Magpul STR build kit. I assembled the lower and staked the castle nut per mil spec. I also swapped the bolt catch and mag release for Seekins Precision. This is an awesome rifle and has never been fired. The only reason for the sale is I need cash for another endeavor. I need $750 to part with this one. That's a no haggle bottom dollar price to move it fast. Those of you who know AP, know they are top notch and this is an insane deal. Thank you.
