The E2 edition is a discontinued product that comes with a modified grip that is much more ergonomic and fits the webbing of your hand with much more contact providing a lot more control when firing the pistol. It is a big game changer for me. This special edition also comes with the short reset trigger (SRT) which is another really great feauture that reduces the reset distance the trigger travels after firing. This is another great feature for reacquring your target and getting back in place and ready to fire at a quicker rate. It has a DA/SA system that has an excellent trigger pull that is crisp and smooth on the double action and an awesome single action trigger at 4.4 lbs that breaks just right. The Sig Sauer brand in general has been good to me, and this firearm is no exception as they don't need my review to count toward their sterling reputation- everyone knows the 226 is considered to be one of the greatest pistols ever engineered.It includes 3 Sig Sauer 15 round magazines. This gun is in great condition and has been cleaned after each use."

This is a new build with the exception of the Magpul MBUS flip ups, those I had laying around.  Build list: Lower receiver: Aero Precision AR15 lower receiver, Gen 2 with upper tension screw. APAR501101 Trigger: ALG Defense QMS.  Trigger Guard: Magpul OD Polymer Grip: Hogue Ghillie Green with finger grooves. 15821 Stock: Hogue Ghillie Green with QD mounts and buffer tube kit. 15845  Safety: CMMG Ambidextrous Safety (Not installed at the time of pictures) Bolt catch/release: PDQ ambi bolt catch. PDQ-ABR-BL Mag catch: Knights Armarment Ambi mag catch. KNAC20470 Magazines: C Products 30rd Stainless Steel with Anti Tilt Follower Quantity: 2 Upper Receiver: Aero Precision AR15 Upper receiver with standard parts kit. APAR501603 Charging Handle: BCM Ambidextrous Gunfighter Gas Block: SLR Rifle Works.

Machined to mil-spec dimensions, our lowers work with standard AR15 components and ensure the highest quality with a correct component interface. Gen 2 Improvements  Upper Tension Screw - Allows users to fine tune the fit of the upper and lower receiver through the use of a nylon tipped tensioning set screw inserted in the grip tang of the lower receiver. This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver. Increased Magwell Flare - Allows for easier insertion of magazines and provides a sleeker look.  Includes:  Stripped AR15 Lower Receiver, Gen 2 Nylon tipped tensioning set screw  Trigger: ALG Defense QMS. Description: The ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. 1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter • The ALG Defense QMS trigger pull is smoother than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by honing the sear surfaces smooth while not removing metal below the valleys of the stock surface finish. • Sear geometry has not been changed from standard so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. • Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. • Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness • Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. • A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. • Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. • Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.5lbs. 2. Advantages for the Armorer• The ALG Defense QMS trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.• There is spare parts commonality between the QMS and stock triggers• Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.• Since it is a trigger meeting the U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense QMS can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements. Bolt catch/release: PDQ ambi bolt catch. PDQ-ABR-BL PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™The new PDQ Ambi-bolt release™ puts the operator in control of the firing grip at all times. The trigger finger moves from trigger to mag release to bolt release smoothly without moving the weapon from the shoulder. That is why it is call PDQ (pretty dam quick). When seconds count and your life and others are depending on you. Count on PDQ The PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™ Release is made in AMERICA, uses Military grade steel, hardened and Mil Spec 8526 Class 3 type 2 coated to last a life time of operational conditions. Reloading with PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™When performing an emergency reload a shooter will typically use his left hand to insert a fresh magazine, press the bolt release, and return hand to shooting position. When using the new PDQ the shooter can now move from mag insertion directly back to shooting position. The trigger finger releases the bolt while the left hand returns to the shooting position. Clearing a Double Feed with PDQ Ambi-Bolt Release™While an advantage in firearms reloads, the PDQ advantage when clearing a double jam on the weapon is amazing. When a rifle malfunctions due to a double feed, the shooter will typically move the left hand to the bolt stop release and the right hand is now needed to activate the charging handle. This action is neither smooth or quick. Using the PDQ will allow the shooter to clear most double feed jams without ever removing his hand from the shooting grip. This action is not only faster but also more familiar. Whether in a competition or in a fight for your life the PDQ adds speed and reliability.

It is in immaculate condition. No scratches WHATSOEVER! Looking at the internals, one may question whether the pistol had been fired at all.This Sig has been upgraded with the Factory SRT and also the factory TacOps Magwell grips seen on some of the Tacops series pistols from SIG. It also comes its standard 2 15-round mags and new Hogue G10 smooth hardcoat anodized grips, and a concealed right-hand Kydex carbon fiber Holster. In addition i am throwing in a 50 round box of 9mm NATO rounds. They are made to military standards so i would NOT recommend using them in a really cheap pistol that can't handle higher pressures. One additional feature is that the slide has Custom Professional engavings on it (MOLON LABE) normally found on the Spartan series pistols from SIG. This is a SUPER SWEET one-of-a-kind pistol. You will never find another one like it. my price is $1,050. Let me know if you have any questions, message me ANY time night or day. REDACTED"

The speakers sounds fine and works fine. A coyote ran across my yard 15 minutes after I started using it for the first time.  And no, I wasn't as prepared as I thought I was, and didn't get a shot at it. The remote has a new 2032 battery but the call still won't reach more than about 75 feet reliably. It's supposed to go to 100 yards but it doesn't. I got it working at 100 feet with perfect line of sight once.

If offers excellent control for whatever you are after -- fast-flying waterfowl, upland game or just shooting fun. Matching the rounded pistol grip is the forearm. It is nicely rounded at the fore-end and together, they give the name to this over under gun as ""Lightning Style,"" or in this case, the Citori Lightning model.As to the finish . . . The Citori Lightning over under shotgun features deeply blued barrels, receiver, top lever and trigger guard -- and gloss finished walnut stock. The trigger is gold in the classic Browning tradition. The checkering is a fine line 24 per inch cut that is true Browning with its sharpness and precision. This look and quality has long been the choice of serious hunters and gun writers. There is simply nothing to criticize.The look and feel. The absence of a recoil pad adds to the graceful look of its profile, and, of course, saves weight. Reduced weight is one of the primary advantages of this model. Plus, the general look of the Citori Lightning has its roots in early Browning Superposed shotguns -- from which this model evolved.

The gun is about 6 months old.  It has no wear, scratches, holster marks, nothing.  It, for all practical purposes, is a brand new gun.  The are no modifications other than what I have mentioned above.  It is not ported, nor does it have threads for a suppressor.  The barrel is an original Glock factory barrel, it has not been modified.  I have not throated it either, in case someone was interested.  I will send additonal pictures if you wish, just let me know but pretty much what I have included is what you will get.  Please read my description, as it pretty much covers everything.  I will ship the gun to you from Washington.  I will do so via my FFL to an FFL of your choice.  Please do not ask me to mail it direct, as I cannot do so, per Washington State Law.  My choice is to have you send me payment via PayPal, or USPS Money Order, period!!!! SCAMMERS, NO I WONT ACCEPT CASHIERS CHECK, NOR WILL I SEND EXTRA CASH TO YOUR UNCLE,DAUGHTER, MOTHER..GET A LIFE DIRT BAGS!Please email me with any questions on this listing. I AM NOT interested in ANY TRADES. I understand my price is a little higher than a basic Glock 17 purchase; however, you are getting almost $350 in additional quality extras for this weapon. This is truly one of a kind (in my book at least) and one of my favorite Glock weapons.  I am pretty close on price, based on what I have invested in it so far.Washington State law requires all purchases be conducted through an FFL dealer.  If you live in Washington, an FFL is still required for the purchase.  Transfer charges are usually about $25.00 as are most shipping charges.Thank you for looking.Eric"

Its an older H&R Pioneer 750. Blued, 22in barrel and manufactured sometime between 1950s and 1970s. Hard to pinpoint exactly when. Rifle is very accurate, and easy to operate. Shoots S/L/LR. I've only had it about a year and have shot all kinds of rimfire in it, from Shorts, Longs, Longs CB, Long Rifle, Long Rifle Quiet, and Colibri Long Rifle 'primer only' rounds. Probably have put close to 1000rds through it without a single hicup. Stock was touched up with TruOil adn looks great. Bluing is probably 70% as there are spots of surface rust on barrel, but no pitting. Bore is in excellent shape. Only thing this rifle could use is the cocking indicator. Original owner lost it. I never seen a need to have it. Its pretty obvious when a round is chambered in a single shot. Asking what I have into it, $100.00. FTF in Brighton. I'll even throw in a box (100rds) of Remington thunderbolts. Not really desperate to sell, so I'm stuck on price. If it sells great! If it doesn't, I still have a fun bolt gun to play with."

This is the FN-P version of this platform pistol and is fully ambidextrous, with ambi slide release as well. It is almost new, has only been shot around 25 times and been holstered once. I love the weapon but I just dont see myself carrying it. It would make a great night stand weapon and in the right holster would be a good winter time carry. It comes with 3 15 round magazines and a host of accessories in the FDE carry bag.  It has a real nice feature on the slide, where you can remove a plate right at the rear sight and place a red dot sight (like a Burris Fast Fire or something like that) Also, has a threaded barrel is you choose to put a suppressor on it at some point. (im thinking that suppressors may be much easier to attain and cheaper with the election of Trump) This weapon is practically new and pretty rare in the flat dark earth model. It has raised Trijicon night sights in case a suppressor is added (so you can see over the suppressor). Get yourself a GREAT Christmas present with this FN. I would need to see your Tn. Drivers license and would prefer to deal with someone with their Tn. carry permit. I may be into a partial trade but would rather sell outright. If you have something nice to trade on just let me know. Thanks for looking and MERRY Christmas!"
