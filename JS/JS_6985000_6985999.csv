It also features stippled-textured soft rubber grips that further absorb recoil while affording a firm and positive grip. Besides being one of the most photogenic handguns ever made (it appeared in countless movies and TV shows), it is perfect for home or personal defense, as well as concealed carry and recreational shooting. Superior Reliability The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.     Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only make the 92FS super-accurate, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple to this the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class."

His stock is also incorrect for a 1939 k98k rifle., that is the stock has a cupped butt plate instead of a flat butt plate. So the stock is not from 1939. Cupped butt plates came into use in 1940.

Most STI Trojans come with Bluing for the finish this one has a full Factory cerakote job package that is baked-on at the STI Factory not air-dried so it is the most durable cerakote job available and also has a mirror polished feed ramp better than the standard Trojan. This version came with two sets of grips one set is Rosewood which is a red tone the other is a shiny mahogany style wood. The trigger on this pistol rates 3 pounds it is extremely light and very very accurate the pistol has never been fired I have the regular version hard Chrome which is an everyday shooter when I go to the range and it is my most accurate pistol in any caliber  both of mine are 45 ACP but this one in the listing is very special and I cannot bring myself to shoot it my minimum price on this one is $1,500 cash or very high-end trades you will not find one of these for that price if you go to gun shops that actually carry these which there are not many who do you will find that they cost a little bit more than that for this version if you can even find this model  because  there are only  two shops that I know of in Ohio that carry STI and everything I have seen is blued also the regular version with tax was $1,300 this is one is the STI custom 1911 Trojan and I would put it up against any Wilson Combat or Ed Brown any day of the week it is very hard to get this configuration from the factory if you were to order these options from STI for a regular version it would cost you an additional $500 or more I have all paperwork associated with the pistol everything that came with it including the Box and an itemized list of what the pistol has it came with the pistol brand new $1,500 cash *****REDACTED *****please only contact me if you are very serious about buying and if you have trades make sure they are up to par because this pistol has not a single flaw and I will not trade it for flawed items or cheap items I need something that makes sense if I am going to do any trade."
