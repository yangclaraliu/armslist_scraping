The Effin-A Compensator MKII features 8 columns and 3 rows of exit ports that can be either opened or closed through the very simple use of set screws. The exit ports are not threaded completely through to eliminate the possibility of the screw being over turned into the chamber. This feature also allows the screw to “bottom out” increasing tightness and ensuring that it will not work itself out under the pressure of the gasses being released by the weapon.
The Effin-A Compensator MKII weighs in at only 2.5 ozs; which is half the weight of the previous version. Allen Key is included."

Honestly, this is the nicest Chilean Mauser I have ever seen.  The only reason I am selling/trading it because I am trying to consolidate calibres.Feel free to text me at 219-363-5044.  Thanks :)

BILL OF SALE IS REQUIRED:This rifle requires a bill of sale.  I use the ATF form 4473.  However, I do not require that you provide your social security number or drivers license number on the form, but I do insist that you provide the rest of the information on the form along with filling out the questions on the form.  The form 4473 is the same form you fill out when you purchase a gun from a gun store.  I will be comparing the completed form to your drivers license.OPEN TO TRADES:Swiss K31Swiss K11Swedish Mauser M38Swedish Mauser M94Persian MauserOther Mausers in 8MMAR-15Rifles in 6.5 Swedish Mauser CaliberOther Rifles? Pistols I would be interested in:Glock 19*Obviously I would be willing to include cash in some of these trades :)

WHERE DO WE MEET:I can meet you at the Wal-Mart parking lot on 3221 W 86th St, Indianapolis, IN 46268.  Please bring your own bore light [I have lost mine :( ].  The gun will be in my trunk, so we will have privacy and discretion in handling the rifle.  I have a blanket to cover the gun when it is being transported from my car to yours."

They use the Savage Barrel Nut system, so barrel changes are pretty easy.
 
I was able to get MDT to special make me an FDE version of their Tac 21 Chassis (they don't offer FDE in Left hand), and had my gunsmith do some mill work to get it to set within the chassis (Shilen uses a bolt release on the side of the action housing instead of in front of the trigger guard).
 
I haven't even taken off the newspaper that Shilen wrapped the barrel in for shipping, and of course haven't even fired a shot through it (so barrel break in still has to be done).
 
I also have:
5 MDT Long Action magazines (3.715 Length) still in wrapping to match the chassis/action.
6 boxes of (50) 300 WM Nosler brass - brand new, but I may have cut the tape on a box or two to look at the brass but they are all there.
Redding Die Set (NIB) - Competition - Bushing Neck Size Die for 300 WM- Set 58153
 
Only selling it because I don't foresee having time to develop a load for over a year; I haven't even begun the barrel break in processes on my DTA SRS A1 in 6.5 Creedmoor...  Need to downsize my collection since I already have 7 other precision rifles, and I figured that I should find this rifle a good home since it's a great setup and I just, well, don't have time to use it... 
The barreled action through Shilen was around $1800, and the MDT Tac21 was $800, plus the gunsmithing, etc.  I've got somewhere around $3000 into it.  
 
I'd like:
 
$2,500 for rifle ($3,000, and a 3-month wait if new from Shilen today)
 
$300 for the 5 magazines ($70 each from MDT plus shipping)
 
$420 for the brass ($76 each + shipping online)
 
$210 for the Redding Dies (Midway has them on sale right now for $215 +shipping, which is much less than I paid)
 
OR, $3300 for everything. Buyer pays shipping (shouldn't be too ridiculous)
 
 
I'd like to not break up the rifle/magazines, but otherwise I'm open to selling things separate."

The pistol is is great condition and comes with many accessories at the asking price (optic, stabilizing brace, angled grip, accessory rails, and back up sites). I'm willing to lower the price if some or all of those accessories are not of interest to you.

$980 firm in cash or best trade offer.  Bud's has this one for $1,160 right now, so after your FFL fee, you still save over $200 on a like new(except for being fired) pistol. 
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel, medium weight barrels preferred, uppers or complete.  9mm lower, complete or stripped(preferred).  2-3 Law Tactical Gen 3-M or Dead Foot Arms folding adapters.  2-3 KAK Shockwave kits.  Side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 31+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe a couple of nice micro red dots.  Not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time at retail.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, no flakes, no POS scammers and no BS!

I love this weapon with this trigger its hard not to be accurate. A lot of people try selling there guns for more then you can buy in the store new on here but I'm being reasonable. The cheapest I could find this gun online was $569. Trigger was $175 plus labor and sights were about $150. Total I have into it is $900. Im selling it because I have the same one with a shorter barrel so I want to get something different. Your getting a practically brand new gun already modified and ready to shoot for much less.

No, I will not, under any circumstances, open these cans for you to inspect. I'll be happy to show you powder from my already-opened can if you so desire, but there's zero evidence of degradation and the loads I've shot match up with old Hercules load data. You get a pound of powder and a neat metal can to put in your collection. Or just leave it unopened as a collector's item. I'm in Scott county, TN, and will not travel to sell items unless you're buying most or all of the nine cans I have.$20 per can."

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR 9mm with 5""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel, medium weight barrels preferred, uppers or complete.  9mm lower, complete or stripped(preferred).  2-3 Law Tactical Gen 3-M or Dead Foot Arms folding adapters.  2-3 KAK Shockwave kits.  Side-charging upper receivers for 5.56 & 9mm.  New factory Glock 9mm 31+ round normal capacity mags.  I can get complete PSA and similar uppers shipped really cheap, but want to try and trade for some first.  No BCG needed on the 5.56.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe a couple of nice micro red dots.  Not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time at retail.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  No lowballers, no flakes, no POS scammers and no BS!
Thanks for looking!"

The Browning 1911 was yet another revolutionary gun by one of the greatest gun designers of all time, John Moses Browning, the founder of today’s Browning Arms Company.This great legacy is now reflected in the new Browning 1911-22 pistol. Introduced 100 years after the original 1911 pistol, the Browning 1911-22 is proudly made in the USA, at a state-of-the-art factory located only a few miles south of Ogden, Utah – the same town where John M. Browning lived and where the genius of all of his greatest firearms inventions began.Let’s spend a few minutes exploring the rich history of the original Model 1911 .45 Automatic, and discovering how the world’s greatest handgun came to be."
