The pistol has a stainless frame and blued slide, a safety/ decocker, a slide lock, and a fixed barrel that attributes to improved accuracy. Two 7-round magazines are included. The Bersa is a pleasure to shoot--and shoot accurately--with minimal felt recoil. It would prove to be a good choice for concealed carry, especially for smaller shooters and women who may prefer lighter recoil. $260. I am open to firearm trades of any kind, with or without cash. Buyers must sign bill of sale and CCDW permit holders preferred but not required."

It holds 20 rounds, tube fed. Nice condition for the age. Blueing has a few light spots where it rubbed off, but no rust. Never reblued. Wood stock is nice condition, few slight dings here and there with age and use. Very accurate rifle, I can hit squirrel sized targets at 200yds easily. Cycles/ejects great. Will shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger. I inherited this rifle from my grandfather 13 years ago, he purchased it brand new. The Model 36 is a fairly scarce model, not to be confused with the much more common Model 30, as the Model 36 was only produced in 1955 and 1956, making it a very short run. JC Higgins is only a house-brand used by Sears Roebuck, the rifle was actually manufactured by High Standard Inc. It has a milled forged aluminum receiver, the first model of .22 rifle to have an aluminum receiver instead of steel. Much nicer gun than any modern-day cheapo, designed and constructed to last for decades. Email me if interested, and I have several more pictures. $270 or best offer."

I'll include in a 30 round Magpul PMAG and some 45 degree iron sights.It has a few dings on the lower rail section near the end where I had a bipod attached, but it functions without any issues. There has been one question about the trigger: it is a standard mil-spec trigger: single stage, fairly crisp, but not fancy. I've also had a question about grouping, and while I can't recall specifics, I have been pleased enough with the performance that I would not hesitate to take this rifle hunting once properly sighted in.I've put 100 rounds through it at the range, and it's enjoyable to shoot. I'm selling because I'm planning a .300 Blackout SBR build and would like to put this sale toward the new rifle."

Takedown is as simple as locking the bolt back and verifying that the rifle is unloaded, pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies and pulling them apart.
Simple reassembly allows for a secure connection of the barrel and action and returns the firearm to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used, ensuring consistent accuracy, shot after shot.
Legendary action, a tried and true Ruger design, ensures consistent, reliable performance.
Combination scope base adapter for both Weaver-style and .22 tip-off scope mounts included.
Easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of flush-mounted magazine
Positive, push-button, cross-bolt manual safety.
Heat-stabilized, glass-filled, polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact and abrasion-resistance and unmatched ability to withstand the elements.
Precision-rifled, cold hammer-forged barrel capped with a Ruger® flash suppressor mounted with a 1/2""-28 thread.

Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
　
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
　
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
　
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
　
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

I take it to the range once in a great while, but it mostly just sits in my safe. It has roughly 500-600 rounds through it. It comes with all original materials (case, lock, papers, cleaning rod, speed loader). It also comes with 4 .40s&w mags, a Fluted Lone Wolf Alpha Wolf 9mm Conversion barrel and two ETS 9mm Mags. The gun has a bunch of upgrades as well. It has an Apex Tactical flat faced trigger, extended mag release and slide release, Ghost slide lock lever, ""27"" back plate, ""27"" grip plug, a ghost elite connector, ghost HD trigger spring and a zev 3lb striker spring. This gun has one of the smoothest trigger pulls you've felt on a Glock. I can include whatever stock parts that I can find. I believe I still have them all together. I don't really want to sell this because of how hard these are to get in MA, but I would rather trade it for something I'm going to use more often, or sell it and buy a firearm that I want. All offers are welcome, the worst I can do is turn it down. But I know what this package is worth and I know how hard it is to get a like new Glock subcompact in MA, so please don't lowball me.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit."
