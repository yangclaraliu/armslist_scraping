Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there. The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

My budget is 1000-1200 depending on what you have .  I would need you to ship to my FFL dealer in TX.  He accepts from individuals so you wouldn't have to ship from your ffl .  People ship firearms legally all the time so I don't have time for anyone acting like a cupcake . If you are scared , go to church, if you are worried go get a hug.   All FFL rules apply.   Please let me know and thx ."

See:http://www.core15.com/about-core-rifle-systems/the-core-warranty/ Not familiar with 300 Blackout? It is the fastest growing caliber on the market. Unless your target is 250+ yards away, it is far superior to the 5.56/.223 in many ways. Think of it as a 7.62 bullet in a 5.56/.223 case (hits MUCH harder) with powder that fully burns in a 10 inch barrel unlike a 7.62 or 5.56/.223 which don't burn completely even in a 16 inch barrel. If you want to know more about the 300 Blackout, message me and I'll reply with some links.This gun is brand new and has not been fired since it left the factory.

Original owner and fired very little maybe 100 rounds. May be carried ""cocked & locked""-- these guns are hard to find now. See below for details:.        ( no trades please and must have Nv. Dr. Lic.).
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I got this gun in a trade a couple years ago and planned on keeping it, but just recently realized that my 10 year anniversary is up in a couple weeks, so need to generate some money for an appropriate gift. I never did get around to shooting it, so that is one of the reasons that I am going to let it go. Any of my listed guns that are not penny auctions are subject to being pulled at any time for local sale unless a bid has been place. Refer to pictures for best insight as to condition of gun. I take my pictures outside in natural light, which generally (sometimes to bright or dark) shows more imperfections than indoor pics, which gives the buyer a better idea of the condition than I can explain or rate."
