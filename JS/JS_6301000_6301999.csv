It was bought new by my grandmother in 1957 and has remained in our family since that time. At this point in time I have too many sentimental guns and I'm trying to consolidate so I'm willing to let this one go. It is in very good condition and has some bluing loss where the shotgun shells enter the receiver from the bottom. The wood and the checkering is in excellent condition. Overall this gun is in 90-93% condition, especially for it's age. I can confidently say that this gun has not been shot much, my grandmother would ocassionally shoot it through the years and it's only been in the woods to hunt a handful of times in the last 60 years. I'm asking $1100 and located in the Sevierville area. I also travel to Knoxville quite often. Buyer must abide by all state and federal laws and must be legally able to own a firearm. Thanks for looking!"

The first true subpact in Sig Sauer's classic all-metal firearms line, the P224 is ideal for concealed or off-duty carry featuring all of the features that you would expect from Sig Sauer.
 
Based on the 229, the P224 takes advantage of the hammer-fire reliability and lightweight all-metal frame and puts them in a subcompact package with all of Sig Sauer's familiar controls and functions.
 
In spite of its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a higher capacity of 9mm than those in firearms of its size, at 12+1 rounds of 9mm the P224 has a distinct advantage over most of its subcompact competitors. With that advantage, the new model P229 magazines can also be used to give the P224 an even greater round count.
 
The P224 is an excellent choice for those who are familiar with the P229 manual of arms, with all the controls and operation of the P226 and P229 being the same in the P224.
 
The SIG Anti-Snag (P224 SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, with the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip. The P224 SAS comes standard with SIGLITE Night Sights in the Nitron coated slide model.

It was bought for me as a very thoughtful gift from a family member, who thought since I was a firearm collector, I would also be interested in crossbows. I lubed her up properly and shot her four or five times, just to please the gift giver. However, I have no need for it, and hopefully can give someone a deal on it! It was bought from a family friend who, according to his wife, never once took it out to hunt with it, and it was just left sitting in his safe. But it has no obvious signs of wear that I can tell (the bluing on the flight groove is pristine, which leads me to believe it was not used much).It's in excellent shape, and even comes with a few aftermarket extras!- Soft Crossbow Case, Green with Mossy Oak Camo (not the flambeau case pictured)- Simmons Crossbow Scope- w/ Rings 4x32mm Multi - Reticle - Optional Crossbow Rope Cocking Aid Crank (A $200 accessory on it's own)- 6-bolt quiver along the bottom of the limb- All rail grease, owner's manual, scope manual, etc.No one wants to pay for accessories they wouldn't have put on the weapon themselves, so I've taken that into account in my asking price.Below is an original add for the Quad-300 when it first came out, so you can see the specs when it was brand new to the market (as I said, I'm not crossbow man, so this can explain the bow better than I ever could!)  Barnett Quad-300 Compound Crossbow: The Quad-300 is the fastest, most powerful production crossbow in the world. Barnett's leadership in innovation and superior technology is truly evident in this bow. Details such as the extended trigger pull which allows a much longer power stroke and the heavy duty components used in assembly are simply not found on other crossbows. The unique System 4 limb design, teamed with Radical Cam Technology and the continuous flight track assembly delivers incredible power, speed and performance. The Quad-300 is capable of delivering real speeds of over 300 feet per second when using 2219-XX75- 20"" hunting arrows. With this tremendous speed and heavy arrow projection, the power of the Quad-300 is bone crushing upon impact. In terms of speed and power, Barnett's Quad-300 out-performs all other production crossbows. Barnett Quad-300 Crossbow Specifications: 150-lb Draw Weight, 15-1/2"" Power Stroke, Foot Pounds Energy - 113, Max Hunting range - 60 yds., Limb Type - Compound, Wheel Type - Cam, Arrow Length - 20 Inches, Arrow Velocity - 300 Feet Per Second.Please contact me at (918) six29-031five if interested!
