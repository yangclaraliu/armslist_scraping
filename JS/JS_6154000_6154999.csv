In 2007 S&W released the Model 22 Thunder Ranch in .45 ACP, and thereby perfected the retro-style, big bore, combat revolver. This Model 22 is an N-frame revolver, which means that it is pretty big. Until the recently when the X-frame 500 mag came out the N-frame was S&W’s largest revolver frame. However, the “largeness” of this particular model is reduced by the four inch, tapered barrel that weighs far less and is less bulky than the more common, fully-lugged, N-frame barrels. The Model 22 also retains the old style, square-butt frame. The African Cocobolo wood grips that come standard on the gun are beautiful and retro. This gun has the standard, six round capacity, and utilizes moon clips. Since the .45 ACP round utilizes a rimless case, use in a revolver requires moon clips (flat metal clips that hold all six rounds together in the proper loading position). The moon clips stay on the rounds when in the gun (unlike a speedloader), and assist with positive extraction. This is the fastest method for loading and unloading a revolver. This new Model 22 was inspired by Clint Smith, a nationally known trainer and founder of Thunder Ranch, now located in Lakeview, Oregon. Clint has a special love for combat revolvers, and was the driving force behind the Model 22 revivals. As such, S&W has christened bit with the “Thunder Ranch” moniker. The Model 22 Thunder Ranch is a limited edition, with a special serial number run that starts with “TRR0000.” The Model 22 has a subtle Thunder Ranch logo engraved on the factory grips. This gun also comes with a nifty, olive-drab, soft pistol case, embroidered with a Thunder Ranch logo. This gun is 99% like new and come with several moon clips."

It's an AYA 12Ga Side Lock with H&H style hand-detachable locks. This is getting into the rarified air of high-falootin high grade shotguns. If you know anything about AYA shotguns, this is a Model XXV without all the engraving. If not, it's has 25"" barrels, single selective trigger, Churchill rib, gold washed locks, pistol grip stock and semi-beavertail forearm. It is definitely not a safe queen, but not abused either. Normal dings and wear typical for a high grade shotgun from 66/67. Slight bulge at left muzzle, probably from steel shot by a moron.$1500 OBO."

Here is one you don't see every day. I love this rifle but I just don't use it. In fact, I left it home on my hunting trips this year. I guess it just doesn't fit my shooting activities, which is sad because it's such a quality firearm.  Overall this is in very nice condition, with a few handling marks in the stock and a little bluing wear on the high spots around the muzzle. No heavy hunting wear or anything like that. Action is smooth and feels very solid, it's a joy to operate.  The rifle is VERY accurate, shooting factory Federal 130gr ammo into 0.75 MOA consistently.   I'm NOT including the scope, but I will include the rings if the new owner wants. I'm listing it at a lower than average price because of the handling marks in the wood.   Willing to meet a serious buyer within 30 minutes of Reno. Only trades I'm looking for are a Ruger SR22 pistol, a Ruger or CZ .17 HMR bolt rifle, or towards a PS90."

Has a title out of Illinois which I have.There is a small 1/8 hole that was repaired with marine epoxy that is shown in the photos (beaver got it on a camping trip).The wood at the back has the plastic hull between and there are no seams in the plastic hull. The wood is just there for mounting the motor if you choose too. So no worries about leaks there.Would be open to Miller Tig WelderNight VisionATV/UTVBoats VehiclesToolsAnything Else Really Worst I Can Say Is No

M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used. The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized.  This DDM4v5 features the new DDM4 12.0 Free Float Quad Rail Handguard that extends forward over a pinned, low profile gas block to create one long, uninterrupted top rail platform, as well as providing ample room for mounting tactical accessories and enhancing the system's accuracy potential by isolating the barrel from outside influences. The DDM4 Rail combines the best features of Daniel Defense's previous handguard designs to create an entirely new and improved platform. The 1-Piece Lower Rail of the handguard has been located closer to the barrel for an exceptionally slim, compact exterior footprint that is more comfortable and ergonomic to hold in the off-hand. The DDM4 rail is secured to the upper receiver with a new Bolt-Up System using 4 steel fasteners for rock solid stability and repeatable positioning of rail mounted accessories, and includes 4 Integral Quick Detach Sling Swivel Sockets for a multitude of sling mounting options.

This is the legendary Yugoslavian Zastava M70AB2 underfolder rifle. The Yugo AK rifles are some of the best weapons in the Eastern Block.This Century Arms Yugo M70AB2 rifle is a 7.62x39mm semi-automatic AKM-pattern rifle with a long-stroke gas-piston operation, a rotating bolt and a detachable, 30-round box magazine. The original Yugoslav M70AB2 was manufactured in Kragujevac, in what is now Serbia, at the famed Zastava Arms factory.Features:Caliber: 7.62x39mmBarrel: 16"", threadedGas system: long-stroke gas-piston operationMuzzle Device: Flash suppressor brakeStock: UnderfolderSights: Iron sights (100 -1000), grenade launcher sights (50 -240)Magazine: one 30-round magazineADITIONAL INFORMATION:Zastava has been in the arms-making business since 1853 when it produced its first cannons. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Zastava adopted the AK-pattern rifle and was tasked with meeting the needs of the Yugoslav military. This very specifically called for grenade-launching capabilities, while other distinct changes over the standard Russian AK were also implemented.As the M70 was designed to be able to fire rifle grenades (using blank ammunition), it needed the ability to withstand a good deal of pressure. The rifle’s stamped-steel receiver is actually based on an RPK receiver, and being that it is thicker than the standard AK’s, it has a distinctly bulged front trunion. The RPK is the designated squad automatic weapon for many nations. As part of the grenade launching system of the M70 series of AKs, there is also a gas cut-off device. This device, which looks like a lever, is located at the front of the gas system and above the handguard. It rotates upward to prevent any gasses from entering the piston area and directing all gas pressure forward out of the barrel. In combination with the front sight, the gas cutoff (graded from 50 to 240 meters) also conveniently doubles as a sighting device for rifle grenades. Though the rifle grenades are obviously not available, a grenade launcher attachment is. You can secure it to the threaded barrel by simply replacing the muzzle break. It is certainly possible to fire standard ammunition with the gas shutoff in place, but don’t expect the action to cycle. Needless to say, firing rifle grenades produces a lot of additional pressure inside the receiver, enough to blow off the steel receiver dustcover on top of the rifle. To prevent this, the engineers at Zastava added another thoughtful feature: a plunger at the rear of the receiver that locks the takedown tab on the rear recoil spring assembly. This tab also holds the receiver cover in place. In order to remove the cover and disassemble the rifle, the plunger must be depressed, and this also applies to reassembly of the rifle.This particular model comes standard with an underfolding metal stock and an upgraded palm-swell/finger groove synthetic pistol grip and handguard. Another distinct feature of the M70AB2 is the elongated handguard with three, instead of two, cooling slots. This addresses one of the AK design’s drawbacks, which is the standard, short handguards don’t do a very good job of protecting the support hand from barrel heat under sustained fire. A longer handguard offers the shooter a greater purchase area and better protection.GENERAL INFORMATION:Please text to 8I3-36o-9642, or email for pictures and/or more info.Please do not text, ""what is the lowest price you'll take?"" - I listed the item at my asking price.

Information from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
Action: Gas-operated, rotating bolt
Feed system: 2, 5, 8, and 10-round detachable box magazine, 12, 20 or 30-round detachable drum
Info: The Saiga-12 is a 12-gauge shotgun patterned after the Kalashnikov series of assault rifles and named for the Saiga antelope. Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.
In response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, U.S. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13662 on July 16, 2014 blocking the importation of all Izhmash products, including Saiga shotguns and rifles."
