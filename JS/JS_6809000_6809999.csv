It has knicks here and there but that is character. It is super accurate. It has a slight scent of Japanese imperialism and engineering.

Purchased from gunbroker approx 8 months ago and does not function. The seller refused a return so now I am tryin to sell to recroup some of my loss. The lugs on the back of the cylinder are partially sheared off which is preventing the cylinder from turning. I have looked online for a replacement cylinder but have not had any luck and am out of patience as far as continuing to look for one. The rest of the revolver appears to be in decent shape and could be used for parts or if someone with more patience than me can find a cylinder for it. Selling for $100. Still must have a buyers permit or CCW. Located in SW Omaha area. Feel free to contact for any additional questions of pictures.

SELL or TRADE! Century Arms Catamount Fury I AK action 12 gauge semi-automatic Shotgun. These are selling in the range of $550 to $750+ as you know if you have been shopping. Everything works except in my anxiety to ""improve"" it I boogered up the bolt CARRIER by taking off too much at the rear. One of the design faults of the Fury is that the carrier slams into the spring retention holder. So I was attempting to ease the pain. As a result the carrier derails in the receiver. I used 2 bolt bumpers which works pretty good but only with very light loads. The heavier loads derail the carrier.
I think this would be a project for a guy who has some machine shop experience with welding. Problem solved!
Other than that the gun has less than 300 rounds through it.

I have never opened one of these cans, but I believe it to be similar to the last picture — copper-washed steel-cased ammunition with 147-grain FMJ bullets, Berdan primed but not corrosive. This video shows a guy opening what I think is probably an identical can: www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd61dO26t90At the same time I bought these, I also bought about 500 rounds of what I believe is the same ammo, though not sealed in cans, and it worked fine in every weapon I tried it in — an M1A, an HK, and an AR.This is a factory sealed can, so part of its value is that it's sealed, protected against aging. As such, I will not open it for your inspection, but if you like, you can hand me your money, open it in front of me, and I will return your money if it is not as described. For this price you can certainly just open it up and shoot some for cheap, but since it's sealed, it would be a good item to put away for ""just in case"".I have one of these cans left. The lettering in the first picture is stamped in the can, but I inked the letters for clarity. From what I can tell from my reading, the ""92"" in the lot number is the year of production, and the other two numbers have to do with the date of production and the facility. In short, it is 25 year old ammo, but of course, sealed since the day it was made.$200 for one can of 520 rounds — 38¢ a round, about the going price for 5.56 these days!I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I'm willing to ship at buyer's expense though it would be pricey. Buy it from me and have it today – no sales tax, no dealer fees, etc. I will be offering a few other things, so check out my other listings and let's make a deal!"

Nighthawk , Kimber , Springfield , Smith . I also have several listed as I am thinning out my collection some. Look at my listings. ThanksI will trade towards multiple cheaper guns, gun for gun, or cash from either one of us to even out a trade.I am only trading for pistols, no long guns at all. I am specifically looking for the following.1) Gold coins at 95 % spot price2) Colt Snake guns Python , Anaconda , Cobra , King Cobra , BOA , Diamondback , Viper3) Colt guns ( I do like older ones)4) Nice revolver guns, Ruger GP100 , Ruger Security Six , Smith Model 29 and many more, Smith and Wesson prelock revolvers, Performance Center Smith revolvers; prefer 357 and larger5) Nice 1911 guns 6) kimber guns including kimber k6 357 , I do not care much for the Kimber Solo unless cheap sorry just haven't had much luck with them7) Performance Center Guns8) Will accept ammo if still in the original box and at a really good deal. I can order ammo by the cases and get good deals so this is basically to even out trades or for bulk ammo at a good discount in case you have some calibers you don't need anymore. (mostly pistol ammo but will accept others possibly)Face to face transaction, I must see your concealed carry permit or get your pistol purchase permit. I will provide the same. If you do need to use a credit card, I do have an app that we can use but it costs 3% extra, and if anything goes through ffl, it is at your expense. I'm willing to help anyway I can on my end. Thank you"
