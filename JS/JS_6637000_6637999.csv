For sale is a Savage 111 Bolt action rifle chambered in 3006. Was purchased used from an FFL, and have been shooting it for a few months now. I've decided to sell it to recoup some money i spent on other toys.. I don't have any information regarding its previous level of use, however the rifle IS in good, functioning condition. The only issue with the rifle is what appears to be- and i could be wrong, but i dont want any disappointments- a bit of surface rust forming on the barrel. Its a slight discolored/rough patchy spot, and i am assuming it is rust. Otherwise it appears to function nicely and all. I put about 30 rounds through it with zero issues; not much, but the thing is fairly expensive to shoot so i tried not to waste ammo. May need to be zero'd in as i removed and put back on the sight. The Busnell scope is a 3-9 and is included, but appears to be your typical cheapo scope that comes with rifle packages. I can't say it gave me any problems, though. Rifle has an Accutrigger according to the sticker on the stock.Also available, either as a package with the rifle or AFTER the rifle is sold, is 180 rounds of Wolf Military classic 145gr FMJ steel case as well as 10 rounds of Federal Power-Shok 180gr soft point ammo. 65 cents a round for them all (Paid over 1$/rd for the Federal, and about .75+ for the wolf with shipping).450 OBO for the Rifle & Scope ONLY.Need gone ASAP"

For Sale Trijicon TA01 with Docter RDS on it. Haven't really played with the RDS, it's just there. It works fine as far as i can tell (lights up) but i never zero'd it, only got to shoot the rifle a few times with it. 
Some details: Was purchased from a retired PO who didn't put much use on it, however, it was on his work rifle and spent a lot of time banging around in a gun rack, hence the condition. Comes with hard case and paperwork. I called Trijicon with the Serial # on the case and they said it is 9 years and change old. That said, to be honest, i haven't removed the Docter sight mount and it does cover the Serial # on the actual unit. I have no reason to believe that it is the wrong case for the sight as all of the correct paperwork is there, but i suppose it is possible.. Tritium still glows in the dark, but dont know how bright it is supposed to be so i have nothing to really compare it to. ACOG works great, sighted in and wonderful to shoot with. Glass itself is in pretty good condition but is a bit dusty and such, and will need a good cleaning.Comes with lens pen, some extra screws, loc tite, and other random stuff that was in there as well as paperwork for everything.Also have a new in the pouch GDI R-COM E-Model QD Mount that i will throw in with the purchase for the right price.Looking to move it to put some cash back in my pocket after a large purchase.Can meet in Newark/Woodbridge/East Brunswick, but East Brunswick is best. Would consider traveling.900$ OBO (Includes  QD mount at this price)."

Thank you.History of its developement:The Special Investigative Section of the Los Angeles Police Department asked Kimber to build them a gun with Kimber's standard build including match barrel, match trigger, wide grip safety, beveled mag well and checkered flat backstrap, and then to add the following extra features: stainless steel slide and frame, special shaped tritium night sights with square edge for one-handed cocking, flat milled top of slide to cut down on sight glare, ambidextrous safety, checkered front strap for more sure grip, SIS light weight hammer, and the series 70 style firing system (no firing pin safety). Kimber coated it with their KimPro coating, gave it a nice set of custom wood grips and a stylized SIS milled into the slide instead of cocking serrations. It was so popular that Kimber made an extended production run for the civilian market for about five years. Production of the SIS version was discontinued in Jan 2010."

This rifle was built in Romanian by RomArm/Cugir and imported by Century Arms. CAI simply imported these, they came over with double stack mag well and were not single stacks that were sloppily opened by century. This is not a cobbled together Century gun or lower quality WASR. Cosmetically the only issue is the previous owner either cleaned the bolt carrier with something wicked or decided to polish it up. Mechanically it runs great and is in the original configuration it was imported in with original palm swell laminate hand guards. Only reason I'm selling is because I'm an AK collector with many other AK's and even more parts kits. Asking $675 OBOTags: AK AK-47 47 AKM Romy SAR1 SAR 1 SAR-1 Rommy Romanian AKM-47 AK47"
