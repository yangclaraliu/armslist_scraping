The carefully balanced, custom-ground buffer spring, combined with the JP LMOS buffer, greatly reduces friction and vibration - say goodbye to the annoying “spoon over a cheese grater” noise of conventional springs and buffers. Fits buffer tubes for both M4-style collapsible stocks and also, using the included spacer, the longer tubes for fixed rifle stocks.The Auxiliary Spring Rate Kits for the JP Silent Captured Spring allow custom tuning of the device to a given rifle. While the default spring offers the best performance for the widest range of configurations, a simple disassembly and reassembly of the JPSCS with a slightly different spring rate can yield truly optimized performance, particularly for rifles without an adjustable gas block. Benefits of the Gen 2 Captured Silent Springs include:New aluminum guide rod cuts overall weightHeavier masses translate to more buffering mass and chance of bolt bounceFull correspondence between SCS masses and H1, H2 and H3 buffersInterchangeable buffers allow conversion between AR-15 and AR-10 models (and vice versa) Includes spacer to allow for installation in both carbine-length and rifle-length buffer tubes. The standard weight buffer weighs approximately 3.6 ounces. The buffer contains one Tungsten weight, and two steel weights."

This is not just the standard kit that you buy from the store. It has pretty much everything you need to get started reloading today. When you buy the kit it doesn't come with any reloading dies, powder, bullets, brass, scales, measuring caliper. This kit includes a 9mm die set, i believe it has a 357 mag kit, but i never used that as this will come with some tools from a previous set I had. I am including a few hundred high quality 9mm HP bullets from hornady as well as a few hundred small pistol primers + brass. I have some Unique small pistol powder that will be thrown in as well. Its about 1/8th full which should make maybe 100 rounds.You will be set to reload 9mm. No live ammo included. Also included is a digital powder scale, digital caliper for measuring length of the bullet, and a few 100 round bullet holders. You will not be able to piece together the required parts to reload for under 400. This press has only had maybe 200 rounds through it if that and comes with the lifetime limited warranty of Hornady, and they have excellent customer service. You will have to configure it for your own preferences as I tweaked it for my own uses. You will see alot of extras in the photos. I cant begin to name everything included. There is also a second single stage press that you can use for anything such as a dedicated depriming station."

ANSCHUTZ target rifles are known worldwide for their accuracy, precise construction and unmatched shooting performance. The excellent characteristics that allowed ANSCHUTZ sporting equipment to dominate national and international competitions such as the biathlon since 1856 can also be found in the new ANSCHUTZ semi-automatic precision rifle in .22 long rifle.
The MSR RX 22 is a joint development by three German companies: ANSCHUTZ, GERMAN SPORT GUNS and ESC Ulm. The MSR RX22 barrels are manufactured to the same exacting tolerances of ANSCHUTZ's target barrels with a special button-rifling process. The barrel also features a recessed target crown. The single-stage trigger's components are hardened and finely ground to produce a fast trigger with a very consistent release. The trigger can be adjusted from 3.3 to 5.5 lbs., and it is set at 4 lbs. by the factory."

Rifle: Savage 10 FCP-K with 24” heavy profile, 1/10 twist, free float, fluted, threaded barrel, and muzzle break. Accustock, accutrigger (modified with solid trigger stop and lighter spring…breaks at 10 oz…can be returned to factory pull weight in a couple minutes by reinstalling included factory trigger spring), harris bipod, 10 rd box mag.
Scope: Meopro 4-12x50 with weaver 20 MOA base and rings. Research this scope…the clarity is ridiculous (99.8% light transmittance) and the turret adjustments are perfectly accurate and repeatable. My friend has a $2500 nightforce, and when looking at his neighbors cows through it at dusk or dawn, you could only make out outlines and silhouettes…with the Meopro, you could actually see individual hairs on the cow’s hide.Will include 1 box of Federal 175gr gold medal match sierra match king BTHP, along with ballistic data for this specific rifle/scope/ammo combination (measured with ballistic software hooked to chronograph, taking into account bullet weight, velocity, barrel twist, and scope height in relation to bore) Provides precise MOA adjustments for range and windage in 50 yrd increments out to 1100 yds. You can drive tacks at any distance the first time out.
I have @$1600 into this but have switched to a 6.5 creedmoor set up. This is a great opportunity to pick up a 1000 yd rifle for a very reasonable price.

From researching the serial number (126xx), the year of manufacture is 1888 as a factory letter that would indicate that they produced at least up to 20000 revolvers in the first production year. Overall it is in ok condition for an antique pistol of it's age. The serial number on the cylinder and the frame are matching. The nickel plating has quite a bit of loss on the cylinder and some small spots of loss on the barrel near the muzzle, near the cylinder and on the grip frame. The bore is good, and strong rifling. The grips are in great shape and all original. The grip safety works as intended and the action cycles smooth. Overall a nice antique revolver.

The 715 is as it was before — designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Famous for its swappable barrels, 2017 sees the revival of the Pistol Pack. Shipped with 4”, 6” and 8” barrel/shroud assemblies in the modern heavy vent shroud profile, the weight of which tames the recoil of the .357 Magnum very well. 
Like it’s famous predecessors, barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. 
The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent, helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy over other revolvers, it’s that consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design. Additionally, the clockwise-rotating cylinder reduces stress on the crane, since it turns in the same direction the crane locks, prolonging service life and keeping everything tight. The 715's frame is robust, built to handle the heaviest of factory loads. 
Each Pistol Pack is shipped in a custom Dan Wesson hardcase with compartments for the additional barrel assemblies and a factory-supplied barrel wrench kit.

Elegant in Blue and Stainless this small, single-action-only could be found under a cummerbund or a pair of bibs. It's what you have been asking for! No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come.  Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.  New Unique SA/DA Trigger System The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

This Colt Anaconda Is Chambered For .44 Magnum And I Have Two New Boxes Of Hornady .44 Magnum Ammunition To Go With The Gun, But The Gun Is Also Designed For .44 Special Ammunition If You Should Feel The Need To Tone It Down In Power. I Will Only Deal Face To Face Locally And Do Not Play The Texting Game Or E-Mail Tag. I'm Asking $2,500 O.B.O. For This Revolver Due To Its Pristine Condition, If Interested Please Send A Local Phone Number And The Best Time To Call With Your Best Offer. I Will Not Respond To E-Mails With-Out A Phone Number To Call You Due To Spammers Etc....And This Post Will Remain Up Untill I Sell The Anaconda, Or Just Decide To Keep It. So Please Don't E-Mail Just To Ask If Its Still For Sale, Thanks....."
