Perfection isn’t accomplished overnight. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Model 82A1. For more than two decades, this short-recoil, semi-automatic series rifle has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so impossibly precise, it’s hard to believe it’s man-made.
Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.....exciting to shoot."

Looks like you could run a bore rag through the barrel and shoot it though. I had a gunsmith take a quick look at this gun and confirmed that the gun is chambered in 7.62 x 54r. Just got this gun out tonight to take another look at it and noticed the handle on the bolt is broken. you can still open and close the bolt though. I think it must have been drilled and pinned at some point. Looks like it could be welded without any problem. Buyer must be an Indiana resident and show a valid current state issued ID.

Fusion MSR Ammunition is engineered for hunting MSR's. Each round performs its ballistic peak through 16"" to 20"" barrels which are the common lengths found on these rifles. Each load features a low-flash, fast-burning propellant and primers compatible with the free-floating firing pins that are characteristic on MSR's. Each brass case features a harder case head for exceptional primer retention, military-style colored iris gives visual confirmation or proper case metallurgy. These rounds will feed and function perfectly from magazines and exhibit velocities that are tailored to the unique ballistic tendencies of these rifles. These loads are loaded with a specialized fusion bullet that is perfect deer sized game. Each bullet features an electrochemically bonded lead core to copper jacket, eliminating the possibility of a core/jacket separation. The boat tail rifle bullets feature a slight dimple in the nose that delivers exceptional accuracy and devastating terminal performance which delivers an impact that radiates lethal shock throughout the target. This energy is optimized through mass weight retention, a top-secret tip-skiving process and superior bullet integrity. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.
