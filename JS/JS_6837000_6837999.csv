This rifle is the Czech ""AK"" despite being completely different. You can feed it with stripper clips of 7.62x39. It's a striker fired rifle that utilizes a gas piston system to cycle the bolt. It uses a similar leaf sight system to the AK varients, as well as the slant cut muzzle break. This particular model has a folding stock that I have lovingly wrapped in black Paracord for those cold or hot days. It also has two sling attachment points, but is currently set up with a single point sling.
It comes from the factory with a railed handguard and a Tapco verticle foregrip. I swapped the Tapco grip with a Magpul AFG. It's techically a quad rail system. Rail on the bottom of the hadguard, two on the sides, and one on the top. Optic, Light, and lazer ready.
Complete with this package is 4 magazines. All of them hold 30 rounds. *Note*Cannot take AK mags, must use Vz.58 mags.
I have maybe 250 rounds through it, and that's no joke. I just haven't shot it as much as I thought I would.
 
I am willing to trade for an AK of equal value."

It's a great gun, I just want to try something different. The gun is in excellent condition, with minimal wear on the barrel and no wear anywhere else. This gun is loaded with all the goodies to make it pretty much perfect. Night sights, rubber grips, new trigger (amazing, very smooth, crisp, minimal over travel) and springs, etc. I'll post a full detailed list belowDropping this thing down to $450 FIRM. This is the last drop, it's now listed at almost half of what it's worth to get it the hell out of my safe.Springfield XD Mod.23 MagazinesDouble mag pouchSpringfield soft caseFactory plastic case w/brush, lock, paperwork, etc.XS Standard Dot Night SightsTalon Rubber GripsPowder River Precision spring kitPowder River Precision trigger kitSafariland ALS holsterI also have the factory sights & trigger includedAsking $450 for this, if you wanted to go buy one new and add all of this stuff you'd be looking at $800+. Not looking for trades, cash is king.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing crazy. Face to face ONLY, I will not ship. You must be 18 with a purchase permit or 21+ with a CPL, no exceptions.Best way to contact me is by shooting me a text at REDACTED any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

This revolver was made in 1978, SN: R59XXX, it's in excellent condition and has spent much of its time in my safe (I've only fired it once or twice since owning it, and it looks like the retired doctor who owned it before me kept it mostly as a safe queen). I'm looking to consolidate some portions of my collection, and I'm partial to shooting my S&W K22 over the Diamondback mainly because of how nice the Diamondback is. This gun is in almost mint condition, it looks great in the photos and even better in person, the lock-up is like new and the trigger crisp like you'd expect of a Colt revolver. I can provide more photos for serious buyers. This isnt one of the often seen Colt armslist scams, I've included one photo with the local Ellettsville newspaper to authenticate (Dated 15MAY17).  I'm going to offer this locally for a while before I decide to list it in auction on Gunbroker. I'm in no hurry to sell and the value of these snake guns go up every day. I'm pretty firm on price for now, and if it dosen't sell it can always go back into the safe for another couple years. If you're looking to round out your Colt collection, now is the time before the company goes under and the prices rocket. I'm not very interested in trades, but I'd entertain them if the offer was right. I'm located in Ellettsville, but travel up as far as Plainfield often for work."

If you are a reloader, I can also include about 100 pieces of matching headstamp reloadable brass (federal). I bought the rifle on a impulse and it has been a safe queen. I put about 100 rounds through it right after I bought it and it has been setting ever since. Rifle was properly cleaned and lubed after each firing. I just do not shoot it as much as I thought I would. I have a few other projects I need to get off the ground so I have decided to let this one go. Price dropped to $2500 or best offer. I will listen to reasonable offers. Do not low ball, if you do I will ignore you. Serious and reasonable offers only.  I have several more pictures I can email upon request."

How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel.  This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology  It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.  Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols.  It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"

ROCK-OLA Music Company made the fewest number of rifles of the 10 major suppliers. They also supplied stocks and handguards to other makers.  This rifle has a cartouched  ROCK-OLA stock, handguard, receiver, barrel, trigger housing , front sight, and magazine . Early push button safety and flip sight. All other parts are all USGI. NOT AN IMPORT. A great piece of history. $1400. 
There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for

As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"
