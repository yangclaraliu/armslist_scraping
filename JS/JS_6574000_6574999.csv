The M is machined at the factory to accept standard AK magazines. This carbine loads well, fires great and feels good on your shoulder. The rifle sports a nice short 16 barrel which is easy to point and find your target. Thumbhole stock makes for a good feel as it welds to your cheek :) I will leave the dust cover scope rail on the rifle. I used it for a scope/aimpoint. The ONLY known minor issue with this rifle, the rear sight leaf spring keeps popping out around the third shot. Not a problem if you have a scope on the rifle! The wood is a typical Chinese Blonde wood, it is a light soft wood."
