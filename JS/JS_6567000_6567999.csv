I received this as trade, so unknown history. Someone did a poor chrome finish job on most all of the metal at some point in distant past. It is still solid, no flaking though. Some external pitting on underside of barrel, but wood hides it. Also it has a full matching set of Canadian Longbranch furniture on it-all matching color/tone, except the sniper cheekrest is lighter tone. Would like GA carry permit, but GA Drivers license & Ga Hunting license will suffice if necessary.  $300 Firm, no ammo. I can meet at public place in or around Gwinnett county."
