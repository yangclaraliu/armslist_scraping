I had just gotten this stock in from VLTOR when we had our 2nd child and I sold the rifle before ever firing a shot. There's a tiny bit of wear to the butt of the stock from me taking pictures of the rifle after mounting it in this. The new owner of that rifle already had a wood stock they wanted to use so I'm selling this stock by itself. This carbon fiber composite stock weighs less than 3lbs and is extremely comfortable to should. Both the length of pull and the height of the buttstock are adjustable, a must have for when you mount optics to your M1A. MSRP new is $529. Most places sell it for around $500. I've priced it low to hopefully find it a new home quickly! The color is a very light foliage green. You could, of course, cerakote or paint it whatever color scheme you wanted.While the preview picture is of the butt stock, the ENTIRE stock is included. Just snap in your M1A and you're good to go.

I believe it's 647 grain and the ammo is Lake City 14. Ammo matches can, which is in perfect shape and nicely marked too.About as genuine USGI as you can get and in perfect shape, ready to feed your M2, or delink and feed your single shot rifle.The can and the links are worth 20 bucks by themselves so at my price, the ammo is a bargain.
Most dealers were getting $300 a can for remanufactured stuff as all the USGI has dried up. There is some out there with 20% tracers but you can't shoot them anywhere in Minnesota, and their prices were $275-300 a can plus shipping....and that stuff has dried up too.You want the best, I have TWO CANS ONLY, each 100 rounds linked in the can for just $275.00.Face to face/Cash and carry, no tax, no shippiing.Buy them both and I'll take $270 each can.Thanks for looking!"

Super clean, locks up tight.Comes with box, manual and two check-mate mags as pictured. $800 firm cash in hand at a local Lancaster County FFL, buyer to handle all transfer fees. Strong preference is to sell, my only trade interests (+/- cash) are a CGW'd CZ PCR, or a Bobtail Commander 1911 (DW Guardian, V-Bob, etc)From the CZ-USA site:Discontinued 2015. 2015 brings the launch of the first pistol made in the USA that bears the CZ name. The CZ 1911 A1 is an homage to the past, a 5” government sized model built as a modern incarnation of the original 1911 A1. That original was adopted into US service in 1924, ‘improving’ on John Moses Browning’s original design. Our version makes several small ‘improvements’ as well, swapping the checkered plastic grips for checkered walnut, adding serrated slide stop, magazine catch and mainspring housing and using a stainless steel barrel. For the sake of the shooter, we elected to forgo the lanyard loop, and added a taller set of sights that are easier to use, with the front dovetailed in so that it can be swapped more easily. Though there are a number of changes, we feel the CZ 1911 is still true enough to the original service pistol to wear the A1 name.
Built with much tighter slide-to-barrel and slide-to-frame tolerances than vintage models, the result is much improved accuracy without compromising reliability. Built without a trigger safety, the trigger itself is aluminum, with pull specified at 5 lbs., give or take a pound. Its forged carbon steel frame and slide are finished in a black oxide and it ships with two 7-round magazines."

THIS FIREARM DOES NOT FUNCTIONThis is a model 60 glenfield/marlin, made in 1982. It does not function, as is-where is. I have owned this firearm since the early 2000. I took apart to replace the buffer.  The trigger/hammer pack went missing in a move several years ago.  To get it to function a new trigger pack is required.  I rather sell this as a wall hanger or extra parts.really only trade I would take is 9mm ammo or 300blk ammo"

All parts are Bula except the new SAI trigger group. The gas cylinder is cast, piston is nitride.  The gas cylinder black coating shows a little discoloration this could be a used cylinder I’m not sure it was this way when I bought the barrel receiver.  Everything else on the barreled receiver is new.
 
The barrel is one of the first 15 produced by Bula and does not have the retainer clips slots.  It’s set up to go in  An EBR chassis. But the handguard can be attached at the rear with high temp glue, weather stripping adhesive, epoxy. or high temp RTV gasket silicone . It is currently not glued to the barrel.  It's only attached at the front band just in case the buyer wants to put it in a chassis. 
 
 
Stock is an older hard to find smooth side USGI fiberglass .  It’s straight and lock up is tight.  The selector hole has been filled.  Stock has a textured coating with OD green paint. 
 
 
 
Also including one SAI magazine and a 5/8”x 24 thread adapter (I know that adapter is on backwards in the picture) No muzzle brake included.
 
 
 
I have decided to go a different route with another rifle and no longer have interest in continuing with this one.  
 
Will accept paypal or USPS money order.  I will ship to your FFL.  You will need to cover shipping.

Interesting history with this model!Built like a tank!  If you run low on ammo this pistol is without a doubt the most comfortable club you could ever beat someone with!  Does not appear to been fired very much. I took it in on trade when I really needed the money more than another pistol. I really do like it and it shoots great. I assume because of the weight of the pistol you don't get that normal 40 caliber snap of recoil much like my FNS-40's.  I fired two magazines through it last week and it functions perfectly. Sites appear to be adjustable as I recall and I can send plenty of photos or other information if necessary. It does come with two magazines. One is a 10 rounder, other is an eleven rounder.  It does have what appears to be the original box for it but there is no label or sticker is on the exterior of the box proving this. Super cool pistol.  I will require a copy or at least your drivers license number and the bill of sale all Missouri and federal laws apply. Please make sure that you can prove you're a Missouri resident with proper documentation and that you have not  been convicted of any felonies anywhere. I will be perfectly honest with you I'm not exactly sure what these handguns go for I've seen everything from 550 to 450. I can say that it is in very good shape so please don't hesitate to send your best offer if my list price seems high.Thank you for your time."

This is a Rock Island Armory Tactical II, which comes stock with a full length guide rod, ambi safety, adjustable sights, G10 VZ grips, and a mag-well. It has run fantastically and is a wonderful pistol to shoot. This will come with the case (matched by serial), one magazine, and of course the gun itself. It is in good shape as pictured, I did carry it a few times and has some minor holster wear. The white dots on the rear sights were blacked out to improve the sight picture. Asking $480 at the Damage Factory in Centennial, but I'm willing to entertain other FFLs. No trades please"
