The new Precision Rifle employs a hybrid ""Target"" chamber, which safely accommodates 5.56 NATO cartridges while providing excellent projectile control and accuracy for both .223 Rem and 5.56 NATO cartridges. The rifle ships with two Ruger AI-Style Precision Rifle magazines that accommodate 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. factory ammunition loaded with the longer, higher ballistic coefficient projectiles popular among long-range shooters. Like all Ruger Precision Rifles, this model's highly accurate, free-floated barrel is cold hammer-forged from 4140 chrome-moly steel and features 5R rifling for minimum bullet upset. Minimum bore and groove dimensions (air-gauged for process control) and a centralized chamber deliver outstanding accuracy, longevity and ease of cleaning. This new model features a 1:7” twist rate that stabilizes long-for-caliber projectiles. All models of the Ruger Precision Rifle are equipped with a left-folding stock with adjustable comb height and length of pull, an ergonomic pistol grip and a Precision Rifle handguard, all of which may be customized with AR-style components. The Ruger Precision Rifle also features a Ruger Precision Rifle Hybrid Muzzle Brake, a 20 MOA scope base and the Ruger Marksman Adjustable trigger, which provides a user-adjustable pull weight range between 2.25 and 5 pounds.check us out on linehttps://www.abam-co.com/Like us on Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/abamindustriesreno/"

These projectiles are die cast/swaged, triple coated, and then re-struck in a carbide die. TSJ bullets have no exposed lead, therefore avoiding lead exposure upon firing and producing less fouling with higher velocities. The bullets are individually sorted by weight to the nearest 0.2 grains to ensure match qualityNote: You may get all nickel plated casings in your order, which is a free perk. These casings will be bright silver.Only once-fired military and police brass is used in loading, which is acid washed / processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected for thin walls and defects, to ensure safe internal tolerances.In our loading process we only use the top quality powders and primers. Powder is dropped to +/- 0.1 grain accuracy to ensure the highest accuracy.Velocity/ Pressure: 995 FPS (SAAMI pressure)REDACTED."

Mostly matching numbers.   Has bayonet,  but no cleaning rod.A little history:Chinese production of the carbine begin in 1953 and the designation of this new carbine was the Type 53. The early proofs on the barrel shank of the type 53 will have both Chinese characters and the number 26 or 296. The Chinese characters translate to ""53 year type"" and the 26 or 296 are the stamping of the state Factory at Chongqing. In many later production Type 53's the Chinese characters are not present but it is not known why the characters were dropped. The shank proofs also became larger in 1960 but again the reason for this action is not entirely clear.The Chinese did not use the large number of stamps on the carbines metal as their Soviet allies; however, the Chinese more than made up for this with the large number of proofs that appear on most type 53 stocks. It is not uncommon to have 10 or more various stamps on these stocks. The wood used on most of these stocks is not the high quality as that used in the Soviet carbines; however, the wood on the type 53 is quite solid and competent. The Chinese utilized a local wood that is known as CHU-wood. The CHU-wood was put to use as it was quite effective in standing up to so-called ""jungle rot."" The wood was quite proficient in resisting moisture, so it was a perfect choice for the environment of Asia. There are some type 53 stocks that have their serial numbers match to the carbines, with these numbers appearing on the left side on the stock."
