I only took it to the range on one occasion and fired approximately 50 rounds. Traveling as much as I have I never made enough opportunities to take it to the range again, and that is why it hasn't been fired a ton. There has never been any damages or malfunctions with this weapon. I love this handgun due to its handling and weight distribution when firing. Again, I just don't have the time to show it proper love.   My foremost concern with the private sale of this weapon is that the person purchasing this gun is capable of doing so legally. Therefore, I prefer to sell only to those interested that have a valid carry permit. I understand that a permit isn't required, so at the very least there will be a bill of sale involved with this transaction.

Includes a brand new, unused Comp-Tac International kydex right-handed holster ($65 value) for an additional $50 that I had intended to use for IDPA. FYI - CZ P-01 compatible accessories are extremely expensive or hard to find (just Google search to find out). Asking $650 (gun only) or $700 (w/ Comp-Tac International Holster). Price is FIRM. Despite being on-roster, the P-01 is harder to find than some off-roster guns. The P-01 MSRP (based on Gallery of Guns) is $627. Riflegear lists the original retail price at $600. It is, however, rarely in stock or hard to find due to limited distribution from CZ, hence its relative rarity. Add 8.75% sales tax ($52.50) and DROS ($25) and you end up paying $677.50. For $650 you forego the wait and hassle of hunting for a new one from a retail FFL. The optional Comp-Tac International holster is brand new, unused, and of high quality. It retails for $65 + tax (check online to verify). I'm offering it as a package for an additional $50."

Put this gun in a pocket, in a purse, under a dress, be creative ....... it'll conceal almost anywhere you can imagine. And when you wear it open carry you'll be the queen bee. Embrace your femininity. I'm calling this gun new in the box. The first owner purchased it and never shot it. Inspection bears this out. There is no indication it's been used. No wear marks on the breech face, feed ramp, or frame and slide rails. As a bonus I have professionally refinished the grips. Rosewood is a very tight grain species, with high resin content. It does not lend well to a built up sprayed on finish which causes many of these factory grips to easily chip. As noted in pic #7 the finish has chipped on the lower diamond of the left panel. In pics #10 and 11 notice the new look. The crappy factory finished has been removed and the grips have been hand rubbed with 3 coats of Birchwood Casey Tru Oil, followed by a coat of gunstock wax. Very beautiful custom feature. No more worry about the finish chipping. Over time the oils in your skin from normal handling will impart a beautiful patina to the wood. The 380 packs quite a punch, much more than its given credit for. It's very easy to operate, great for small hands. The single action trigger makes for accurate shot placement at 7 to 10 yards. Great self defense gun. The thumb safety is easy to release and strong enough to stay on until it's ready to be put into service. Sig did an excellent job designing this little gem.

Ruger is proud to introduce the new Ruger LCP II. Since its original introduction in 2008, the LCP has set the industry standard for compact, reliable .380 Auto pistols. Rather than rest on that accomplishment, Ruger has built upon that solid performance to produce the new, best-in-class LCP II pistol. The LCP II features a short, crisp, single-action trigger with inner trigger safety, improved sights for superior visibility, a larger grip surface for better distribution of recoil forces and an easy-to-rack slide with an improved slide stop mechanism with a last round hold-open. With its compact size (just 5.17"" long and 3.71"" tall), this new lightweight compact pistol comes with a pocket holster and is designed to fit a variety of holsters and concealed carry options. Weighing in at just 10.6 ounces and equipped to hold 6+1 rounds of powerful .380 Auto ammunition, the LCP II is the ideal back-up gun - compact and light enough that you never have to leave it at home. The American-made LCP II is built on a rigid, one-piece, precision-machined, anodized aluminum chassis with integral frame rails and fire control housing. Additional features include rugged construction with a through-hardened alloy steel slide; a black, one-piece, high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame; a textured grip frame to provide a secure and comfortable grip; a finger grip extension floorplate that can be added to the magazine for comfort and more secure grip, and a blued, alloy steel barrel. The LCP II ships with one 6-round magazine. Note: Six-round LCP® magazines are compatible with the LCP® II, but will not activate the last round hold-open feature of the LCP® II. Seven-round LCP® magazines are NOT compatible with the LCP® II. Firearm Features  Short, crisp, single-action trigger pull.

I'm sad to be selling this gun, but I've got kids now and need cash to keep food on the table! This weapon is extremely reliable. Shooting a tangerine at 300 yards with a low quality scope is nothing for this rifle. As anyone who has ever hunted with a .270 knows, this is a very flat-shooting round that is absolutely devastating upon impact. The barrel is free floated and the trigger is crisp, though a tad stiff (no Accutrigger on this model). The detachable 4 round box magazine is a real plus, making unloading when getting out of a deer stand much easier. This rifle has a right-handed bolt and a three-position safety located directly behind it. Here is the original description from the manufacturer:111FCXP3 Long Action Specifications:- Caliber: .270 Winchester- Stock: Synthetic with positive checkering, dual pillar bedding, generous recoil pad- Magazine Capacity: 4 rounds- Weight: 6.5 lbs.- Barrel Length: 22""- Twist: 1 in 10""- Overall Length: 43.25""- Action: LongFeatures: Blued barreled action, free-floating and button-rifled barrel, detachable box magazine.Included with the rifle are two .270 snap caps, a buttstock ammunition holder, a gun lock, scope rings and mounts, a Flambeau rifle case, the safety/instruction booklet, and a box of 20 130gr Hornady hunting cartridges.There are only slight signs of wear on this rifle. The recoil pad has some small nicks out of it where it's been rested on a bench (this does not effect functionality and the recoil pad is easily replaced if it bothers you). The blue finish on the barrell has some hazing/faint markings. Just standard wear from light usage.  Please contact me with any questions! Cash only, please. I'm asking $230 but am also willing to hear reasonable offers. South Carolina residents only.You can either message me through Armslist, or you can text me directly REDACTED). If you'd like additional photos I can also email you a .zip file containing several."
