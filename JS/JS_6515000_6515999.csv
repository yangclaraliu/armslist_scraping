Also has an idiot scratch from a previous owner. All can be polished out if desired. That's the beauty of stainless, it's still stainless underneath! Never bothered me enough to buff out.

Will also include a set of Pearce finger groove inserts and a brand new custom made blood red carbon fiber iwb kydex holster with rcs claw for better concealment! I've put exactly 200 flawless rounds through this gun. It is extremely accurate, reliable and I completely trust it as an every day carry gun. This is a hard to find model and I've seen them go for much more than I'm asking. Don't miss this opportunity to own this beautiful rare piece. Will not include the pictured stag grips (I'm keeping them for another gun along with the extra mags shown) but I will include a very nice set off checkered hard wood grips along with the Pearce finger groove inserts. I'll also include a set of Hogue wrap around rubber grips with finger grooves. Gun will come in the original hard case with the factory paperwork and one factory magazine. Asking 700, cash only ( includes $50 never worn custom holster and extra grips)  No trades please. I love this gun, but I'm only selling to fund a great deal on one of my dream guns. Foid, ISP check and wait period required. All laws will be followed! No exceptions! Text me REDACTED. Located in St Charles but willing to meet within reason. Thanks!"

I installed a set of Leuepold Base and Rings that come with the rifle. Intended on using this rifle but have since got another bolt action. The gun need to be used by someone who needs a good hunting rifle and not set in my safe for 20 years. I'd trade for a Semiauto or Lever Action Rifle, a small frame concealed carry handgun or a like new rear tine garden tiller.Call or text Dave REDACTED"

297,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6515297,For Sale:  Mathews No-Cam (LH),"Woodbridge, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 995,"Listed On: Sunday, February 26, 2017",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here are the specifics: -LEFT Handed -Currently the bow is set up with a 28.5 inch 85% let=off Rock Mods.  -The bow is set up with 60 to 70 pound limbs in factory Tactical finish. The limbs will top out at about 70+ pounds and can be set as low as 58 safely. Currently set at 70 pounds. -The riser of the bow is in Mathews Tactical finish.  -The string and cable are in great shape as they have been shot very little. I would give them an easy 9 out of 10. As you can see, they are in great condition. -Peep sight is installed, aligned and served into place. -String loop is installed and ready to shoot. -Custom Mathews Color Dampeners are installed on the two large riser spots as well as the small spot in the sight. -The sight is an Axion Gridlock 5 pin in matching Tactical finish. Just a fantastic sight. There are so many fantastic features to this sight that it would be tough to list them all here. Those of you who know and shoot Axion products know of their amazing quality and durability. 5 pins in .020 size. There is also an adjustable Axion rheostat blue light added to the sight. The light mounts in the bracket of the sight, so that it shines only on the extended fibers of the pins. This eliminates any halo that can occur when lights are shined on the pins themselves and helps to eliminate any external light so that you do not spook any game when hunting. Adjustable brightness on the light by simply turning it brighter or dimmer. 2 inch housing with Glo Ring. It also has a Mathews Harmonic Dampener in the sight to help eliminate any vibration and to match the look of the bow perfectly.  -The stabilizer is a Brand New KTech Tech 5 Twin in matching Tactical finish. As you can see in the photos, this stabilizer matches not only in color and finish, but also carries Mathews Harmonic dampeners and a Mathews Harmonic stabilizer. This also helps to eliminate any vibration or noise when shooting. The stabilizer is approximately 5.6 inches in length and approximately 7.6 ounces in weight. The stabilizer and dampeners can be moved around from the front to back position or removed all together to distribute the weight of the stabilizer. It is made from 6061-T6 aluminum and CNC machined.  -The rest is a Trophy Ridge Pro model drop away in matching Tactical finish. This is a great rest that gives you the best of both a containment rest and the drop away. The launcher on the rest can be locked into the up position preshot to contain the arrow for you. That launcher will not drop away until the bow is drawn and shot. With the this rest, you can draw the bow and let back down without the rest dropping away. Very few rests have this function as most other models reset when the bow is drawn. This rest will not drop away until the bow has been shot. The Pro models also have a lock down feature that will lock the launcher into place after the shot to avoid any vibration or noise. The rest is all set up and ready to shoot.  -Brand New braided wrist sling in black is also included.   -Mathews No Cam soft case.   - 1 dozen Easton Storm carbon arrows. Cut to 29.5"".   This setup is flawless and the only reason I am selling is to get a Halon. This bow shoots smooth and I do hate to sell it...but, I only need one bow, so I will pass along a good deal to another bow hunter. All this would be at least $1500-$1700 in a pro shop. $995 is a steal for all this bow comes with. Pretty firm on price. Serious inquiries can get more pictures through text, but you won't be disappointed. Oh, comes with all the packaging for accessories (as seen in picture) and a box for bow included.  Contact Steve @ 703-304-8359. Please be local to Woodbridge. Please only serious inquiries. I am not selling this because I have to...if need be, I will keep and use it this coming hunting season."
