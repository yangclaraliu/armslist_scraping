I built this UZI from an Israeli parts kit on a McKay receiver (amazing receiver) using all McKay semi-auto parts and a high quality Green Mountain 10.25"" 1/2x28 threaded chrome lined barrel. I've put maybe 500 rounds down range with it without an issue. In my opinion these are the most reliable smgs ever made because of their simplicity. Extremely accurate and very controllable. With the UZI comes 3x25rnd Israeli mags and 1 US made 32rnd mag. All run reliably. Also included in the deal is the original stock and sling that came with the parts kit. The only problem I've ever had with it is shooting Winchester white box ammo. That's garbage ammo and its not consistent enough to work reliably in any smg type firearm. It has absolutely no problems with any other type of ammo, that includes aluminum and steel cased ammo. The finish on the gun is 2 tone. I left the original finish on all the original parts and the McKay receiver is flat black. For trades I'm looking for a nice light AR pattern rifle.I'd also be interested in large quantities of 9mm ammo. Good ammo. Not Winchester white box. This is a long shot, but if you have an MP5 pdw 3 lug barrel, I'd take that towards the trade as well. Asking 900 OBO for a super-reliable, super-controllable, super-fun gun. My number is 4four0-Nine84-seventeen94. I can send more pictures if you would like them."

Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible. This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability. The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM. The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated. The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation. The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor. The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements. We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target. We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION• LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 16” lightweight profile barrel, the V7 has a DD improved Flash Suppressor to reduce flash signature. The mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any condition and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts.  A free-floating MFR XS 15.0 handguard offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 7 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 LW has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the user may require.  The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable."

Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times. Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws."

Off-duty, I have always been pro-firearm carry. However, I am nineteen(19). Meaning, I can't buy a handgun or ammunition from a private dealer. However, I contacted the Wisconsin Department of Justice two times, once in-person and once over-the-phone. Each time, they said that it was legal for someone under the age of 21 to open-carry a handgun. Pretty much under the ideas that (1) private sales are not regulated (2) you have to be at least eighteen to open-carry in Wisconsin. I also think it's worth mentioning that I bought the Glock 23 from a Police Officer(who did ask for my ID to confirm I was over 18).I'd like ammo for the range so that I can practice shooting and so can my girlfriend. I primarily want hollow-point rounds for self-defense but at this point I will take anything.If you're interested in trusting a nineteen(19) year old with ammunition(whom volunteers his time to the Civil Air Patrol and works as a Security Officer) then please contact me.I ask that you text me first.
