Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs feature a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Variant 7 is a double action without control lever (no manual safety/decocking lever). This model comes with three magazines and night sights.

The Bulk fill adapter originally purchased for $30.00.Email me if interested. Stored in gun safe, like new. I only have about 4 sessions with this airgun (about 6 hoppers full of bbs.) It is quite fun and accurate for what it is. You can use 88g CO2 which is hidden by stock, or you can use the bulk fill adapter with paintball tanks (see image but please note that the tank pictured is not included.) This is a lot of fun for backyard plinking!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBB3hPmBvI0http://www.umarexusa.com/products/umarex-ebos""The Umarex EBOS (short for Electronic Burst of Steel) is a tactical BB rifle that allows you to shoot in 1, 4, or 8 shot bursts with a high velocity of 540 fps. The top- and bottom-tactical railing lets you customize your gun with any point sight, flashlight, or laser enhancements that you would like to add. The gun is powered by a single 88 g CO2 capsule. The ergonomic pistol grip and removable fore-grip give you the ability to shoot comfortably all day long. Electronic Burst of Steel (EBOS) rifle w/BONUS: Umarex EBOS Bulk Air Adapter.Uses an 88-gram CO2 cartridge Semiauto or burst-mode full-auto 24-rd mag, 400-rd reservoir! Electronic trigger control Burst mode for 4 or 8 rounds at a time! Tactical foregrip Weaver/Picatinny rails Adjustable front sight Adjustable rear sight Built-in (non-removable) mag If you use the bulk-fill CO2 adapter, the buttstock won’t fit on the gun The Umarex EBOS is one of the most exciting CO2 guns made. We’ve taken the basic gun and kicked it up a couple notches by making an adapter that attaches to a bulk-fill CO2 tank. The adapter is listed in the ACCESSORIES link for this gun. It’s a simple process. As it comes from the factory, the EBOS CO2 submachine gun can use only 88-gram CO2 tanks. They will deliver a lot of shots. But, if you want to really economize, get our CO2 bulk-fill adapter (AV-00034) and pick up a 12-oz. CO2 bulk-fill tank (KM-JAA12T) and get ready to rock! You can use a 20-oz. CO2 bulk-fill tank, but it’ll be pretty heavy to hold for extended periods and may not allow you to fully enjoy the experience. UMAREX BULK FILL ADAPTER (I believe this was made by JimC for DrozdMax) Enables the use of refillable paintball tanks. More shooting before needing to refill. Seals perfectly in the EBOS no other parts or materials required. Save money over using expensive 88g Co2 cartridges. NOTE: The paintball tank valve will immediately open when it’s completely screwed into the adapter. Make sure the adapter is tightly/securely installed in the gun before the tank is tightened down."

$1,000 firm in cash or best trade offer.  Bud's has this one for $1,160 right now, so after your FFL fee, you still save almost $200 on a like new(except for being fired) pistol. 
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, will consider others, depending.  Stripped lowers, nice AR/AK triggers, quality lightweight 12""-15"" AR rail and 12""+/- AR-10 rail.  FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 triggers.  
AR 9mm with 4""-8"" barrel, 5.56 with 8""-10"" barrel and 7.62x39 with 8""-10"" barrel, uppers or complete.  PSA billet 9mm lower, complete or stripped(preferred).  2-3 Law Tactical Gen 3-M or Dead Foot Arms folding adapters.  2-3 KAK Shockwave kits.
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6x, PA 1-6x ACSS 5.56/.308 & 7.62x39 reticles, other similar 1-6+x and 1-4x with nice clear glass and true 1x, QD mounts are a plus and some longer range scopes in 4-16x, 6-24x etc., needs to have good eye relief and clear glass.  I have some Nikon M-308 and M-223 4-16x I've picked up for around $300 in excellent condition and a little more with quality mounts.  I've been pleased with these, but open to others like Vortex etc.  Maybe a couple of nice micro red dots.  Not interested in retail prices, I can buy online any time at retail.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX."

It does not include the case. The stock is synthetic and all black. This is a versatile rifle and can be used for many different purposes. As is, it is a fine deer, hog, or varmint rifle. With a trigger job it can be a match grade shooter, savages are known for their accuracy! Be forewarned, it is light and easy to carry but it does have a stout kick to it, be wary if you are interested in using this with a smaller statured shooter or someone unaccustomed to shooting large caliber bolt action rifles.

This is not the cheaper n-pap that utilizes commercial grade parts and a 1.0mm receiver. This AK has the thicker 1.5mm receiver and was built by Zastava using true military grade M70 parts making it one of the toughest AK's around. This rifle has an ALG trigger with krebs retaining plate along with a Krebs custom safety lever. Factory trigger and safety lever is included as well. Factory furniture has been preserved with BLO and looks amazing. I will include Magpul Zhukov stock and Moe grip for only $50 dollars more if you want a truely functional stock that goes great with the rifle. The sights are straight on this rifle and it is a perfect example of one that was built right. It has only had two magazines worth of ammo fired through it to test function before it was cleaned and put in my safe. I am firm on the price as these rifles are getting harder and harder to come by. Feel free to ask questions.
