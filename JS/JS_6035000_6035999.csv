We set out to break the mold of current pouch-like designs that add unnecessary weight and bulk.We've accomplished this by creating a lightweight minimalist design that features true one-handed operation, full adjustment to handle any container size and mounting to either MOLLE/PALS, or a standard belt.The Skeletonized Bottle Holder features double-layer webbing and strategically placed HDPE stiffener for structure and support. We've also created a textured pull-tab for a non-slip grip with adjustable shock cord retention to facilitate one-handed container deployment and accommodate any bottle neck size.This bottle holder was created with a fully-adjustable system in both width and height that can handle multiple container styles and diameters. Using the included MOLLE/PALS attachment system, it can be mounted virtually anywhere, including most any belt size with a simple configuration of the mounting strap.A short list of compatible bottle designs include Liberty Bottles (both 32 oz. and 20 oz.), Nalgenes, Klean Kanteens, G.I. Canteens, Guinness Cans and even plastic water bottles.MSRP: $24.99 + Shipping! Currently sold out online. I'm only asking $15 (FIRM).*The one I'm selling is Multicam* No bottles included.
