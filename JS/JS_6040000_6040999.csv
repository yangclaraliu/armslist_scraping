Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.  Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.  Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol. Features Unlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models:  - Striker Safety - Disconnect Safety - 3-point Take Down Safety System - Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine - System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear - Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation."

This is the same shotgun that's also marketed as the Verona. It's a semi-auto chambered for 3"" 12 gauge. It takes RemChokes, and comes with a full choke in the barrel (sorry, no other chokes with it). The stock is a beautiful Circassian walnut. The finish on the barrel is a mat that looks like it was bead-blasted and blued at the factory. The receiver is blued. It comes with both front and back sling swivels. The condition on this shotgun is excellent.I bought it about ten years ago to try an automatic shotgun. It shot fine with my light target loads, but I've decided to stick with pumps. I only ran one box of shells through it, and it's been sitting in the safe ever since. Time to move it and buy something else.I haven't measured the barrel, but it is fairly long. The whole gun is actually pretty lightweight--much lighter than my name brand pumps. I'm almost talking myself out of selling!I've looked at Gun Broker. A nearly identical gun is selling for nearly $340, and it's not as nice. Plus you'd pay shipping and dealer's fees. You can see it there if you look it up.Myself, I'd just like to get some decent cash back out of the gun, so I'm asking what I think is a pretty fair price (less than it cost new ten years ago). Please don't try to lowball me. If the ad is up, the gun is still for sale--I won't respond to ""Is it still for sale"" emails. Contact me if you're genuinely interested and we can do business."

Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system."

Serial # 1221. Interestingly there was an error made when stamping the serial number and you can clearly see the second 2 is stamped over a 1. In 1872 Marlin introduced his first really successful handgun, the XXX Standard 1872. The XXX (which was a reference to the .30 caliber chambering) was a tip-up revolver (similar in design to the Smith & Wesson #1 and #2 revolvers) and was chambered for .30 rimfire. The revolver was a five-shot single action gun with a spur-trigger bird’s head grips. The standard barrel length was 3”, although custom lengths (both shorter and longer) were available by special order. As originally produced the revolver had a ribbed octagon barrel, and an unfluted cylinder. Like most handguns of the era the standard finish was nickel plating with wood grips. However, half-plate finish (silver frame & blue barrel) were offered for extra cost, as well as fancy grips like pearl or ivory and even scarecer models were gold washed by special order like the model you see here. Only about 500 of these earliest XXX revolvers were produced, before the Marlin company changed over to a ribbed round barrel, but retained the unfluted cylinder. Again, about 500 units were produced and another change took place, replacing the plain cylinder with a short fluted one. These guns sold extremely well, with about 10,000 being produced between 1873 and 1876. The final change came not long after, with the cylinder and frame lengthened about 3/16” and the length of the flutes extended as well. About 15,000 of these guns were also produced, through 1876 when the XXX was dropped from the product line, to be replaced by the newly designed Models 1875, 1878 and eventually 1887 revolvers."

The interchangable back straps, holster, mag holster, 3 extended mag (4 mags total), extended mag grips, and speed loader. I will include some ammo (hp's and range) as well as a DeSantis OWB holster. I have roughly $750 tied up in the whole package and Im looking to get $550. Right now these are on sale for $599.99 but no one local has them in stock. I use this pistol as my night stand buddy and have hardly ever carried it as I prefer my much smaller G43. I fired 3 boxes of ammo through it (150 rounds) and its a very nice shooter. Im only looking to get some cash or get something different as this is my first Springfield and being a Glock guy, its quite a bit different. Please call or text if interested.
