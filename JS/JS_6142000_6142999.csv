This is the latest generation of the Sub2k released from Kel Tec. From the factory: The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model). The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

Bought it to dispatch gray squirrels and practice off hand shooting for small bore silhouette. New neighbors will call the cops on me if I kill a squirrel (which is a felony in my city) and the gun is not similar enough to my Anschutz for practice. I have owned a FWB 300, Daisy Avanti and Beeman R7 and this can shoot with the best of them. I have the velocity turned down to launch a JSB Exact Heavy at around 700 fps, which gives 25+ shots before the POI changes. Comes with a UTC 3-9 Adjustable Objective scope that has a red and green illuminated MIL-DOT reticle. I also have a SCUBA adapter/hose and several tins of JSB Exact Heavy pellets that are not part of this sale, but could be. Email me through this site or call/text me at nine-seven-one 219-1015."

The soft armor inserts are still in like-new condition but the plate carrier has plenty of wear and tear on it which is why I'm throwing it in for free with the soft armor.Sizes: Both the soft armor and the plate carrier are size MEDIUM. Brand: Soft Armor is from Velocity Systems and the plate carrier is from Mayflower Research and Consulting (who has now merged with Velocity)Note: This soft armor is specially cut to fit in the Mayflower Low Profile Assault Plate Carrier. If you are not going to use the plate carrier that I'm providing, make sure to verify that your plate carrier will accept the shape of these soft armor inserts. Note: This plate carrier will accept small or medium ESAPI type plates or 10'' x 12'' plates.For details on the soft armor (level IIIA) check out the pictures or visit Velocity Systems website (velsyst.com) and navigate to the LPAC/LPAAC Soft Armor Inserts page.Email me with any questions.-Pat"

Same size and feel as a 45 without the recoil and high cost to shoot. Low round count and like new in box. I bought this and customized it to get into IDPA but never did. It has been Profesionaly Cerakoted and a trigger job done. Comes with with 3 Wilson Combat Vickers Duty magazines Cerakoted to match and the two facory mags that came with it. Also has Houge Extreme Series G-10 grips with matching mainspring housing that create a magwell. Also has a Hi Viz green Lite Pipe front sight installed. The gun shoots perfect and extremely accurate. The only trade I am interested in is a S&W .460 with 8.375 barrel or possibly a .44 magnum. Or possibly a nice AR with boot on your end. Unless it is a 1500 dollar AR to begin with. Let me know how much your willing to throw in boot with the AR. I have around 900 in the gun 200 in the cerakote of the gun and mags alsmost 200 for the mags 140 in the grip set 50 for the trigger job and another 40 in the front sight. So if you want to make a offer please be realistic. You can text pics of what you have and offers to 423-612-6413 or reply to post. You can also call 423-573-6030 (land line) if you have trouble reaching my cell number. 1000 is a steal for what is in this gun and the better than new condition. All the work was done to a brand new gun not some beat up wore out piece. Like I said I built it to get into IDPA and not only be competative but to look good as well. But I took a new posistion at work and do not have the time now. It comes with the box and all paper work and a Blade Tech holster witch from what I have read is suppose to be one of the best for IDPA.

You must be a NM resident and because this is on a 4473 in my name I will require that you sign a bill of sale, thanks.PRODUCT SUMMARY:Combine the appeal of the traditional semi-automatic rifle, add the quality and handling of a Browning, mix in a little rimfire fun and the result is the Browning SA-22. With a forgedsteel receiver, bottom eject that makes for great shooting for right and left handers both, wonderfully crisp trigger for great accuracy and you have a rifle always ready to take on a walk in the woods, knock over a few tin cans or even put some dinner on the table. Unlike many .22s, the quality of the SA-22 is evident from first glance, with beautiful fit and finish and accuracy to match. The SA-22 is certainly meant to be used and cherished now and for generations to come. This is the Grade One rifle with a scroll engraved receiver, 19-3/8 in barrel and beautiful, high gloss walnut stock and forend. The Browning SA-22 has been in production for ONE HUNDRED AND TWO YEARS for a very good reason, this is a stunning rifle!"

It will come with a scope (not the one pictured on the gun).  It is a very nice fixed red dot sight-Bushnell Trophy Optics.  As you can see in the pictures this rifle has a beautiful custom paint job that was done professionally.  The paint does not scratch off easily but it is easy to clean.  It also has a fully adjustable ATI rear stock with adjustable length and cheek pad height.  It has a one of kind muzzle break on the end as well, there is virtually no recoil with the rubber stock and great muzzle break/flash suppressor.  It comes as pictured except for the scope and comes with 1 aluminum 30 round mag.

Bulgarian made this is the pinnacle of AK47s and you will not be dissapointed, just look up the reviews. If you were to buy a saiga and convert it it would cost an average of over 2000$ and Arsenal does an amazing job at this for a lower price. These have become scarce in today's market and I am only parting with it because I have so many rifles and need more CQB style and .308 rifles in my arsenal. There is only a few months until rifles like this are banned and it is a time to become a gun owner. I am a very responsible gun collector and take the best care of all of my weapons.This has never been fired, fully California legal to own currently, but not for long with the way our state is running things. If purchased from a retailer it cost me over 1600$ once BS california taxes and DROS fee were added in. I am willing to take a little bit of a loss and sell it for 1500 but that is a little negotiable. Brand new this rifle comes with the oil bottle. Bulgarian Military sling, and extra 10 round magazine that is sold with it if you buy it from a retailer. I am willing to travel and willing to trade if it is a reasonable deal. I'm specifically looking for a Kriss Vector, Ps90 but I am open to a lot of options as long as it is fair on both ends so just send me an email and I'll get back to you within 24 hours."
