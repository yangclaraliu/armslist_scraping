From the website:www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-mod-2-5-tactical-model-9mm/When it comes to security for you and your family, there’s rarely a concern over having too much ammo on hand.The XD Mod.2 5″ Tactical Model packs 16 rounds of 9MM ammo in each of its two included stainless steel magazines. While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2 Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul."

Anyways, beware of these assholes that are trying to take our hard earned $, sometimes I wish I could just round up all these skamming mother suckers up and well you know. So back to the scam, I searched the pictures and found them all over the place in the United States, also it's the same guy selling similar vehicles for extremely ridiculously low amounts. It just takes a little due diligence and research to figure out these losers schemes. So please pass the word and let your community that this Jackwad bag of dix is out there doing this and please lets all report this to the authorities.

Barrel is a standard BCM 16"" light-weight mid-length gas sporting A2 front sight post as installed by BCM (no modifications).  Handguard is a simple 2 piece Cavarms in FDE. The muzzle device is an AAC Blackout whi h works awesome. As its a 16"" barrel it is not pinned and can be removed.  The upper also includes a BCM FA bolt and gunfighter charging handle, matching FDE A2 grip, standard A2 flash-hider and a black plastic trigger guard. Only thing the upper would need is a rear sight. This upper has had less than 300 rounds total through it. Shot twice, cleaned both times, and currently clean and ready to go.  I never had any issues with either of my BCM uppers, this one included.  They function great. THIS IS A NON-FIREARM BUT I DON'T INTEND TO SHIP - INTERESTED CT BUYERS ONLY PLEASE.

Chambered in 9MM, The P2000 is a short recoil-operated locked breech pistol with a modified Browning-type linkless cam action with a vertically tilting barrel also employed in the USP series of self-loading pistols. As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps, allowing the user to customize the size and feel. There is a universal accessory rail built into the dust cover that allows for the use of tactical illumination devices and laser sighting systems, as well as other accessories. This is in contrast with the USP series which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol. The P2000 features a LEM modification that allows the weapon to have a constant trigger pull once the weapon is loaded. This version does not have the decocker lever on the other models. This firearm is used and only comes with one 13 round magazine. see photos for details.If your looking for a high quality, compact pistol , then look no further than the Heckler & Koch P2000."

The barrel is stamped Spain. The early CVA rifles were USA made, while the later production kits were produced in Spain. These are considered to be very fine shooting rifles, with the larger bore rifles very capable hunting rifles, with good knock-down power.All of the original parts are included to finish this kit. The stock has been finished in an oil finish. The barrel still has the original rust preventative coating on it, and it is still in its unfinshed state, so it will need to be either blued or browned. The front sight will need to be installed, and the forend cap and butt plate will need to be installed. I originally purchased this kit in 1986, and after attempting to finish it, found that career and moving did not afford me the opportunity nor the work space to finish it. As can happen with some projects, you lose interest and the project lanquishes, in this case in the gun cabinet for 30 years. Shipping is available for this rifle.Payment Options: Acceptable payment options include: Cash (in person), Check (with 7 day hold), USPS Money Order, Credit/Debit Cards (with 3% Fee), No COD or PayPal. $35 service fee for all returned checks.Text is the quickest way to reach me, at: 7one7 nine8two 2two6three."

Ultraconcealable size makes it a great choice for self-defense. Grip features built-in beaver-tail design, allowing shooter to acquire a high, tight grip. Aggressive texture of grip promotes easy operation. Large magazine catch allows for easy removal of six-round magazine. Trigger reach and pistol grip are familiar and dimensionally equivalent to larger 9x19 pistols in Glock’s lineup. Comes with two magazines.When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users."

The G19 is a mid-size pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The GLOCK 19 is a short-recoil operated, striker-fire semi-automatic pistol. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The main frame of the GLOCK pistol is constructed of high-strength polymer that is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body, or kept in a holster for extended periods of time. The slide cycles on 4 hardened steel guide rails within the frame. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and is drift adjustable. GLOCK pistols fieldstrip easily without the use of tools. The GLOCK G19 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for concealed carry, at home, or on duty. This model G19 comes with two standard 15-round magazines."
