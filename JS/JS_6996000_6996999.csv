I bought this firearm and its accessories with the intent of taking up hunting but I won’t be able to due to some life circumstances going on right now. I have fired less than 100 rounds though this firearm and it isn’t getting used at all. I would like to see it get some use and passed on to someone who would enjoy it. I paid a total of $1216 building this firearm and fired a couple of boxes through it at the Clark County Shooting Range to sight it in. I would like to get $1,100 for it. It is everything you need for someone new to hunting. I also have a card that has the ballistic stats for the scope that is calibrated to the rifle to provide precise long range shooting fun. I would like to get $1,100 for it but will take reasonable offers. The rifle comes with 260 rounds of ammunition. Anyone buying it must have a concealed weapon permit. I will only take cash unless you want to write a check and I hold the rifle until the money clears. If you are interested in purchasing it please contact me at REDACTED or via text at REDACTED.

It is not damascus. Possible restoration project. I'll start off my saying this should be checked out by a gunsmith. Functional and still shoots but the wood stock is a little loose and upon opening the break action there is no easy way to closing it. The lever works just as it should and same for the triggers & safety. All wood is in decent condition. Barrel, blueing and the rest of the metal on the shotgun shows it's age. No dents but some small, hardly noticeable scratches, some small rust and very small amount of pitting. All it says on it is Ranger on one side & Pat.APR.20-1915 on the other. Also says High Pressure Compressed Steel Barrel & Lug Forged In One Piece on the barrel. It is my understanding these were made for & sold by Sears and Roebuck after the turn of the century (perhaps around 1930). I found a few online, & prices vary quite a bit. Also included is a box of 16GA Winchester Super Speed Mark 5. Asking $150 but I am mainly looking to trade. I will not take a hundred please no rediculous low ball offers please. Willing to trade for almost anything as long as it's in good condition and functional just let me know what ya got. Preferably handgun or revolver. I have CCW. Can send more pictures upon request.

This rifle uses their CQB MRP Monolithic receiver/forend. The forend includes two flush-cup sling attachments on either side and one on the bottom. The rails are all mil-spec, numbered, and completely SOPMOD compatible. The overall diameter is narrow, allowing for the addition of protective rails that do not make it overly large. Two Torx screws are used to attach the barrel. The rifle came with a set of LMT removable A2-type sights. The barrel is 16 inches long, chrome-lined and cryogenically treated with a 1-in-7-inch twist rate. The bolt carrier group is a standard semi-auto group with a standard charging handle. A torque wrench and driver are included to make certain the barrel tensioning screws are not over-tightened. The upper is mated to a Defender 2000 lower receiver, which contains a mil-spec single-stage trigger that is crisp and solid. The rifle ships with one 30-round magazine, two heavy-duty push-button sling swivels, three rail panels and a tactical sling. The buttstock is an LMT SOPMOD model with battery compartments on either side. Swapping out barrels on the MRP is really easy. Simply unscrew and remove the two screws and it pulls right out. It has the side benefit of making cleaning really easy. Swap the barrels and tighten the screws using the torque wrench. The manual calls for 140-inch-pounds of torque tightened front to back. The trick here is not to over-tighten them—you really do not need to crank them down. By using the same setting each time, it generally makes for little change in point of impact with a barrel change and your receiver will last forever."

Load custom ammunition for hunting or inexpensive ammunition for the range. The kit includes the Lee Challenger Press, the Lee Ram Prime, the Lee Auto Disk Powder Measure, the Pro Upgrade Kit, the Double Disk Upgrade Kit, and Adjustable Charge Bar for the Powder Measure.This is all you need to get started in reloading, except for a die set (you will need components including cases, bullets, reloading powder, and primers however).These items are in excellent to nearly new condition.Here's more information about these items: Lee Challenger Press - can handle everything from the smallest pistol to the largest rifle calibers. It features a steel ram and operating linkage, a very strong ""O"" frame that is larger than the average press opening giving reloaders maximum hand clearance. When de-priming, spent primers are sent directly into the trash can helping to keep reloading areas nice and clean. Lee Ram Prime - allows the reloader to prime on the up-stroke for a more sensitive feel and increased leverage. Included are easy to change punches for both large and small primers.Lee Auto-Disk Powder Measure - automatically dispense charges. The case itself actuates the measure as the neck is being flared. The measure is actuated during the presses maximum mechanical advantage. This assures the smooth, even action of the measure. Built-in baffle and precisely molded, glass reinforced charge disks contribute to the charge uniformity.Lee Auto-Disk Powder Measure Upgrade Kit - Upgrades the Lee Auto Disk to function like the Pro version and features a new round powder reservoir, an elastomer wipe, shut off valve, and swivel adapterDouble Disk Kit and Adjustable Charge Bar - These work with the Auto-Disk Powder measure and allow you to automatically measure and dispense (drop in reloading parlance) up to 28.8 grains of Unique and 42.2 grains of IMR 4064 (this kit will work with all brands of smokeless powder) by raising the powder hopper permitting two disks to be stacked in powder measure. It allows the user to double the capacity and make very fine adjustments by adjusting up or down in 1/10th grain increments using different combinations of disks. The charge bar has an adjustable cavity and allows even finer adjustment of powder drops for handgun cartridges"

One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition"

This chambering accepts both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem while maintaining better accuracy than a NATO chamber, and the barrel has a 1:8 twist to stabilize nearly any bullet you'd run through it. I used this rifle for a Precision Scoped Rifle Skill Builder course at the SIG Sauer Academy, and it shot consistent sub-MOA five-shot groups at 100 yards. Moving out to 200 yards, I managed to pull off a 1.5 and 1.6-inch group -- that's 0.75 and 0.8 MOA, respectively! At 300 yards, it was child's play to consistently hit a row of four-inch-diameter steel plates. This rifle can shoot.Lower Receiver Group: The lower is a complete unit from Surplus Ammo and Arms, with an upgraded match trigger and the trigger guard and pistol grip upgraded to Magpul furniture. The pistol grip is a modular Magpul MIAD, with a core that holds five spare rounds of ammunition. The trigger is a Rock River Arms Two-Stage Varmint Trigger. This is a lighter, crisper version of their excellent National Match trigger, and this unit is rated to break at 3.5 to four pounds of force, following a first-stage takeup. It is excellent for precision work.Optic: The optic here is a Bushnell Elite Tactical 3200 scope, with a 5-15x magnification range, parallax adjustment, and a mil-dot reticle. Adjustments are in increments of 1/4 MOA. I have this rifle zeroed spot-on at 100 yards for 75 grain HPBT match ammunition, and I also have scope adjustment data I can give you for both 75 grain match and 55 grain ball ammunition out to 300 yards (data gathered by me shooting in the field). The scope is clear, repeatable, and reliable, and has plenty of magnification for anywhere in the effective range of this rifle. The scope mount is nothing fancy -- I picked it up on eBay after I had spent all my money on the upper, lower, and optic. However, the mount has been 100% reliable, and held zero through many years of use.Sling: I'll include the high quality, padded sling I've been using with this rifle. Every rifle needs a good sling.Miscellaneous Notes: Weight -- with the 20"" bull barrel, this is not a featherweight carbine. This is meant as a midrange DMR (designated marksman rifle)/varmint/predator rifle. It shines best when shot as such - from support or a bipod! If you haven't yet delved into the world of long range shooting, it's a blast. This rifle, and its affordable ammunition, can be a relatively inexpensive gateway into the sport. Magazines -- this rifle has had flawless reliablity with aluminum/steel magazines. For whatever reason, it occasionally fails to strip a round from my 20 round Gen 2 Magpul PMags. I would recommend that you run this rifle with metal magazines, and it will perform at its best.If interested, please shoot me a message! Upon purchase, I'll need to see two forms of ID; one being a New Hampshire driver's license. No out of state sales, please! Thanks for your interest."

I will come with TWO un-opened spam cans and as well as a open box of ammo, with both of them it comes to 1055rds of ammo. There are some high grain ammo as well as armor piercing ammo. If you have any questions let me know. Thanks!"
