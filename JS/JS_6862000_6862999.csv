Some minor, superficial marks on the stainless finish, but a very nice specimen for a 30 year old gun. Functions flawlessly. Great shooter. Comes with three magazines. These guns will feed anything--they will even feed empty cases. The reason for this is because the bullet feeds at a very high angle, almost straight into the chamber. Don Johnson carried the 645 for several seasons in Miami Vice. So basically what I'm saying is this: you'll be as cool as Don Johnson if you buy this gun.
