Bore is in excellent condition.Permanently converted to a carbine. Would make an excellent and accurate plinker or ranch carbine. I believe this to be a Navy Arms Co imported and converted carbine replica due to faint markings under the trigger guard.Ammunition can be a bit tricky to find, but excellent brass is available from Starline. I DO NOT recommend using 7.62 Tokarev ammunition; it will feed, but is typically loaded at higher than recommended pressures for these old guns. In a pinch I have in the past pulled the bullets from Tokarev ammo and re-loaded to the proper spec with good results. She's a sweet shooter, though I've only put a few hundred rounds through it. A heavy grease was applied before storage, so cleaning is highly recommended before shooting.No trades please. Sold as-is, no warranty expressed or implied.**IMPORTANT: To be eligible to purchase, please include your name and a return email address you can best be reached at. Seller will not respond to your inquiry without these present.

This weapon is in fantastic condition. Always oiled and case kept. Never had any malfunctions with it. Max of 250 rounds fired through it! Comes with interchangeable hand grips, factory night sights (which are amazing), a leather hip holster, and 3 magazines. Capacity is 10+1. I have used this as a conceal carry on many occasions and didn't have a problem hiding it. I will not be selling the case with it as it has my name engraved on it. Thanks for your interest!"

This is an antique in good working condition, likely from the early 1950s, and has no markings other than the “Firearms International Corporation Washington DC 20022” on the inside of the skeletonized buttplate. The Firearms International firm was begun in around 1952 as a front for the CIA to obtain and ship, through supposed commercial sales channels, surplus firearms to allies of the United States during the Cold War. After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, to which they apparently supplied the weapons, the company was outed and reorganized. They bought, imported, and sold many good guns from various manufacturers and this rifle may have been made by FN in Belgium, although there are no numbers or markings other than the importer info. Cool little survival rifle with a neat history. Face-to-face deals only and full refund if you are not happy with the rifle."

Bright night sights and everything from the factory. Looking for trades only in Commander size. If you offer a ruger commander or something in that value range, offer cash as well or I will just ignore the offer altogether. I am not opposed to a Ruger lwt commander, but not on even trade. Must be of equal or greater value. Can add some cash on my end for the right deal as well, so I expect you to do the same if the value of your trade is lower.

It has been an awesome vehicle that has never let me down. The truck runs and drives great with zero issues and has been taken very good care of. The model is a 2007 radiant red Toyota Tacoma access cab with the 6 speed manual transmission. The truck gets a lot of attention and you will rarely see another like it driving around. Proper maintenance has always been kept. oil changes every 3000 miles, I have also changed the Differential and brake fluid lately. I rebuilt the rear drums about 2000 miles ago along with replacing the front pads. Even with the lift and 35's the trucks rides awesome, no whine or major noise. The paint isn't perfect, it has a few dings but I would still give it a 7.5/10. The interior is well kept. 8.9/10. Since I have owned it, I have been very particular with this truck and hate to see it go. However, life events happen and I have to part ways. I really am not interested in trades.

Trijicon Night Sights! To many Americans, there is only one caliber for a personal defense handgun and that's the .45 auto. Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the development of the Glock 21. Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the Glock 21 Gen4 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with 10 or 13 round magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the life of the system, and the enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. The Gen4 system is the perfect complement to this iconic .45 caliber cartridge.Mfg Item Num: PG2150203 Category: PISTOLS Type :PistolAction :DoubleCaliber :45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Barrel Length :4.6""Capacity :13+1Safety :Trigger/Firing Pin/DropGrips :Black Interchangeable BackstrapSights :FixedWeight :26.3 ozFrame Finish :BlackFrame Material :PolymerBarrel Type :Octagonal RifledSlide Description :BlackCase Type :Hard"
