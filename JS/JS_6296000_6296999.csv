This barrel will cycle standard and magnum loads, both 2-3/4” and 3”.The gun comes with two stocks; the Beretta Trap stock which features a slight Monte Carlo cheek piece and a Beretta Sporting stock (currently installed). The stocks have not been cut and so have factory standard length of pull. You can change recoil pad thicknesses if you wish to lengthen the pull.The gun is in great condition. The photos are of the actual gun being auctioned and accurately depict its condition - please examine them closely to make your own appraisal. No rust or damage on the metal – just a few minor marks here and there. There are no cracks or damage to the wood. The trap stock has a few minor marks and the Sporting stock is new. Both barrels have perfect bores. The gun is mechanically and operationally sound. With the trap barrel, it functions reliably even with low recoil loads. With the field barrel, the gun reliably shoots the heaviest magnum loads. The gun is all original and in Excellent Condition.. I Would Ship!"

This does not affect the optics or performance of the spotting scope. The focus and magnification work perfectly. The only degradation is that you can't adjust the distance between your eye and the ocular lense. It is stuck in the furthest position (the one most people use). Vortex will fix this under warranty or you could easily bend the mechanism back to be functional, but it never bothered me and with the rubber eyecup on, you can't tell there is any issue. Included is everything it would come with from the factory: box/manual/neoprene cover/lense covers/etc. These sell new for $650, used prices seem to be around $525. I'm asking $425 shipped which I think is very fair!"

This rifle does include the original ""troop tag"" that was issued with this gun along with the original leather sling, which is in far better condition than any  issued K31 sling I have ever seen. The sling is stamped with the Swiss cartouche.The bluing on rifle is all original and very nice. The bluing on the receiver is very, very strong. The cartouche is stamped very clearly and is not worn at all. Additionally, the bluing on the (original) magazine, magazine well, and trigger guard is near perfect. Bluing is also strong on the barrel and barrel bands. The bore is very bring and shiny with strong lands. The only concern is cosmetic pitting on the muzzle, however this doesn't effect accuracy as this rifle consistently shoots 1 MOA groupings at 100 yards with iron sights and surplus GP11 ammo. I'm located in St. Augustine but am willing to meet somewhere as long as it is safe.

Like new condition with approximately 20 minutes of run time. Specs below: The highest magnification binocular available, Night Owl Optics’ 5-power binocular is the industry’s most advanced, most highly acclaimed generation-1 binocular. The aesthetics, ergonomics and performance of this instrument can only be appreciated by comparing it to anything else on the market.

A central focusing wheel allows for quick and easy focusing of both objective lenses simultaneously. And Night Owl’s proprietary inter-ocular hinge guarantees you that both optical channels are always centered precisely over each eye.  Features: • 5x magnification• Adjustable focus with central focusing mechanism• Adjustable inter-ocular distance centers the dual optical channels precisely over each eye• Two high-quality generation-1 image intensifier tubes• Built-in columnated infrared illuminator for use in complete darkness or to improve target recognition in any environment• Objective and ocular lenses constructed of high-quality all-glass optics• Soft-touch rubberized finish• Impact-resistant molded thermoplastic lens housingsDo some research and you'll find that these are very highly rated and typically sell for around $500.

You know the excellent reputation of H&K. This package has everything you need except ammo. I'd like to do a two gun trade if possible. First option would be a Smith & Wesson Shield in 9 mm only and a Glock 19 gen 4. Or possibly a Glock 26 gen 3 or 4 instead of the 19. No Taurus or Ruger LC's. No shotguns. Could do a Shield only with cash from you. Depending on your trade, I may ad cash on my end. Any trades from you should be in the same excellent condition as mine. Let me know what you have and let's see if we can work a deal. Thanks."

I have checked and THIS MODEL WAS NOT PART OF THE 2009 RECALL. That recall affected some in the DA series and this gun was manufactured well after that. Gun comes with lock, manufacturer hard case, two Sig Sauer brand magazines, hard hip holster (RH), molded leather Tagua hip holster (RH) with thumb-break. All clean and new!  I have another listing for ammo including 150 rounds of FMJ for practice and some Hornady Critical Defense JHP as well. I would be happy to bundle those together and make the ammo a little cheaper if you buy the gun too. All great ammo, most of it from Sig Sauer. I have a cleaning kit I can throw in for a few bucks too, cleans multiple calibers and will work for all you needs with the P238.  Gun is in factory-perfect condition, never been fired, totally new in box. I have kept it around for self-defense so far, but need to pay some unexpected medical bills, so I'm getting rid of it and hope it goes to a good home. It would make an excellent pistol for self-defense for situations where concealment is necessary or for a family member who needs a handgun with a little less kick.  This is for local only in the Evansville, IN area. I'm willing to negotiate a little on the price but the P238 sells new for $650 from Gander Mountain and $630 on Sportsman's Warehouse, AND this comes with extra accessories. I can meet you locally anywhere in the Evansville area, just let me know what works for you. Cash only, no trades. Let's figure this out and both get what we want!"
