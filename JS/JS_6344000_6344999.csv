It shoots a .308 / 7.62 round.It comes in the original soft case and the original box and has never once been used at all. It was only opened to take photos of, that's it.I'd planned on having the rifle done in Cerakote in a FDE (Flat Dark Earth) color, but have since decided I need the money for other things.That being said, I swapped the stock Magpul MOE SL buttstock out for a Magpul MOE SL buttstock in FDE color, and I also added a Magpul MIAD (Mission Adaptable) grip which includes all the extra grip pieces to fit it to your liking.Please note that this is a SECOND GENERATION Ruger SR-762. I'm saying that because the first generation models had different buttstocks and grips, and also had some issues with them that Ruger resolved fairly quickly. I'm just pointing that out so you know this is a very recent model, not an old model.My price is $1500 firm which does not include shipping (shipping will be an additional $100 since I require the buyer to pay for insurance on the shipment just incase).I will ONLY ship to a licensed FFL dealer, no exceptions to that whatsoever.I'm alwo throwing in 500 rounds of Federal 7.62 ammo!If you happen to be local to Salem, Oregon you can pick it up from me in person."

The Vertec, unlike most Berettas has a thinner vertical Vertec grip instead of the large Beretta hump, which makes it feel MUCH better in your hand. Another Vertec upgrade is the flush barrel and the dovetail-mounted sights which lets you easily swap in others.This firearm is upgraded with a Wilson Combat Short Reach Steel Trigger (which replaces the composite trigger), a Wilson Combat Extended Mag Release (which replaces the very small, plastic mag release), and a full set of Wolf Hammer Springs (16lb, 17lb, 18lb, 19lb), the 16lb aka the ""Beretta D Spring"" is currently installed, which is the spring they use on their decocker-only models for a lighter and smoother double action pull. After installing the upgrades, it has been tested and everything works perfectly.This firearm also comes with all factory parts, and THREE magazines. A 10 round magazine, a 15 round magazine, and a 18 round flush fit Mec-Gar mag that is less than a week old. Below I will list all parts.In this package you get:-Beretta 92FS Vertec Inox-Wilson Combat Short Reach Steel Trigger-Wilson Combat Extended Mag Release-Wolf Spring Set-3 Magazines-All factory partsI'm asking $900 for this, which considering how much they sell for (When they actually come up for sale, once every 5-6 months) is definitely a really good deal, especially with the upgrades and extra mag.Definitely open to trades. Prefer polymer striker fired handguns in 9mm, but I am willing to consider all trades, the worst I could do is say no eh?Optimal trade would be a Steyr 9mm + cash, but since those are pretty rare I won't hold my breath.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED or messaging me on here at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"
