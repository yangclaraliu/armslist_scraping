It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has a Flat Dark Earth frame, black slide with 3-dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.for more info or to buy onlince click.... HKVP9"

Worse, if you buy one decked out like this one the seller will charge you upwards of $1,500 to $3,000 for it!

Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.

The Taurus Tracker family includes a full range of calibers and sizes to perfectly suit any hunting adventure. Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to .22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction.
Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Rubber Grip
Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 300 finished in our Mil Spec + Cerakote has all the same modularity and functionality as our popular V11 Carbine, but was built to accommodate the versatile .300 Blackout cartridge. This caliber offers projectiles with increased bullet weight which substantially increases its effectiveness on target all while reducing felt recoil to the operator. The DDM4V11 300 features a free-floating Cold Hammer Forged, 16” S2W barrel with 1:8 twist and carbine-length gas system—tuned to reliably cycle a wide range of 300 Blackout cartridges. The V11 features the KeyMod attachment system integrated into our SLiM RAIL 15.0, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from a Daniel Defense product. The longer 15” rail features an uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachments at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions, ensuring plenty of real estate for optics and accessories. It also allows maximum sight radius, for more accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights, and provides operators with the option to extend the support hand out closer to the muzzle in order to drive the gun more precisely and help prevent over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Daniel Defense’s rugged Buttstock and Pistol Grip provide the comfort and ergonomics needed for optimal control. The V11 300 is designed to be shot suppressed and un-suppressed utilizing various types of supersonic and subsonic ammunition. For reliable operation we recommend .300 supersonic ammunition while shooting un-suppressed, and subsonic ammunition should only be used with a suppressor. The utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-suppressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

It is double-stack and holds 10 rounds in the flush mag, and 12 rounds in the extended (which also has a pinky rest, giving you a full grip on the gun)I've shot about 400 rounds through it, and it's never jammed. The trigger has a much crisper, cleaner break than my other Glocks, for some reason, but the gun has not been modified at all. It comes in the original box with the factory cleaning rod, bore brush, one 12 round factory extended G26 magazine and one 10 round magazine (comes with 2 mags total). The gun itself has been well maintained and looks basically like it did when it was New In Box. Also, it has the older Glock finish, which I've found to be indestructible, unlike the finish Glock now uses for their slides to comply with environmental regulations.Price is $400, firm. Must be willing to fill out a provided Bill of Sale, and must be legally able to purchase a firearm. ---Local sales only---"

I bought it a couple years ago and have treated it almost too well.  It was my carry gun for a while but only left the holster for monthly range time and cleaning, so there's no holster wear.

It has only about 1500-1800 rounds through it without a single malfunction. Works flawlessly and looks like new. It comes with a lot of extras for the price, so it will be nicely set up and ready to go for the next owner.

First off, it comes with 3 magazines, 2 compact (13rnd) and 1 full size/extended (19rd).  Compact mags also have the pinky extension.  ($50-60+ value)
Talon rubberized grips for the frame and magazine extensions.  ($20 value)
It also comes with a custom Foxx kydex holster for inside belt carry.  ($50 value)
I had the best XD guy (xdman.com) install a set of Truglo TFX fiber optic/night sights that work very well and look great on the gun.  ($150 value)
Finally, I installed the PRP drop in trigger kit which made a night and day difference in trigger travel, crisper break, lighter trigger, etc. ($125+ value)

I have all the original paperwork, box, etc so it's as close to a brand new gun purchase as one can get.  My loss is your gain.  From what I've seen brand new with only 2 magazines this gun is selling for around $500 minimum if you find a good deal.  Overall I have about $400 in extras for this XDM.

I'm selling everything for $650 and am firm on that price.  I can remove the PRP trigger kit and sell the gun without it for $550. 

Please contact me with any questions or to check it out in person."

In 1959, the US military adopted the resultant M14. The rugged reliability of the M14 coupled with its formidable 7.62×51 NATO cartridge left an enduring impression on America’s fighting forces despite its relatively short tenure. When it was replaced in 1970, the stage was set for the next step in its history. In 1974, the Reese family ensured that the legacy of the M14 would live on. Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois began offering a civilian legal semi-automatic version known as the M1A™. Powerful, accurate and reliable, M1A’s™ were soon found dominating the National Matches at Camp Perry. Shooters across the country discovered the versatility and enjoyable satisfaction of owning an M1A™.

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting.The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

If you have something else you want to offer, throw it my way. No 40, bows, or bolt rifles. $850 trade/800 cash obo
 I'll take $700 cash and give the gun with 3 flush mags, no Wilson combat at that price."
