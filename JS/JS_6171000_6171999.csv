This gun was purchased in 1974, test fired (Less than 50 rounds) and then oiled up and stored in a safe in the dry desert climate of Southern Idaho for 42 years. The gun is truly in new condition with no blemishes, or scraches. All of my collectable guns are removed from the safe annually and cleaned and given a fresh coat of Rem-Oil. I have the original box and owners manual that came with the gun. SN# on the box matches the SN# on the rifle. This is a collector or investment grade rifle and is priced accordingly. This gun was manufactured prior to the saftey warning being stamped on the barrel and the addition of the crossbolt safety that came later. A rifle in similar condition with box sold last year on Gun Broker for $1800. I am pricing the rifle at $1500 but will consider a reasonal offer.

This is the best plate carrier on the market.  I have other multicam pouches for sale as well. Just let me know if you're interested in receiving the list of other pouches.No TradesThe Patrol Incident Gear Plate Carrier (PIG PC) is a Patent Pending design that was over two years in the making. Starting off as a modified Eagle Plate Carrier Pre-production model in 2007, we threw out the drawing board altogether and performed a complete ground-up metamorphosis based directly on a list of functional attributes we wanted to feature. The result is the most versatile, and most highly-rated plate carrier on the market. The PIG PC is a lightweight plate carrier system that allows the user to configure the kit to work optimally with their mission profile. It is proudly Made in the USA, and offers some of the most unique features available on a plate carrier today. Approx. weight (w/ Molle Cummerbund): 2 lbs 11 oz Industry Firsts found on the PIG PC- Elevated Plate Profile - Most plate carriers on the market tend to carry the plate extremely low in relation to the most vital organs and vessels in the upper-thoracic region they are meant to protect. One of the main goals of this carrier was to get both front and back plates high enough to maximize protection of your vitals. An adjustable plate harness pushes each plate to the top of the plate pocket, and keeps plates centered left and right through internal velcro stabilizers. The PIG PC also places the top of the rear plate ABOVE the connection point to the shoulder straps. This allows both front and rear plates to be optimally positioned without sacrificing comfort.- One Size Fits Most – The adjustable plate harness and the internal Velcro stabilizers allow the wearer to use any size SAPI/ESAPI plate from Small through Extra Large (or similar corner cut plates) without having the plates bottom out or swim around in the carrier. The PIG is the only plate carrier that can secure this wide range of plate sizes while maintaining such a low footprint on the wearer.- Rear Padding System - The rear plate carrier features two vertical back pads that keep contact off of your spine and creates an air-flow channel to aid in increased ventilation and heat dissipation. These vertical pads flow into the integral padded shoulder straps, creating a continuous shock-absorbing feature that is extremely comfortable for extended use.- Hybrid Construction - Utilizes 500 Denier Cordura and lightweight Pack Nylon in different areas according to abrasion exposure to minimize weight.- Multiple Cummerbund Options - Now you can get all the features you want, or just those you need with regards to the cummerbund. With 2 cummerbund options and 3 side plate carrier options, you have multiple configurations to select from.- Scalable Side Plate Pocket Options - Now you can use 6""x 6"" side plates as well as 6""x 8"" & 7"" x 8"" models with the extended retention strap feature on both of our Side Plate Carrier models. The elastic expansion capability allows you to run just a side plate, or both a side plate and a soft armor backer behind it with no slop or movement in the pouch. The PIG Modular Side Plate Carrier (MSPC) adds the most versatility, securing most any size side plate with or without soft armor backer to any Molle surface.- Dedicated Plate-backer Pockets - Each PIG PC ships with a custom cut foam panel that sits inside a dedicated pocket to increase comfort for the wearer. You can access and replace this panel with a soft armor insert without having to touch your plates and visa-versa. This makes plus-ing up or scaling down a much simpler operation.- G-Hook Applications - The PIG PC is the first production Plate Carrier to utilize ITW G-Hook, easily one of the most versatile pieces of hardware available to the tactical market today. Used in the primary shoulder strap attachment, it allows the user to replace hardware in the field and select between a side release buckle or a metal D-ring assembly. The PIG PC Load Integration Kit also uses G-Hooks to seamlessly integrate the popular Eagle Yote pack to the PIG PC.Additional Features:- Semi-Rigid Drag Handle - The tubular nylon drag handle houses a length of plastic tubing to increase surface area and comfort when gripping.- Split Cummerbund Retention Flaps - By splitting the cummerbund flaps, the user is able to keep one side attached at all times through repeated don/doff cycles. The flaps' outer corners are retained by snap tabs that come up from underneath to keep the corner retained. Each flap includes a kangaroo pouch for hasty item storage or integration of dedicated flap pouches.- Front & Back Velcro PALS - Now you don't have to settle for either just a velcro panel, or PALS without velcro. Both front and back plate compartments have velcro-covered PALS webbing that lets the user configure the Plate Carrier with ID patches or modular pouches as necessary."

The break-open action allows for easy priming, produces a tight seal for ignition in foul weather and also makes cleaning easier. The Pursuit LT also features 2 safeties making it one of the safest muzzleloaders available. The first safety is built into the hammer and blocks the firing pin from igniting the primer when the trigger has not been pulled. The second safety is a cross block trigger safety just like the ones found on many rifles and shotguns.

Push the button forward on the grip and the mag drops, while maintaining the use of the heel release if required. The 22lb spring power is used to increase the life of the firearm as well as being able to safely shoot +P rounds/ higher grain rounds. Built like a tank with high tolerances. When purchased the gun was brand new and caked in cosmoline. After the firearm was properly cleaned it ran flawlessly with any ammo I fed it. Max rounds placed through it is about 150. All of the firearms that I have or have sold have been kept in pristine condition and cleaned after every firing session so there is no need to worry about overall condition/ maintenance.

I will include the 10rd magazine (pictured) and an extra 5rd magazine. I will also include the bipod and the orignal stock and parts. This is a type 53 Mosin which is the same as a Russian M44 carbine so this is not as long as the 91-30s that you tend to see a lot of. It's not a show piece but it is a really fun shooter, the surplus ammo is still around $4 per 20 rd pack when bought in bulk tins making it the cheapest rifle I know of to shoot. I have several of these and looking to start another project so it's time for this one to go. I have a local FFL dealer we can meet at or I can possibly travel a little to meet you. If you have any questions please ask."

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and have only put 270-300 rounds through it, ie, 9 or 10 mags through it, and that's all. The gun functions flawlessly, it looks brand new with barely a single scratch or smudge, and it shot anything I put through it without a single jam or FTF or FTE. It produces average 5 shot groups around 1.0 - 1.5 inches at 100 yards when scoped, and could probably do a bit better with a proper load work-up, as I was just using factory ammo. I have the Geissele SuperSCAR 2-stage trigger already installed, which breaks very nicely at around 4 pounds.  I'm selling this gem simply because as cool as it is, and as flawless as it is, for what it is, this is just not my type of thing... In terms of rifle shooting per se, I'm really just an old school bolt action benchrest guy, but had thought I would try my hand at AR style shooting for the first time ever. And so I picked this up a few months ago to give it a whirl. But once a precision shooter, always a precision shooter...it just kinda hurts my eyes to look at paper groups bigger than 1/4 inch at 100 yards. I guess you gotta know who you are in life and stick with it: SO I would rather roll out of this rig and put the funds towards a new benchrest rig for which I've already got my components picked out. Anyway,  THIS SCAR WILL COME WITH ALL THE FOLLOWING: 1)The Geissele trigger already installed (a $350 value for the trigger alone, plus gunsmithing charges saved if you needed a gunsmith to install for you); 2) the original milspec trigger bagged on the side; 3) the attached UTG bipod which was purchased brand new for this rig; 4) a brand new black magpul vertical foregrip 5) and three (3) OEM original FN 30 rounds mags. That means the single original 30 round mag that came with the gun (still pretty much brand new itself), PLUS two (2) other brand new in the box / never opened OEM original FN 30 round mags that I'll throw in just to sweeten the pot ($70 dollar value). 6) Plus all the original FN swag that originally comes with the gun, like all the paperwork, box, chain lock, etc. . NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PRICE BUT AVAILABLE   TO YOU AT DISCOUNT IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE EVERYTHING I HAVE FOR THIS RIG, are the following: I have 6 other brand new / never touched, new in box FN OEM original 30 round mags:  Seen pictured is also a Larue 1104 QD mount (which also has inserts to accommodate 1 inch scope tubes in addition to 30mm tubes) which was purchased brand new for this rig. These sell at  $211 plus tax and shipping brand new, I'll let it go at half price if someone is buying the gun, which is a great deal for a once-used Larue.  The scope I have pictured is honestly too powerful for this type of rig, I just mounted this particular one to accuracy test this thing. But for someone looking for a scope for this rig or others, I have a bunch of scopes I was ready to list.  I'd prefer a face to face sale in San Antonio so that the Buyer can actually inspect the gun at time of sale, and can be satisfied on the spot regarding how pristine and mint condition it truly is.  This gun is totally legit and fully as described, and I'd like the Buyer to be able to see that for himself in person.  But if an out of state Buyer is all I can find, that's ok too, it just gets a litle more complicated, and means we'll need to go thru your FFL"

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and have only put 270-300 rounds through it, ie, 9 or 10 mags through it, and that's all. The gun functions flawlessly, it looks brand new with barely a single scratch or smudge, and it shot anything I put through it without a single jam or FTF or FTE. It produces average 5 shot groups around 1.0 - 1.5 inches at 100 yards when scoped, and could probably do a bit better with a proper load work-up, as I was just using factory ammo. I have the Geissele SuperSCAR 2-stage trigger already installed, which breaks very nicely at around 4 pounds.  I'm selling this gem simply because as cool as it is, and as flawless as it is, for what it is, this is just not my type of thing... In terms of rifle shooting per se, I'm really just an old school bolt action benchrest guy, but had thought I would try my hand at AR style shooting for the first time ever. And so I picked this up a few months ago to give it a whirl. But once a precision shooter, always a precision shooter...it just kinda hurts my eyes to look at paper groups bigger than 1/4 inch at 100 yards. I guess you gotta know who you are in life and stick with it: SO I would rather roll out of this rig and put the funds towards a new benchrest rig for which I've already got my components picked out. Anyway,  THIS SCAR WILL COME WITH ALL THE FOLLOWING: 1)The Geissele trigger already installed (a $350 value for the trigger alone, plus gunsmithing charges saved if you needed a gunsmith to install for you); 2) the original milspec trigger bagged on the side; 3) the attached UTG bipod which was purchased brand new for this rig; 4) a brand new black magpul vertical foregrip 5) and three (3) OEM original FN 30 rounds mags. That means the single original 30 round mag that came with the gun (still pretty much brand new itself), PLUS two (2) other brand new in the box / never opened OEM original FN 30 round mags that I'll throw in just to sweeten the pot ($70 dollar value). 6) Plus all the original FN swag that originally comes with the gun, like all the paperwork, box, chain lock, etc. . NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PRICE BUT AVAILABLE   TO YOU AT DISCOUNT IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE EVERYTHING I HAVE FOR THIS RIG, are the following: I have 6 other brand new / never touched, new in box FN OEM original 30 round mags:  Seen pictured is also a Larue 1104 QD mount (which also has inserts to accommodate 1 inch scope tubes in addition to 30mm tubes) which was purchased brand new for this rig. These sell at  $211 plus tax and shipping brand new, I'll let it go at half price if someone is buying the gun, which is a great deal for a once-used Larue.  The scope I have pictured is honestly too powerful for this type of rig, I just mounted this particular one to accuracy test this thing. But for someone looking for a scope for this rig or others, I have a bunch of scopes I was ready to list.  I'd prefer a face to face sale in San Antonio so that the Buyer can actually inspect the gun at time of sale, and can be satisfied on the spot regarding how pristine and mint condition it truly is.  This gun is totally legit and fully as described, and I'd like the Buyer to be able to see that for himself in person.  But if an out of state Buyer is all I can find, that's ok too, it just gets a litle more complicated, and means we'll need to go thru your FFL"
