I'm selling this CVA Scout V2 Takedown in .44 magnum for $300, firm.  This rifle has never been fired, save for the factory. Comes with integral scope mount and rings.  Assembles in seconds (three pieces) and tears down in half the time all the while keeping your scope zeroed.  Comes with a satchel though in no time and with little talent one could modify a backpack or sling scabbard for an even smaller profile.  Great for treks deep into the woods, thickets or climbing. The barrels are made by Bergara of Spain and the trigger is very good with no creep and about a 3.5 lb. pull.  Combined with Hornady's Leverevolution ammo this will make one fine deer rifle out to 100 yards or little more. Happy to answer any questions. No trades and located in Bedford.  Thanks!"

ARES ARMORY PISTOL UPPER WITH BCG.
 
It is an factory built upper.
 
10.5 inch barrel, 5.56 caliber with new BCG, Charging handle, Free Float Quad Rail, and with the ARES BREATH BRAKE that is slightly used.
 
ARES BREATH BRAKE is really nice, check it out, and what makes it different.
 
This upper sells for 500.00, and the brake sells for 175.00 by itself.
 
I'm wanting to trade this for an 7.5 inch barreled flat top upper, with quad rails, in 5.56 caliber.
 
I would be willing to do an even trade, just depends on what pistol upper you have.
 
I have more pics of this upper, the first two pics posted will be this upper in the ad, and the third pic will be the pistol upper that I'm wanting.
 
Thank you."

The earlier versions had dates and other legends, but between governments, until the Nazi's took total control and started overseeing the plants, this is what was produced.  There's a small Brescia proof on the left tang and BM in a box at the butt next to the lanyard loop.  All matching numbers, in condition as you see it.  Bore has some minor frosting but good rifling.  I have shot it and it worked well, no known mechanical issues.  The impression I get is this was carried, used, and surrendered later in the war.  No import marks, most likely a GI bring back.  It's a duplicate, so wife says something has to go."

The weapon was purchased new and has about 300 to 400 rounds through it.   The rifle has been modified as follows;Original forend has been replaced with an AKM type forearm.  The weapon would normally not accomodate anything but a WZ88 forend, this being one of the differences between this and hte AKM style rifles, but rifle was modified by a retired US Army armorer and now accepts standard AKM forends. Pistol grip was replaced.Standard hammer spring has been replaced with a .308 spring.Handguard mod was due to excessive heat when fired rapidly, much more comfortable now.  Pistol grip is meatier and just feels better to me, easily replaced back to original if you prefer.  Spring was the armorer's idea, but makes sense to avoid light strikes.  Weapon has been tested in it's current configuration and functions without issues.  I'm willing to ship this to your FFL, but payment would be via US Postal money order only, with shipment once cleared upon deposit.  Buyer would pay for the  shipping.If you buy locally, I've got a couple stripper clips loaded with ammo you can have with it, but I would rather not deal with the ORM-D shiping issues sending them anywhere else with the gun.I have 2 1080 round spam cans of 5.45x39 ammo you can purchase for $250 each as well if interested,   If you want them shipped, they go seperate from the gun and you'll have to cover the shipping.Please note;  I loathe haggling.  The prices posted are the prices I will sell the items at.  Any messages of ""Will you take $X"" or ""What's your bottom dollar? will not be replied to.   Nothing personal,  a lot of people like those sort of games.  I don't."

The grip angle and a low slide profile on the M&P semi-automatic pistol make it a natural pointer, while reducing muzzle rise to enhance controllability during rapid fire. The M&P45 has a polymer frame that comes with 3 interchangeable palm-swell panels to accommodate the hands of virtually any shooter. The panels are easy to change without the use of tools. The frame has an integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard for the attachment of after market tactical flashlights or laser sights. The stainless steel slide has a durable, black oxide finish, and forward and rear cocking serrations that provide a secure grip when loading or clearing the action. The slide release is ambidextrous, and the magazine release is reversible. The trigger system prevents the firearm from discharging unless the trigger is fully depressed, even if the pistol is dropped. There is no external thumb safety. The trigger pull is smooth and clean, and it breaks predictably. All M&P pistols disassemble easily without the need of tools. The Smith & Wesson M&P45 Semi-Auto Pistol comes with all steel Novak® low profile sights with 3 dots. The sights provide quick sight acquisition, and minimal interference when drawing the weapon.Striker-firedPolymer frameStainless steel slideNatural pointing grip angle3 interchangeable palm-swell panelsSteel low profile 3-dot sightsSmooth and clean trigger pullDisassembles easily without tools"

Here is what Sig Sauer says about this model:With the P938, SIG SAUER offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol.  A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.  With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six-plus one roungs of 9mm into an all-metal frame and a polished and engraved stainless steel slide.  The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.  Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb-safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places.  An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

Gen 4 guns come with 3 mags. It also has an adjustable rear sight installed. Magazines & Sights are $30 each. That's $180 + tax worth of accessories. It's really nice to go to the range with 136 rounds loaded and ready to shoot. You're shooting while everyone else is reloading their 2 or 3 mags. I'm selling because I'm buying my son's Beretta. I just shoot heavier guns more accurately. This is THE ONE for Glock Lovers. Easily an $800+ package buying new with tax. Steal this like new setup for $625 or best offer. One trip to the range with a brand new one & you'll have mine without all of the expensive extras."

Shot 24 rds with it - took it to the range twice and shot two cylinders each time. Fun gun, just haven't had time to have an emotional attachment to it, and I need the cash.***NOTE*** You will not find a six shot Pitbull anymore, these have been discontinued! The 5 inch barrel is uncommon, and I'm not trying to hype this up as a super rare gun, but I can't find any others for sale on Gunbroker or on online gun shops.The 9mm Rimless Pittbull uses same unique rimless cartridge extractor assembly system as the Charter Arms .40 cal Rimless Revolver. A dual coil spring assembly located in the extractor allows insertion and retention of a 9mm cartridge in each chamber of the revolver's cylinder. After firing, the shooter can easily eject the spent cartridges for immediate reloading. Charter Arms has taken the difficulty of rimless loading and ejection to the simplicity of the rimmed cartridge in the revolver industry.UPC: REDACTED07Vendor Part No: CA 79950I also have a spare set of grips for it from either Hogue or some other very popular brand. It fills the hand better, and since this is a 5"" barreled revolver, I doubt you'll be CCW'ing it.I still have the case, manual, lock, and everything else that came with it from the store. I have a light action mainspring, but I had two weak primer strikes with it, and immediately put back the original mainspring. Double action pull is about nine pounds, and single is buttery smooth and crisp, like a piece of toast at less than three pounds!$500 as is. Shipping extra, at cost of course. Bring a driver's license with you at sale."
