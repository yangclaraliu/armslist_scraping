But I am very particular and specific when I want something, which means I really don't know what I want.  As far as weapons, I love custom 1911s.  I currently have an Ed Brown, a TRP full rail, and my EDC is a Kimber CDP Pro.  Not a big fan of Kimber, but it was the lightest 1911 I could find for carry.  I'm eyeing the Wilson Combat Protector right now, but trying to justify spending that much, which is also a reason why I'm considering buying a pre-owned gun for the first time.  I also love drones, I have a phantom 4 right now, eyeing the new Pro if you have one. I love high end electronics.  Prolly don't need a TV or a Bluray player since I'm waiting for the new Sony OLED to come out and also the new Oppo to hit the market."

This 1911A1 was manufactured by Union Switch & Signal in 1943. Of the nearly 2-million 1911A1's manufactured during the Second World War, only 55,000 were manufactured by US&S. Only the fabled Singer is rarer. This pistol is in excellent shape and appears to be 100% original and genuine. The frame is properly marked with the circled RCD acceptance found only on the US&S production. Neither the frame nor the slide have the ""P"" proof which is correct for the earlier US&S pistols. All of the various parts are correct for a US&S including the coarse checkered hammer, finely knurled mainspring housing, blued trigger, ""concentric circle"" barrel bushing, HS barrel, etc. The original Dulite blue finish is fully original and in excellent overall condition with some normal expected handling wear and a very slight touch of patina to the left side of the slide. There is no significant rust and absolutely no pitting. The frame's bullet ramp is milled in the white, as is correct for an original finish pistol. I'd grade the original finish at about 96-97% overall. The original Keyes Fibre grips are in excellent shape, matching the pistol. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. About the only detractor is a so-so magazine that could use an upgrade, but that's a very minor issue. This is a very collectible 1911A1 and one of the most desirable of all WWII pistols. A great example!"

The G33 3x Magnifier from EOTech offers all the features of the Gen II magnifiers with some outstanding additions. This ruggedly built magnifier transforms your EOTech Holographic Weapon Sight into a lethal medium range optic at the flip of a finger. The G33 features a revolutionary Switch to Side mount that keeps the magnifier in place with a rock solid detent and when a sudden CQB situation arises, with the flip of a hand, the detent will disengage and re-engage when the magnifier locks into place out of the line of sight. With an updated appearance and the same top end quality you expect from EOTech, the G33 is the ultimate red dot and holographic sight magnifier. It offers ample eye relief, features finger adjustable windage and elevation adjustments, wider field of view, adjustable diopter for precision focus and is more compact and light weight than the G23 magnifier. The G33 works with all EOTech units and includes a 7mm riser to accommodate raised sights. The mounting system can be reversed for the ability of the magnifier to flip to the right or to the left depending on user preference. Length/Width/Height: 3.9""x2.2""x3.3"" Weight: 11.2 oz. Mount: Picatinny-style or 1"" Weaver Magnification: 3x Eye Relief: 2.2"" Field of View: 7.3 degrees Waterproof/Fogproof: Yes Water Resistant to 33 Ft.

Don't let the name century fool you, this has been gone through and properly maintained it's entire life. I bought it from a Mount Vernon police officer about 4 years ago, and it has been my favorite rifle to shoot ever since! I love this thing and hate to sell it, but... priorities. Package includes 4 20 round magazines, quad rail, bipod, for3grip, original handgaurd (currently installed), picatinny dust cover (mounted), and a cheap 4x scope that came on the rifle (currently not mounted). This is a battle rifle, so don't expect sub moa shots or a safe queen rifle. Barrel is bright and clean. New bolt bought last year. Always properly cleaned, lubed and stored in a temperature controlled safe. Will also include about 100 rounds of .308/7.62 NATO.I would prefer to trade for a firearm(s) plus cash but straight cash will work too. Asking $1400"

I'm looking to trade for something a little different maybe in a 45. Would also trade for a nice carry pistol, wether it be a semi-auto or a revolver. I'm open to offers though. Caliber wise I would like to stick with 9,40,45 because that's pretty much all I have. This gun is like brand new with less than 50 rounds fired and I value it at around $450."
