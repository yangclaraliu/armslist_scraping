Not a long range shooter , I'm interested in trading it for a ACog perhaps something else or just cash. I also have a vortex red dot ,looks just like and aimpoint , with a qd cantilever mount, also have a screw in 2x magnifier that goes with it, has glass caps as well. Both have been great Quality and have had zero issues with zero ECT. Vortex does have a lifetime warranty that goes with the product and NOT the owner. Which means no matter if you aquire one new or used it still retains it's warranty. Just a piece of mind knowing you will always be covered. Thanks for looking, I'd really like a ACog for 556 perhaps a decent 1-4 or 1-8 with some cash or who knows, firearms ECT. Not in a hurry to get rid of it just seeing if there's something else I could use a little more."

You will very quickly get the timing down and it is very close to full auto and completely legal.The revolutionary Binary Firing System™ will be appreciated by three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. 400.00 plus taxCall/text- REDACTED for details and pricingREDACTED"

First of the gun is a p229 dak version. The gun has fired great and never hiccuped or malfunctioned. I have roughly 300-500 rounds through the gun. I have added a laser max guide rod laser which included a new recoil spring that has only had 25 rounds through it.  It does also have night sights on it. I have the factory grips for it which are pictured but I have upgraded to a set of g10 hogue dak specific grips for it. It will also come with 2 barrels. I have a .40 barrel that has been shot and a .357 barrel that is brand new unfired for it. All and all the extras included are damn near the price of the gun. I will entertain cash offers for the gun. If you offer cash please be realistic. I don't expect to get retail for the extras but it is quite an upgrade. Total you would have to spend $550-$600 in just the upgrades. I will also listen to trade offers. I am not looking for a shotgun. Unless you have this amazing browning shotgun. I would really prefer not to trade it for a rifle. I would consider browning blr rifles and 1892 or ruger #1 rifles. Pistol wise I would consider high end guns. I will accept cash to make up differences. I am also willing to add cash if necessary for the right deal.  List below. Please feel free to email me.  This will be a face to face deal. CCW holders to the front of the line but must have a valid ID. Thanks for looking
