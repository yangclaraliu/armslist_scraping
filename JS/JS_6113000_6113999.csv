Chambered for 7.62x51 NATO (.308). Those of you who are familiar with the Hk-91 already know that the manufacturing quality, reliability, and accuracy of these German-produced rifles is unmatched. A ban on the import of these rifles took effect in 1989, so whatever made it into the U.S. prior to that is what's available on the market. This is one of the 48,817 Hk-91 rifles that were imported from 1974 - 1989.This one is in outstanding condition. The previous owner had only put a minimal number of rounds through the rifle, so when I purchased it approximately six months ago, my intent was to keep it as a safe queen.For personal preference, I decided to send the rifle out to Jayson Cotter (IGF) to have him remove the blue-gray finish which was worn in a few places, apply a manganese-phosphate parkerizing, and then complete the work with a matte black 'Envirotech' finish over this. As you can see, the finish is flawless.The bore and chamber are mirror-bright and in excellent condition as you'd expect. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded to accept the flash hider or other accessories (note that the factory flash hider's innovative locking design permits it to be installed / removed by hand and does not require any tools). The bolt carrier and bolt head are 'IB' coded.The furniture is German Army surplus, taken directly from a G3 service rifle. It matches nicely and looks menacing on this Hk-91! Definitely something that will turn heads if you decide to take this out to the range! If you really want to take this rifle to the next level, the receiver is factory-designed to accept a Hensoldt Wetzlar 4x24 scope and claw mount.Included with the rifle are three G3 magazines (two of which are unissued, new-in-wrap), an original G3 canvas sling, and an original cover for the flash hider to keep dirt and debris out of the bore when you're trekking across the African savanna.Asking $2000 shipped for the lot. First ""I'll take it"" claims it! Not interested in any trades..Also, Comes with two Buffers. The 'standard' buffer is already installed and an unissued G3 heavy buffer is included."

I don't have an exact round count.  I've shot less than 200 rounds through it since the trigger and sear block updates.  This gun is in great condition and is more accurate than I am.  Recently replaced the recoil spring as part of regular maintenance.  I will also include a brand new recoil spring assembly still in the package.  As mentioned, the sear block and, therefore, the rear rails are brand new as is the striker assembly.  Comes with four factory mags, factory case, and all the regular accoutrements you might expect.  Never carried and the finish is flawless.Asking $580, but will entertain reasonable offers.  I also have a crap ton of factory 40 ammo I'll sell for 10 dollars per box of 50."

SPTFollowing that is a stainless .357 Mag Taurus 66 with a 6 inch barrel, 7 round capacity made in 2003. SPTFinally is a 9mm Taurus Pt92 AF-D with 2x15 round magazines. SOLDI'm not looking to trade for anything in particular but I do like 357 revolvers (obviously) and 357 rifles. I'm willing to consider trades + cash either way and multi-gun trades. I'll be going from Hampton through Richmond, Staunton, Roanoke, and Wytheville relatively soon and can meet anywhere along the way (64 & 81). I'm not giving these guns away, not desperate to sell, don't need help selling them and don't 'need' to sell them.  If you're not willing to pay what I'm asking or offer a comparable trade don't waste either of our time. Must be VA resident with concealed weapon permit or voters registration card or active duty military with orders in VA. More pictures are available upon request."

This means the entire rifle is lighter, more compact, and easier to haul around.Multiple improvements to the bolt and carrier group were implemented as well. A reduced diameter carrier further decreases weight, and the integral gas key is bombproof. Dual ejector springs improve ejection remarkably. and the redesigned extractor and elastomer spring will last for tens of thousands of rounds without replacement.The 20” G2 .308 Hunter is exactly that, a hunter!

I ordered the stripped lower (NOT a blem or factory 2nd) and put in a BCM Enhanced Lower Parts Kit. The trigger and hammer are Nickel & Teflon coated. At the BCM factory, the sear engagement surfaces are ground, but then hand polished for an increased smoothness up to 300% beyond the Mil-Spec (according to BCM), and the trigger pull on this lower is about as good as it gets with no creep or grittyness. It has a Magpul MOE+ pistol grip.This lower has never been attached to an upper and has never been shot. It will accept any upper with mil-spec diameter pins.The buffer assembly is also BCM. I insisted on using top-quality parts for this lower.Price is firm, and I actually paid more than what I'm asking. Let me know if you're interested.Local only."

This resulted in the 92S which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units. The later relocation of the magazine release button means these models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas.  Comes with one (1) 15 round magazine. $345 Out The Door"

Bulk .22 ammo is still somewhat difficult to find at reasonable prices. I also have quite a lot of other ammo. So here is what I would like to do. For every box of bulk ammo of a different caliber you buy from me at cost I will sell you a box of .22 ammo at cost. I'm not trying to make any money here. I'm just downsizing some of my bulk ammo and thought I would pass on the rounds to fello hunters and shooters. I will use Walmart / Cabela's prices. The  .22 ammo will be approximately 6 cents per round. The others we can look up when you decide what you would like to buy. I have many more boxes of .22 than I have of the other rounds... So if you came in and bought all of my other ammo I would sell you all of my approx 30000 rounds of .22..... could be a hell of a score for the right person. Some of the other rounds that I have are as follows:Winchester and federal 100 round boxes of 9mmWinchester and federal 100 round boxes of 45TulAmmo 500 round case in sealed tin .223Amercan Eagle green tip 1000 round .223500 round case 7.62x51Various 20 round boxes .223 and 7.62x39 (must buy 5 of these per 1 bulk box of .22)Text 316 251 one59four
