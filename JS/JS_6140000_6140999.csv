This rifle is new. It has been on our shelf as a display piece and does have a few very slight rub marks on the barrel that we tried to show in pics. Some are so small that we couldn't get them to show. Other than factory test fire this rifle has never been shot. This is a beautiful rifle that is ready to do some serious shooting. If you are looking for an AR platform with some punch behind it this is the one for you."

This rifle is new. It has been on our shelf as a display piece and does have a few very slight rub marks on the barrel that we tried to show in pics. Some are so small that we couldn't get them to show. Other than factory test fire this rifle has never been shot. This is a beautiful rifle that is ready to do some serious shooting.

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
 
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
 
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Apart from statutory changes inside the weapon the SP5K is absolutely identical to the MP5K, particularly the interfaces for magazine, buttstock/receiver cap, handguard and sight mount. In conjunction with extensive accessory options the SP5K is a state of the art weapon system. In addition to the quick release Picatinny mounting rail and the slim line handguard with HKey mounting slots available as accessories is as natural as a buttstock support option and the ambidextrous operation of the weapon. The SP5K can be universally used both as a pistol or a shoulder-mounted weapon."

So close were the designs that AMT was taken to court by Ruger for Patent Infringement. That court case terminated the AMT Production line.AMT production ran from 1986 through 1993. The AMT Lightning match pistol is said to be one of the most accurate and reliable pistols of its kind. This 6-inch bull barrel has a fixed blade front sight and an adjustable Millet rear sight. This pistol has Pachmayr rubber grips, a custom target trigger, and has a low round count.If you have always wanted a special .22 target pistol, this one is waiting for you.

It preforms very well with high quality ammo. The upper is a plane Jane upper receiver,  with a Wilson combat fluted, 16"" 1:7 twist with a .556 chamber, M4 feed ramps. (It shoots all ammunition with great consistancy) On the muzzle, is a JP competition muzzle break fitted to the barrel using a lathe, and torqued to mate with the barrel shoulder with perfection. The barrel and break was polished from the gas block forward to give a seamless appearance. The gas block and tube are generic. The barrel and gas system have less than 120 rounds through them.  The handguard is a Troy, 13.8"" Quadrail. It's very high quality and extreamly rugged. The entire build has light use. The final price is much less than the original parts and labor bill.This listing is for the barrel, although the upper,  and gas system come with it. -$500 OBOThe handguard comes for an extra $150 OBO"
