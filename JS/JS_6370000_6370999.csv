  #1.  AR-180B in good shape.  Has light scuff marks on barrel.  Worst scuff is the one in photo number three on the stock.    It's in very good shape other than that one scuff, 100% reliable.  I bought it and never shot it other than a few magazines.     Wanting $950 shipped.   #2.   PTR91 GI.   It is the GI model.    It is in good shape except for the light mark shown in picture number six.  It has a matching one on the opposite side.      It has been 100% reliable for the several hundred rounds I've fired.  It shot very well, under 2.5"" groups at 100 yards with XM80 ball ammo.     
It comes with B&T low profile long rail mounted to it.     I am also including a NIB UTG Leapers claw mount.    This model is nearly identical to the surplus issue one and has good reviews amongst all users.   Price is $900 shipped.   I will remove the B&T mount to knock $60 off and the UTG leapers mount for another $30 off.
  #3.  800 rounds of ZQI 7.62 Nato ball ammo in boxes.  This is the green box with taped up sides like they all are.    Good boxer primed ammunition, I am merely consolidating into one type of ammunition so the odd-lots out have to go.    50 cents per round.
   Not really wanting trades, what I am listing I'd be interested in possibly:   Ruger Security Six BLUED model with a 4"" barrel.   18"" barreled FAL.  As long as it runs, manufacturer doesn't bother me.    21"" L1A1 style FAL.  Mainly inch parts, maker doesn't matter, just don't want a metric/inch mixmaster.      Primary Arms 5X Prism scope.     Possibly aimpoint red dots."

Made in 2002 this model was ""tuned"" at the factory for cowboy shooting. In addition to that from what I was told this gun had action work done by Grashorn Gun Works up in Wyoming, and has had a one piece titanium firing pin installed. The action is very smooth and the trigger is light. The trigger is 2lbs and using the same scale the lever took 3lbs to open all the way (vs. 8lbs on my factory 1894 lever). This gun is set up for fast cowboy action shooting, the one piece firing pin is not as safe as the original two piece (just so you know). The butt pad is a rubber pachmeyer. The bluing has a little wear at the muzzle and a couple small rubs along the barrel. Overall a very nice rifle that is hard to find."

It is in excellent condition with only a few very light handling marks that you have to look very closely to find. The stocks are nicely figured with a durable matte finish.  I purchased this gun a couple years ago from the original owner and used it for approx. half of one trap league season.  When I got my new trap gun, I was planning to use the Beretta as my ND Pheasant hunting gun as it is light to carry and very fast pointing.  That plan changed recently, I found a Winchester Model 12 that I couldn't pass up and have decided the Winchester will be my dedicated Pheasant hunting gun.  I prefer to sell the Beretta outright, howevever, I may entertain trades for a Remington 870TB plus cash, I am looking for a better gun that my 13 y/o son can use for youth trap league this spring.  Here is some information about the Beretta S686 Silver Essential from the website GunsReview:""The Silver Essential - Beretta's basic over-and-under.  Here's a functional, working gun for the serious hunter. It's a no-frills shotgun with all the operating systems and safety features that make a Beretta, a Beretta. The straight-grained stock is selected for strength and durability and highlighted with clean, cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end. The low profile receiver and slim fore-end enhance pointability, bores and chambers are chrome-lined for extra durability. The open side riv design results in a faster swing, light weight, and faster cooling. Long life and durability are assured by the perfect mating of Monobloc and barrels, self-adjusting, dual conical locking lugs and strong, replaceable hinge pins. The receiver is finished for extra durability and corrosion resistance with brushed chrome, while barrels are finished in matte black. The tough stock and fore-end are made to stand up to years of abuse in wet duck blinds or dry, dusty days afield. The Silver Essential is chambered for all 2-3/4 inch and 3 inch shells. Feature for feature, the Silver Essential is an unbeatable value.""The Silver Essential is a fairly rare model as it was only imported in 1987 and 1988 and I have seen very few of them come up for sale.  I am selling for $925 cash firm and may be interested in the trade plus cash mentioned above. There is very little pricing or comparable sale information, but I think the price is fair as the only other listing for a Silver Essential model is $1,500. The ad photos are the actual gun, please contact me direclty and I will send you additional photos. I can be reached by text at REDACTED.The sale will also include 5 extended choke tubes (full, light-full, modified, light-modified, & improved cylinder), two flush choke tubes (full & modified) all Beretta mobilchoke style, and a Microlube shotgun case."

It was the standard issue sidearm for officers in the French military during the First World War.The Modèle 1892 revolver is a solid frame revolver with the cylinder on a separate frame swinging right for manual reloading. The Modèle 1892 was first fielded in 1893 and was prominent among French military officers during First World War, and later the French police until the mid-1960s.A mechanically tight and very well finished handgun, the Modèle 1892 fires 8mm rounds with a striking power equivalent to that of a .32 ACP round. It also features a smaller calibre than many other military revolvers of that time period, including the Webley revolver and its predecessor the MAS 1873 revolver.This firearm also comes with an original holster, this was used during WWI and returned with an American service man.  The barrel has slight wear on the exterier but the blueing has help up rather nicely considering it's 122 years old.  Please contact for any questions or for more photo's."

Upgraded with a custom-made Williams rear peep site ($250-300) and German HK Heavy Rubber Butt Pad ($100). Also features the lightweight, yet stout A2 buttstock, lightweight and slim handguard, metal semi-auto trigger pack, standard front sight, and effective factory muzzle break. IB date code, manufactured in 1981. 100% genuine German HK91 and ""Made in Germany"", not a clone or knockoff. This rifle was purchased as part of an estate sale and according to the widow of the older gentleman who bought it brand new, he never took this out of the safe or fired a single round from it. There is minor evidence that a magazine had been inserted when I acquired it; however, for the purpose of taking photos for this listing I inserted plastic Thermold magazine so as to not add any additional wear. From all appearances this rifle has only been test fired with just a handful or less rounds from the factory in Germany prior to being imported to the States. There were ONLY 5,520 of these imported into the U.S. before the 1989 George H.W. Bush importation ban and VERY few left in the country similar to this one that have not been shot or molested. There are a couple very minor handling marks from 35 years of sitting in a safe, but for its age this rifle is in amazing condition and the best I have ever seen in person. You will be hardpressed to find a nicer HK91 and I guarantee you will not be disappointed in this beauty! Includes one twenty round magazine and the buyer will have the opportunity to purchase some extra parts I have lying around (factory German claw scope mount, wide forearm w/ or w/o the bipod, magazines, etc). Willing to accept credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover any PP fees. Private sale, no FFL fees or paperwork to hassle with.

I have put about 750 rounds through the gun and it has proven to be very reliable with very few misfires (ammo related). I am selling it because I'm in the market for a full size AK47. I am asking $700.00 OR BEST OFFER for the gun. *Must have valid GA CCW or Driver's license. Please contact me with any questions or for more pictures. Thanks for looking!"
