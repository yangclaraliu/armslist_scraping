The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.http://gunsnmore.org/product.springfield-armory-xdm-competition-40-sw-525-161-poly-grip-black-3085"

This rifle was purchased directly from Remington as a stock 700 AAC-SD model with the 20"" threaded barrel (1:10 tactical rifling) It then was brought to Accurate Ordnance in Winder, GAThey ""blue printed"", or accurized, this rifle, added a over-sized tactical bolt knob, installed a Timney trigger, a Nightforce one-piece 20MOA picatinny rail, and a AAC 51T suppressor mount. This rifle was then placed in a Manners T4A stock with their BDM Mini Chasis system, which allows the rifle to use standard Accuracy International patterned magazines. This system fully beds the action in the stock and allows the barrel to free float, improving accuracy. One 5 round AI magazine is included with this rifle.The stock was given a custom camo pattern, based off the Swedish M90 camo. Due to some light use and the nature of Cerakote, there are some blemishes on the finish. I can provide additional photos as needed. This rifle probably has 100 rounds through it, 150 at most. I got this rifle built hoping to do PRS shooting, but it's not my cup of tea. This rifle is an excellent shooter, extremely accurate and light on recoil due to the compensator. The scope on top is a Nightforce 3.5-15x50 MIL SPEC Front Focal Plane scope. This has the Horus H59 reticle, a tactical reticle designed for fast reading of windage and elevation holds. The scope is not included in the listed price, but it can be added on for $5,650The bi-pod used in these picture is NOT INCLUDED, it's a loaner from a friend.

Threaded for the standard 1/2x28 pitch, the Sparrow is a great option for virtually any rimfire application. Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance. Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner. Silencerco solved this maintenance issue with MPC technology and made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. MPC technology revolutionized take-apart silencers by containing the lead and carbon debris to prevent the debris from reaching the outer tube. This innovative design is achieved by applying two tube halves before sliding the outer tube on the rest of the assembly. When disassembling, the outer tube can be easily removed, and the tube halves are free to pull away from the baffles without having to rotate or slide. Just pull off the tubes, clean the components, and reassemble.
