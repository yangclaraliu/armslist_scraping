Includes two 8 round magazines, and more than 225 rounds of communist bloc ammo. I can't remember where the ammo was manufactured, but I'm sure the primers are berdan and corrosive. The gun was throughly cleaned and oiled after each range day. This is the Chinese version of the Russian Tokarev, the Model 54-1, which was required to include a thumb safety during the Clinton Administration for importation int the USA. The added thumb safety has long since been removed and discarded.7.62x25 is a powerful round, but hard to find and expensive when you do find it. The pistol is heavy, and of low capacity (8 rounds). Magazines are still available, I've seen an Ebay listing for six mags for $100.00. I've had this sidearm for many years but have no use for it. It's too heavy for my IWB carry, too low of capacity, and more recoil than I'm comfortable with. I live near Oakwood, and will meet anywhere near Hall County, or Barrow County. I'm not willing to ship this pistol, nor will I sell the ammo separately. I'm willing to trade for a sidearm in 9mm, we can workout any differences in value."

It's all original. Used as a truck gun by me and now I'm looking to switch to the G29. So that would be  pretty much the only trade. I'll add cash on my end, just depends if you have a gen 3 or 4 G29. I don't care for accessories or ammo. I might do a trade for a Gen 3 20sf but I'm not too excited about having a full size pistol for summer carry. The previous owner had color filled the letters and used acetone to remove the paint so you can see acetone marks. Glock representative offered me to send it in and get it refinished for about 50$. But that doesn't hurt the gun's performance at all. I've put about 350 rounds so far, of course no problems at all. I've only shot Georgia Arms FMJs through it and the barrel looks great. Thanks for checking out my post. Indiana residents only with LTCH and I'm able to drive about 30 min or so for the trade. Need to see Indiana ID and LTCH, no felons"

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. The stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. MADE IN THE USA"
