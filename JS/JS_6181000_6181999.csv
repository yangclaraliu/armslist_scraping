This gun has only been fired 250 times, as such the pistol is flawless, even the barrel shows no sign of slide wear. I have done a few things to this one but since I have a M&P set up pretty much the same way, this one is going for sale because I don't need 2 full size 9's. First the pistol has had the Phantom fulcrum trigger upgrade. This trigger is adjustable for take up and over travel and has a perfect 3 to 4lb break with a sharp crisp and very short reset. I have it set with a small amount of take up and virtually no overtravel.Second I replaced the stock sights with a set of Meprolight Night sights. These are 3 dot night sights with orange tritium in the rear and green on front. The grip is a Radetec LED advisor which takes the place of the factory backstraps. This grip allows the user to check the amount of rounds left in the magazine either automatically or manually. Green=more than 3, red=3 or less. Ghost foward slide release: smaller but much easier to release the slide due to a forward set and very pronounced engagement bump that catches you thumb easily.Strike Industries slide cover. Simple built in push button allows for easy release of the slide plate for access to the block during cleaning(mostly it's just for looks though).Sticky Holster for the G17All the factory parts are included and of course the gun is just like new with factory box, papers, brush, lock, 3 magazines, mag loader, extra followers, 4 extra backstraps and removal tool. All in all almost 1,000.00 spent on this gun for 850.00No trades unless it's a Sig Spartan 1911 5"". Thanks"

I also took the finish off the barrel for a nice stainless look, and some of the finish off the slide which gives it a graphite-type finish. The metal on the barrel and slide have not been compromised due to the fact that the Tennifer treatment is imbued into the metal, not the black finish, so no worries there.

Smith & Wesson added deep fish-scale scallops on the front and rear gripping surfaces of the stainless steel slide to provide an aggressive non-slip grip for manual cycling. The frontstrap of the grip frame and the mainspring housing are also aggressively checkered for a secure grasp, and the top of the slide is full-length grooved with S&W's classic revolver barrel-rib pattern. The wooden grip panels are figured with an attractive fish-scale pattern that matches the slide-grip surfaces. Smith & Wesson also refined the internal mechanism of the SW1911 E-Series Semi-Automatic Pistol for enhanced reliability. A patent-pending S&W Model 1911 trigger was engineered that allows the trigger to be precisely hand-fitted instead of simply installed during the assembly process without adding undue expense to the process. The new trigger eliminates excessive vertical and front-to-back freeplay in the frame slot, providing shooters with a precisely fitted trigger, equal to or better than a lot of custom triggers. The trigger also has an adjustable setscrew for overtravel. The E-Series 1911 features an extra heavy-duty external extractor and a redesigned ejection port to guarantee reliable case ejection with the many varieties of ammo available today. Continued features from the previous SW1911 line include a full-length steel recoil-spring guide rod, open-end guide rod cap, and a visual loaded-chamber window at the rear top of the barrel hood. The humpbacked beavertail safety cups the hammer to keep it from biting the shooter's hand, and the manual thumb safety has an extended combat-type lever. The operating features–beavertail safety, manual safety, magazine release button, and slide release lever–are a contrasting matte black, as are the steel 3-dot front and rear sights. The Smith & Wesson SW1911 E-Series Semi-Auto Pistol comes with two 8-round magazines with buttpads. Manufacturer model #: 108482.  Trigger eliminates excessive vertical and front-to-back freeplay Redesigned ejection port to guarantee reliable case ejection Beavertail safety cups the hammer to keep it from biting the shooter's hand Manual thumb safety Steel 3-dot front and rear sights"

The rifle comes with the items listed above other than the optics and one brand new 40 round Magpul magazine.If you are serious and want to shoot the rifle prior to purchasing I have no problem with that.

The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
I believe it is new in the box and never fired (I cannot recall firing it and do not see any signs of wear).
FEATURES: Safeties:  3 position ambidextrous safety on both sides of frame. 
The safety also does double duty as a handy decocker. Frame-mounted decocker is vastly superior to the Beretta.
Nicely visible, high profile white 3 dot sight system.
Rear sights are fully adjustable for windage and elevation. Accessory rail milled into frame for a laser, flashlight, etc.Loaded chamber indicator along side barrel.
Single and double action. Single action has a nice clean break -- it’s short, light (about five pounds) and crisp!
Real, external hammer fired.
Breech-locking mechanism uses a Walther-style tilting locking block.
Construction: Steel barrel and slide.  Sturdy metal alloy frame.
5 inch barrel and military/ergonomic frame achieves legendary pointability and accuracy.
Recoil is very manageable. Strong, planted grip with checkered wood grips means that the recoil does not snap or kick...it is more of a ""push"" and really cushions the recoil.  Even shooters accustomed to a lighter round will be able to handle it very easily.
Sharp looking grips have full checkering for a tight grip.
Double stack, high capacity magazine.Field stripping is a snap, using Beretta’s sure-footed, quick lever takedown that easily removes the slide from the frame. From there, the recoil spring, guide tube and barrel are easily removed.
Unbeatable Taurus lifetime warranty (transferrable to all subsequent owners).Comes with factory box.
 
** The features, fit and finish of its more expensive cousins that it easily rivals. Note the absence of machine marks, a characteristic of higher end firearms.
 
 
Carry options: De-cock the hammer by thumbing the safety lever all the way down and carry it chambered, hammer down, off safe for a first double action shot.  You can also keep the safety on, then thumb it off with and have a first double action shot.  If you are a 1911 fan, then you can also carry cocked and locked which is the hammer cocked, safety on with a first shot being single action."
