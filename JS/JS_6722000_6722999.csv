I have many pics of the firearm to email when you reach out to me. I purchased the firearm at Cabelas and have all the official paperwork and the firearm manual. I have a nearly mint condition 9mm Smith and Wesson Military & Police in Flat Dark Earth color with the Carry & Range kit. See the details below. I purchased this firearm for home defense. I put just under 100 rounds through it and maintained it regularly using my handgun cleaning kit. It is maintained impeccably and stowed away in the protective case since purchase. The color is Flat Dark Earth with a black slide. The suggested retail price on the official Smith & Wesson website is $689. I would like to sell this to get a smaller compact firearm as I don’t need two at the moment. I researched the listings and the condition and the extra accessories I am including make this deal very competitive and a steal! So I won’t budge with the price. It's truly a well maintained firearm. I took care of it like a baby. Considering the condition and all the accessories that come with it, the price is set at $500
I'm throwing in a like-new Urban Carry concealed leather holster for free since it fits this model. I am also including a concealed shoulder holster that carries the handgun on the left and two magazines on the right for free.
It also includes accessories over $200 in value. See the list below

These Ammo Cans feature sturdy steel construction with waterproof seals. They measure about 10""x 3 1/2""x7"". Most are dusty / dirty and some may have a small amount of surface rust. The markings on the cans vary. If they were cleaned up they would bring a lot more money, but I just don't have the time right now and they are taking up space.

“THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.”"

This design gives the strength and rigidity of a heavy bull barrel, with the weight of a slim pencil barrel.

   I built this rifle to be a light weight hunting/target rifle that performs like a heavy sniper rifle.
   I've shot less than 100 rounds through the gun, and so far it's proven to be a reliable tack-driver with match ammo as you would expect. I'll get some group pictures up soon.

It is designed for accurate firing by hunting rifles in daylight and dusk conditions and is guaranteed to significantly increase your accuracy. It has a standard 30 mm tube so it can be attached to virtually any weapon. It has a traditional bright red dot with a minimum MOA of 1.5. The PK-01VA has a special 8 setting, discreet built-in variable brightness control allowing you to regulate the brightness of the dot manually. It is overbuilt to handle the strongest of recoils and can be attached to any weapon regardless of caliber. The sight is waterproof and dry nitrogen purged to prevent fogging. It works well with night vision optics. The open windage and elevation knobs are easily accessible for adjustment and have clear, pronounced 2/3 MOA clicks.
