These are sold as blems (because they are a run of 182 grain vs 180 gr) but are one of the BEST most premium bullets on the market today--especially for hunters needing a no-lead bullet.  Nosler eTips shoot with every bit the performance of Barnes and then some, and because they are copper alloy, vice pure copper, do not foul your barrel nearly as quickly or badly.  Nosler eTips feature some of if not THE HIGHEST ballistic coefficients of any bullet in their weight--far surpassing the BCs of other bullets like the Ballistic Tip or AMax. Check the specs on the 180s to see what I mean.  For you, that means a much longer-for-weight bullet than anything else out there, combined with superior ballistics, the flattest shooting trajectories, and some of the best long-range terminal performance of anything on the market. Midway and others sell the 180gr eTips for $45-50 per 50.  Here you get three bags for less than the price of two!  With 150 bullets, you can work up your load, sight in the rifle, and STILL have 100 rounds for your elk, moose, whitetail, mulie, black or brown bear hunt or whatever you are after with your 308, 30-06, 300 Win Mag, 300 H&H, or other favorite 308 caliber rifle. Expands reliably down to 1800fps, so with its high BC you should get a little more distance than normal.  If you love the bullet, reloading the 180s vs the 182s shouldn't be much different once you run out.Use Barnes data as a guide if there's no eTip load data on the Nosler site, but start a little lower than normal and work up, looking for pressure signs (all the standard disclaimers).  Buy now and be reloading tomorrow!Looking to sell for $70 face to face (cash only). Willing to ship (PayPal or PMO) for $7 +3.5% if you use PayPal (DO NOT note these are for bullets--while this shouldn't be a violation of PayPal's anti-gun policies, I am not willing to risk having my bank account frozen to test that theory).  No Sunday sales."

Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 19 is a mid-size pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol utilizes a dual recoil spring assembly that substantially increases service life of the pistol, and helps take the snap out of recoil, reducing muzzle flip for faster follow up shots. A modular back strap allows shooters to instantly customize the grip to an individual shooter's hand size, or to cold weather gloves. Rough grip texturing on the Gen4's polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 19 Gen4 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for concealed carry or at home. The model 19 Gen4 comes with three standard 15-round magazines magazines that comply with various city or state restrictions on magazine capacity."

It comes with a very rare excellent condition brown 1918 dated holster with an original tool in the leather pocket. The holster was manufactured by Uberpf Sattler [full name etc in photo] The 1914 Mod. is identical to that of the 1908 with the exceptions that you see here: 4in barrel, stock lug, hold open device, and a letter following a 4 digit serial number. In this case, the letter is ""a"". As such, this is an Imperial Army Mod. 14, 9mm with a full date of 1917 on the chamber. The barrel is in excellent condition with strong lands and bright finish. What I find of particular interest is that all of the numbers, including that of the firing pin, match. This indicates that over the 99 years of life of this pistol it was not fired much. There are NO import marks. All of the standard military acceptance, inspector marks/proofs are found where they should be. The finish has some very minor rust spots near the grips. The finish is about 85% and original- see the white unblued interior of slide and receiver. The straw parts, in most part, appear 90%. If interested, I have additional photos. PAYMENT OPTIONS: I accept USPS Money Orders and personal/business cashier checks. Items paid with US Postal Money Orders will ship forthwith. Items paid with checks will ship when check clears.

The hunter is immediately ready to shoot. He gains time, remains calm and therefore is able to shoot safely. WITH CASE. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot.  The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact.  The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing."

Mainly looking to trade but if someone comes with cash, I may take it.Great shooting gun. CZ75 concept essentially. Was going to be my carry gun but found a compact 1911. Hammer, trigger, feed ramp, slide release and safety have been polished. Lettering has been color filled. Very clean gun. I've personally shot 50 rounds through it and the previous owner didn't put much through it. I'd say 100 rounds or less through it. Yes, I know Academy sells these for 349.99. Then include tax and BG check and then you have a basic T-100 for around $400.

The straight extension offers a perfectly aligned cheek weld when shooting with optics and the angled extension gives you unrestricted use of the iron sights.Maybe some days you want to use a forward grip but other days, you just don’t feel like having a vertical grip protruding from the underside of the stock body. Again, the choice is yours because this stock system has a bottom Picatinny rail with removable cover. Aren’t comfortable with the length of the rifle? With our 6 position adjustable buttstock, we let you pick how long you’d like your rifle for the most comfortable setup. These are just a few examples of how we’re putting the power into the customer’s hands to make their Mini-14 work for them. This stock system also includes a top barrel cover with Picatinny rail, a SAW Style Pistol Grip, and is completely made in the USA out of military grade composite.

I might sell it at some point but Im looking for a nice 909 so I might need it but anyone interested would be the first to know if I dont get one. **"
