Early last year before the Elections I purchased several guns that I thought would be banned if""That Woman"" got into office. But now that the panic has passed I have decided to sell a couple of these guns so that I can go buy myself another new toy, LoL !!!So today I'm offering to the right person a Brand New in the Box, NEVER FIRED, Palmetto State Arms AR 15, the model is called the ""Freedom Carbine"". This gun has Forged Aluminum Upper and Lower, See Specs below, NO Plastic like some guns in this price range. The PSA website has this gun on sale now for $699 Plus. The only difference between the current rifle for sale now at PSA and my rifle is I ordered my rifles to be made with the ""Multi-Cal"" Receiver at an additional cost to me. Please do not forget that when you buy a gun online or even locally there are a lot of fees you are required to pay in addition to the sales price stated, like FFL Transfer Fee, Shipping, Background Check Fee, Sales TAXES just to name a few. So with my sale, you can avoid all of these fees and taxes as I have already paid them all. These guns are proven to be a great rifles !!!  There are dozens of review videos online at YouTube. I will only require you to let me photo copy your Valid Florida Drivers License and fill out a Bill of Sale, that way if the gun gets say stolen from you and used for unlawful purposes I can show I no longer own the gun. This information will ONLY be kept in my bank vault for CYA (cover your a$$) protection for us both. I will not sell to anyone that is not currently able to legally own a firearm !!! I am LOSING money on this rifle,but that's ok, I've got my eye on a 50 cal pistol I want to buy. This rifle as shown has the 16 inch Stainless Steel Barrel, I really like that barrel, but if you don't want the shiny barrel just paint it or whatever. The following info is from the PSA website, giving the technical data for this gun. I will give as an extra bonus to the buyer three 30 round mags (a $40 value) !!!!

It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be. The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT™ is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT™ from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT™ features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT™ features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT™ is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT™ includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT™ uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions. The SAINT™ is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory® low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with ½ minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation. The bottom line? When it’s time to protect and defend, trust the SAINT™.

Serial number 454XXE, born in 1976 another bicentennial gun. There is one small nick on the bottom of the crane an shown in the pictures. A little history on the Python; The Python was created by adding a full under lug vent rib barrel and precision adjustable sights to Colt’s venerable “I” frame in 1955, the same frame used for the .38 Special Official Police and the .357 Magnum Trooper. The Python was precision made and hand fitted and was essentially a mass produced custom gun. It was intended as a precision target revolver, but law enforcement and the public at large fell in love with the Big Snake. There were blued models, .38 Special only Target Models with eight-inch barrels, high polish nickel models and the one I lusted after, a high polish stainless steel model. Colt produced the Python as a regular production item until 2000,and as a custom shop special order item until 2003. And there will never be another Python. Oh, if Colt’s management were to pull their collective heads out of their collective fourth points of contact and realize the the company can’t survive on dwindling military contracts and civilian sales of their existing lineup, there might be a revolver with “Python” on the barrel. But it won’t be a real Python.Lots more pictures available upon request.  Sorry coukd only post 5."

I have barely used the gun and just want to sell it to try something different. I am the original owner.  I bought it new from gunbroker.The price: You wont find a better price anywhere.  I shopped the internet and I'm offering you the best price. The ghost trigger kit cost me $35 new and the extra extended magazine is worth $15.The Ghost Trigger Kit: This kit reduces further travel of the trigger after the firing pin goes off. This increases the accuracy of your shooting.   The kit has the option to be installed to produce a 4lb trigger pull or a 6 lb trigger pull.  Lower trigger pull weight allows higher accuracy. You can install this kit yourself using a video from youtube or you can have your gunsmith do it.Terms of Sale: I am a law abiding citizen who cares for the safety of others.  As such I will only sell this gun locally.  You must meet me in the Orlando area at the gun shop of your choice where we will do an official FFL transfer which will require you to have the local shop background check you.  Most gun shops charge between $30 and $50 for this service. Forms of Payment:  I will take only cash for this transaction.  When you meet me at the local gun shop of your choice you can transfer the cash to me there.

This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds.<br>I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. I have personally shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

The rifle's bolt, barrel and a barrel-extension into which the bolt locks are all steel. The 171⁄2-inch barrel has a 1:7 rate-of-twist and features a permanently attached muzzle brake. A modular fire-control assembly, made primarily of polymer, is located inside the butt of rifle's stock and is easily removable.   One of the most unique qualities of the FS2000 is it's almost entirely ambidextrous. An Achilles' heel of most bullpup designs-particularly for southpaws-is having the action of the rifle located behind the trigger, the ejection port is then in the rifle's buttstock near the shooter's face. FN's solution was novel-a forward ejection system that employs a tube above the barrel and an ejection port on the upper right side of the receiver, covered by a hinged synthetic door.    Another unique feature of the FS2000 is its inspection cover door located to the rear of the optics cover assembly. Since the action and chamber are completely enclosed within the rifle's stock assembly, this door allows visual access to the chamber area.nufacturer: FNH USA; REDACTED, Fnhusa.com   Manufacturer: FNH USA; REDACTED, Fnhusa.com   Caliber: 5.56x45 mm (.223 Rem.)   Action Type: Gas-operated, semi-automatic   Receiver: Aluminum alloy   Barrel:171⁄2-inch, manganese phosphated steel   Rifling:Six grooves, 1:7 RH   Magazine:Detachable box, STANAG   Sights: Iron Sights     Trigger Pull:91⁄2 pounds, two-stage   Stock:Synthetic   Overall Length:291⁄4 inches   Weight:7 pounds, 14 ounces     https://combatrifle.com/fs2000 http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=216 https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2009/7/13/fnh-usa-fs2000-standard-specs/"

It has had about 2000 rounds through it, the vast majority being birdshot loads for clay shooting. She will run Slugs and Buckshot just fine though. Been incredibly reliable for me under all conditions, although I have taken care to clean her anyways. No notable damage to any parts, see pictures for condition. The Kick-Off system works great and after 8 rounds of skeet my shoulder felt like it could go for 8 more. Shot plenty of 25s with this gun, but it'll go great as a field gun if you want as well. Included is the original end cap with sling swivel and a weighted end cap that helps the gun swing better with some weight in the front. I prefer the high-visibility fiber optic bead on the end. The gun comes with a hard case, Cylinder Choke, Modified Choke, and Full Choke as well as a choke tool. Price negotiable, let's talk about it.Must show NH ID on sale."

Contact via email for photos if interested. Mags are $20 for the stippled one, $25 for the new one. Frame is make an offer before I destroy it.

It is a RARE 7th Series that has the short ladder sight, grooved safety knob, cylindrical bolt handle, and short cleaning rod. The stock has a small cartouche. There were less than 100,000 of this series made. Even fewer in existence now. The only thing missing is the mum. The rifle is 100% numbers/arsenal matching and has a nice finish. The bolt face looks almost perfect. This was an implement of war and used as such so it should be expected that it does show wear.This is a vet bring back so it is NOT import marked. I also have a bayonet/scabbard that goes with this one if you would be interested. Total for both would be $475.Local pickup in the Keller/Roanoke area available. If you would like it shipped I will ship anywhere in the lower 48 states for $35/ insured shipping.
