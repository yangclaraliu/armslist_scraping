Supposedly third generation.. Sigarms made the Tacops for Blackwater years ago along with options for the LEO community. Wildly popular they discontinued the BW version for political reasons (BW bad press), kept the LEO versions, and then flooded the market with civilian Tacops units which come in cardboard boxes or plastic cheesy cases. Four civilian mags in the civilian package are typically the Mec made in Italy units and are shiny. These real units are matte, marked Sig Sauer, and are US made. Civilian TACOPS are a black painted finish versus these waterproof/salt resistant versions. Factory zeroed 25'."

I replaced the oem trigger with a Timney Trigger (1.5 - 4 lbs) the oem trigger will come with the gun in case you want a really heavy trigger. The gun shoots great and is blemish free! I'll throw in a couple of boxes of ammo to the buyer as well.

To minimize recoil, the slide features a heavy profile which also enhances durability and the grips are Hogue soft rubber wraparound panels that greatly absorb the momentum of the pistol upon firing. Other important features of the 92FS Brigadier include the dovetailed front and rear sights that can be easily replaced by the user. Add to this the legendary benefits of the Beretta 92FS (M9), and you get a variant equally suited for home defense, competition, duty or concealed carry and more. Like the standard 92FS, the 92FS Brigadier is a double/single-action semi-auto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. When it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Add to this the extra weight of the Brigadier slide, and you get enhanced durability even above these specifications. Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92 family consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Inox finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning."

Pretty close to an Actual Russian AKM of the era. I'm selling my Egyptian Maadi MISR S/A AKM in 7.62x39. These were the last of the Maadis to be imported from Cairo, Egypt that were worth anything in my; and a lot in the AK commnunity's opinion. Not to be confused with the MISR-10 or MISR-90s; the MISR S/A has all Egyptian parts (receiver, chrome lined barrel & bore, furniture, etc.) and built in Cairo to accept double stack magazines unlike the MISR-10 and MISR-90s which were hollowed out by Century. Century Arms imported the MISR S/As without triggers, sears, hammers (the fire control group), nor pistol grips to comply with 922r. The bayonet lugs were ground down and muzzle threads turned down as a result of the at the time; Clinton Assault Weapons Ban to remove all the scary features. I bought this rifle unfired from the original buyer last year. I have about 500 rounds of TulAmmo 122 FMJ through it. I cleaned it after each range trip with only around 100 rounds each time. Only selling to start my own build of another Egyptian Maadi. Rifle functions perfect and has had zero problems.
