The grip does have some carry marks on it as does the slide. The grips can be replaced for around $40 if it bothers you. The controls, trigger, and slide have all been polished. I have the original 12 round mag and a 17 round mag as well. 2) Astra A-75 ""compact"" .45 acp. Originally imported by EAA. This gun was discontinued in 1998 and has become somewhat collectable. It is blued and heavy. The feed ramp was professionally polished. This gun is an absolute pleasure at the range. It's in great condition for its age and actually looks a lot newer than it is. It comes with the factory box and papers and the original 6+1 mag. It has fed everything I've ever put through it."

And “clone” isn’t exactly a fair description because this is a quality-made rifle by all accounts. It is in excellent condition, and shoots like it is supposed to, which means it's a battle rifle and not marksman's gun. I can do about a 3"" inch group at 100 yds, bench rest on a good day. I am selling mainly because my interests are going in a different direction, and I’d like to free up some room in my safe. It operates with a direct blow-back action, so it is not friendly to spent brass. One thing that I think is pretty cool about this particular rifle, is that it's stamped with PTR's original location in Farmington, CT, before they moved to South Carolina in the face of Connecticut's anti-gun legislation. To me, that makes it kind of collectible. It also has an enhanced recoil buffer, and the aftermarket flash hider you see in the pictures. I will sell this gun with the tri-rail front hand guard that came on it from the preceding owner, and a half-dozen box mags, most of which are original HK-made. There is also a clamp-on picatinny rail if you want to mount a scope. Please, no low-ball offers. If it comes to it, I’ll just stash it away until the Zombie Apocalypse."

At my asking price the gun comes with everything you see: 2 magazines, an almost new IWB holster and 50 hollow-point rounds. I've put about 500 rounds through this and it operates flawlessly, no surprise there. I've got multiple full size handguns though and with the cost of ammunition it doesn't make sense for me to have one in a different caliber than the others.I live in SKC, near 435 and Wornall, and we can meet somewhere in the area and in public. Send me an e-mail if you have any questions and include a number to text/call if you would like. Thank you and talk to you soon."

If you want to put custom 870 parts, most will bolt right on. In fact it is currently fitted with a factory Remington 870 stock.Unlike an 870, it's not $400 for an Express which will come covered in rust with a weak ejector. This thing is bomb-proof! The steel is very strong, there's no hint of rust anywhere. It has a metal trigger guard instead of plastic and the furniture is so tough I swapped it with a Remington set because it was just too dang heavy, but it is included if you want to put it back on.Also, since it's quite hefty it does a great job bucking recoil. Even 3"" magnum slugs feel surprisingly tame launched out of this bad boy.Why am I selling it? There's only space in my safe for one pump gun and I'm just more attached to my older Mossberg. That said if I had to pick one to survive an apocalypse, the H&R would definitely be the first pick of the two.So if you want a damn-near indestructible (albeit ironically Chinese made) 870, that can take all the 870 mods for HALF the price of a flimsy 870 Express model go ahead and message me. If you want to waste $400 on an Express that will rust up or $800+ on a custom 870 be my guest, but you will always wonder about this little Chinese secret."

The 870 Express is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it one of the most useful tools that an outdoorsman can own. The Super Mag has a 3-1/2"" chamber to handle heavy turkey and waterfowl loads that reach out to knock birds down at maximum shotgun range; it also functions with 2-3/4"" and 3"" shotgun shells, making it an extremely versatile firearm. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and swing fluidly on fast flying birds. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun - Synthetic comes with virtually indestructible black synthetic stock and fore-end that are impervious to water, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A premium vented recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes.Twin action bars prevent binding and twistingBarrel has a vent rib and a bead sightUses standard Rem Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube)Premium vented recoil pad dampens recoil"

Most sellers would list this revolver as new old stock, although we feel this revolver is well above most you will find outside box is not with tears and tape and since its 35 years old the pickiest of inspections may find something not to perfection so its being offered as used. Some sellers buy replacement boxes and transfer labels to make them look better we do not operate that way. The internal foam box is excellent and the paperwork is complete. The revolver is bright and there is no flaking or cracks."

It is unfired and has been properly maintained and handled its entire life. Most sellers would list this revolver as new old stock, although we feel this revolver is well above most you will find outside box is not with tears and tape and since its 35 years old the pickiest of inspections may find something not to perfection so its being offered as used. Some sellers buy replacement boxes and transfer labels to make them look better we do not operate that way. The internal foam box is excellent and the paperwork is complete.

Mount. Scope and mount are brand new! One-Piece 30mm Main Body Tubes Engineered for minimum weight and maximum strength and durability, Nikon builds these scopes from aircraft grade aluminum alloy and utilizes larger internal lenses for a wider field of view. Larger tubes allow for wider windage and elevation travel, and superior wall strength and durability.        Advanced BDC Reticle     The Advanced BDC reticle is uniquely designed with an innovative wind-compensating feature that integrates windage marks to the left and right of the lower sighting post. These windage marks are calibrated for a 10-mile-per-hour cross wind when the rifle is zeroed in at either 100 yards or 200 yards.         Fully Multicoated Optical System Multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds on every glass surface provide bright, vivid sight pictures and optimum light transmission from dawn to dusk.       MONARCH Eye Box Technology MONARCH 7 scopes feature massive ocular lenses that deliver a huge, exceptionally bright, high-resolution sight picture and constant, non-critical eye relief that can be used on even heavy recoiling rifles.       Adjustments Made Simple To simplify field adjustments, MONARCH 7 integrates Spring-Loaded Instant Zero-Reset Turrets and the Locking Side Focus Parallax Adjustment. These technologies minimize parallax and offer last-second pre-shot changes to be made with confidence.       Spot On Ballistic Match Technology  The MONARCH 7, like all of Nikon’s riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On™ Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on your scope’s reticle at various yardages for your specific ammunition and load.
