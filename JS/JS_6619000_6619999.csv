Mostly good-quality parts, because it was built to be a reliable truck gun (ie in a bad situation, better for the police to impound this than an expensive gun). It has an Auto Ordnance/West Hurley NY frame and grips. The slide is a WWII Remington Rand, but you can't look at it and tell because it's been polished and refinished. I think it's a Colt barrel, and most other parts are USGI. It's a gun you can trust with your life, but nobody's idea of a collectible 1911.Putting this out to see what trade offers I may receive.

The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver.
The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions.
The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger.
The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire.
The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines. THIS VERSION ACCEPTS NATO MAGS!"

Up for sale is my brand new never fired Mossberg 500 Thunder Ranch 12 guard. It was purchased 2 days ago. And I added the rail, an ncstar red dot, and a shotgun shell sleeve. It's all included in the sale. The thunder ranch model comes with a shorter length of pull stock which makes maneuvering in short quarters much easier. It also comes with the front foregrip that has a picatinny rail bottom and on both sides which you can attach a flashlight or laser. And lastly it has the monsterous door breached barrel. This is a badass gun for home defense and an excellent package deal. Of course being a mossberg 500 as well there is endless amount of interchangeable parts on the market. Longer barrels, foregrip, stocks etc. I never fired this gun. I upgraded from a maverick 88 to this. And now I want to upgrade again and can't afford both. $500 takes the whole package as is with the site, sling and  sleeve. I will meet at a local gun store and pay the transfer for my asking price.

Bought it brand new from Mega Sports. I changed the grips on it. I've been searching for the originals but so far I haven't found them. The wood grips on them are genuine Smith and Wesson (bought from their website.) The gun is stamped 642-1, but the box it came in is marked 642-2, but the serial numbers match on the gun and box. (I think its interesting haha)I'm not sure about the manufacture date, but the test fired casing that came with it is marked 2013. Comes with orignal box and cross breed horse hide holster.All laws will be followed.If this is posted, it is still for sale. I will not respond to messages with no name or contact number.Thank you"
