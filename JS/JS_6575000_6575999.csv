I'm not sure what to list this for as far as price with the current market but in my research on this gun since it was first released up until now this gun has never been cheap, even if it has been fired. I've seen this gun sell for $1,000+ in the condition it's in and this gun will only continue to increase in value seeing as there were only 1,776 of the pistols made. I'm only looking to sell this gun to get some of the funds for a revolver I have a guy out of state holding onto for me so please no trade offers, I'll listen to reasonable cash offers and if I get anything that I feel is a low ball offer knowing what I know about this pistol I'll respectfully decline.Keep in mind although this is a quality Sig it's also a collector's grade Sig and they're no longer made. It would be perfect if you're looking for something new to add to your collection or if you are looking for a top quality, accurate shooter this would be perfect as well. Serious inquiries only please and thank you! I also have 2 boxes of Hornady 9mm Luger 147 grain XTP ammunition for sale as well if you're interested. Please by all means send me an email and I'll accept calls/texts as well, it's honestly easier to get ahold of me that way: (440) 714 - 8336"

The world’s most elegant carry pistol family just added a new member. For those who emphasize extra-discreet concealed carry, we’re proud to introduce the new Springfield Armory® EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour. Back in 2007, the original Springfield Armory® EMP® set a new bar for quality, performance, and style. Combining the near-perfect ergonomics of the time-tested 1911 design with a new patented short-action, the original EMP® redefined what a carry 1911 could be. Among the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever. The all new EMP® 4” Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour model improves on the original by combining a longer barrel with a frame trimmed for ultimate concealment. The new bevel cut on the mainspring housing does a lot more than one might think. The rounded contour molds to the shape of the shooters hand, preventing “palm bite” during fire. For carry, the contoured shape helps to prevent snags during the draw and virtually eliminates the telltale bulge under a cover garment. Now, the EMP® is easier than ever to conceal. The new Concealed Carry Contour model features a four-inch, stainless steel, Match-Grade bull barrel with a fully supported feed ramp. The barrel is housed in a forged stainless steel slide with an exquisite satin finish. The slide assembly is complemented by a black hard coat anodized forged aluminum alloy frame. The front fiber optic sight facilities instant sight acquisition while the low-profile combat-style rear sight ensures a smooth draw from concealment. The EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour handles even better than it looks. Checkered black G-10 grip panels combine a slip-free hold with incomparable durability. Both front and rear strap frame surfaces feature our smooth, but effective, Posi-Lock texturing pattern. Your EMP® will come packaged in a premium carry case with three nine-round magazines offering a loaded carry capacity of ten rounds of 9mm. Check out the all new Springfield Armory® EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour. You’ll never carry a 1911 pistol the same way again.

I put my trade value in the $400-500 range. If you would prefer to buy, I will sell for $400 firm at this time.
