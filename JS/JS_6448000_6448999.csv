This is a beautiful 1998 ""born on"" date Marlin MR7 chambered in 30-06. In almost like new condition with absolutely no flaws, it has a beautiful walnut checkered stock inlaid with the Marlin bullseye, 22"" fully floated, crowned and recessed JM stamped barrel, almost flawless bluing, and a jeweled bolt that was masterfully reworked by Skip Baldwin in Michigan. It is topped with a matching set of Leupold rings and bases and a awesome period correct Swift Model 656 3-9x40 scope. Here is a brief history of the MR7, which is touted as one of the finest and most accurate bolt rifles to ever be produced:
The Marlin MR-7 was only made from 1996-1999. It was only chambered in .25-06, .270, .280, and .30-06. It features a 3-position safety, a bolt face encircled by three rings of 4140 steel, a shrouded striker and high-visibility cocking indicator. It has an adjustable 3-6 lbtrigger, A forged, machined and heat-treated receiver and an extra-strong bolt lockup. The Mr-7 has a hinged floorplate with a removable yet securely mounted 4-shot box magazine (The Mr-7B does not). It has a 22"" barrel with 6-groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It also has a classically configured, cut-checkered American walnut stock. The later (1999) MR-7B was made with birch wood for the stock and the MR-7B didn't use a floorplate. It was a few $ cheaper and in 1999 the MR-7B was only available in .270 and .30-06 calibers.
The Ring of steel around the cartridge and the strong locking lug bolt-face was mimicked off of the Remington 700.The wing-style safety was mimicked from theWinchester Model 70.The ""Dogleg"" Bolt handle mimicked the Ruger 77The floorplate with the detachable mag was mimicked from the Browning A-Bolt.
This would be a special piece for someone's collection or a super accurate hunting setup. I also have an additional mag for the rifle which is almost impossible to find available. Asking $800 sale or trade for the package, and open to trades. Thanks for looking!"

It was bought as an impulse buy a few months ago.  I wanted to be very different than everyone else at the range so I got an uncommon color and style. I had Tru Glow night sights installed as this was going to be my bedside gun, but I just never warmed up to the grip angles even with the multiple backstraps. It is flawless and unfired, comes with 3 magazines, all the straps, pins, lock, and accessories, and a lifetime warranty. I realize that I will not be able to recover what I have spent, but I priced it fairly so someone can enjoy it, and own an uncommon glock 21. Price is firm , over 21 and nonfelon. Prefer CCW license holders but you will have a Florida driver's license at the very least. By responding to my ad you are indicating that you are over 21 and a nonfelon. Lowballs ignored, there are plenty of budget items listed at this site so check those out. Sale/trade will be in the Northdale area as I cannot drive very far. Thanks for looking."

Made only in 1970 by Marlin to celebrate the 100th annniversary of John Marlin opening his gunsmithing store on State Street in New Haven, Connecticut.  A century later, Marlin created the the 39 Century Ltd., a commemorative version of the famous Marlin Model 1891, the world's first lever action .22.  It shoots .22 short, long and long rifle. The straight grip stock is genuine hand-rubbed select American walnut--fitted entirely by hand to a receiver that is machine forged. Like the original 1891, there is a 20"" fully-tapered octagon barrel, curved brass butt plate and brass fore-end cap, and a mint struck medallion mounted on the receiver and a commemorative brass plate mounted on the butt stock. This rifle is simply gorgeous and is in remarkable condition for a firearm that is fast-approaching 50 years old.  JM stamped and made in Connecticut by Marlin when Marlin was really Marlin.  Unsurpassed accuracy with micro-groove rifiling, diamond rear sight and brass bead front sight--all 100% original as it came in 1970.  This gun spends most of its time in my climate-controlled safe, but it does see the range on rare occasions and is a real tack driver.  This rifle will come with the factory original scope mounting rail (not mounted) and the unobtainable original JM marked trigger extension for use with an optic.  Also included is a 100% perfect reproduction owner's manual.  This is a heritage quality firearm. They really are not made like this anymore.  Sure--the new Henrys are good shooters but are made from cast alloy (some refer to it as pot metal) and then painted to resemble bluing.  Say what??  The JM marked Connecticut Model 39s and 39As are machine forged and deep blued, and this rifle will bring someone great pride of ownership for a lifetime. It already has for 47 years and still is spectacular.  PRICED TO SELL! Cash sale face-to-face in Columbus, Ohio. Buyer will be asked to show Ohio drivers license or CCW--CCW preferred.  If this ad is up, it is still available.  Feel free to email me or text (not call) me at REDACTED.  More pictures are available by text.  I am not looking for any trades.  Thanks for looking."

But, the reason I picked it up, was that the rifling was deep, pronounced, and the bore was actually shiny. Sold me.
-        I have hand polished the bolt and all contact points to a mirror sheen, as well as drill polished the chamber throat.
-        The front sight is anodized bright red, which is unique as far as mosins go, and does an excellent job picking up your target. It's not painted, cerakoted, it's anodized. Cool, huh?
-        I’ve also done the trigger job (like we all do) with the aftermarket springs to get rid of the typical mosin slop and jiggling.-        Also, like we all do, I've replaced the metal butt plate with a AIM sports rubber replacement.-        I will include a box of brass case Winchester White Box 180 gr. 7.62x54R, your choice of SP or FMJ.
 I have put exactly 20 rounds of Winchester white box (treating her right) down the tube, and the rifle was immediately cleaned, J-B Bore Scrubbed, and J-B Bore Brighted.
This is one of the finest M44s I have come across. You'll love it as soon as you pick it up, I'm serious, if M44's are your thing, you'll be all giddy and stuff. If you are a serious collector and want to know the stickler stuff (I believe there’s an Izhevsk stamp on the receiver), I can send you pictures if that’s your thing. (I haven’t ever cared, as long as the M44 is clean, functions, and is accurate). Of course, it will come with the Mosin pouch of tools the commies provided with each rifle, as well as the original metal butt plate.
 
Also, I have a BRASS STACKER SCOUT SCOPE MOUNT, new in box (I received it three days ago and haven’t even cut the tape on the box yet), check the ratings out on amazon, they’re $70, I’d sell it for $35, if you were interested in turning it into a scout rifle (My original intentions). Literally haven't even cut the tape on the box.
Also, if you’re interested, I have a bunch of Winchester White box 7.62x54R I’d be willing to sell at a discount, all kept in a dehumidified safe and pristine! I will be making a separate ad for those.
 TULSA AREA ONLY PLEASE! Not interested in trades at the moment, thanks!"

Glock 17 or 19 gen 3 or 4 with extras on your end. Im not a glock fan boy so i wont consider your $800.00 glock price serious. I live here now im not from here. Any glock over 700 better have some good upgrades and more than a couple of pre ban mags. But throw a honest trade at me and maybe ill take it. I just want to see what is out there. Rifles, shotguns, pistols or what ever. Have a LtC A prior and durring purchase and we're good. We can finalize it online or in store. Split store price down the middle. Depending on where you live, i can meet you half way or there. If you're far West, then you'll have to come more my way before i head out. Consider it a 60/40 if  you're far out west. Im in no rush to sell or trade."
