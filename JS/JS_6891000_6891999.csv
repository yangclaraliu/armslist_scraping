The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

This rifle is perfect for someone looking for a plinker, target shooting, cowboy action, or just about anything you could want from a .22!  It's rugged, it's got a nice smooth action, it feels well built, and it shoots straighter than I can.  It's practically new-in-box. (I can even provide the box that it came in if you would like) We have shot the gun a grand total of around 10 times, but have put about 300 rounds through it.  I've never had any failures to fire, and never had any feed or extraction problems that weren't caused by me trying to be John Wayne.  The manual and website states that the gun has a 14 round capacity but I've been able to squeeze 15 +1 into the rifle's tubular magazine.  All-in-all, I would say this is the perfect gun for just about anybody looking for a nice simple .22, with the added bonus of being extremely fun to operate with that lever action.
 
I would like to try to get rid of it relatively quickly for convenience's sake, but I would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have.  Asking 370 OBO.  If this posting is up, I still have it!"
