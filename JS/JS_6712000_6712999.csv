I bought many firearms at one time and something has to go. I have several AR15's so I am passing one on. This is new from ATI, ATI is the manufacturer that teamed with Ruger and Winchester for some of their tactical firearms, such as the ATI Ruger mini 14.   It is the .556/.223 Omni Gen2 Hybrid Maxx. It is lighter than all other AR's on the market, and it absorbed the recoil to my surprise, instead of passing it on. It is a perfect and flawless shooter and is in perfect new condition. Internet gives it 4.5 or better in customer ratings in all catagories and It surpassed all milspec tests including being driven over by a 8000 pound fork-lift.  It has proven indestructible. It is new except for one night of shooting (last night), and it ran perfectly.It comes with one ATI Hybrid magazine also smartly designed (but accepts all AR15 mags). And, this thing has a locking six position stock with a lever that quickly locks 100% of the normally experienced play out of the stock once it is in position. It works perfectly. It's called the Rogers-Super-Stoc and has teamed with ATI for this new design. (See Rogers-Super-Stoc website) I can't say enough good things about it but I also can't say enough about good green currency.I will always consider trade offers but I am selling it because I need to convert this to money. Hard to turn down a great trade though."

The SAS (Sig Anti Snag) melt, makes this gun as smooth as possible. No sharp edges anywhere. Very comfortable for iwb carry. Then you have the SRT, short reset trigger, that reduces trigger reset by 60%!  Also equipped with a very bright set of Siglite night sights. This package will also include 2 sets of barrels. The original factory 40 barrel with 3 mags and a 9mm conversion barrel with 2 mags(1 extended 10 round). This gun fires both calibers flawlessly, without having to change out anything but the barrel and mag. Also included will be a Alien Gear iwb holster and a nice leather owb holster with thumb break. This is a great conceal carry package, and you choose what caliber you want to shoot! There's about a grand here all together. I'm asking $750 cash, which barely covers the cost of the gun. Basically you're getting all the extras free. Text me REDACTED"

Sometimes it would fail to eject sometimes fall to load, sometimes I would have to push the trigger forward to reset it and sometimes it wouldn't lock back on last round. I figured the gas port on the barrel was too small so I opened it up a little bit. Now it cycles better, but too hot and you get some sparks out of the block. I think an adjustable gas block would fix it but I don't have the time to try and fix it. My loss is your gain. I tried various things including buffer weights, different bcgs, reseating the gas block, etc. I can throw in the adjustable gas block for an additional $40 of food the right trade.

Feel. Performance. More than just three catchy words, it's who they are, what they do and where they come from. It's philosophy that permeates through each and every unique product they've produced since day one. Pioneering the first drop-in replacement trigger for Glock handguns in 2006 was just the beginning, they now provide the most comprehensive set of replacement parts engineered for the Glock platform. ZEV Technologies products are used by top competitive shooters, elite military and law enforcement around the world. It's their job to make sure that they, and you, are carrying the best product possible. ZEV Dragonfly: The Dragonfly is one of ZEV's first cuts and it remains their most popular slide cut. This cut removes the most amount of material, while maintaining structural rigidity. Most often used in competition applications, the Dragonfly's windows allow for aggressive styling as well as enhanced cooling of the barrel. All ZEV Slides:  Machined from 17-4 Stainless Steel Billet Lowered Ejection Port Aid In Ejection of Brass Match Grade, Precision milled tolerances, that are tighter than factory Improved accuracy and grouping performance upon installation DLC or PVD coatings offered have a Rockwell hardness rating above that of factory coatings RMR cut co-witness  ZEV Match Grade Barrels: ZEV Technologies Match Grade drop-in barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened chromium stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in match grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures, while being highly corrosion resistant. ZEV Match grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finsih of 16 RA is reached. During this process, the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.003"" for consistency and accuracy. The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish. Barrel Specs:  416R Rifle Barrel Quality Stainless Steel Match Grade Drop in Barrel Final Dimension of +/- 0.003"" for consistency & accuracy SAAMI spec. Match Chambers  ZEV Adjustable Fulcrum Trigger: A fully adjustable, drop-in match-grade trigger for your Glock.

One piece aluminum design Smooth black anodized finish Kit includes magwell body, mounting screw, and wrench  ZEV Magpul Basepads: Following the 2016 release of Magpul's all-polymer PMAG 17 GL9 magazine, ZEV immediately went to work designing what they believe to be the definitive extended capacity basepad option for the magazine. Simply remove the existing PMAG floor-plate, attach the ZEV Basepad and reassemble using the same floor-plate.  Adds +5 capacity on 9mm Two piece design for ease of disassembly and reassembly Additional power spring provided  ZEV RMR Adapter Plate: The ZEV Technologies Red Dot Sight Adapter Plate for the Trijicon RMR is machined from 17-4 Stainless Steel to match the specific red dot sight cut.

The serial number places its manufacture date at around 1903. Since I've owned it I've fired at least 400 rounds of featherweight loads for cowboy action shooting.  This used to have a longer barrel and neither I nor the dealer knows when it was cut down. The barrel is stamped stating that it has a full choke but the choke was removed when it was cut. The action is tight and the threads haven't neede to be advanced in so long that the key sits at the second notch. This probably means it wasn't shot much in the 100 years before I got it. The stock is a reproduction that's been aged to look more like it belongs on a 100+ year old shotgun. I will be happy to meet you so you can check out the shotgun and be sure it's in good condition.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating pusher rod in place of the gas tube which virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. It uses the HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard with four MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails, and a machined Picatinny rail on the upper receiver. Major sub assemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. The thick, heavy contour 16.5"" barrel has 6 lands and grooves with a 1:7 "" twist, and is moderately swagged with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end for better bullet accuracy and velocity. A precise, enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1, and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle take-down pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56x45mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber, and functions reliably with most quality 223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components.

The neck is slighter tighter than SAAMI with a diameter of .245 and the brass necks may require a bit of clean-up for proper clearance, or the chamber can be cleaned up with a SAAMI reamer for normal factory ammo. Only reason I'm selling is I'm changing to a feather weight contour in a super light wood stock. I am also listing the McMillan Fiberglass Hunter stock this barrel was bedded into if a buyer is interested in matching these components up again.   Manufacturer: Hart Match Grade Stainless, Chamber: 221 Fireball (tight neck and throat), Length: 21 1/8"", Muzzle Diameter: 0.600, Breech length: 1.25"", Breech Diameter: 1.040"", Twist: 1-14"", Barrel Shank Thread: 16 TPI, Action: Sako L461 Vixen,"

See photos.Buyer must have Georgia Weapons Carry License (see below).I've sold a few guns through ArmsList, so here are answers to some of the most Frequently Asked Questions:- I’m in south Georgia; that is a 3 hour drive from Atlanta (over 6 hours round trip)- I'm only selling; I'm not looking to trade.- I am NOT desperate to sell, and the asking price is firm.- I will sell in a face-to-face transaction. I do not ship, it is too much trouble.- It is against federal law for me to sell a handgun directly to a non-Georgia resident.- I don't sell guns for a living, and I have a job. Scheduling a time to meet will take some patience and coordination, so please bear with me.- I'm asking to see the buyer's Ga Weapons Permit because that lets me know the buyer passed the NICS check. I'll also accept a blue card (Georgia licensed armed security guard) or military ID with assignment (PCS) orders to a Georgia base. There are lots of fine, law abiding citizens that don't have these,but I don't personally know them all, and --- in today's world --- I want proof. I'll show my Ga Weapons Carry permit, and I will check the buyer's permit.Thanks for your interest and for reading all this!"
