All parts numbers matching, but it's been fucked by california (launcher brake removed and thrown away, replaced and welded down by a replacement brake, launching sight cut off) so it doesn't really have that much collectible value. Bought during the rush for 700, I know I won't get that back but I kinda want to at least try to break even. The stock has quite a lot of cosmoline residue and though I sweated the stock last summer it's only marginally acceptable, so you might want to do a 922r conversion and use the tapco stock I'm including with it so you don't have to deal with the ickiness of the original stock. Not looking to break up the deal, what you see is what you buy. The outside of the gun and the blued finish is rough and faded, but judging by the quality of the bore (it's very clean) this was likely a guard's gun that was often carried and abused but seldom fired. despite the mushy SKS trigger it's a tack driver at 200 yards, never jammed on me once, internals are also imacculate.comes with 15 EXCELLENT QUALITY clips, selected from the best of about eighty other clips as the ones that are least likely to jam.some triple-compartmented pouch, unsure of the origin. can hold all 15 loaded clips at once.tapco stock. planned to do a 922r conversion so I could legally put it on the gun but never went through with it.an ak/sks cleaning kit.650 buys all."

(Does NOT Have the Drop Safe Trigger in it)The P320 is a pistol that defies comparison with revolutionary features that stand alone. The P320 slide rides on all-metal rails in a solid stainless steel frame for greater stability. The serialized unit lets you change everything from size to caliber to grip at will. With the P320's 3-point takedown safety system, once the magazine is removed and the slide is locked to the rear, shooters simply rotate the takedown lever for disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation. A smooth, crisp trigger pull and short tactile reset deliver heightened accuracy. A true Mil-std. M1913 rail ensures stability and peak performance with lights, lasers, and other accessories.

Includes one magazine. Asking $675Manufactures Description The Ruger AR-556 8500 is among America’s affordable, rugged, and reliable modern sporting rifles that are manufactured right here in the USA. The AR-556 has an A2 F-Height fixed front sight (adjustment tool included!) with Ruger Rapid Deploy folding rear sight that provides wind-age adjustments, and if need be, folds down to accommodate optics. Ruger’s barrel nut and Delta ring were redesigned for an easy one-person handguard removal and installation; the design accepts most carbine length handguards. Ruger AR-556 8500 uses a chrome-plated inside diameter and chrome plated gas-key inside. The overall BCG is then finished in a matte black oxide finish for exceptional corrosion resistance. To the rear, the Ruger AR-556 8500 features a Mil-Spec buffer tube with six position telescoping butt-stock based off of the M4 platform. Single-stage Mil-Spec trigger for consistent trigger pulls and Ruger’s own enlarged trigger guard to accommodate gloves. At the front, the AR-556 has a milled gas in the carbine length/M4 position for better balance and handling, meanwhile it features a Quick Detach socket and a bayonet lug. Ruger made sure that you have everything you need to start with on this rifle, made of strong aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging wearing a durable Type III hard coat anodized finish; and the upper comes with the dust cover and brass deflector. Ruger is no stranger to making accurate rifles and barrels, and the AR-556 is no different. This rifle comes with a Cold Hammer-Forged 4140 Chrome-moly steel barrel chambered in 5.56mm. The 1:8″ twist rate stabilizes bullet weights from 35 grains up to 75 grains. Ruger uses its own style of flash hider 1/2″-28 threads at the tip of the matte black oxide finished barrel. One 30rd Magpul magazine comes from the firearm."

Rough exterior but internals are imacculate; this was likely a guard's gun that was carried often but fired almost never, the bore is crystal clean and despite the average SKS trigger it's a tack driver at 200 yards. I sweat most of the cosmoline from the stock last summer but it's still a little gooey, so I'd reccommend a 922r conversion and putting that tapco stock on. Not willing to break up this package, I bought it for 700 in the rush and I don't expect to get that much back, as much as I'd like to break even.Comes with tapco stock, cleaning kit, 15 EXCELLENT clips (the 15 best from a stock of 40, these are least likely to jam or spit rounds), and a three-compartment hip ammunition pouch of unknown origin that can hold all clips loaded."

The Ag m/42 was designed by Erik Eklund of the AB C.J. Ljungmans Verkstäder company of Malmö around 1941, and entered production at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna in 1942. Some 30,000 rifles were manufactured in all for the Swedish Army. This was a relatively small number of weapons and the standard infantry rifle remained the 6.5 mm bolt-action m/96 Mauser.
After a number of issues had been discovered, including a serious problem with rusting gas tubes, the existing stocks of the rifle were modified between 1953 and 1956, and the reworked rifles were designated Ag m/42B. Modifications included a stainless steel gas tube, two knobs on the breech cover, a new elevation knob for the rear sight, a rubber case-deflector, new magazines and new cleaning rod. The Ag m/42B was replaced in Swedish service in the mid 1960s by the Ak 4 (derived from the Heckler & Koch G3)."

Whoever the previous gunsmith was apparently didn't have the right tools because the sights got kind of buggered up during the install, and some of the finish is marred around the pins. Turns out it also needs an adjustment screw for the aftermarket sear to ensure correct safety function. There is three magazines and two extra sets of grips to go with.

I am throwing in everything in the photos and some rare armor piercing ammo. This rifle is about 2 years old and has less than 200 rounds. Everything is original inside and out as it came from the factory. Flip up sights are zeroed and ready for combat. This rifle has an AAC muzzle break with three prongs and is ready to direct thread to an AAC can. On top is a trijicon acog TA33-9. This is 3x30 amber reticule with .308 BDC and TA60 mount. The acog is the same age as the rifle and were purchased together. It is zeroed to the ammunition included. This is the only acog that offers reasonable eye relief for the recoil of 308. A surefire m600iR vertical grip with a flip to side IR filter to use with nightvision. This has the two smaller led breecher lights in red along with the white light. Uses CR123 batteries. Then you will receive 7 factory original, standard capacity, Black and Tan magazines. 3 magazines are stun the box and plastic. The other four have been used and proven 100% reliable in this specific rifle. All these magazines have the ranger style pull tab on the base to make them easier to remove from pouches. Last thing in this package is a full magazine of the current issue 7.62x51mm EPR m80a1 rounds. Made in 2015 by Winchester Military in Mississippi. These are 20 factory made rounds, no reloads. This rifle functions perfect with this ammo. Make a reasonable offer for this set. I will not piece this out. I have more practice ammo to include for the right offer."
