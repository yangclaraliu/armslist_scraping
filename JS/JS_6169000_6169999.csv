It's a great little .22 and a ton of fun to shoot.  Minus the cosmetic wear which really isn't all that bad this gun is in excellent shape. Barrel has tons of life left in it and it cycles minus a few hang ups but I have a feeling it's due to the older magazine spring. Then again most .22's don't cycle perfectly 100 percent of the time. This gun comes with one magazine and as you see in the pics.  I no longer have the faux suppressor because I had to remove material to take it off but you can still find them online if you wish to add it back on.  I'm asking 275 cash face to face, NO TRADES AND NO TRADES PLUS CASH!!! Normally I'm open to them but I'm going to use the money for my next NFA tax stamp on my SBR.

Both of these have radiused bolts, bolt buffers, extended charging handles, auto bolt release, exact edge extractors (indexed with barrel cut), extended magazine release, Boyd's laminated wood stocks, and all metal internal parts most of which are the original Ruger parts. Trigger parts have been polished and lightened from factory original. Re-designed v-blocks. Scopes, rings, and mounts come with. Pressure pad under barrel over v-block and oversized takedown pins. These are sighted in and ready to go. I will not remove anything from these rifles for any reason especially the scopes.Individual rifle specs are as follows:HIS: Built on a 2001 Target model Ruger 10/22 silver finsh receiver (ser# starts with 252). Scope is a Simmons ATV 4.5-14x40 AO with Stoney Point elevation knob and Buttler Creek flip open caps. 20"" Green Mountain stainless fluted .920 barrel with recessed target crown.

Rings and turret caps were color matched to the Boyd's Baraccuda Bumble Bee stock (blue and gold), as well as a gold colored trigger to match. The stock was purchased unfinished from Boyd's and has 24 coats of Deft semi-gloss clear wood finish. It took almost six months to fully cure. You get a scratch or ding in this.......just sand it down and put another coat on. Barrel is an 18"" E R Shaw spiral fluted blued .920 barrel with a 10° target crown.

Browning reduced the weight by using an special aluminum alloy to make the receiver and designed it to hold only two shells. One in the chamber and the second shell rested in the bottom of the receiver. The recoil is drastically reduced from the combination of the breech opening and the barrel is designed to move into the reciever to give additional relief from the Recoil. You can shoot this gun all day and your shoulder is not going to hurt! This gun is  beautiful in appearance and the twenty weight reciever and the vented ribbed barrel was an upgrade from the standard Double Auto. These are the most sought after upgrades with exception to the rare colored reciever such as the green or red ones. There were only 67,000 Double Autos manufactured from the mid 50's and stopped production by 1970. This number includes the standard steel (7 lb-15 ounce), twelvette (7 lb ) and the twenty weight (6 lb-1ounce) models. The gun has a  full choke that creates a tight pattern.

Co., Warranted 14K U.S. Assay Hunting Case pocket watch made in 1896. The internal workings are made by National Jewelry W Co. In the U.S.A. The watch looks and functions wonderfully, and would be a great addition to any collector. B.W.C. Co. has had a very interesting history (see below), and was know known as one of the best pocket watch makers of their time. The watch is 1.5 inches round and highly engraved with a dove as the focal point. I have had the watch checked by two jewelers and a local pawn shop, all confirm the watch is solid 14k gold. Would like to trade for a nice Trap Shotgun, Colt SSA, S&W Revolver, or 1911Brooklyn Watch Case Co.: A Thumbnail DescriptionThe Brooklyn Watch Case Co. (BWCCo.) is discussed in the book, History of the American Watch Case, Warren H. Niebling, Whitmore Publishing, Philadelphia, PA, 1971 (available on loan by mail to members from the NAWCC Lending Library). Information on the company has also appeared in an article entitled ""The Story of Hayden W. Wheeler,"" by Howard Lasser, NAWCC Bulletin, October 2005, 549-550. Notes based upon this article will appear in brown. Mr. Niebling describes the firm as starting in New York City in 1865 and moving to Brooklyn (at that time, a separate city, one of the country's largest) in 1866. Hayden W. Wheeler formed the Brooklyn Watch Case Co. on March 10, 1873 to devise methods for the mass production of watch cases. Joseph Fahys was one of the original directors of the company. The company started out by making gold and silver cases, but production of the silver cases eventually ceased. 18-karat and 14-karat cases were made in some quantity prior to the firm moving to Warren St, near Fourth Ave. in Brooklyn.Brooklyn made gold-filled cases, and 14-karat solid gold cases, but is perhaps best known for its line of Eagle solid 8K gold cases. However, Brooklyn offered a Variety of Grades, detailed below. Sometime in the late 1890s or early 1900s, Brooklyn was bought out by Joseph Fahys & Co., a major watch case company who had been listed in Brooklyn ads since 1896 as their selling agent. Joseph Fahys acquired Brooklyn prior to Wheeler's retirement in 1891, by which time the firm was producing 75,000 cases per year. An October 1898 Fahys ad proclaimed Fahys the successor to Brooklyn, owning all of Brooklyn's trade marks. Fahys thus continued to use the Brooklyn name and trade marks.Actual Gold ContentA pair Brooklyn ads from 1909 give a glimpse into jewelry industry practices at the time. In a January 1909 Ad, Brooklyn proclaimed itself the industry leader on account of U.S. government assays showing that Brooklyn used purer gold than its competitors in its 14 kt gold cases, even though all exceeded the requirements of the government's recently enacted stamping law. The fact that none of the case manufacturers' 14 kt gold cases actually assayed at 14.00 fineness or better didn't seem to bother the advertising department who proudly showed it to be 13.92. Perhaps there was some negative comment at the time because an October 1909 Brooklyn Ad showed that five out of ten case manufacturers' cases assaying at 14.00 or better, with Brooklyn still in the lead at 14.29.Brooklyn: A Victim Of FraudIn 1898, a news item appeared in the trade press that may explain what appears to be misleadingly marked, or even fraudulently marked, surviving Brooklyn cases. At that time, somebody was stamping Brooklyn trade marks which indicated solid gold cases on cheap, brass cases and upon Brooklyn gold-filled cases. Brooklyn was forced to place ads warning that such cases existed and that the person(s) behind the scheme would be prosecuted. Nevertheless, cases bearing Brooklyn's Eagle trade mark were still showing up a full year later."

This pistol also inclues 7 facotry magazines, all in superb shape. The wear on this gun is fairly low as seen on the photo of the rails, but the barrel definitly has some ""smilies"". I took very good care of this gun and made certain the rails were well coated to prevent rail damage over time. The coating on the slide has a couple spots where it has been worn down by holster use. Other than a couple cosmetic things, this gun is 100% reliable. I changed out the old grips and main spring housing to a E2 grip set up. I also installed a short reset trigger and a wolff reduced power hammer spring. The double action is smooth, yet relabily strikes primers; I have never had a light strike issue. Im looking to sell this for 550$ to help with moving costs. CPL required for sale. I would also like to transfer at Precise Shooter in Lynnwood. They are a nice small business that I like to support when I can. They also have a low transfer fee (25$)."
