This 9mm chambered 11 inch Modern Series Barrel is machined from 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium steel with a QPQ Corrosion Resistant Finish and 1/2-28 x .620 full profile threads.  Designed to work with both Colt/RR and Glock style AR builds. Compatible with standard mil-spec uppers. There are also numerous dedicated 9mm upper options that work. Requires the use of a unique magwell conversion (Colt/Rock River style) with UZI mags or a dedicated 9mm lower with Glock mags. 9mm on an AR15 platform operates by blowback and does not need a gas block or gas tube. Threaded 1/2x28 instead of 1/2x36 to give you greater versatility when choosing a suppressor. Integrated feed ramp and barrel extension. Since the “barrel extension” is an integral part of the barrel, the length stated is the true overall length. For example, an 11” 9mm barrel has the same outer dimensions/length as a 10.5” 5.56 barrel. IMPORTANT: A standard 1/2x28 flash hider will not have enough clearance for a 9mm round to pass. Before installing a muzzle device, ensure a 9mm round will drop freely through the muzzle device bore.  You may use this barrel with a lower receiver that is a Registered SBR, Machine Gun, or Pistol. Possession of this barrel along with a Non-NFA lower receiver is Prohibited, except when installed on a Pistol configuration firearm.

Designed to work with both Colt/RR and Glock style AR builds. Compatible with standard mil-spec uppers. There are also numerous dedicated 9mm upper options that work. Requires the use of a unique magwell conversion (Colt/Rock River style) with UZI mags or a dedicated 9mm lower with Glock mags. 9mm on an AR15 platform operates by blowback and does not need a gas block or gas tube. Threaded 1/2x28 instead of 1/2x36 to give you greater versatility when choosing a suppressor. Integrated feed ramp and barrel extension. Since the “barrel extension” is an integral part of the barrel, the length stated is the true overall length. For example, an 11” 9mm barrel has the same outer dimensions/length as a 10.5” 5.56 barrel. IMPORTANT: A standard 1/2x28 flash hider will not have enough clearance for a 9mm round to pass. Before installing a muzzle device, ensure a 9mm round will drop freely through the muzzle device bore.  You may use this barrel with a lower receiver that is a Registered SBR, Machine Gun, or Pistol. Possession of this barrel along with a Non-NFA lower receiver is Prohibited, except when installed on a Pistol configuration firearm.

It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be.   The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT™ is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT™ from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT™ features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT™ features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT™ is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT™ includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT™ uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions. The SAINT™ is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory® low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with ½ minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation. The bottom line? When it’s time to protect and defend, trust the SAINT™.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this gun online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Selling my Nighthawk Custom GRP Recon 1911 made by RWA ** Airsoft Pistol ** , this is an extremely limited production and very high-end build…anyone that wants an elite Airsoft or Training Pistol this is fantastic…I had a professional gunsmith mill three top vents into the mill, this give a quicker cycling and also allows for more shots per magazine.

I can give more pictures and more details to anyone that would like them.
 
It comes in a custom wooden display box with the certificate of authenticity…I also have a custom Pelican 1490 case made for this…the foam was cut with a waterjet for a perfect fit. I also have a custom battle-belt made for this setup that holds the pistol, a Cold Steel practice knife, and 6 total magazines. It is made with very strong carbon fiber style Kydex, really well made!

Since then, Stag has quickly become a market leader and one of the largest firearms manufacturers in the United States. We value our reputation as a customer focused company very strongly. Since our start, we have remained at the forefront of innovation - first, by offering both left and right hand AR’s, and also by designing new models based on customer demand and recommendations. Our customer service is second to none with the highest satisfaction rate in the industry. All of our models include an industry leading lifetime transferable warranty and an infinite shot guarantee on the barrel. Unlike most other companies who purchase their parts from various different suppliers and simply just assemble the rifles, here at Stag Arms we manufacture 80% of our rifle parts in house. The only parts we don’t manufacture in house are the plastic pieces and some of the small springs, but these are still manufactured in the United States. This allows us to offer you the best models possible at a very competitive price.   02/24/2017 - 03/03/2017 $25.00 off if you have previosly purchased a firearm from us.

The pistol is semi automatic and holds 8 rounds of .22lr in the magazine. They dont pop up for sale very often at all and are somewhat pricey for what they are. Last i checked there were only 2 for sale online in America.  The condition of the pistol is really good except a few scratches here and there. It is a little picky about certain ammo. Some ammo strikes lighter than others and causes the gun some failure to extract problems. Other better quality ammo functions perfect and it will fire very rapidly if need be. Im not in any rush at all to sell or trade, im just seeing what is out there that someone would consider trading me for it. Its a little tricky to put a value on the gun considering they dont pop up often and dont have very much info about them online. There is a s&w 2213 which is the same gun, but a nickle finish and is on gunbroker right now for 400 and there is another one on gunbroker for 550.

The supply of these pistols has dried up and if you've been looking for this pistol, this is the one you want.I put this package of goodies together for collector/investment purposes. CZ 82s were once going for less than $200 just a few years ago and now regularly sell between $350-$400 on Gun Broker. Sometimes even higher when the pistols are in excellent condition. We CZ enthusiasts love collecting.My plan was to hold onto this several years if not a decade or more. Things change and I can no longer sit on this for as long as I had planned. Hopefully another CZ collector/investor/enthusiast can take what I have started, build upon it, and watch their small investment increase in value as the years go by, all while enjoying a fantastic sidearm. It is a great shooter and a fine example in the realm of surplus CZ pistols.Package includes all items listed below. Prefer to sell everything together. - CZ 82 surplus police pistol. Late model, 1994 manufacture marks. Matching serial numbers on frame and barrel. Century import marked. VG bore. Polygonal rifling excellent. VG+ exterior condition. All original finish. 92pts/100. Only a few cosmetic imperfections & very light holster wear as shown in pictures. I've fired approx 50-60 rounds, previous owner I knew personally fired approx 150 rounds. Pistol functions perfectly. Very accurate with Priv Partisan (PPU) ammo. Double action is smooth and only moderately heavy. Single action breaks crisply. Mag release works as it should. Pistol also has custom night sights.As seen in pictures, grips were replaced with brand new, unissued oem CZ 82 grips. Also, the original recoil spring was replaced with a brand new, unissued oem CZ 82 recoil spring. Original grips and recoil spring are included.- Zili Praha leather holster and magazine pouch. Very rare. Excellent condition, supple leather no cracks. Genuine CZ and Zili Praha markings. These were the same accessories issued to Czech police who carried the CZ 82 on duty. Both the holster and mag pouch were imported with this particular CZ 82. Holster fits the pistol like a glove.- 3 original CZ 82 (not CZ 83) magazines. Mags riveted to 10 rounds from their original 12 round capacity. These were purchased by me as rebuild kits and built to 10 round capacity. Magazine baseplates have genuine ""CZ mfg"" marks.- Wolff Springs Recoil Calibration pack. Includes 14.5lb (stock power) 16lb and 18lb recoil springs, plus three extra firing pin springs.- Pelican 1170 case. Seen in pictures. Like new condition. Waterproof & airtight seal.

OVERVIEW  X-Treme Bullets features copper plating applied electrochemically to a precision swaged lead core. The base of the bullet is also fully coated in copper. X-Treme Bullets are proudly made out of the finest materials available in the United States in order to ensure performance delivered down range with each and every shot. Our process starts with a lead billet that is extruded into wire. The lead wire is then swaged into a core. The cores are copper plated, then re-struck once more. Though not common in the industry, this restrike process produces a bullet that is more uniform, with a more precise diameter and a smoother finish for a better shooting and a better looking bullet. X-Treme Bullets Copper Plated projectiles are re-struck to ensure our diameters are precise and consistent from bullet to bullet and lot to lot.
