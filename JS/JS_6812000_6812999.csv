Technically LEM is still a type of DA/SA but not the tradition DA/SA as most would think. You have a VERY light pull to the back, you hit that wall and then the break. It's more like a striker but, not... I assume if you're reading this you probably know what HK LEM is.The gun itself has Meprolight night sights, and the HK 45 extended magazine. I also have 5 magazines, two of which have flat base plates for easy carry and comes with a holster. I've also got the case, the back straps etc.Some  would argue the P2000 LEM is the perfect carry gun if your an HK fan. I've seen coutless people say the LEM is the way to go if you want a better than a striker like trigger but still prefer a hammer. I love HK pistols but I definately prefer the DA/SA guns over the LEM. All of my other HK's are DA/SA and I've always just felt more comfortable carrying DA/SA over LEM or striker fired.I would like to trade this for another HK 9mm with that is DA/SA. Ideally I'd like to even trade pistol for pistol the P2000 9mm V2 LEM for an HK P2000 9mm V3. I would also concider trading full package for full package for maybe an HK P30 or P30L in 9mm. The only striker fired gun I would concider is a GLOCK 19 Gen4 MOS, I'd like to attach a RMR to one and have it be a range only gun. Shoot me a PM if your interested in knowing more."

It is a flat top upper but I have the optional iron sights and handle installed as well. It is a very nice rifle and I am sad I never got to fire it, I have heard very good reviews about these.
I have other AR and AK items in my other ads.

NO TRADES. PLEASE DON'T ASK. I wouldn't be selling it, if it were not necessary. It's that good, but bills gotta get paid.The Legion is the latest offering from Sig along the P226 line. The gripframe is a little thinner, better checkering on the frontstrap, better checkering on the grips (without being too aggressive). bright nite sights, 3 mags, box, papers, everything.    I've owned 2 prior P226 (standard and the ""Navy Seal"" models. This beats them hands down. I carry it pretty much 24/7. The thing that I like is that the thinner gripframe allows me to make confident 1 hand shots. I have medium hands. I've always thought that the P226 was great, but a little thick for my hands (with one hand) and for a full sized pistol. This is accurate as hell and totally dependable.  I've shot exactly 650rds through it without a problem. It feeds everything smoothly.Condition is really good. There is one minor ""ding"" on the right side of the slide (at the muzzle). Came from shooting quickly around a barricade. It means nothing. It's a tool, and that's the only reason that I'm selling it for this price. If you can find a Sig Legion for less, I'll match it. Period. Cost's $1,299.00 BEFORE tax. Call around to the local gunshops to verify.  I'll include pics.

New in box. See on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Griffin-Armament-Sight-Deployment-Kit/dp/B01MRVOEUGGriffin Armament is proud to introduce affordable Micro Modular Sights (M2) compatible with Picatinny rail systems. Griffin M2 sights offer an industry first, patent pending, modular base plate system. Constructed from QPQ Treated 17-4 and ordnance grade steel, Griffin M2 Sights were designed to be the correct product for every backup sight application. A shooter can use these durable, low profile sights in a 12 o'clock mounted application while having the flexibility to reconfigure them to ambidextrous 45 degree angle sights using the alternate and available angle plates. This flexibility ensures these sights can be used by anyone and will never end up in a box of undesirable legacy kit. The full M2 deployment kit includes the front and rear sight assemblies as well as both vertical and angled bases for a complete modular system. However, sights and bases are available separately for users who wish to buy parts as needed. The front A2 sight provides elevation adjustment while ensuring maximum aftermarket support for your favorite post, be it tritium, fiber optic, match grade, or otherwise. An extremely low profile, snag resistant, slotted rear windage screw, affords easy but more importantly secure adjustability. Robust spring tension of both front and rear flip up assemblies ensures accurate repeatability every time the sight towers are actuated.Never before has a product in this category offer this degree of flexibility. Griffin M2 Sights have a minimal foot print, and are among the smallest backup sights on the market. For a mere 2 and half ounces your rifle can be equipped with a durable iron sight system, to provide aiming capability in rain, snow, or fog, on or off axis without dependence on batteries or glass."

If you slap together a Franken AR with bargain parts and think it magically becomes worth $800-$900 then you are in. I will dismount the soapbox now that I have ticked off a good portion of Armslist users. The NAA & holster cost $260, Taurus 617 @$450 so $600 give or take in trade for the pair seems fair.
