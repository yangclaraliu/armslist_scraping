The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

In our opinion, it is also every bit the sight that the ELCAN is while coming in at $900 less. Both the PSU and the ELCAN Specter DR use an internal 4x power magnifier at the front to cancel out the fixed 4x prism sight located at the rear part of both sights. The difference is that the ELCAN uses a rotating prism design for its built-in magnifier while the PSU has a sliding conventional lens in its magnifier part. Another big difference is that the PSU uses a common internal adjustment system, while the ELCAN has a non-standard and for many, unpopular, external adjustment setup. The PSU 1x/4x uses German SCHOTT glass for its lens and prism. SCHOTT optical glass is the best in the world and found only in the finest, high-end optics. When set to 1x magnification, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view for rapid, both-eyes-open target engagement. When the magnification switch is flipped to 4x, the sight’s reticle is extended for range-finding out to 800 meters and comes in with a field of view a full degree wider than the ELCAN. The PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body and is shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics are sharp and bright with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The PSU comes with a Mil-Dot style reticle or a BDC reticle. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters and has a telemetric rangefinder in the lower right that provides height-based range-finding for a man-sized 1.8 meter target. The BDC is calibrated for the 62 grain M855 NATO round. The PSU’s reticle is illuminated by a single common CR2032 lithium battery and the illumination is not daylight visible but for use in dusk conditions. A definite BEST CHOICE! Compare the PSU to the ELCAN and you'll find the performance equal or better at a significantly lower price."

Of course it's a single action single shot, with an exposed hammer and  automatic extractor . The frame and trigger guard have good nickle finish, although not perfect, the original walnut grips look great, and the  wire stock fits perfectly but the nickle finish is worn. The bluing on the barrel has gone to mostly brown with some speckling. At close to 120 years old the springs are strong, the extractor works perfectly, and it shoots well (shot it  9-25-17). THE 5 DIGIT SERIAL NUMBERS ON THE FRAME, BARREL, AND STOCK MATCH. I have owned it for a dozen years but never attempted to restore anything, just wipe it down occassionally. These are seen more often in books than in person. It will handle modern .22 Long Rifle ammo, but the family that I bought it from used 22 shorts in a basement range with bullet trap. Unfortunately the gun was kept in the basement.  This is a prime candidate for a quality restoration if you have the skill or the right connections (have you ever seen Turnbull's work?). Price is $550. I DON'T DO PICTURES OF ANY KIND so available for local cash sale to Ohio resident only.

Black Creek Precision (BCP) has an interesting new take on SB15 Stabilizing Brace compatible AR pistol receiver extensions. Their new BCP Pistol Brace Adapter for SB15 Brace features a large spacer that creates a smooth transition from the brace to the rear of the receiver and has integral QD sling swivel sockets on both sides. At the rear of the spacer, there is an end plate and castle nut. This allows the SB15 to be placed against the end plate as intended while still providing sling mounting points at the rear of the receiver and preventing the inadvertent rotation that is common on many pistol extensions to varying degrees."

The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x56R (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable mag. The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification.
The PSL has been in service in Romania since the 1970s and is widely sold on the world market. They are frequently encountered in Iraq where they appear to be quite popular. The simplicity of the rifle makes it ideal for soldiers to use and maintain. The action, being a variant of the AKM's, is extremely reliable despite lack of maintenance, and is particularly forgiving of sand and other debris. The scope's reticle pattern is easy to use and makes range estimation quick and reasonably accurate without any mathematical calculations necessary. With some simple instruction an average individual can be issued a PSL and successfully engage targets at ranges that far exceed the accurate capabilities of non-scoped assault rifles like the AKM, AK-47, etc. Accuracy varies greatly, however, between individual rifles to a greater extent to other rifles in its class, probably due to insufficient quality control during the manufacturing process. In the hands of a capable shooter and with quality ammunition such as 7N1 and 7N14 a PSL is capable of 1 MOA (approximately 1"" at 100 yards) or less while the rifles on the other end of the spectrum are only capable of about 3 MOA."

The Glock 19 has been fired less than 100 times and fires flawlessly. It comes with 5 factory Glock magazines, factory box, etc. 
The InForce APL weapon light works great and is very small for how bright it is. It was purchased new for this gun, so only has <100 rounds through it while mounted. 
The Glock factory FDE finish is very hard to find right now, and the T Rex Arms lead time for holsters is between 4-8 weeks. This one took a little over 5 weeks to receive. 
*I prefer to sell to an LTC holder. A Firearm Bill of Sale will be filled out and I will ask for your Texas Driver's License."
