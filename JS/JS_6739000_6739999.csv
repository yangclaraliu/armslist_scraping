The gun is essentially a Remington R1 Enhanced that has been tuned by Advanced Armament Corp (who makes some of the best silencers in the world). The slide has advanced armament branding, and has their skull and cross guns symbol laser engraved on the side. The grips are special edition AAC G10 Hogue, with the frag texture. This pistol can only be purchased as a combo package with the AAC Tirant suppressor that is in the picture. The suppressor is NOT included or for sale. Please do not ask. This pistol is optimized for use with silencers. It comes with a threaded barrel and tall sights that extend above the silencer. This is without exaggeration one of the most accurate and reliable pistols I've ever shot. This one has just barely been broken in with about 350 rounds through it. It shoots on par with my Dan Wesson Guardian, and that's a seriously impressive thing. I am only parting with it to pay for some unexpected expenses. This pistol comes with two 8 round magazines. I do not have a box, but I have a zippered padded pouch I'll throw in. Must have a valid tn driver's license and be legally able to own a firearms. Handgun carry permit holders preferred. Must be willing to fill out a bill of sale. I've bought and sold on here alot. This is a great gun. If you are serious, I'd be happy to meet at a range like OnTarget and let you see for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Please feel free to contact me with any questions whatsoever, but please do your research and be realistic with your offers. This is a limited edition version of the R1 enhanced, I've yet to see another one in stores anywhere. Thanks for looking!"

So i just bought something that I could sell or trade for something that I DO want. So here it is, I am looking for a SIG P226 FACTORY threaded barrel. There seems to be some confusion as to what ""FACTORY"" means. It means that Sig Sauer is the ACTUAL manufacturer of the barrel. Aftermarket barrels have different threading and I cannot use those.For a cash price I will take $180 and no less.

The barrel has hardly been used, with maybe 100 rounds through it. It was on a recce type build, that due to time constraints only saw one trip to the range. The barrel is ungodly accurate, and whoever buys it should expect sub MOA accuracy if they do their job. Also included is a Daniel Defense clamp on gas block and mid-length gas tube. The clamp on gas block allows for better accuracy, and makes assembly and cleaning easier. The KG exterior finish was completed by ADCO firearms when I purchased the barrel. The caliber is 5.56/223 and the length is 16"".If you are interested in buying the barrel without the gas block and tube just let me know and we can workout a price. I am not interested in trades, and although I am open to negotiation, I will ignore rediculous/not serious offers. If you have any questions feel free to ask."

This is the Glock 17 Version and will accept Glock 17RD and 33RD 9MM Magazines. Comes with one 17RD Magazine. DESCRIPTION The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger or the .40 cal. S&W cartridge. Different versions of the SUB-2000™ rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines (see list below). By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model) or 9/16""-24 threads (.40 cal S&W). The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools. Manufacturer: KEL-TEC Model: Sub-2000 (Glock 17 Version) Condition: New Caliber/Gauge: 9MM"

I’m getting trade offers and there seems to be some confusion. I’m probably not being clear so let me see if I can clear this up. If you have a 4 or 6 inch 686 pre-lock with factory walnut target grips in excellent condition; I would trade this gun even for it.
However, if you have a 686 with a lock, has rubber grips, or it is a 7 shot; I would still be interested in it if it is excellent shape, but you would need to put cash with it to trade for this 1911.
Cash price is $1050 OBO
I’m in the mood to trade and here are some things I’m interested in.:
Smith & Wesson K or L frame revolvers in .357Mag. 686, 19, 66, etc. Not really interested in J-frames unless it’s a stainless .357Mag.S&W Model 39
Older(70’s) Belgium Browning Hi-Power
PCP Air Rifles. I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.
Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.
Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition.
Money can go either way. If we trade firearms I require ID showing you are a Tennessee Resident 21 or over and a signed bill of sale (I will provide). I’m in the Murfreesboro/Shelbyville area."

Pistol is in mint condition, 25-50 rounds fired. Original box is included with everything that came with a new gun. One 5 round mag and one 6 round with grip extension.
As far as the value; that’s up to you. This pistol is $706.58 today from Buds. Use that information however you like in determining a trade value or cash offer.
This pistol is in absolutely perfect condition; just like new. I’m just ready to trade some guns. Here is what I’m interested in…
Smith & Wesson K or L frame revolvers in .357Mag. 686, 19, 66, etc. Not really interested in J-frames unless it’s a stainless .357Mag.S&W Model 39
PCP Air Rifles. I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.
Older(70’s) Belgium Browning Hi-Power
Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.
Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition.
Money can go either way. If we trade firearms I require ID showing you are a Tennessee Resident 21 or over and a signed bill of sale (I will provide). I’m in the Murfreesboro/Shelbyville area.
I also have a S&W M&P40C Leo version, in mint condition, as soon as I get the pics and descriptions together."

The chokes I have for it are a cylinder, modified, and full. It has a rail system that takes 30 seconds to instal that comes with it too but no red dot unless you want to pay extra. I installed sling mounts and a shell holder on the stock, and i still have the original box for it. Armslist only allows one photo for me so if you want to see what I have for it shoot me an email, but please don't waste my time if you are not looking to buy or trade. Asking $570 or best offer, extra $30 for the red dot. I am in no rush to get rid of it so don't give me a bad deal. I'll meet you in any town within 20 minutes of warner or Wilmot and anywhere in between, but if we are not going through an FFL I'd like to see a license and preferably a CCL, but since they are no longer required it can be negotiated. FFL transfer is on me but only at a gun shop I choose, otherwise you have too cover it. Offer cash and I'll knock off a few bucks. Thank you for looking!"

The hammer-forged 18"" match grade barrel is perfect for shots anywhere from close quarters distances all the way out to hundreds of yards. To make sure you hit that target you are aiming for a Samson Evolution free-float handguard keeps your point of aim where is should be by keeping the weight of the rifle off the barrel. Other features like a Timney competition single stage trigger, a Magpul CTR six position stock and a SureFire muzzle brake make shooting fast and accurate as easy as pointing and clicking. All that is left to do is add your favorite optics and get out on the range!
