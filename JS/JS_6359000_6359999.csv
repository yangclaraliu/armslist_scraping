Browning Micro Midas firearms are designed specifically for smaller framed shooters. If you give a new shooter a long gun that is too large for them, they will develop bad habits in their form as they are doing everything they can just to hold the barrel up and get some kind of sight picture. The Micro Midas BPS shaves off weight and length (which can be adjusted with included stock spacers), creating a more compact and easy to handle package. As the name Micro Midas implies, this BPS is not another cheap ""junior model"" shotgun. The satin finish Walnut wood stock is as beautiful as it is functional, with detailed checkering on the pistol grip and fore arm. The vented rib barrel and the forged, machined steel receiver are gloss blued. The barrel is every bit the same quality as a full size Browning BPS, made with the Total Barrel Dynamics system, including Invector Plus chokes for the 12 and 20 gauge models and Standard Invector chokes for the other gauges.

I bought this for my wife because it has a safety, a decocker, light, smaller grip and is very reliable. I actually shot a few magazines myself and could not believe how accurate it is. I would say it is a solid 9 out of 10 and comes with an extra magazine. Will only go up in value.  There is not another one listed on Armslist, Gunbroker, or Gunsamerica right now.

I have over $750 into everything I am selling. Price is $500 for all. Cash firm, will not negotiate. No trades, wil not ship, Bill of sale required to AL resident over 21.

The metal is in 95% shape and the stock a little less.  There are several dings and scrapes from being moved around in storage through the years. Comes with USGI sling.  Contact me for additional photos or with questions.  Thanks"
