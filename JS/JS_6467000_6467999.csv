These law enforcements individuals are spreading lies saying children would be allowed to carry firearms under SB12, this is a lie! The NHACOP are asking every citizen to call the Governor to get this bill vetoed. This is very serious. Please make sure to contact this  organization (google them please) and ask them to cease using our tax payer money to push such a negative agenda. We need to have many, many people contact the Governor in support to sign it into law. They have been contacting Governor Sununu trying to get him to sway his vote.

I am really not interested in shipping, but it will add $90.00 (CONUS only) to my price if you insist.  Plus, you will have to wait until your check or money order completely clears my bank before I will ship,  no ifs ands or butts - PERIOD.   There are simply too many scams and cons out there for me to be willing to take the chances, so please do not even bother to contact me unless you understand and agree to my terms for shipping.  No trade offers please.  I'm decluttering. 
Sorry to all the real people out there, but becasue of all the tire-kickers and (expletives deleted) SCAMMERS on here now, I will no longer be responding to inquiries without a name, city and telephone number where we MUST speak about your interest and buying it.
Thanks in advance for your time and unterstanding.  All the real and normal folks out there are invited to have a wonderful day."

It has nice walnut wood with satin blue metal finish on the barrel and receiver. One of the most stealthy steel frame finishes, the color sets this rifle apart from other models, without the bright “Here I am!” of the brass and silver rifles. In the woods, where they’re right at home, the non reflective bluing, and walnut wood form their own basic camouflage that your Great Grandpa would have been very familiar with while hunting deer, and we like to think he would have been quite appreciative to have this Marlin along. Merging old with new, the profile is conventional, and the caliber is also long-established. The .30-30 dates back to 1894, and while it may be considered ancient today, the modern hunter can handle anything from coyote to deer, with the right load. It features adjustable buckhorn and bead sights, and checkered walnut furniture. The modern part comes from the quality CNC machined steels used, sling swivels, and a drilled and tapped frame for scope mounting. I work a lot of hours, but I am normally around during the day at least once a week, and can also meet at lunch. I will answer emails as soon as possible. Cash only, no trades.

Of 348cc, the new engine employed a single overhead camshaft driven by vertical shaft, and was unusual in having a very narrow crankcase, an arrangement determined by the existing transmission and frame design, which made for a stiff crankshaft assembly. Entered in the 1925 Isle of Man TT, the new model K did not fare well, all three entries retiring because of lubrication problems. Its engine redesigned to incorporate dry-sump oiling, the 'cammy' Velo returned the following year to score a memorable victory, Alec Bennett romping home in the Junior race 10 minutes ahead of the second-place rider! Second place in 1927 followed by another win for Bennett in 1928 ensured a healthy demand for Velocette's overhead-cam roadsters and prompted the launch of the KTT, one of the most successful over-the-counter racers of all time. Introduced in 1925, the KSS was the Super Sports version. For the 1936 season, the MkII version of the KSS represented a major redesign, featuring a new aluminium-alloy cylinder head with enclosed valve-gear, plus the cradle frame and heavyweight Webb forks of the new MSS."

Sells new at Dixie Gun Works for $400.00 plus shipping so my price for this unfired piece I've only used as a prop/wall hanger is very fair.   I am only thinning out what I have so no trade offers please.
I am really not interested in shipping, but it will add $50.00 to my price if you insist.  Plus, you will have to wait until your check or money order completely clears my bank before I will ship,   no ifs ands or butts - PERIOD.   There are simply far too many scams and cons out there for me to be willing to take the chances, so please do not even bother to contact me unless you understand and agree to my terms for shipping. 
Sorry to all the real people out there, but becasue of all the tire-kickers and SCAMMERS on here now, I will no longer be responding to inquiries without a name, city and telephone number where we MUST speak about your interest and buying it.

YES. it fires just fine even slam fire. the issue is that shells tend to get stuck in the tube from timte to time (mainly the last round) and parts CAN be found. I simply don't have the time for another project.I have a Winchester 1897 12G takedown. Best I can tell from around 1926. FULL choke and barrel was cut down to 20.5 inches long ago for a riot gun.it fires just fine but could use a new magazine tube as the last round will get stuck.  two parts that are missing are the screw/pin for the right side shell release & the takedown pin at the top of the shell tube.she is a bit rough and has certainly seen some use.would make a perfect Trench gun copy without feeling bad or destroying a piece of history.$250 or trade..any questions feel free to ask.thank you.642840135
