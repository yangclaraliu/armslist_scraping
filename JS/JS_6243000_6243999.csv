With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold."

It has a billet upper receiver, 16"" 1:10 nitride barrel, 13"" PSA M-Lok hand guard with Strike Industries grip inserts, custom engraved ejection port cover, and PSA Hybrid 7.62x39 bolt carrier with mil-spec charging handle. The pictured AAC muzzle brake is not included, it'll come with the factory A2 flash hider. The rifle accepts AK/AKM pattern magazines but is notorious for not functioning with metal surplus magazines due to all of the varying tolerances out there. The Magpul AKM Pmags are cheap and work best in these rifles. I'll include one 20rd (pictured) and one 30rd with the purchase. The lower receiver is also billet aluminum and I installed PSA's EPT NiB polished trigger. The stock and grip are Magpul MOE. The optic is a gently used Primary Arms 1-6x24 ACSS (7.62x39/.300blk BDC) mounted in a brand new American Defense AD-Recon mount. I have the factory PSA rifle box and the boxes for the PA scope and the ADM mount. The cash ash price on the package is $1,000. I'll trade for a Rock River Arms 18""-20"" Varmint A4. I'll also trade for a Wiley Clapp 4"" Ruger SP101 plus cash. I'll sell the rifle only (in factory box with one mag) with A2 flash hider and mil spec trigger for $700. Won't sell the optic until rifle is gone. The only issue with the rifle (not even an issue to me, I prefer it) is that the takedown and pivot pins are extremely tight. A punch is needed to separate the upper from the lower. That just makes for an unbelievably solid feeling rifle without the common AR-15 upper/lower wobble. This rifle has zero movement at all. All transfer laws laws will be followed and I strongly prefer the buyer possess a NC CHP."

While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform.  Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins.  Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a standard PSA A2-style grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style. Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim Keymod free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $950 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG magazine (buyers choice)."

Fired less than 500 rounds. The Breakdown lever broke off partly when cheaning the firearm. Being lazy i never replaced the lever. It's still possible to breakdown the firearm for cleaning. A replacement lever is fairly cheap. I bought this gun just as a fun gun to have for shooting at the range. Looking to sell/trade because i want to try out other firearms and because this guns grip doesn't fit my hand well. Two 7-round mags. Interested in handguns of any caliber or cheap rifles.

Harris is featured in the Cole Agee book on page 133 to 136. This pistol retains all of its original 1917 era parts, in which Harris has tastefully performed his craft with full coverage scroll engraving. It is outlined in platinum with an inset platinum arrow on top of slide. It was then finished in full blue finish and fitted with a pair of silver medallion ivory grips. Harris is considered one of the master engravers of our time and this lovely pistol proved to be a perfect canvas for this engraving style. Strong clean bore and fine action. It is in as new condition, having not been fired since work was performed. $8,000.00  Reasonable offers entertained. Not interested in trades."

These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim Keymod free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $950 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). *** Drum magazin in pics is not include with this sell.

As you may be aware the feds stopped all trade in new production ivory and even the old stuff is banned from sale if its not attached to a gun. This one is in 45 Colt and the finish and grips are in pristine condition. I had to put Colt under the manufacturer just because there is no place for USFA. No box . Original hard rubber grips included. I'l be honest abut this gun since Ive had a few questions. It has been fired . 100 or so rounds through it but I take care of everything like its my baby and it is pristine especially for a 13 year old gun. The next thing is that its $2100. You might say to yourself , ""hey self, I can get a USFA for a lot less than that"". You certainly can but its going to be without fitted ivory grips and its probably not going to be polished nickel either. Realistically This is a $1300 gun with $800 worth of grips on it. They were $550 when they were legal to make and sell. Theyre not now . Its a beautiful USFA Single action that you arent going to replace like for like with anything. If I sound like I'm full of crap its because you arent looking for a nickeled ivory grip 4 3/4"" USFA 6 shooter . If you were  you'd realize that this is one of the only ones in existence and possibly the only one on the market."
