The upper receiver is a forged DSA Type 1. The argie lower hammer stop (just a cross steel pin that was required by Argentinian law) has been cut out vs cutting on the receiver, and the hammer has been replaced with a proper Austrian one. The rifle has been headspaced using Forster 7.62 NATO headspace gauges (1.6355MIN-1.6455MAX) allowing for the use of a broad range of commercial .308 and surplus 7.62 NATO. Headspace was checked once again before this posting and can be demonstrated to buyer upon request.The barrel IS chrome lined. It is the original Argentinian barrel included with the kit. These were manufactured by FMAP in Argentina and are considered some of the higher quality FAL barrels available. This specific barrel was likely manufactured in the late 80s or early 90s. It was brand new, in the white, and unfired when purchased. Parkerization job was done by Schuff's Parkerizing. The barrel is timed and torqued properly.Rifle does have scuffs near barrel shank from slipping in the barrel vice. This is covered by the handguards and there is no rust to speak of anywhere on the rifle. Included picture wihtout handguards shows scuffing.The gun is 922r compliant when using US made magazines.

It comes with Magpul flip up sights and I installed an ALG defense advanced combat trigger that is really sweet. The pull is around 4 pounds and it has virtually no creep in it. (makes a huge difference in being ABLE to shoot accurately) It has an awesome Noveske barrel as well..this little AR pistol is honestly a tack driver. As you can see, it has a full rail along the top and is optics ready if you should want to install an optic. I had a Sig Romeo 4 red dot on for a short while and it was incredibly accurate with it...even out to 100 yards. I have shot maybe, 80 rounds through it so the barrel is barely broken in....not one problem with feeding or failures to eject. It has a Thordsen pistol stock on it..and I absolutely love this pistol stock. It is very comfortable and allows a nice cheek weld. The Thordsen has sling attachments on both sides as well. It also has Samson Evolution series M-lok handguards on and a Hex mag adjustable pistol grip that you can customize to your liking as far as the angle goes. I added a Fab Defense mag well and KNS anti-walk trigger/hammer pins. This is one very smooth well thought out .300 BLK AR if you are curious about getting into the .300 BLK. I have also included 300 new rounds of Ozark Ordnance 147 grain FMJ ammo with it. This is supurb ammo. I am just selling because I do not shoot it anymore have decided to get out of the caliber. The upper is a CMMG and the lower is an Anderson...as I said, with the ALG defense combat trigger. I am also including a nice UTG soft case with it that has plenty of room for the gun and various accessories. Includes one Magpul 30 round magazine. The .300 blackout uses standard .556 magazines, so if you have several with your .556 the mags are interchangeable, which is a nice feature. I would need to see your Tn. drivers license and sign a bill of sale..  Message me if you have any questions.. thanks for looking!"

They sure know how to make a good first impression: the Witness Polymer is smooth, reliable, durable, and just plain fun to shoot. But, as the ""Witness"" name implies, some things you just have to see for yourself. Features:  Caliber: 9mm Action: Semi-automatic (SA / DA) Capacity: 16 (17?)

The TRUGLO/Marbles fiber-optic front sight lets you draw a fine bead in low light conditions. This is what a serious lever-action hunting rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was. Quick takedown. Very quick. The takedown models of the BLR are unique, allowing you to simply flip a finger lever, twist the receiver and barrel 90 degrees and instantly separate the two parts for space saving storage or easy transportation, even in a backpack or hunting duffle. Reassembly is in reverse order and takes only seconds. Scout style. The barrel on BLR Takedown models is factory drilled and tapped for an optional Browning forward-mounted scout-style scope base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform, allowing you to remove the barrel for transportation and storage without losing your scope’s zero.

That's in addition to a rigid new structure making liberal use of high-strength steel and, Kia hopes, addressing the lackluster safety rating of the SUV's predecessor.Engine Powertrains carry over for 2017. The SX Turbo model uses the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which makes 241 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. The LX and EX trims again get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that's good for 181 hp and 175 pounds-feet of torque. All trims are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission and are available with front- or all-wheel drive.ExteriorBut the new Sportage isn't just sleeker; it's also bigger. While the vehicle's width remains the same, its wheelbase is stretched 1.2 inches to 105.1 inches, and the length has increased 1.6 inches to 176.4.SafetyAvailable safety features include autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and bi-xenon high-intensity discharge headlights. Also, Kia says the new version uses nearly three times the amount of high-strength steel in its architecture.Web : www.westsidekia.comPhone : 888-284-4718"
