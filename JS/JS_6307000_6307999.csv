The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in conjunction with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker that was apparent on the previous Model P99. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for extra security. If the firearm is dropped on the ground the gun will not go off. The only time the PPQ will fire is when the shooter engages the trigger.The Walther PPQ features a polymer frame that  has interchangeable backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail, low profile 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. The PPQ M2 features a resilient Tenifer-coated slide, a 15 round and a 17 round magazine, and 4.6"" threaded barrel.

Asking $200 FIRM or trade for guns listed below; really the main guns I've got my eye on. I also have a Sony DSC RX100 that can be part of the trade if you'd prefer instead of cash on my end (total worth of the gun + camera = ~$500. Can send pics of camera if requested).Really just looking for something else to try out. This one ended up just a bit too small for me as I only plan on range shooting & not concealed carry or anything. Definitely a fun little firecracker to shoot, though & certainly a great backup.Thanks for looking!"

I have every service record since the vehicle was purchased back in 1998 (I know the original Owner.) The frame has a full restoration done a few years ago- so it is near immaculate. Just recently did the timing belt less than 4000 miles ago, and also did the brakes all the way around.  The windshield has a minor crack across the width of it which occurred this winter. I took this off of my insurance so I never got it fixed. Your insurance should be able to replace it with a 0$ deductible. Rear bumper has some rust due to the age, and rear tailgate has a few dents.   Please contact me at any REASONABLE time at 5 one 3 6 8 0 seven one 8 6 via text / email / or phone call.

The gun is a government model with a 5inch barrel. It is a very accurate with a super nice trigger pull. Some of the add-ons include: skeletonized hammer + trigger, front cocking serrations, ambidextrous Wilson Combat safety, Magpul grips, and Novak tritium night sights. The finish on the gun does show some wear in certain spots but nothing that impacts the function of the gun what so ever. It has always run like a champ and has a very smooth action. The gun comes with one steel 7round magazine. I could also include one 10round Chip McCormick magazine (pictured) depending on the offer. I honestly cannot get enough of shooting this gun, but I am looking to simplify my collection and only shoot 9mm. I would consider trading for a glock 19 depending on the condition of the gun and any extras that may be included. Please feel free to get in touch with me for any questions or offers. I am also happy to send more pictures upon request. Thank you, Josh REDACTED"

Rifle shoots really well, no canted sights or excessive wobble. Rivets look good.Rifle was further modified with Troy Extended handguards and railed gas tube. Has a US Palm pistol grip that's more comfortable (for me) than the original. Also has the Rifle Dynamics stock adapter with a Magpul MOE stock. Also has a Spike's Tactical .30 brake. Has two removable rail sections approximately 2 inches long.  One rail section has the BCM vertical grip attached, the other I used previously for mounting a light.  Has the UTG attachment for running a QD sling in the frontRifle comes with 5 Magpul mags, 3 US Palm mags and a Tapco mag. Also original furniture, some Midwest Industries Quad rails, cleaning kit, original sling, and front sight adjust toiolMore pictures available at request."

The cylinder fit is tight, and the recoil shield shows no signs of being fired much.the only flaw is some very light, shallow pitting on one side of the cylinder. I assume this revolver was shipped in a velvet lined walnut case. It appears the revolver spent too much of its life stored in this case. Like many others, the finished was flawed because of this.There is no flaws on the barrel or anywhere else. I am not interested in trades. The first $750 gets it.

There is some pitting in the nickel steel receiver, this is common in old 95's. The rust blued barrel retains most of the bluing, no rust, and has a great bore. This old repeater has the famous Climbing Lyman rear sight, probably from the factory. The rear dovetail has a filler plug that looks like it's a sways been there. Teddy Roosevelt's favorite rifle was a 1895.Winchester he named Big Medicne. The 19-03 was the U.S. Military 'official caliber for a very short time. A guy named Spitizer designed a pointed full metal jacket bullet in 1906 to replace the big, round bullet designed for the 03 Springfield ergo the 30-06 we all know and love. Most of the 30-03's went to the Mexicans fighting their Revolution. ( we had a bunch of surplus ammo).this rifle fires 30-06 ammo through it's shiny bore like a champ. I have had this fine piece of history a long time. The stock has some dents, it appears that it rode in a rifle rack a good bit. The wood has no cracks, it's a rock solid rifle. I can send a lot of photos. It even has some black ebony or buffalo horn in it's forearm. It is all original. I saw one like this in rough shape for sale with a price of $3000.00. I would feel guilty and sleep poorly if I received thar much. I will take $1800 though, it is worth it.thanks, text if you wish seven seven seven 3836. I appreciate your reading this far, Eric"
