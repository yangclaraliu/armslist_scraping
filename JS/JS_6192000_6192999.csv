I need a precision rifle for a class in March. By no means do I WANT to get rid of my SCAR, but I'd rather not spend the extra cash when I could trade. Any trades will need to be name brand and from a company that guarantees accuracy. Extra points for rifles with known round counts. I will need a rifle, scope, mount, and rings. I need a complete setup. I will keep my mk6 and atlas if you do not have a scope or bipod to trade. If you want me to include my scope, I will need a replacement with mil/mil adjustments. The SCAR averages about 1 inch at 100 yards. I have shot several groups at 3/4 but most are at 1 inch or more. the biggest I've shot wasn't measured, but Im guessing 1 1/2. All shot with FGMM 168gr. I also have some ZQI 7.62 that would go with the rifle.

This revolver is from the early 90s before the M640 was beefed up to chamber the 357 mag. The newer 640 revolvers are great but they definitely carry like a bigger gun unlike the older 640 which keep the airweight dimensions. As you see from the photos in excellent condition, low round count, well taken care of. Trigger pull is exceptionally smooth, timing is exact, lock up is tight. Comes with Smith and Wesson box and manual. For collectors of no-longer-in-production S&W revolvers. For investors these will undoubtedly continue to increase in value due to finite supply and continued demand for classic no-nonsense wheelguns. Price is firm (it's well worth it).

The owner was US Navy Commodore Wade C Wells, who was Captain of Task Force 117 and then Commander of River Assault Flotilla One of the Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam during the late '60s. After leaving the Mobile Riverine Force, he trained naval personnel at the Naval Inshore Operations Training Center at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Sadly, he died in 2010 and was buried at sea at his own request.  The government had recorded the serial number of this gun as ""V90058"" and is on the included documents, but this is actually the assembly number inside the crane. The actual serial number is ""V436087"" and of course all parts match including the grips. There is also a ""US Property GHD"" stamp on the left side of the top strap. Condition is a little less than perfect as you can see, with most of the parkerization off the barrel, and smaller areas on the frame & cylinder. Also there is some rust corrosion. Most of these that were service weapons were sometimes subject to abusive conditions, especially Navy weapons. The leather holster is not included, but this information packet is. C&R eligible. SN: V436087."

The VP9 was developed by Heckler & Koch to meet the need for a safe, robust, ergonomically enhanced, striker fired handgun. Easily identify whether the firing pin is in the cocked or uncocked mode. Quickly view the amount of ammunition present. With slide releases present on both sides of the frame and a magazine release on the rear, bottom portion of the trigger guard, VP9 controls are completely ambidextrous. The VP9’s high strength polymer frame includes a unique ergonomic handgun grip design consisting of interchangeable grip panels and backstraps, as well as a dustcover with a standard Picatinny rail interface. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. The barrel — made from canon grade steel — ensures long service life.  The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into the VP9’s polymer frame can mount a wide variety of lights, laser aimers, and other accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9 is well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products.

Thanks."

This place belonged to my Grandmother and she is now in hospice. I don't want any money for it but will need it moved by the en of the month. I will get the listed measurements for it and pictures in the next 2 days. This would make a great Bugout place or hunting cabin if you have a little piece of land to put it on. Everything has worked on it for over 30 years. The owner of the park wants it moved so he can start renting to temporary campers/ 5th wheels. We did some calling around and because of the width( 12 ft I think) it needs a pilot car and a permit. The trailer is located very close to I-70 and is very accessable to hook up to. It is a 1970 Hillcrest 12x50  trailer. Please email back with phone number if interested. I will get some pictures taken of it. Thanks
