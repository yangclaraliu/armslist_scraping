This is a.32 caliber, self-loading, semi auto pistol designed by John Browning and built by Colt Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company of  Hartford, Conn. Despite the title 'Hammerless', the Model 1903 does have a hammer. It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allowed the pistol to be carried in, and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging.
I took it to a firearms store and they estimated the price to be $850-$1250.  I have the gun priced at $800 O.B.O.
New owner must be a Wisconsin resident, non-felony, who can legally carry a firearm.  A CCW permit will be a plus.  Thanks"

It was first used in later stages of the Philippine–American War, and was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911 for the original model of 1911 or Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. The designation changed to Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1 in the Vietnam War era.[1]The U.S. procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols in military contracts during its service life. The M1911 was replaced by the 9mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in October 1986, but due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out. Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.[4 Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols. It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and Bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons, because of the design's relatively slim width and the stopping power[5] of the .45 ACP cartridge."

Like his previous designs, he approached both Colt in the United States and Fabrique Nationale in Belgium with a view towards manufacturing his new design. Colt expressed no interest in the new pistol so Browning decided to patent and manufacture it only in Europe. The new pistol was called the Browning Model 1910, also known as the FN Model 1910, and was manufactured at Fabrique Nationale’s factory in Herstal, Belgium. The Model 1910 was unique at the time because Browning incorporated a main spring that completely surrounded the barrel. Browning’s main spring design was later incorporated into the Walther PPK and Russian Makarov pistols."

I haven't taken it down to check the stock. I would rate it somewhere in the very good condition ballpark. As as for accuracy, I'd rate it a bit below a 91/30 which makes sense to me. I honestly haven't shot it nearly as much as I have my K31 or Garand so I can't say exactly how accurate it is.

These KS-47s are an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The PSA KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). Would trade for a Sig Sauer P226 MK25.Can add additional items for the right trade.*** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell, at this price, but can be added."
