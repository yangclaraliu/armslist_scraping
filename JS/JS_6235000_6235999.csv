Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  Might trade for an excellent condition CX4 in 9mm that takes 92 mags or the PX4 mag version and I'll get the 92 mag adapter.  If you don't have as many factory mags(not interested in 10rd. or non-factory mags) as I do, I will need some cash, nice optic or other to make up the difference.  Might also consider a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 Gen 2 that accepts Beretta 92 mags or maybe even Glock 17/19 mags, but will need cash or other, since I can pick one up new for $450 right now.

The Echo Trigger allows the shooter to select from 3 different settings.- Safe Mode: Firearm will not fire.- Semi-Automatic Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled.- Echo Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also when trigger is released.  The Echo Trigger is designed with safety being the utmost priority. When the shooter is in the Echo Mode and depresses the trigger one round is fired, if the target moves, the shooter can move the selector to the safe position and a second round will not fire upon release.

For sale i have a Remington rolling block in 20 guage. I've done some reading that these were typically rolling block #5s that were converted to hunting shotguns for civilians. Very common for them to have NO bluing. Like this one.It is in good shape considering its not blued. Something else that was done to this rifle at some point in its life, it was given a fish scale finish. Which is crazy to think about because the past 40 years the family had it, it was never toucned. There is also a very old brass insert that replaces an otherwise raised peice of steel that assists in the reload..I feel this was done in the past 60-90 years? I have a hard time imagining it was done a few years after it was converted..Love the gun, and the mystery behind it. But im looking into making up for a large purchase into a compound bow.Any questions please fire away."

$560 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  Might trade for a CX4 in 9mm that takes 92 mags or the PX4 mag version and I'll get the 92 mag adapter.  Maybe the Kel-Tec Sub2000 Gen 2 9mm that takes 92 mags, might consider the Glock 17/19 version Gen 2, but needs to include a couple 15-17rd. mags and a few 33rd. mags, factory Glock mags please, not really interested in non-factory mags.

This is for a Remington Rolling #5 in 7mm mauser.The gun definitely doesnt have much of its bluing left at all it does have a patina and pitting, but it does NOT at all compromise the guns integrity its very mechanically sound. And fires GREAT. Just put 20 rounds through it after its been sitting in safes for 40 years.With that said, the rifling is weak. But this gun still had it. At 50 yards, with these wild sights, i was getting 2 inch groups. And thats with this things HARD trigger pull. They were actually known for that.. 15 lbs... Ouch..Its been oiled very lightly its entire life, rarely. And was cleaned lightly after firing."

It is a pure tack driver with or without a scope. As you can see from the pics, the gun has been well maintained and cleaned. The action is smooth and the takedown lock is tight. The only reason why I am parting with this gun is to make room in my safe for a brand new Ruger 10/22 Sporter with a classic blued barrel and wooden stock. If you are looking for a first gun for your children or always wanted to have one of these ""just because"", then this is the 10/22 for you.Included is the rifle, manual, child lock, 10 round rotary magazine, and carrying case. The carrying case itself is probably one of the most well thought out range bags I have ever used. My price is firm. It represents an almost 30% discount price over buying one of these new either online or at your LGS. I am not interested in trades or ammo + cash. I meet all Armslist buyers at Young Guns in Apex, NC. I require a valid driver's license and a CCW. No pistol purchase permits."

Hardly fired ~400 rounds through it, essentially just broken in and in new condition. Cleaned regularly and last cleaned before making this sale. This firearm is a great carry piece, handles 9mm very well and is a very accurate firearm, great for anybody who wants to pocket carry or for women who want to protect themselves daily. Makes for an excellent Christmas Gift. Included in this purchase:- Firearm- 1 magazine w/ interchangeable baseplates (LC9s Pro only came with 1 magazine)- Original cardboard boxI am asking $330.00 for the firearm. You can find it (though hard to find) on sale for about $350.00, however, if you bought it brand new you would need to pay taxes, FFL transfer fees, etc. In all, you would be saving anywhere from $50.00 to $70.00 or more by buying from me. The factory matte-gold cerakote is a nice addition and it will start conversations with fellow firearms enthusiasts.NOTE: Because I have had some strange encounters with strangers in selling firearms online, I will ask that you present some sort of ID to me (upon purchase) and accept and sign a Firearms Bill of Sale sales receipt with me (you, too, will receive a copy, thus you will have all of my information). If I get even the slightest indication that you are shady, odd or if you don't show up in time or change appointments to meet up to purchase the firearm, I will immediately amend my consideration for sale. If you do not want to sign a Firearm Bill of Sale or show me an ID, then don't bother messaging me. We must meet in a public place with a lot of passerbys. I will also insist we do it near an ATM (Wells Fargo) so that I can cash the money first to ensure it is not fradulent. If the money you give me turns out to be fradulent I will call the police. I am not trying to be difficult, I am simply trying to ensure a smooth transition of the firearm and purchase.Contact me if you are interested!"

We recently acquired this pair of New Old Stock Unfired Boberg XR45-S models with “Consecutive Serial Numbers.” The Boberg XR45-S is a mechanical work of art! This pistol utilizes a long stroke rotating barrel locked breech recoil system with dual extractors for its robustness and reliability. Boberg machines their barrels with precision tolerances allowing for equivalent and sometimes superior ballistics to common full size semi auto .45acp pistols. The locked breech rotating barrel recoil system allowed Boberg to employ a recoil buffer and slow cycle speed down by 1/3 of traditional semi autos providing substantial recoil reduction and control of the pistol. The feature that stands out above the rest is the ammunition feed system which utilizes a pull push system that pulls the round out of the magazine from the back and then pushes the round forward to chamber. The design is fascinating and fun to manipulate. Look for our two other Boberg models in the coming days. The pistols will ship with their factory box, two magazines each and documentation. There is one notable difference in the factory configuration of these pistols: one is outfitted with Tritium night sights and the other has white three dot fixed sights. Thanks for looking!"
