$700 firm in cash or higher in trade.  Or $760 with the Raven Concealment Magwell(cost $95+ new) included, cost for this pistol and parts/work new would be well over $1,000.  Pics included both ways.  Just let me know if wanting the RC Magwell if offering a trade.  If not wanted, I will just use it on another Glock.
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.

It's a project/parts gun       If you aren't real familiar with these Enfields, the stock is 2 pieces. In the case of this one, someone sporterized the front wood portion and installed a black Monte Carlo buttstock. The barrel and receiver are intact. It needs a replacement bolt and a magazine. This is a good candidate for either restoring or sporterizing. I considered making a fun sporter project out of this one myself, but do not have the time right now. The bore is excellent. I test fit a magazine and bolt from another rifle just to test basic bolt operation. It operates fine, but was not fired. Once this rifle is completed it should obviously be safety inspected. This could be the base for a cheap fun shooter or hunting rifle. These look pretty nice with a Monte Carlo stock. This one would only need the front portion to match the butt. I've seen the new complete Monte Carlo stocks on fleabay for about $70. The front sight blade is loose and will need a little attention. It will never again be a numbers matching rifle, so build it to your preference and enjoy it. This is a private local sale. Being sold in ""As Is"" condition. I'm willing to travel within about 30 miles of Fond du Lac,WI."
