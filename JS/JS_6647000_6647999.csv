Milled reciever, chrome-lined hammer forged barrel. I've owned this rifle for a little under a year, it was purchased in September of 2016, and I've put about 900 rounds through it. MSRP for this rifle on Arsenal's website prices it on it's own at $1450, but I'm including a number of accessories/extras for $1400. The accessories include a UTG gun bag, which holds the rifle, all included magazines, and a significant amount of random range things. It also comes with the Arsenal 10-round magazine, one Tapco brand magazine, 4 Polish Surplus 30-round magazines (fantastic surplus magazines), and one Magpul 30-round PMAG, with the metal feet lips and magazine catch, and the included cleaning kit.

It is in pristine condition. You honestly will probably not find a Model 12 in such an excellent condition again. I'm not saying that to be gimicky, but its the honest truth. I really don't want to sell because it is my favorite shotgun although I've only shot about 10 shells through it personally. However, my financial situation is forcing me to part ways with the gun. The gun was manufactured in the early 1960's if I remember correctly. The quality speaks for itself, this is a genuine American made Winchester shotgun. I will include various shotgun shells with the gun as well. I will only sell to qualifed and trustworthy individuals. LEOs to the front of the line."

The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.* #bonus you will also recieve a box (20 rounds) of PMC Starfire 380, 95 gr SFHP personal defense with purchase.  Must be a Michigan resident, 21 and fill out a 4473 and or have a CPL or pass the background check. To see the functionality of the pistol visit my YouTube Channel Walden Arms, LLC.thanks for stopping by!!269-788-460six"

It doesn't look like it was fired much but does show use over the years. These are getting harder to find and are excellent shooting pistols that really fit my hand like a glove. Made by Beretta on the Cheetah frame this one dates to probably the late 80's. It is missing one grip screw but you can order the same screw for the Beretta 84 Cheetah and they will work just fine. Really love this gun but needing money for a car for my gals son so things sometimes have to go. Price is pretty firm at 475 as these go for much more but make me an offer anyway, thanks!"

Would estimate that about 450 rds have been through this gun.  I'm asking 700 for the gun with seven mags. But wait, there's more! I have two original browing hi cap 15 rd mags with the gun.  These are hard to find and come with a premium.  If you buy the gun and want the hi cap mags (which I highly recommend) I'll sell both for 875.  If you want just a pair of mags and not the gun, I'll sell for $200.  This is a great deal for a premium firearm and lots of mags.  I doubt you will see this kind of gun with this many mags up for sale. The final prices are pretty firm but I'll also look at best offers too.  No trades for this thing. Thanks"
