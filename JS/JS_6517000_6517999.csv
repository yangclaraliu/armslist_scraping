This is a commander sized 1911, 4.25"" barrel.  White dot front sight, all black serrated rear.  Short reach trigger, skeletonized commander hammer, flared bearvertail and black rubberized grips.  That's how the pistol came, now for the customizations, all of which were perfomed by a certified gunsmith.Slide work: Back end of slide is serrated to reduce glare, 11 degree target crown blended into barrel bushing, ejection port was lowered and flared, the extractor was tuned and the Marvel cut was added to smooth out the action.Frame work:The fronstrap was hand checkered to 30 LPI, as were the front of the trigger gaurd and the bump on the grip safety.  Also, the mainspring housing, mag catch and reciol spring plug were replaced with chekered ones.  Trigger job to about 4 pounds, minimal take up and breaks like a glass rod.  The trigger gaurd is undercut and the beavertail was raised, making it incredibly comfortable in the hand and also giving it great pointability.  The beavertail was radiused to give it a sleeker look, as was the the thumb safety.  Also, the thumb safety, grip safety and frame have been blended together to be one smooth curve.  Again, super comfortable in the hand.  Idiot proofed the slide stop (makes for easy installation and eliminates the chance for the infamous idiot scratch).  The magwell has been beveled as well.It was recently Cerakoted.  The Slide, frame and mainspring houseing are Tungsten (metallic dark grey), all other parts and pins are Cobalt (metallic black).  It's a pretty slick looking firearm.  It comes with 3 mags.  One Springfield 7 round that works great, an 8 round ACT mag that could use a new spring.  The first round tends to nose dive but cycles fine after that.  Also a 10 round promag that I picked up in a trade.  It looked like someone went at with some pliers and I was rather skeptical of it.  It worked surprising well though.  Sticks a bit on the release.  As you can see, quite a bit of work has been put into this little fella and I'm asking a more than fair price. So no lowball offers please.  I also have a pair of Crimson Trace Chainmail grips for sale for it for $150. I can text more photos with details if you're interested. Thanks for looking."

Cool gun, but the original is a better fit under your shirt or inside your belt. If you are looking at this ad, you probably know how good the Springfield EMP feels in the hand and on the belt. If not, you should check it out. The EMP is not a 9mm mag and barrel stuck in a full size 1911 45, it's a 1911 pattern pistol engineered from the start as a 9mm. Mated with a 3 inch bull barrel, it's an ideal size for concealed carry. In addition to the standard stuff Springfield provides, this one comes with a bunch of important accessories that make the EMP complete.Having plenty of magazines is important, and this one comes with 6 factory Springfield magazines. I sent one of them to Log Man to have his custom flat plate mod. This removes a half inch from the butt of the grip and really reduces the profile under your shirt. Still a factory mag, but it loads flush to the borrom of the grip. A real must have.Springfield provides a plastic OWB holster and dual mag holster, but you'll want others. I'm including a black leather OWB holster with a mag slot. Very comfortable. Also included is the correct Galco IWB model for warm weather.Why anyone would want to take off those beautiful double diamond crossed cannon cocobolo grips, I can not imagine. But if you do, I have a set of black synthetic grips that I believe are by VZ.Round it out with the original Springfield case with all foam, chamber flag, and barrel brush, and you're ready to go.

It is in chrome finish and ready to install. You get everything here. Included are two working keys on the M3 keyway and the key authorization card. The keys are restricted to whoever signs the card and they are the only one that can order more keys and only with the card. SO KEEP IT SAFE! The M3 keyway is the Medeco keyway under patent so you cannot go to a hardware store and have more made. IT IS RESTRICTED. This is a high security deadbolt and is resistant to drilling, cutting and most other types of access. The keyway is pick resistant but personally working with these locks it is more pick proof than anything. The ring above the keys is a slightly used spacer ring and even though the deadbolt works fine without it I replaced it because I lost the original. If you are looking to keep someone out and need key control. This will do it. Most locksmiths can order more keys for you if you bring a signed authorization card and ID. Any questions please ask. This deadbolt will fit in place of most residential deadbolts. Price is firm but trade is not. Email thru the site or text me @ REDACTED. I am in Morristown and will travel short distances to meet."
