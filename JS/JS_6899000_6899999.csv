This pistol started life in 2001 as a hand-fitted carbon steel CQB custom-built to my specs by Wilson Combat and finished in black Teflon. It was carried daily, but shot very sparingly.
After the Teflon finish finally began to show some holster wear it received an extensive further customization & refinish in 2012. Work done included hand-cut 25 LPI checkering on the frontstrap and mainspring housing, undercut trigger guard, flushed & beveled barrel crown, recessed & chamfered take-down pin, fresh Heine boot ledge straight 8 Tritium night sights, beautiful hard chrome finish by APW with brushed flats & satin rounds, VZ grips with custom screws.
There have been less than 500 rounds fired after the refinish, less than 1000 rounds total. Among extras included will be a tungsten recoil spring guide rod, 4 Wilson 47D magazines with fresh followers & springs, and a Wilson Combat pistol rug.
The slide to frame fit is perfect and the trigger is glass rod at 3#. You will rarely see a 1911 this nice. I have about $4000 in this one-of-a-kind custom Wilson Combat CQB, I will sell it for $3250. Bill of sale with DL # will be completed.
I am 45 minutes from Hattiesburg.     Dave REDACTED"

I need to make room in the safe so here we go. I have a Sig 556 Classic. This firearm was purchased when the first came out. I changed out the crappy front sight it had and installed a nice HK style Sampson folding sight as I wanted it out of my sight picture when the Millet DMS-1 is cranked down to x1. That Millet DMS-1 is mounting using my favorite piece of gear! A LaRue LT-104 SPR mount. This QD mount and rings all in one is rock solid with QD removing and reinstalling the optic with perfect return to zero. I also changed out grip as I didn’t like the factory model. There aren’t many choices so I went with Houge. It’s very comfortable. I then installed an YHM Q.D. Phantom Brake which is compatible with all YHM QD suppressors. This rifle was a tremendous suppressor host as the piston can be adjusted to lessen gas and there is no clear path for gas to your face so its way less gassy than regular DI AR.
 
 
Price is $1550 FTF (Nash Co. outside Raleigh, NC) or you pay shipping cost. If your dealer needs FFL then that adds $25 to cost of shipping. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions.

Note that all original parts, which have been replaced as part of the aforementioned upgrades, are included with purchase.The only trades that I currently have any interest in are 1911 handguns.

This is the smaller framed 1911 with the 3.5 barrel and feautures a decocker, when the trigger is squeezed with the safety on, then the safety is turned off it will drop the hammer to decock it. The gun is in good shape, Cabelas here in garner said its 90%. It shoots great and is really a great feeling 1911. I bought this from the original owner who bought it in 1986. Comes the two oringal colt magazines and extra pachmayr grips on it and the original colt grips in a soft case. I do not have the original box.
