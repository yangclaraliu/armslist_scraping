I got it for my wife to carry and although she loves it, she has never carried it. Actually, it has never been carried. It is like new and the frame is in the rare flat dark earth with a stainless slide. It also has an ambi safety.  I was curious as to how it shot so I did shot about 50 rounds of .380 ball through it. It shoots like a dream with very manageable recoil. It is a small pistol and will fit in the palm of your hand..thus not a targer pistol , perse. I shot it at 10 yards and 15 yards and had amazingly tight groups (around 2 inches to point of aim). That is great group size for a pistol this size...and that was with PMC 90 grain FMJ ammo. It would make a great little pocket pistol in the right holster, or a very discreet belt carry or inside waist band. Comes with original blue plastic box and all paperwork, as well as an extra magazine with plastic extension to wrap your little finger around. It is, for its size and light weight, a very comfortable and fun gun to shoot. I will ask to see your Tennessee drivers license and sign a bill of sale. Prefer to deal with carry permit folks. Thanks for looking!"

The Kadet adapter features all-steel construction and an adjustable rear sight.Included are (2) 10-round magazines that fit flush with grips of the full size CZ 75 and SP-01 models. The Kadet conversion kit will work on the CZ 75 full-size and compact models including the 75, 85, SP-01, 75 Compact, P-01, P-06, and PCR, but note that the full-size magazines will extend out of the bottom of the shorter grips on these models. The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models. Pre-B model 75s may or may not function with the Kadet due to differing magwell dimensions.When used on an aluminum-framed compact model (PCR, P-01 and P-06) as well as the steel-framed Compact .40, a specific slide-stop is required for proper last-round hold-open (part number REDACTED, available at no charge through our parts department). On 85 models, the 85 slide stop must be used but will not enable last-round hold-open.When used in competition-oriented or modified 75 series pistols like the Shadow, a factory-weight 75 mainspring may be required to provide proper primer ignition.The above description is from CZ directly and photos are stock photos.   ****No trades at this time****"

Not too picky as long as it works well. Girlfriend shot a 22 converted AR and now she needs something similar in her life to replace me I guess. Anyways, I digress. Here's what I've got.-Wards Western model 30 (Stevens 520) shotgun in 16ga with a couple boxes of practice ammo.      Bought this from a gentleman a while back, pistol-gripped the stock and cut the barrel down to legal length. Also has a tru-glo front sight to replace the one I cut. Took my time to try and make it look nice too. This thing is short, mean, and not for the faint of heart. Pump is a little finicky sometimes too but shoots well considering its probably from the 30's. You can also slam fire if you so desire.-Chiappa M9-22 (Baretta M9 replica)      Comes with 2 mags and a case. This won't shoot golden bullet but is a fun little bugger. I just never use it.-Beeman 22cal break barrel pellet gun      Bought when I was too young to buy a real firearm. Comes with a lot of ammo. I repainted it in urban tiger stripe camo because I can.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

Honestly, this is the nicest Chilean Mauser I have ever seen.  The only reason I am selling/trading it because I am trying to consolidate calibres.Feel free to text me at 219-363-5044.  Thanks :)

BILL OF SALE IS REQUIRED:This rifle requires a bill of sale.  I use the ATF form 4473.  However, I do not require that you provide your social security number or drivers license number on the form, but I do insist that you provide the rest of the information on the form along with filling out the questions on the form.  The form 4473 is the same form you fill out when you purchase a gun from a gun store.  I will be comparing the completed form to your drivers license.OPEN TO TRADES:Swiss K31Swiss K11Swedish Mauser M38Swedish Mauser M94Persian MauserOther Mausers in 8MMAR-15Rifles in 6.5 Swedish Mauser CaliberOther Rifles? Pistols I would be interested in:Glock 19*Obviously I would be willing to include cash in some of these trades :)

WHERE DO WE MEET:I can meet you at the Wal-Mart parking lot on 3221 W 86th St, Indianapolis, IN 46268.  Please bring your own bore light [I have lost mine :( ].  The gun will be in my trunk, so we will have privacy and discretion in handling the rifle.  I have a blanket to cover the gun when it is being transported from my car to yours."

The Can Cannon is a patent pending launching device for soda cans, tennis balls and other round thin walled objects. A proprietary gas ported barrel and pressure tube reduce the exposure to high pressure gasses which could destroy relatively delicate projectiles. The Can Cannon is currently configured for launching full, un-opened 12oz soda and beer cans. When used with standard mil spec blanks and fired at an optimum angle it can reach an average distance of 105 yards! Why launch soda cans instead of drinking them? Because you can! Projectile options are only limited by your creativity and local laws. Our BATFE approved design is not considered a Destructive Device or firearm.This is sold as an assembled upper with receiver, headspaced and mounted ported barrel, and pressure tube. The system is compatible with any AR-15 mil standard bolt and most piston bolts. You can purchase this by itself for the price of 350.00 (25.00 Shipping if out of Missouri but within the other 47 connected United States) If you live outside that area, ask for shipping costs. I also have the milspec blanks that are 38.00 per 100, and I only have 100 left.So if you are interested, please let me know. If this ad is up, it is still for sale.

Leavenworth, Kansas City, Kansas",FREE,"Listed On: Thursday, April 27, 2017",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling Two of my AK kits. I didn’t want to sell these now, but I need the funds, so here they are.First is a Polish Tantal kit that I got about six months ago. It still needs to be demilled. It is great looking, all numbers matching kit. I have added a virgin US barrel, and a 80% receiver with the rails. All you will need to complete this build is a rivet set. I am asking $460 for everything for this kit. The other Tantal kits you will find are priced higher than this, without a receiver. Red pistol grip has been swapped out for a matching orange color.Last is a milled Yugo M72 kit that I have taken a lot of time to get as close to the M72ab1 model. As it is pictured all it is missing is the UF safety and of course the bipod. I found a safety leaver and have it coming, which if I sell this, it will be included. I also have an extra upper handguard that will be thrown in. I have several receiver pieces that should be enough for a complete reweld on this one. I may have an original finned barrel that I will include. The lower handguard has a small dent at the right side rearmost vent, but it does not affect the fit/finish at all. This will make an AWESOME RPK when finished, as close to the rare ab models that no one can get anymore. I am asking $700 for this one, which is less than I have in it. $700 includes the barrel, which are upwards of $300 alone now.I will also break up the kit into the numbers matching kit with receiver pieces, the under fold stock with stub, and the barrel. If you are interested let me know and we can discuss prices."

I have fired about 200 rounds through the rifle, so it is just broke in now. I was going to take it hunting for small game, but after doing some research I believe I would prefer hunting with a bolt action .17HMR. That is the only reason I'm considering getting rid of this gun. It functions perfectly as the day I took it out of the box (which I still have as well). I do not have the scope mount that came with it from the factory, but I do still have the screws for whatever top rail you choose to put on it if you decide to scope it. The bluing on the gun is still in excellent condition with absolutely no rust whatsoever. I have disassembled the rifle down to the individual springs to perform a complete and thorough cleaning, and have test fired it since then as well. I have about 800 rounds of ammo (a mix of Remington, CCI mini mags, CCI stingers, and Winchester), 3 BX-25 mags, and 1 BX-10 mag to throw in with it. If you're wanting all the accessories with the rifle then I'm asking an extra $100 which would make the total asking price $350 for the gun with all the accessories. ($50 for the ammo, $15 per BX-25 magazine, and $5 for the BX-10 magazine) If you want to consider trading then I'm mainly intersted in small game hunting calibers such as the .22WMR or the .17HMR in a bolt action setup. Let me know what you have, and the worst I can say is no. I will not ship this firearm, so this deal will have to involve a local pickup only."

It began production in 1989 and is a relatively conventional short recoil Browning-style-locking pistol. What makes it unique is the trigger. It can be fired in single action, double action and a third action called Fast Action (also called Triple Action or Double Action Plus+). In this third action the trigger has the same length of pull as double action but the trigger weight is the same as single action, giving some of the safety of double action with the accuracy benefits of single action.The pistol is in great condition and just looking for something cool to replace it with. If if the price is right I might sell. Let me me know what you have. 400 obo Thanks for looking."
