This Colt is in very nice condition, with little wear or markings and only 600-800 rounds fired. It comes with the original serial matched box, weapon bag and Colt manual. This particular AR was made not long after the '94 Assault Weapons Ban, but has pre-ban features without the LE restricted markings on later production models. That makes this model rather unique and collectible, especially in such great condition. Most Government Carbines from the post '94 period you'll find will come from Law Enforcement/Gov Agencies and are in poor condition with lots of wear and rack marks. It features a 16"" barrel marked C MP 5.56 NATO 1/7, standard A2 front and rear adjustable sights, a 4 position M4 stock, dual heatshield M4 handguards, tactical latch on the charging handle and side sling mounts on the front sight and stock. It comes with 2 brand new 30rnd USGI mags (D&H Industries) upgraded with Magpul anti-tilt followers and I will also throw in 2 original Magpuls in your choice of black or FDE. Price: $950 or Best Offer. -Sold Pending Funds-Shipping: Although I prefer a local sale, I am willing to ship to your FFL.

This fine pistol has been well cared for and not shot much since I bought it brand new. It has been kept in my safe, and only shot perhaps 50 rounds total in its lifetime. I did find it to be incredibily accurate, shooting its first ever magazine of factory ammo into a group so small that I photographed it and still show it off today. Check out the third photo, this weapon shot Group #2 at 10 yards free hand with no rest. These were its first 8 shots ever! Group #1 was shot with a Glock 30SF.
The pistol comes with everything that came with it new. I'm only selling it because I have two equally awesome Commanders. The pistol can be seen a my office in Homestead by appointment, no parking lot deals, so please don't ask. I'm willing to listen to reasonable best offers and consider partial trades. All laws will be complied with in this sale, so if you don't have proper ID, please don't respond. Thanks for looking at my listing."

Indeed, the Army had many of the earlier bayonets cold pressed to reduce the socket diameter to fit the ’73 Springfield. It’s the first US bayonet to be blued, and I think it’s the last of the US Army standard issue socket bayonets. It is marked with a “US” at the base of the blade. This bayonet is free from rust.The scabbard shown is the 1887 version for the 1873 bayonet, with a brass hook permanently attached leather frog instead of a belt loop. This was intended to be inserted through one of the loops in the Mills woven cartridge belt. Scabbards are hard to find in good condition, and this one is in good condition. Leather intact and still relatively supple. Asking $100.00 cash. This is a great price for this, so please, do not email with other offers. Thanks for looking!"

Top of the line model. Hard to say one is flawless, but I cannot find a mark on it. Topped with the original iron sights, a DNZ scope mount(not cheap) and a brand new Centerpoint 4-16 X40 IR scope. Gun is at least 99%, and only thing that keeps it from being mint is that I do not have the original box. Not giving this one away, but it can be bought or traded for. Cash is $550.00, trade value around $575-$600. Yes, that is a little more than these normally sell for, but this one is exceptional quality. I doubt it has ever seen the woods."

Its same size as a Glock 19 but ahead in Quality. It comes in the CZ case with all accessories and includes FIVE, 14 round mags!  VERY accurate and reliable. I put a few mags thru it to try it out. NICE!!! This gun also has a NATO serial number stamped on one side. I think it means that it is approved by the Czech Military for their use.  $550.00 cash or $600.00 trade value -- FIRM.  NO SHIPPING! FTF only in Tampa.  Thanks for looking.  God Bless."
