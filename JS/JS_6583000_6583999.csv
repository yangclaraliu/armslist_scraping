Used by mostly Finnish and Swedish armies, it was also widely exported into Baltic countries, some European and South American countries. Although manufacturing of the Suomi in Finland ceased in 1944, it was widely used throughout the world well into the 1990’s. This Suomi M31 has been converted to Semi-Automatic and fires 9mm parabellum rounds and comes with a 36 round stick magazine, 2 drum magazines and original sling. These are out of production and will not be produced again.This rifle is in excellent condition and has been well cared for. Bore is bright and shiney, and stock is in great shape. Beat-up Suomis go for $900 on GUNBROKER (without a single drum magazine). There are currently on 2 other M31s listed on ARMSLIST."

The “SKS D” rifles were regular Chinese SKS56 rifles that were converted to accept AK mags by Midwest Ordnance in Nebraska. The SKS 30 rifles are much less common, with less than 7k ever imported, and a great addition to any SKS collection.
The SKS 30 rifles also feature a quick detachable folding bayonet that can be completely removed from the rifle. This is a feature unique to SKS 30 rifles.Shipping is accepted... shipping fee cost for $35"

Hostage Target Video We want you to be safe!  When using steel targets safe shooting distances are as follows:  Handguns - 15 yards or greater, Rifles - 100 yards or greater. Steel targets should never be shot with a 50 BMG or steel core bullets. Any bullet with steel in jacket could dimple AR500 when shot at close range. (If bullet projectile is magnetic it contains steel). BB, pellet and airsoft guns should not be used. They will bounce back. Superior Ideas, Inc. assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for use or misuse of targets. You are agreeing to these terms as buyer. AR500 Steel targets are great for AR15, AK47 and other assault rifles at 100 yards. They will last virtually forever with various handguns, including Glock, Browning, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, 1911, Springfield XD, Sig, etc. at 15 yards or greater.

We have been working and perfecting some new products and parts for the SP01 Shadow and the CZ 75 Shadow.Let’s talk about the differenceThe new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug.The bushing keeps the front sight in the slide so no pin is necessary or needed (fitting the pin will damage the bushing threads.)The bushing will need to be removed before the barrel can be taken from the gun.Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group.This can be retrofitted by CZC to any CZ with a full width slide.What’s new and very exciting is the CZC SHRT reset trigger system. People have been asking for a shorter faster reset without the trigger swinging all the way forward in SA mode, now we have it.We have taken almost all of the forward movement out of the single action position with the trigger moving on average less than a 1/16 (0.0625”) before stopping. We have basically created a 1911 single action on a double action gun. All of the parts are retrofittable on a customer existing pistol. The CZC Bushing and Plug and the “CZC SHORT Reset Trigger System” will be CZC fit only. The CZC HAJO can be supplied as a part for customer fitting and will require a 7.5mm Front sight.Supplied with: (1) Bushing Wrench(3) 18 round 9mm magazinesPlease have a FFL to have it shipped ."
