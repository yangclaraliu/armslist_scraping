Kindly remit payment within five business days in the form of a US Postal money order or certified check. Within that same time period please send along the paperwork for the FFL you'd like me to ship to.
 
 
 
 
This pistol features the black hard-coat finish on its alloy frame and SIG's Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military's accuracy requirements, even after 20,000 rounds. It's also passed the military's 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights.

The guns previous owner had the gun refinished and the barrel cut to 20"" for use as a home defense gun. I kept it that way for 20 years and never got around to buying another barrel. It does pattern buckshot well. The action is very smooth and the wood is very nice. The gun dates to 1928-29.I answer all inquiries. Text REDACTED"

It remains in what I would certainly consider very good condition with the occasional handling mark - but please judge for yourself from the detailed photographs. SigLite night sights are included and have plenty of life left in them. The gun comes with three Sig 15 round magazines, it's paperwork, original box and cable lock. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. 
I'm happy to meet at any FFL within 50 miles of Scranton to do the transfer. I'm also down by Philadelphia once every couple of weeks or so.  Additionally, I'm open to trade. Let me know what you may have to offer and we can try to make a deal.  I'm predominantly interested in fine handguns, vintage revolvers and higher end semi-automatic rifles - cash can be added where appropriate.

It holds 6+1 . I am the original owner and purchased it brand new in 2006. It's built extremely tough and has the tough finish instead of the shiny style thin finish. These receivers are made from a single billet of steel. They are tough as nails. It has only had 15 rds through it. It has been stored in my safe since then and is in excellent shape. It can shoot 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. I am asking $350. I am in middle Tn on the outskirts of Clarksville and Ashland City. I can drive a reasonable way to meet a member to buy it. Thanks for looking.

Original buyer. I've personally cleaned all the cosmoline out and shot a couple hundred rounds through it. Works flawlessly. All numbers matching except for the 5 round box mag. I had to buy one on ebay but is period correct. Comes with three 30 round metal removable mags and two plastic tapco 20 round mags. It has a period correct chinese sling and the original butt stock tool kit. The only visual flaw is the metal dust cover. It looks like a manufacturer flaw with the blueing (most likely from how it was stored for 40 years in a crate). Does have original fold-able bayonet. Will also throw in a 100 round of the non corrosive steel surplus Russian ammo I've been using. Eat's through it no problem at all. The gun has been well maintained and properly cleaned and oiled after every outing. Price is negotiable My number is REDACTED if you wish to know anything else about it or want pictures.
