This knife has never been used as can be seen by the condition of the blade that shows zero wear. The only marks are on the anodizing of the handle as can be seen in the photos. This is from the knife being stored inside a pack clips into the Molle webbing  and having items occasionally Rob E did in the pack. I am only selling this knife because I currently have the gray anniversary issue model and have no need for two of these knives. These are outstanding blades that were made and very limited runs by Benchmade. Knife comes with black Benchmade molle compatible sheath. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification.

As you can see, the stock has some marking on it, none of which is through the clear. If you are looking to make the gun perfect, it will cost you about $100 to have the stock fixed, or $1 if you google how to perform a repair to high gloss guitar finishes and do it yourself. I have deducted the $100 from the price for this purpose. (I am not skilled at, or care to attempt repairing the finish myself.)The gun shoots perfectly, action is still tight and has had very few rounds through it.  I have another XT and my wife and kids, all trap shooters, prefer semi-automatic guns, so this gun sits unused; the only reason its on the market.Please feel free to ask me any questions on the gun and I'll get back to you quickly.Kind regards, Matt 612-Five Five 9-three 798"

Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.
