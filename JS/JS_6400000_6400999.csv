I know I just got it, but I'm not a huge fan of revolvers even though I keep buying them!The Mod 37 was the first ""Airweight"" revolver, actually before they came out with the name Airweight. The first ones had an aluminum cylinder and frame, but the cylinders would fail due to not being strong enough. They switched back to steel cylinders but kept the aluminum frames. This model IS one of the ones with the steel cylinders, so it's completely safe to fire.This revolver is in amazing condition. I have never fired it, not sure what the previous owner put through it but for it's age...this thing is very nice. The finish is great and it has absolutely 0 rust. There is barely a ring around the cylinder, and it locks up tighter than most new revolvers fresh out of the factory. The revolver comes with a vintage S&W Revolver box (from a different revolver though, not the original box to this one) which is also in pretty good shape!Asking $500 for this. Looking online, the only ones I can find are $500+ in beat up condition, nowhere near the great condition this one is in. I believe $500 is more than fair.Cash is preferred on this one, but I'm open to trade offers...I always like trying new things!Best way to contact me is by texting me at REDACTED or PMing me on here at any time, I always try to reply very quickly..usually within minutes.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

It has the carbine length piston, and an aftermarket keymod rail for mounting anything your heart desires. I have shot 60 rounds through the rifle and put it off to the side in the safe...I just don't get out to the range as much as I once did.The rifle also comes with Sig flip up Iron sights, and the rear sight has the dual apeture. the rifle also has an ambidexterous charging handle, so you can switch it from the left or right side of the upper receiver. I also had the trigger adjusted so it's essentially a two stage trigger with a really crisp reset. I will include 2 mags with the rifle. I no longer have the original box, I may have the paperwork somewhere.I'm not looking to travel very far, and will need to see a PA DL, and concealed carry permit.thanks for looking!"

For sale is a Remington 700 in 300 winchester short mag. The receiver has been trued and lugs lapped to 85-90% contact and bolt fitted to the race by gunsmiths at Scheels in Des Moines IA, I have receipts to verify this. The bolt is a one piece bolt from Pacific Tool & Gauge with M16 extractor. The barrel is a Black Hole Weaponry chambered in 300 Winchester Short Mag with 3 land polygonal rifling, 1:8.5 twist rate. Muzzle threaded 5/8x24 with a surefire warcomp suppressor adapter currently mounted (has been mounted since the rubber thread protector was removed to protect the crown). The barrel has an M24 ""heavy"" profile and is made of shot peened stainless steel. The current round count on this barrel is 92. The proper break in procedure found in the Barnes reloading manual 4th edition was followed to ensure longer barrel life, greater accuracy, and ease of cleaning. This barrel has only been touched with a one piece carbon fiber .30 cal rod. This is a ""rem/age"" type barrel so the headspace is easily adjusted with a savage barrel nut wrench. The rifle currently will NOT chamber most factory loaded ammunition, it is set for my hand loads. If desired I will readjust the headspace to accept standard SAAMI loads prior to completing the sale. The action is sitting in a Bell & Carlson A2 stock. The stock has been bedded to this action using devcon epoxy and the barrel channel has been inletted to allow for free floating of the heavier profile barrel. I also have 92 pieces of fireformed brass and ~130 pieces of un-fireformed brass (all federal headstamp) and redding competition 3 die set that I can sell with the rifle if desired. Contact me and I can send a picture of a 5 shot group fired at 104 yards using 220 gr smk's and reloder 19 powder and full length sized brass."

Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.
Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.
The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.
If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact."

First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy. The original Beretta Cougar was NATO qualified and boasted a long service-life of more than 30,000 9mm rounds. In its new incarnation, Beretta has developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the new Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail."
