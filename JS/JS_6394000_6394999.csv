This caliber was the Soviet answer to the Western .223 round. AK's that shoot this caliber are called AK-74's. The big advantage of the WASR-2 / AK-74 is the cheap ammo you can feed it. Another advantage of the 5.45X39 round is the recoil which is lower than the WASR-10. Every WASR series has it's lemons but in general, there do not seem to be a lot of of feeding or jamming issues with the WASR-2. The reliability of the WASR-2 is probably around the same level as the WASR-10; which is good.  You cannot find them!!!!!"
