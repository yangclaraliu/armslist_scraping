I've had no problems at all with either - and since they came inspected from Atlantic you know they're good. No canting and no crazy mag wobble. I did replace the new furniture (which I didn't like and didn't seem like it was too durable) and replaced it with original romanian military wood along with the ""dong"" grip.Also included are the following (all in excellent or in practical unused condition):1. 1 complete set of the original furniture that came on the rifles2. 1 complete set of the new AK Magpul furniture3. 3 AK slings - 2 canvas and 1 leather4. 2 original AK slant brakes5. Tapco slotted muzzle brake6. 1 original Romanian AK grip7. 3 three sleeve AK pouches8. 7 Polish surplus steel 30 round mags9. 2 Newest gen Magpul 30 round AK Pmags ...and anything else I happen to come across...oh and a complete trigger set off a Saiga AK.I'd like $1,600 for everything."

Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 4 inch Blue Colt Python, 6 inch nickel python, and 4 inch nickel Python (shot 6 times, amazing looking).Have a nice unfired factory engraved Smith and Wesson model 29-10 with factory wooden display box and a Walther PPK/s with 2 mags and matching box (smith and wesson).Have several 1911 guns in brands such as The rare unfired Colt El Cen 38 super listed above, and a rare unfired Remington R1 1911 Pearl Harbor edition, only 300 ever made, still has factory preserve oil on it.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome (low or high end guns). I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

This is one of the most sought after semi auto AK’s, it’s a milled receiver with a chrome lined Steyr barrel. Originally this would have come with a thumbhole stock as depicted in the brochure, but I had a gunsmith add a US-made stock and US-made Hogue rubberized pistol grip. It's very comfortable to shoot and super accurate. Included is a rubberized shock absorber for the rear of stock if needed and a black sling strap. Comes with one original (Arsenal, Circle-10 style) 5 round magazine. Also throwing in a Tapco 30 round magazine for everyday plunking. These are very robust little magazines for the price, I have yet to have a problem other than the usual tight fit that is easily fixed. I have literally only taken this rifle out twice in the last 8 years; maybe 300 rounds through it total. The outdoor ranges are too far away and I tend to be more of a handgun guy. Instead of spending its life safely locked away, I thought it should get some use.
Included is the original sling, oiler, cleaning rod, thumbhole stock (with some odd white discoloration) and owner’s manual that came with the rifle. Also comes with a few extra goodies: Additional rear stock, additional basic pistol grip, New Tipton Snap Caps for practice firing, replacement spring kit, silicone storage sock and a very nice padded soft case for transport. Everything you need for a day at the range.
The rifle has some very minor wear in the usual wear spots, but that is basically how it came from the factory. Seeing how it’s only protected by a thin layer of black paint, it’s bound to happen. The rifle shoots great and is in great condition. This is an AK that will last you a lifetime and then some. Please see the pictures for details.   I am a private seller, so we will need to meet at a local gun store or dealer to complete the purchase. Buyer pays all transaction and background fees.
I’m also selling a few other AK-related items separately including seven Tapco 30 round magazines, four high-quality Arsenal circle-10, 30 round magazines and 115 boxes of 7.62X39mm ammo. If you are interested in any of this, drop me a line and I can tell you more."

While some Yugo K98s contain peened eagles, this gun has no visible eagles, peened or not.The bolt and receiver series numbers match, but the rear sight and floorplate numbers do not. All in all, the rifle is in great shape for a Mauser. The stock is in remarkable condition, with no major dents or dings (of course, minor ones are there, but compared to the normal Mil-surp K98, they are very minor). Bore is in good shape, and its a great shooter. The only ""mechanical"" issue with the gun is the cleaning rod doesn't like to thread into its slot. Otherwise this is a complete rifle, in great shape, ready to hit the range!I also have 8mm Mauser ammunition for sale as well, and the buyer of the rifle gets first dibs. 387rds of Yugo ($.45 a round), 20rds of Turkish (free with rifle), 100rds of Romanian steel case ($.55 a round)= 507rds total.

Remember you won't have to pay taxes. If you buy it from the store, you will.

It comes from the factory with a railed handguard and a Tapco vertical foregrip. I swapped the Tapco grip with a Magpul AFG. It’s technically a quad rail system. Rail on the bottom of the handguard, two on the sides, and one on the top. Optic, Light, and laser ready.
I have a Sightmark Ultrashot Reflex sight on it right now. It has four different dot settings.
Complete with this package is 4 magazines. All of them hold 30 rounds. *Note*Cannot take AK mags, must use Vz.58 mags.
I have maybe 250 rounds through it, and that’s no joke. I just haven’t shot it as much as I thought I would.

I also replaced the bottom metal that was kind of flimsy with a DIP products lower bottom metal so I could get a proper torque on the reciever to the stock. The only reason I am getting rid of it is that I just dont shoot it anymore. The rings in picture do not come with the gun. You will get the original 5 round mag and if I can find the 10 round I have for it I'll include it as well. But for now all I can locate is the 5 round mag. This has the 20"" threaded and fluted barrel. This isnt the model with the polymer stock. Its got the tactial form heavy textured stock. I will trade for a savage MKII FVSR (almost the same gun but with a lighter polymer stock and 16"" barrel) plus cash on your end. Maybe ar15 stuff?

Cash preferred, though.  (I say that, but my gun additction forces me to say that if you have something of equal value that you'd like to offer in trade, I'll be open to hear what you have).  Trade value: $900.  Local pickup only, no shipping for now.  If I ship, I'll list on Gunbroker and go that route.  I'd much rather sell locally. It looks like this gun may never have left Tennessee!  Call or text Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six.  TN carry permit required.  I will provide purchaser with all of my info as well (TN DL & carry permit), as well as the factory letter with my info on it.  Call or text anytime. I can meet you in south Greene area or downtown Greeneville.  *I'll take more flattering pics during the day.  The weapon looks much better in person!"

Also including Tapco rubber covers to keep out the dirt. As a special bonus, I'm including a brand new Maglula bullet loader. These things are great and make loading magazines a breeze. Arsenal Circle 10 magazines are inarguably the finest AK magazines in the world-period. They are the ONLY magazine to pass 100% of the military drop tests, 100% of the time. Circle 10 magazines are made from the highest quality polymer, contain steel reinforcements front/back, steel feed lips, and a steel locking lug. Should you drop your loaded rifle or run into something, they WILL NOT break off and leave you with a possibly non-functioning gun. Circle 10 magazines feed and function perfectly all the time-every time.
Benefits and Features of Circle 10 Magazines:
Steel reinforced feed lips increase strength and durability.
Metal front strap protects magazine from bullet points, gives rigidity, and a steel lug for magazine retention
The wear resistant steel lugs are machined to factory specs to guarantee perfect fit and function
The bottom rails are strengthened with a steel insert. (Not available on clear mags)
Steel floorplate safely secures all moving parts
Our powerful spring is full size with more turns for long life and reliability
Our follower (right) will not tilt in the magazine or cause a jam
The circle 10 keeper is captive and has a spring guide to prevent binding
Circle 10 magazines are machined on four sides for a perfect fit"

This is one of the most sought after semi auto AK’s ever imported to the US, it’s a milled receiver with a chrome lined Steyr barrel. Originally this would have come with a thumbhole stock as depicted in the brochure, but I had a gunsmith add a lower tang to accomidate traditional AK stocks. US-made stock and US-made Hogue rubberized pistol grip is installed currently, but can be swapped out as desired. It's very comfortable to shoot and the quality steyr barrel makes it  super accurate. Included is a rubberized shock absorber for the rear of stock if needed and a black sling strap. Comes with one original (Arsenal, Circle-10 style) 5 round magazine. Also throwing in eight (8) Tapco 30 round magazine for everyday plunking. These are very robust magazines for the price.I have literally only taken this rifle out twice in the last 8 years; maybe 300 rounds through it total. The outdoor ranges are too far away and I tend to be more of a handgun guy. Instead of spending its life safely locked away, I thought it should get some use.
Included is the original sling, oiler, cleaning rod, thumbhole stock (with some odd white discoloration from storage) and owner’s manual that came with the rifle. Also comes with a few extra goodies: Additional rear stock, additional basic pistol grip, New Tipton Snap Caps for practice firing, replacement spring kit, silicone storage sock and a very nice padded soft case for transport. Everything you need for a day at the range.
The rifle has some very minor wear in the usual rub spots, but that is basically how it came from the factory. Seeing how it’s only protected by a layer of black paint, it’s bound to happen. The rifle shoots great and is in great condition. This is an AK that will last you a lifetime and then some. Please see the pictures for details. I am a private seller, so we will need to meet at a local gun store or FFL to complete the transaction. Buyer pays all transaction and background check fees.
