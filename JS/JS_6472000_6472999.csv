The interior has a computer rack and 3 fans which could be removed for a very large gun safe or with some modifications it could be used for both Guns and Computers. Interior is carpeted in anti static carpet very nice. This is VERY HEAVY and you will need a very good moving dolly to move it. It does come with whells but they are not attached. You will need several people and a good trailer or truck to move this beast. NO I CAN NOT MOVE IT FOR YOU!"

1 Each MEC 9000G configured for 410 Gauge
 
All three 9000G’s are mounted on a piece of ¾” plywood with a rail around the outside of the plywood so parts and pieces don’t fall on the ground.  They are easily picked up this way and stable just sitting on a bench or other when set up.  All three 9000G’s are set up with a “Smooth As Silk” air cylinder which when connected to an air supply converts the re-loader into an automated progressive.  The automation set includes the pressure regulator, an air filter, and the foot activation valve for the cylinder.  All the re-loaders already have the necessary hardware on them to make each one automatic.  To use this device all you do is remove two pins and move the cylinder to the 9000G re-loader that you want to use and reuse those pins.   You connect the foot valve to an air source and adjust the air pressure for that re-loader and off you go.  I still have all the hardware if someone wants to convert the re-loaders back to a manual version.  I also have a variety of spare parts and accessories for the re-loaders.  They are all in great condition with hardly any use on the 28 and 410 re-loaders as I shot mainly 20 gauge.  I want to sell them all as a package and this would be a great way for someone to get into reloading.  The 2016 list price on the 9000GN models (GN replaces G) in 20 gauge is $603.99 and $659.99 for the 28 gauge and 410 gauges.  These prices are from Midway.  So, three new 9000GN’s will cost you $1923.97 plus shipping.  Buy these three re-loaders, with the added on air cylinder, the extra parts and extra accessories for $1,200.00.  This is comparable with the low end prices on Ebay without the automation set up."

Also retained is the Winchester 70-type three-position swinging safety lever located on the bolt shroud.The Advanced Tactical Rifle utilizes Kimber’s bottom metal and feeds from a non-detachable 5-round steel box magazine. Emptying the magazine is accomplished by depressing a button inside the front of the triggerguard, which drops the hinged floorplate. This rifle also has Kimber’s gunsmith-adjustable trigger, which on my sample was set at 3 pounds.Although similar in components and design to other models in the company’s long-gun line, the rifle also offers unique features for tactical shooters, such as an oversize tactical bolt knob and a steel 20-minute Picatinny scope rail mounted with 8-40 screws. The match-grade barrel features a tight match chamber, a recessed crown and a 1:12-inch twist.The stock is the popular McMillan A-5 model in desert tan, fitted with an adjustable comb and length-of-pull spacers. The Advanced Tactical Rifle is further modified for tactical use through the addition of four flush-mounted quick-detachable mounting points for sling attachment. There’s two on the left side of the stock and two on the bottom of the stock. Accuracy is enhanced by both the glass bedding and a free-floating barrel.Please PM oryou can text for any info six 78-340-583 one"

I looked it over and could tell it was pretty cherry, so I bought it and have probably put 100 rounds thru it during the time I've owned it. Since I had more common AK's to shoot, this one has been mostly a safe queen collecting dust. I would guess it has had around 300 rounds or so thru it judging by the wear on the rails, bolt, carrier, etc. It shoots very well and I have never experienced any malfunctions or other problems."

From Aimpoint:
 
""The Aimpoint® 6XMag-1 was specifically designed for use with Aimpoint® Micro T-2 and Aimpoint® Micro H-2 red dot sights. This module gives professional users enhanced capability for long-range aiming and observation. A variable (-3 to +3) dioptric setting allows the magnifier to be adapted to the individual operator’s eye.
 
The 6XMag-1 can also be used as a handheld 6X monocular. Aimpoint magnifiers utilize the red dot in Aimpoint sights as the aiming reticle, eliminating the need for re-zeroing when shifting between non-magnified and magnified aiming.
 
The 6XMag-1 is encased in a shock absorbing protective rubber cover that also creates an ideal ergonomic grip. Internal optical adjustments make aligning the magnifier and sight quick and easy.""

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).SPECIFICATIONSCZ 75 SP-01 – 9mmProduct Name CZ 75 SP-01 – 9mmChambering 9mm LugerMagazine Capacity 18Magazine Type Double StackFrame SteelGrips Aluminum TacticalTrigger Mech DA/SASights Fixed Fiber Optic RedBarrel Cold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length 4.6 inMagwell Anodized Aluminum IPSC LegalWeight 40.7Overall Length 8.15 inHeight 5.79 inWidth 1.46 inSafety Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block SafetyCustom Version of Shadow by Akai Custom GunsShadow Competition Rear Sight CZFiber Optic Front SightCZ Custom SA DA Hammer & Main SpringDrop in Pr B Short Reset / Swing forward DisconnectorExt Firing Pin, Lighter Spring Pin SpringStainless Steel Guide RodTune Trigger Components (Reduces Single and Double action trigger pull)Install and Tune 13lb Main Spring and 11lb Recoil SpringRe profile and Polish Disconnector and associated surfaces.Re Profile Slide Stop For Magazine release with Heavy / Long BulletsThin Silver Aluminum Grips Includes (8) 18 round 9mm magazines Reliability Check. Zero Check with Factory AmmunitionThe CZ custom hammer will give you a ""full"" Single Action trigger pull of about 3.0-3.5Lbs , Double action at about 7.5-8.5Lbs. The reason I say full, is that is what the trigger will need to activate fully. I.e. hanging a weight on the trigger. If we could actually weight the break point of the sear less the trigger return spring, The actual break point of the sear hammer engagement is about 1.5/2.0Lbs the rest is the trigger return spring, since we normally don't let the trigger all the way forward for subsequent shot the sear break point matter more than overall trigger weight. To lighten the trigger more it is necessary to lighten the trigger return spring, this can be done by careful bending, also replace the mainspring with something lighter a 13lb or 15lb mainspring, this depends on the type of ammo you are going to shoot?
