Century Arms UC-9 Uzi Carbine 9mm
Well I took this in on a partial trade and though it wasn't what I was really after, I found it to be interesting nonetheless. I figured if I can't sell or trade it, I will still be able to have some 9mm fun with it. I've never had it out to play yet. Previous owner bought it new and had it to the range one time with less than 300 rounds fired so it's basically pretty new. Couldn't get the box as it was buried under a recent re-insulation of his attic. He promised to get it for me next time he goes up there. This Uzi will come with eleven 30 round mags and one 20 round mag as well as an Uplula loader to assist in loading them all up. 12 mags total. It would be an easy SBR if you decided to go that route with it.
 
PRICE:
$700 for the rifle, mags and loader. Maybe throw in a few hundred rounds of 9mm if I like you.
 
TRADE:
Still searching for a Glock 19 MOS or a pistol/slide or something that I could have milled into an MOS capable pistol. Willing to go + or - cash either way to even out trades.
 
LOCATION:
Everett, Washington (prefer transfers at Sound Loan because Jeff is the best guy in the world to work with)."

Both barrels are vented and rem choked.  Hunt rabbits and squirrel with the 18 and pheasants with the 26.  All three pieces are 3 inch compatible.  Throw in a 3 inch high performance turkey load and one of the three extra chokes included and shoot a turkey.  Compare the performance between 12s and 20s they're pretty close these days.  Yes, I am the original owner and I have receipts.  No, I don't have the box, it wouldn't be tactical to keep it in.  $800.00 for everything in the pictures.  Brad Jacobson REDACTED.  Thanks for looking!"

As a matter of fact I've tried to find another one for years and cannot. It has a little holster wear.  Had it professionally broken down and tuned and cleaned.  I'm interested in trades. Cz rifles, savage rifles, let me know what you have. Preferably .223, .17s, 22lr & 22-250. I will add cash for the right trade. Icannot drive far to make a deal. I'm firm on the cash price. Thanks for looking."
