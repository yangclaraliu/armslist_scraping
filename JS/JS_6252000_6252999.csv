It has a brand new back tire and front tire has 80% tread. It's pretty apparent that the top end has been redone. The guy I bought it from said it was professionally rebuilt about two years ago.

I recently moved and lost the box to the rifle, but I still have the box to the scope. I wasn't able to get out to the range to use the rifle, so as I said it is unfired in mint condition. The scope has been thrown on the rifle, so you probably want to use a mounting kit or have it professionally remounted. The scope is a Zeiss Terra 3-9x42. It has a game reaper low profile mount, putting the scope closer to the bore axis. I would like $800 firm for the rifle and scope with the game reaper mount and a black nylon sling. The plastic case is not included. Please don't email me with, ""what is the lowest you'll take"", I won't even respond."
