Optically both are about equal with maybe a tiny advantage to the ELCAN, that’s no small achievement on the WOLF Optics PSU since the ELCAN is the best combat optics available. Using the premium German SCHOTT glass in the WOLF Optics PSU has probably helped that a lot. The WOLF Optics PSU has a slight advantage in offering a half degree wider field of view at 4x. The ELCAN has great daylight reticle illumination and digital power control, but the WOLF Optics PSU has a more contemporary tactical focused reticle design. Lastly, the WOLF Optics PSU is about $850-900 cheaper than the ELCAN SpecterDR.""Optic in action from Army-16 expo in Moscowwww.youtube.com/watch?v=WMmW992JawEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdhLLFtXVQwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKijLRKt-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTidLiicgXwManufacturer's write up:The 1x/4x32mm PSU, WPA’s flagship scope, was designed to combine the best features of both the 1x and 4x sights. When set on 1x, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view facilitating rapid “both eyes open” target engagement. Set on 1x it can be employed similar to a reflex sight, providing quick hits on multiple or fast moving targets. With the flip of a switch the magnification increases to 4x providing target identification, ranging and engagement at extended distances. A Bullet Drop Compensating reticle combined with a simple to use “no math” telemetric rangefinder provides fast and reliable hits.Built to survive harsh conditions the PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body. The design is both shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics provides a sharp and bright image with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The illuminated reticle features seven intensity settings and is powered by a readily available CR2032 3-volt battery. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters. The telemetric rangefinder allows ranging out to the same distance. Capped adjustment turrets provide quick and trouble free zeroing. Once zeroed all ballistic corrections are made using the reticle.Very compact in size, the PSU is only 7.4 inches long. Weight is just 24 ounces. Eye relief is a generous 2.75 inches. The PSU mounts easily to a MIL STD 1913 Picatinny rail and features two QD levers. These allow rapid attachment and removal, no tools required. Extremely robust, the PSU is a perfect match for an AR-15 or other Modern Sporting Rifle.Magnification easily changes from 1x to 4x32mm objective provides a large Exit PupilVery wide field of viewCompact size, only 7.4 inches longIlluminated 800 meter BDC reticleIlluminated 800 meter telemetric rangefinderSeven intensity settingsPower provided by common CR2032 batteryOnly 24.6 ounces with QD mountFits Mil Std 1913 Picatinny railQD levers for rapid on/offShockproof and watertight construction--------------Specifications--------------Magnification: 1x and 4xField of View 1x: 26Field of View 4x: 6.5Exit pupil: 8mmEye relief: 70mmAdjustment range of the sight by height: +0-10 mils, min.Adjustment range of the sight by direction: +0-10 mils, minThe height of optical axis to the seat plane: 37.5mmPower supply: CR2032 3VOverall dimensions: 7.5x3x3 inWeight: 24.6 oz."

CZ 455 Varmint Rifle - The 20.5” long, .866” diameter cylindrical barrel gives the 455 varmint an accuracy advantage across the wide variety of rimfire loads available todayAny of the accessory barrels available for the 455 platform, including the American and Lux (open sights), as well as other varmint-weight barrels in .22 LR, .22 WMR or .17 HMR can be easily swapped out due to the larger universal barrel channel of the Varmint model. A 5 round magazine is included.
The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire. The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation.
The CZ 455 American Combo Package is now available from CZ-USA. The package features the new CZ 455 in .22LR and a .17 HMR barrel along with everything you need to make the caliber change. The CZ 455 eliminates the need to spend the extra expense on a second rifle when you want to add another quality shooter to your rimfire battery.
The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.
Our longest-barreled rimfire, the Ultra Lux, joins the 455 platform this year. It retains all the same features as its 452 predecessor, including 28.6” barrel, tangent rear sight (quickly adjustable for elevation), beech stock with cheekpiece and 10-round magazine. Just like all 455s, it now has the ability to swap barrels and stocks.
The largest draw of the Ultra Lux has always been its incredibly long sight radius, which makes it easier to be more accurate when using iron sights."

One of very few pistols ever chambered in .455 Webley, this pistol would have been issued to the Royal Navy, Royal Flying Corps, or Royal Horse Artillery during the First World War, and likely issued to the RAF for the Second. A mid-production pistol, this gun is estimated to have been manufactured in 1914 or 1915, and would have shipped to the UK Purchasing Commission via the London Armory to be inspected at RSAF Enfield and issued to the British military. Its military service is confirmed by British property markings on the slide, frame and barrel, and the gun presumably remained in service until after the Korean War, judging by the BNP proofing on the barrel. The pistol is accompanied by very scarce .455 Webley Auto cartridges, with three loose rounds and one seven-round unopened pack of WWI vintage. A likely veteran of three wars, this unaltered, non import-marked a near excellent .455 Colt is an important piece of history and suitable for the museum or advanced private collection. Condition is near excellent with the pistol retaining better than 90% high-polish blue finish. There is no rust or deep pitting apart from two patches on the right of the frame."

Matte finish Stainless. Factory rubber grips. 6.5” barrel.
Gun is clean. Has had fewer than 100 rounds put through it half of which were .44 Spl.
Comes with Blackjack nylon holster and NOTHING else. No box. No paperwork, etc.
 
Gun came from Taurus with point of impact way low and left. Photo is a target I fired with it after sighting in. 50 feet, hand held, in horrible conditions (standing in knee deep snow on hill with sun in my eyes – lol) Gun shoots pretty darned good and is a nice soft shooter. (Acually this is only allowing me to upload one image. Target photo I was trying to add has 11 of 12 rounds in 2 and 18"" circle with the one out being he first round fired and a clench on my part.)
MSRP $741.86 (seems an odd figure) so by the time you are out the door you are slightly upwards of $800 depending on sales tax where you live. This is $200 less and has the difference of already being dialed in. These seem to be selling for about $600 on Gun Broker and then of course you have to pay shipping, cannot look at before you buy, etc. Not interested in any trades thanks."

This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It has only minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously used, and saw only light usage. The wood stock on this shotgun has only minor signs of wear/tear, in the form of small, shallow, minor nicks and cuts, both on the stock, as well as the pump action. They do not have any major scratches, scrapes, bends, breaks, chips, cracks, dents, dings, staining, gouging, or discoloration. There is a bit more wear/tear to be found on the receiver and barrel, which can also be attributed to prior usage. There are no signs of pitting, or rusting on either, though there is a light amount of staining on the receiver's chamber, and in spots throughout the barrel. This shotgun does boast a 28""-long ribbed and vented barrel, that ends with a bead sight, and has been ported near the end. This shotgun also features a gold trigger, with an action release set directly behind the trigger, and a safety on top of the receiver. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection."
