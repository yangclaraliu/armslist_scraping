Since it's been sitting around for so long I doubt that I ever will, so here it is. I believe that all of the parts right down to the smallest pin and spring are accounted for, but this has been stored in my safe for quite some time, so I'm not 100% sure. I shortened the barrel to 16 1/8"", crowned it and polished the exterior of the barrel. The stock that you see is a Fajen gunstock that I found some time ago that they used to make for the SKS. The Fajen handguard matches. You will have to remove the metal on the original handguard which is included to complete it. Also included is an aftermarket peep sight and a set of Wolfe springs in order to make the trigger much more tolerable. My intent when I started this was to make a really nice looking, highly polished and rust blued SKS. Yeah, I know, that's weird, but it sounded interesting at the time, and it still does, it's just not something that I'm going to finish.Taken pending receipt of funds."

Excellent for home defense or social break down, especially for those among us who are smaller like some women and younger shooters! Great for close in situations like apartments or condos due to less over penetration like a high powered 12 gauge guns, rifles or powerful handguns. (We don’t want to be shooting innocent bystanders or our neighbors – right?!) Think about this, a 3” Remington Home Defense shell can send 5 of .41 caliper lead balls (10.4 mm) down range at 1125 FPS. One pull of the trigger and five 9mm sized lead bullets are going to hit your target! And at the range it does just that. It also likes 3” #4 shot and many other different loads. It would be your choice. That is why I originally got it for my frail little woman. Compared to her 15 round 9mm pistol, this would shoot the same amount of lead with 3 trigger pulls vs. 15 trigger pulls of the pistol!

One is a 40-rounder, the other a 30-rounder. Both mags are barely used, in excellent condition, and function 100% perfectly. They've been inserted in rifles a lot more times than they've ever been fired (and you can see the normal scrapes at the top of the mags from this).These are both the premium Bulgarian Circle-10 polymer ""waffle"" mags, (with steel locking tabs and steel reinforced feed lips),  not the cheaper slab-slides or so-called ""bullet"" mags. If you can even find these in stock, they'll run you more than a hundred bucks. Asking $70, firm. No trades.If the ad is still up, then I still have the mags, so I won't respond to more info-phishing scammers asking if I still have them.Thanks for looking......."

It comes with what is shown plus 2-30 new mags. This is the Norinco all factory matching numbers gun that is absolutely clean as you will ever see one again. It is definitely a safe queen. The only reason I am selling is to get a Marlin 1894 in .357 otherwise it would not be going anywhere. So if you have one and want to trade great otherwise I am not interested in trading. Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. The NHM-91 was equipped from the factory with two 30-round magazines. Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or European AKM. Other Chinese-made AKM rifles such as the MAK 90 and NHM 90 have thicker receivers as well, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62×39mm ammunition.

This gun started out as a standard Colt Government 1911 but has since been transformed into a Wilson Combat. It was sent to the guys there and completely gone through and rebuilt. It has all Wilson Combat internals (springs, bushings, guide rod, etc) as well as Wilson’s gloss black armor tough finish that is very sleek and very durable. The slide has been tightly hand fitted to the frame and is extremely smooth. It’s had orange Trijicon HD night sights installed which are very bright and has had a tuned trigger job that feels to be around 2.5-3lbs. The frame has been engraved with Wilson Combat on the front right side which just gives the gun an awesome look and appearance of its own. This gun will shoot with any high end 1911 and I can guarantee that but cost half what a Wilson Combat or Nighthawk does. The only factory parts on this gun are basically the original metal and barrel. Other than that, everything else on the gun has either been upgraded or customized. If you are in the market for an awesome, reliable pistol that will shoot right along with any custom high end build, now you’ve found it. The gun also wears a set of custom Colt grips that I believe are made from giraffe bone. They have a great feel and really go great with the gloss black finish. This gun does not have any wear or scratches whatsoever. I’m not dying to sell it but just seeing what else may be out there. Pictures do this gun no justice. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks for looking!Dustin REDACTED"

With Hornady SST 165g I punched out several 3 shot groups of .75 to .8 MOA with calipers and never tested it again.  Adjustable 2 stage matech quality trigger adjustable from 6 down to 2 pounds(set at factory default of ~ 5)and a 3 position safety.  The 3 position safety was one of the reasons I bought this b/c dad is getting older and hey sometimes you forget things.  Forward position = fire.  Middle position = locks the sear only, but the bolt is free so you can unload with the safety on.  Rearward position = bolt and sear are locked.  The capacity is 5 + 1 and this rifle also has the hinged floor plate for ease of unloading the magazine. This is a fully enclosed bolt sleeve and fluted bolt.   The receiver machining is simply fantastic there is no wobble or slop it simply fits perfectly and is tight as a drum when closed.  If you have ever picked up say a Remington 700 made in recent years you will know what I'm talking about with loose rattling bolt/receiver play. While the scope is not included the Talley 1"" scope mounts will go with the rifle.  They are machined for the Vanguard receiver and are an exact perfect fit, no lapping required just add your favorite 1"" tube glass and you are good to go.  The rifle is absolutely perfect and was maintained by a neat freak.  Every time I shoot my rifle I run a bore snake through it even b/f I head home.  It's always been cleaned and lubricated with CLP and soft patches, plastic tool fittings only no metal.   ****PLEASE NOTE the Nikon scope is NOT for sale.****  Once the rifle is sold the scope will be going back to my buddy who loaned it to meCash only and for pick up only at my home in South Tampa.  No trades, but thanks for the thought.  I've done my best to be thorough here, but I know there will always be additional questions so please feel free to ask anything you like and I'll get back to you typically within an hour or so I live with my phone on my hip. Thanks for you time have a great day."
