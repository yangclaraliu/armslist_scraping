Its a great optic with clear glass and mil turrets. I upgraded to an SWFA SS HD and wish I had another gun to stick it on. Its a great scope with great glass and excellent tracking, but I can't justify holding onto it. Its brand new and never mounted. Let me know if you are interested and I am happy to answer any questions.It has the APLR1 reticle which is an excellent Christmas tree reticle. I did my best to get a decent picture of it. The picture doesn't do it justice though, it is incredibly crisp. Reticle is SFP that subtends at 15x. It is illuminated and very clear IR.Full disclosure, I got one of the first to roll out a while ago with the tiny turret screws. I had an issue with the objective lens popping loose on after shooting on my .308 with a can. Athlon replaced it in less than a week with a brand new one with the larger turret screws. CS said that it isn't an issue they have seen much and Trent said he has the same one on his .308 with a few thousand rounds through with no trouble.Looking to sell, not interested in trades at this time.  I would prefer a face to face meeting, but I would ship it provided shipping costs are covered and I have either a cleared cashiers check or money order before I send it."

This is an exceptionally good condition pistol.  It has a very low round count...no more than 200 rounds.
I think there are four 10 round magazines.
If you know anything about Steyrs then you realize that finding an S9 with the external safety is very rare.
About Styers...designed and proven better than other ""black Austrian"" designed pistols. This has all the internal safety features as well as the external.  This also has a fully supported chamber, much better design than others.  The grip angle is more user friendly than other designs and allows you faster ""target on time.""  It has a proprietary sight system that actually encourages good sight alignment.
I just do not have a need for it.
You will get the factory storage box, at least 4 10 round magazines, a holster, a manual (if I can find it) and the gun with a Hogue slip-on grip
I am asking $500
I can take pictures but to be honest, it looks like a pistol in immaculate shape."

Hard case, 30rd magazine, extra butt pads and all factory literature.  The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

I took off the original wooden hardware (That may be included if requested) and replaced it with a composite rubberized glass filled stock and put a nice rubberized sling on it. I also took off the straight bolt handle from the action and i welded a new curved bolt so that I could attatch the Picantinny rail to the upper so that my high powered vortex scope ( 6 to 24 power with distance adjustance and sun shield). The 7.62X54R round is very similar in size to the 308 round that is such a revered cartridge and the 7.62X54R ammo is a lot cheaper. Please text me with any inquiries on this fine shooting rifle. I have only shot it a few times since i have gotten it and the only thing I can say about how it shoots is that it shoots very well and it is a very dependable firearm and it can be yours. My phone number is REDACTED and you can contact me any time if you are interested in this rifle. Thank you very much and God Bless

It makes a good rifle to introduce someone to shooting sports with. The controls on this rifle mimick those on an AR-15 platform, and it will accept various accessories that would fit another tactically oriented rifle, such as lights, lasers, and optics. This is a dedicated .22lr rifle that allows a shooter to use this rifle as a 'trainer' for using an AR-15 platform, while saving money on ammunition and not bothering with the hassle of a .22 conversion kit. It's by far the best 'tactical' .22lr that I've encountered. The sights are fully adjustable, and may be removed. This rifle is used and is in Good to Excellent condition. This rifle comes in its original box and includes an extra magazine and a single point sling."

I bought this about 3 years ago brand new when Glock was attempting to enter the LE arms race and build their own round to surpass the .40S&W...needless to say it didn't gain the popularity with law enforcement so this one basically has sat in my safe for a few years and done nothing but collected dust! It's had exactly 80 rounds down the pipe. Comes with factory Glock Night Sights that are still very bright, 3 10rd magazines, 5.5lb trigger job, Blackhawk Serpa holster, original box and documents with a box of LE Hollowpoints. Essentially; it's still a brand new gun that's just been sitting. NOW! I'll trade this for a series 1 42mm Apple Watch that WORKS plus 250 in cash otherwise this is a straight cash sale and no I will not ship it!"
