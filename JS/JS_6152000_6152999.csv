The production date on this shotgun is late teens through mid twenties and is safe to fire with smokeless ammunition. The chokes are Full and Modified. As it sits, It needs an action retention screw/recoil lug (it is a bolt that acts as both) and a new buttstock. I did fire this when I purchased it this summer, but the stock was too dry and cracked. It withstood more than 100 low brass shells before the stock crumbled between the side plates and the gun began to unreliably fire. THIS IS A ""GUNSMITH SPECIAL""/PARTS GUN. The fix is simple and will require around $150-175 for the owner to get this old girl up and running. I was saving this for a winter project, but have come into needing funds for a new waterfowl gun. This shotgun will make a fine beater side by side when fixed, serve as a fantastic home gunsmithing project, or will serve perfectly as a donor for any other Batavia Leaders that need hard to find side plate assemblies and other minor/major components.Make an Offer, I will entertain it! Nebraska resident Inquiries only. I will not ship out of state or transfer.This is a private sale, But it will have a bill of sale for my own records as well as the purchasers."

Beautiful stock and excellent finish and internals as you would expect from a Service Grade CMP rifle.

Has a 1963 Springfield barrel with ME/TE measurements of 1/2. 
No offense but I’m not interested in trades and price is non-negotiable, it’s a good price, just check the closed gunbroker listings for typical garands and even common garands are going for $1,100-$1,200 and this one is well worth it! I’m going to give it a few days on here before moving it to gunbroker. I'm only able to submit one photo on this ad but I can take lots of pics of whatever you want to see and answer any questions you may have."

Has an oversized charging handle which is much more natural to use than the dinky handle on them stock. Has a clamp on muzzle break and along with the springs in the stock pad, it has almost no felt recoil. It has an angled foregrip and just feels supurb. Lastly, the gun has a basic optic that is set to line up with the front sight. Will include the original rear sight and the stock charging handle. Being the gun shoots a pistol caliber out of a rifle length barrel, it isn't loud at all. Great cheap carbine and a great choice for a home defense gun.

Comes with 2 mags, cleaning rod and manual. 7.62x54R. This is the deluxe version with the checkered walnut stock and nice butt pad. Heavy barrel. Scope mount. Beautiful stock on this one. Very hard to find now. Everyone is sold out in this caliber and this stock option. Cost on sale was 838 plus shipping, dealer transfer and call in fee. Normal price is much higher. The plain, smooth stock version with low end wood is even more than this if you can find it. I have seen these listed for 799 but in the plain version and in 7.62x39 only. There was quite the wait for this one. Now I need to scrape up some Christmas cash due to unexpected vehicle repairs so something has to go. This is brand new, unfired. I have inserted a mag for the pics but no rounds have been chambered or even loaded into the mags. I just bought a box of Winchester 180 grain soft point hunting ammo at Big 5 tonight for 28 dollars that will come with it. I did not intend on running any cheap surplus ammo through this weapon. I am not looking for trades at this time but I may be swayed to take a nice Springfield XD in .45 acp in part trade. I would prefer a 4 inch. As you can see, I have almost 950 invested at sale prices. I am offering at a steal of a price so am not going to dicker on my price. If you have been wanting one of these quality weapons as much as I have and are tired of waiting or don't want to spend a grand for one, here is your chance to save some big bucks. Obviously we need to go through a dealer since I had to do a 4473 to get it. The call in fee is on me. The transfer fee is on you. I live in Toledo, near Newport. I may be willing to meet in Corvallis or Albany if you have a trade I am interested in. I know all the shops over there lol. Note*****VEPR is Russian and made by MOLOT who is not on the Armslist so I chose Saiga from the drop down list. Obviously this is NOT a Saiga!!!!!!"

And that can fire 4 shots in less than one second? And that is soft-recoiling and leaves your shoulder feeling perfectly comfortable even after a marathon duck-hunting session in the marshes or a long day at the clay range? The A400 Xtreme Bottomland Camo does this and much more. Add its superior resistance to salt spray, flawless fit and finish and the best materials in the world--and see why this shotgun is the definitive choice for the serious waterfowl hunter. Versatile-Fast-Low-Profile-ActionVersatile, Fast, Low-Profile Action The A400 action is truly revolutionary in the history of the semiautomatic shotgun. Thanks to the proprietary Blink technology, it shoots 36% faster than any other system, meaning that your follow-up shots will always be faster than any high-flying duck, goose or clay target. It is low-profile and light weight (while being super-durable), giving you superior natural pointability. It has built-in rails, so that you can easily equip it with the optics of your choice for turkey season. And its reliable feeding of any type of 12-gauge shell—lead or steel, mild 2 ¾” to hard-hitting 3 ½” magnums—gives the A400 the versatility of a do-it-all shotgun. Low Recoil (70% Recoil Reduction)Low-Recoil The A400 Xtreme Bottomland features not one, but several of today’s most advanced recoil reduction systems right out of the box. All these systems work together to minimize not only the recoil from the cartridge ignition and firing, but also from the backward-movement of the bolt. Also, the A400 Xtreme Bottomland is designed to recoil parallel to the cheek mount, which also reduces felt kick while giving you faster follow-up shots. Altogether, these recoil-reduction devices decrease felt recoil by 70%, meaning that you can enjoy a longer day at water’s edge or at the range without any discomfort. Flawless, Durable, Corrosion-Resistant Finish Something else that won’t fail to impress you about the A400 Xtreme Bottomland Camo is its finish. The camo pattern is flawless and covers even the corners and recesses that would be left out in a lesser shotgun. But what’s even more impressive is that, thanks to Aqua technology, the steel parts of the A400 Xtreme are highly resistant to corrosion, water and salt-spray, which make this shotgun a champion of durability even in the most extreme hunting conditions.
