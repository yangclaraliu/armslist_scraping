I've seen the normal stock rifles at gun shows and swap meets anywhere from $600-$800. I'm looking for trade values in that range.  If you've never seen one of these before, what makes it cool besides the interesting look is the 100 round helical top mounted magazine. That's 100 rounds of 22LR in one mag! Pretty cool. The magazine is also hand wound so you can leave it full with no spring tension. So you can leave it loaded and not worry about weakening the mag spring. You won't find that in any other 22 on the market. And additional magazines can still be purchased new just in case 100 rounds isn't enough for ya."

The gun is based on the ADL line and I have added a KRG bolt handle to help when manipulating the bolt. The gun will come with the 10 round magazine. The gun will accept up to a 20 round Promag or M14 magazine. The chassis was plastidipped in its current camo colors, and it can be easily removed to its black base or touched up if required. Rifle is in great shape, and only has 100 or so rounds through it. Let me know if you have any questions at 615-three-ten-5272."

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools. The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa. The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."

It is self adjusting dependent on the round you are shooting, which you have to program in. The scope is pretty sweet but just a bit too complicated for my taste. Plus on a 7mm the drop is very minimal unless you are beyond 400 yards. I just don't see me using it for what it's purpose which is long range. No low balls because I will ignore.

I literally just got this gun, but I'm not a revolver guy as hard as I try to be. Semi auto has my heart, I've had many many revolvers but none of them do it for me.The SSR stands for Stock Service Revolver, it was made special by S&W for IDPA Stock Service competitions. It has chamfered charge holes, a custom barrel with recessed precision crown, a bossed mainspring, and a tuned trigger straight out of the factory. The upgrades done to this thing by S&W also make it ideal for defense, the double action is extremely smooth and light, and the single action weighs almost nothing. It's a VERY nicely made revolver, and I have never heard anyone say something bad about them.The cheapest I can find these online are $819+$30 for shipping + another $35-60 for transfer depending on where you live. That's a little over $900 at the CHEAPEST listing on GunBroker. This one is in very good shape, comes with the very nice standard wood grips made by Altamont, a set of rubber grips with finger grooves, 50 rounds of Geco 158gr .357 FMJ for the range and 25 rounds of Hornady 158gr XTP Hollow Point rounds for defense. I paid $50 for the ammo, and only adding $20 on to the firearms price for it. My loss, your gain.I'm asking $775 for this, which I think is more than fair considering what I've seen. I'm also apparently the only person in Michigan selling one used, people across the country on Armslist are selling them for $800+ with no extras or ammo.MIGHT be interested in a trade, but at this point I have no idea what I want. Shoot me an offer, worst I can do is say no.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks!~ Mike"

VCI packaging material is clear, giving you visibility of the internal contents.Does not have any external markings.These blued steel magazines have a follower that holds the bolt open after the last round is fired, just like the Yugoslavian manufactured bolt hold open magazines.These magazines are mil-spec, and are almost identical in construction and design to Yugoslavian AK47 magazines.All magazines will have an oily coating on them, inside the VCI package (not sticky, and easily wiped away). Please Note: - The mags will work well in AK rifles that were factory made with a high cap receiver and they held the bolts open as they should in Yugo variants , Polish /Russian variants . Some AK rifles and pistols like the Romanian WASR series may be tight since they started out as Low Cap receivers. The mags may need minor fitting with a file on the mag to make them fit correctly."

Some scratches on the blade but nothing that will not buff out. Original acorn sheath, the white leather lacing has gone brittle and some is missing.From what I have been able to gather these have gone for quite a bit more than my asking price, but if I am way out of line, I welcome a more knowledgable collector to educate me.

Specs / description  as copied from Radical Firearms 
The Radical Firearms complete AR-rifle is a fully Mil-Spec AR-15 rifle built using our law enforcement grade upper receivers and mil spec lowers. The 4150 Chromoly Vanadium Steel barrels are Melonite treated for a harder-than chrome finish without chrome's accuracy robbing side effects! This same finish is applied to the bolt carrier groups, helping to reduce receiver wear and increase reliability. The bolt heads are MIL-STD and MPI for quality assurance. The full-length, free float handguard keeps your hands cool and provides plenty of room for accessories. As an added touch, we are adding a Radical Firearms 12"" FGS (Forward Guard Shield) Round Rail that we built from scratch in-house! The FGS rail even has the capability to add attachments other than on the top picatinny rail, as it does allow Magpul Moe attachments and RF rail sections.Pick up a set of your favorite sights, and you're ready for the range!This rifle is our budget friendly model with all the extras you will want for your first, second or last build!Rifle comes complete with-16"" M4 5.56 Melonite Barrel 4150V Chromoly 1 in 7"" twist rate-5.56 Chamber with M4 Feed Ramps-1/2x28 Thread Pitch-M16 Milspec HPT/MPI BCG-RF Low Profile Micro Gas Block-Stainless Carbine-length gas system-Direct Gas Impingement-Mil-Spec A2 Flash Hider-12"" Free Float Radical Firearms FGS Round Rail-Picatinny Top Rail-Allows for the use of Magpul MOE attachments and RF FGS Rail Attachments-Forged Upper Receiver with Forward Assist, Shell Deflector-Forged Radical Firearms Lower-Milspec Lower Parts Kit-Ergo Sure Grip-M4 Collapsible Stock"

The overall condition of the revolver is excellent. There is very little wear on the bluing and no dings or nicks in the metal. The barrel however has some pitting on the interior from someone along the line not cleaning it promptly after shooting corrosive ammo. I have been told that is unavoidable with any of these pistols. It is dated 1943 and was produced by Izhevsk before being imported by Century Arms. I have put about 50 rounds through it and it hits paper at 25ft. I also have the holster that Century Arms sells them with as a package. I believe I have 100 rounds of new non corrosive brass ammo, the pistol, holster that will all be sold as a package.Please feel free to call or text 7zero3-3nine9-9zero93 for more pics or info"
