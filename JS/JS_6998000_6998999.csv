Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Payment Options:The quickest and easiest method of payment is moneygramm/westernunion or money order.

One of the best guns on the market. Very accurate and very durable. If you have been looking at getting one of these you know how great they are and that they are top of the line.  I just had it sonic cleaned so its in like new condition. I have only had for one year and need to catch up on some bills so im looking to sell. The gun is great and i wouldnt be selling if i didnt need to. I never shot it out past 600 yards but the gun does shoot sub moa. So it wasnt too hard to hit a 12 inch steel plate at that distance. I do have the Super Scar triger that i paid 350 for and it makes the gun so much better. I have the orginal triger as well along with the box. The only other aftermarket things it has is the grip is an upgraded grip and i do have rail covers on it to protect the rail covers but thoes could easly be taken off if you wanted. I have 3 total mags for it and also a nice case as well. Im wanting to get around 3000 for it. I know this is a lot and i do own a lawn care business so i can take partial card payment. I do have about $3600 into the gun and it is my baby so it has been taken care of. The scope is not included in the gun price but i would be willing to sell that as well. Its a Nightforce NXS 2.5-10X42. Model C458. Top of the line.  Feel free to call or text nick at REDACTED with more questions or to see more pictures. I will not ship but i will dive to you if you live within an hour or 2 of me. No checks, No scams."
