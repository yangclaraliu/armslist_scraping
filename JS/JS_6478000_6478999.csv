About NSF Custom Guns NSF Custom Guns is a Small Firearm Manufacturer, that maintains a 07 Federal Firearms Manufacturer License with the ATF. All NSF Custom guns are hand assembled, one at a time, by one AR Rifle Smith (Certified by the American Gunsmith Institute) to ensure the highest quality. Most parts, except some handguards and optics, are made right here in the USA and are sourced from the most reputable USA manufacturers. Feel free to call REDACTED with any questions. Aero Precision Gen 2 Lower Receiver Aero Precision’s roots are deeply tied to aerospace, and their drive for clean, perfect engineering and machining stems from that. When you’re building something that will fly in the air, there is no margin for error. They take that same approach in the firearms industry. This Aero Precision AR15 Gen 2 Stripped Lower Receiver is the perfect base for this custom AR15 build. Machined to mil-spec dimensions, these lowers ensure the highest quality with a correct component interface. 8.35 oz. Made in the USA Machined from 7075-T6 forged aluminum   Upper Tension Screw - Allows users to fine tune the fit of the upper and lower receiver through the use of a nylon tipped tensioning set screw inserted in the grip tang of the lower receiver. This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver. Increased Magwell Flare - Allows for easier insertion of magazines and provides a sleeker look. Aero Precision Lower Parts Kit Aero Precision lower parts kit features Mil-spec dimensions and coatings to ensure the highest quality and correct component interface. Aero Precision M4E1 Enhanced Upper This state of the art M4E1 platform starts here, with the M4E1 Upper Receiver. The M4E1 upper receiver is a one-piece design combining the handguard mounting platform with the upper itself. Through superior engineering, we have condensed the parts needed to mount a free-floated handguard to a mere 8 screws. Since the handguard mounting surface and upper are of the same forging, not only is it a stronger system, but we are able to make additional lightening cuts to save weight and allow for more efficient cooling. Features:  M4 Feedramps .250 takedown pin hole Comes assembled, with dust cover and forward assist installed Handguard mounting platform is forged into the receiver Works with Aero Precision handguards but also fits most BAR-system handguards Barrel nut and wrench are included  Aero Precision Enhanced Gen 2 M-Lok Handguard Gen 2 Enhanced M-LOK Handguard Changes include the addition of quick disconnect sling sockets, enhanced milling design for grip and visual appeal and a new profile for the picatinny top rail. Our Enhanced M-LOK (EM) Handguards provide a lightweight free float design for your custom AR15 build. The M-LOK system allows advanced modularity past the current 1913 picatinny rail system. Machined to mil-spec dimensions and engineered to perfection, this handguard eliminates bulk while retaining strength and stability. Features:  1pc free float design Built in anti-rotation tabs Scalloped rails Continuous top rail 1.72"" inside diameter fits most muzzle devices and 1.5"" suppressors Compatible with low profile gas blocks Gen 2 Feature - Quick disconnect sling socket at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions Gen 2 Feature - Additional milling along flats to aid with gripping and add visual appeal Gen 2 Feature - New profile for the continuous picatinny top rail  Bolt Carrier Group     8620 Steel Bolt Carrier 9310 Bolt MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) Hydraulically Staked CL Key Grade 8 Screws to Mil-spec Made in the USA Nitride Heat Treating for Heavy Duty use Nitride Bolt Carrier Group  16” Stainless Steel Barrel    Barrel Length: 16” Gas System: Carbine Chamber: 223 Wylde Twist Rate: 1:9 Gas Port: 0.750” Thread Pitch: ½” x 28 Feed Ramps: M4 Net Weight: 29.2 oz.

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. The stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. MADE IN THE USA"

Flights back to the east coast to see my parents are racking up on my credit card, and now my car is having trouble starting on the colder mornings. I had this listed at $650 before but I'm dropping it to $425 AND I will pay the transfer fee ($60 at Bighorn Firearms in Denver). This a 9mm Sig Sauer P226 handgun in good condition. This gun has a carbon steel slide that was manufactured in Germany, but the frame, internals, assembly, and testing was done in America. Serial number is U-622-4XX, which puts it around 1998 or 1999 according to a thread on sigforum.com. There is no date code (date proof letters) because it was assembled in the US. Custom work has been performed by TJ's Custom Gunworks (google him - crappy website, amazing work). Work was done when it was with a previous owner, but I contacted TJ and he said that the work was done by him (his work is well known on Sig forums). Internals have been polished which makes the action very smooth, feed ramp is polished, chrome trigger, and the barrel block has been jeweled. I bought this gun used and right after I purchased it I replaced the slide roll pins, recoil spring, trigger bar spring, firing pin spring, decocking lever spring, and slide catch spring. I have kept this thing immaculately clean and it has very little wear and absolutely no cracks or concerning flaws.Comes with four 15 round magazines (9mm). No trades. Will not ship. Will not meet anywhere other than Bighorn Firearms in Denver."

This is my prize bolt action rifle. I built it when I got into long range shooting. The receiver is a Remington 700 tactical pre-Freedom group built chambered in 308. Bolt is a custom made from PTG from solid stainless steel and spiral fluting and sako extractor. I installed a custom light ejector spring to prevent brass being kicked far out and reduce damage. Barrel is Krieger 5R with fitted muzzle brake. Factory trigger tuned to approximately 2.2 lbs. Receiver is bedded and lugged with HS precision stock. Scope is a Leopold Vari-X 3 24x power scope with target reticle and custom turrets. Custom built scope rings by my smith back in West Virginia.
This rifle is painfully accurate and light on recoil. At 200 meters it makes 1 solid hole. I've shot this to 800 meters with ease with amazing groupings. This is my pride rifle and it hurts to let it go.
Asking price is 2500 or best offer. Cash only. CHL or transfer via dealer of your choice or via my business."
