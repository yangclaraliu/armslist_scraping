I purchased this gun from a collector who represeneted it as unfired new and I believe him. It includes original box, manual, and warranty papers. The gun is pristine and speaks for itself. It is stainless steel with the very rare 2 1/2"" full lug barrell, original Lew Horton style finger grove combat grips, red ramp front sight, and adjustable rear. The grips are not marked and fit very tightly. Truely a collector's prize. If you want a piece of S&W history to add to your collection, or just a great big hand cannon, this is it. I have seen these guns go for $1750. plus. My price is $1500. OBO. Call or text only to REDACTED. Low ballers and E-mails will get NO RESPONSE."

I unfortunately do NOT have any magazines/clips or ammo for it, and it certainly will need a thorough cleaning before firing it again, after having sat for such a long time. Also, the lever lock seems to be stuck, and would also need fixing, however, aside from that, the overall condition of the rifle itself is practically brand new, from the barrel to the stock. I would repair it all myself, however, I simply do not have the tools or time to repair it myself. I am askn $300/OBO, and am willn to budge a little for a serious offer.

Some states have enacted laws that restrict common features, including a pistol grip and adjustable stock. Somehow they believe that these features make firearms more dangerous. For law abiding citizens that own these weapons, it could mean confiscation and possibly criminal prosecution. The FRS-15 Rifle Stock is designed help law abiding citizens keep their firearms in compliance with these laws. Replacing the pistol grip and adjustable stock with the FRS-15 rifle stock, effectively eliminates these two prohibited characteristics while preserving all of the weapons functionality. It took nearly two years of research and development for the FRS-15 Rifle Stock to reach its current form. It is an excellent blend of form and function. Shooters of all types will appreciate the feel of its traditional hunting rifle style curved grasp and solid shouldering. With multiple sling hard points and adjustable cheek rise, (optional) the FRS-15 can be easily configured for hunting, plinking, tactical training, or competition shooting."""

While they were much maligned when they first came out due to the odd ""fish gill"" slide serrations, their lack of sales have led to scarcity and surging prices now. Called the most effective combat handgun by some, the Rough Texture Frame Glocks are legendary. The amazingly grippy frame texture is perfect for extended range sessions, or that extra boost of confidence when drawing your handgun.This example is in great condition with few signs of wear. No barrel wear whatsoever, and meticulously maintained. Comes with its original box and 1 LEO/GOV'T RESTRICTED magazine. Do not miss out on this, as RTF2 Glock 17s are becoming more and more hard to find. The RTF2 frame was more often ordered on 40 cal handguns, which means the 9mms are more scarce. If you have any questions, or would like to see more photos, feel free to contact me.(*Aftermarket barrel in photo not included*)Target shown is 20 rounds (over two magazines) at 10 yards standing."

Features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. Spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. Hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Picatinny rail allows the use of any aftermarket optical, electronic or flip-up sighting system. Backbone of the rifle is formed by the barrel and its extension which runs rearward to serve as bolt group guide and structural support for external housing which is made of plastic. Uses STANAG (M16 / Ar15 compatible) magazines and magazine release lever is centrally located in front of the magazine housing. To release the magazine, one has to push this lever backwards and this can be done by either non-firing hand or by the back of the firing hand depending on situation and user preferences.                               Caliber-Gauge .223 REM.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions. 
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the fi eld of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Model: Stainless steel
Includes: original Ruger plastic box, manual, paperwork, etc.
Condition: This gun is new I think – I don’t recall ever firing it and cannot see signs of where.
 
Double-action trigger. Operates on the classic Browning short-recoil principle.
Slide mounted decocking & saftey lever.
Metal-frame constructed from hard-coated investment cast A356T6 aluminum alloy.
Barrel fabricated from heat-treated 400-series stainless steel.
Other small parts (including hammer and trigger) made of stainless steel for longevity and holding up under harsh, moist conditions. Barrel: 4.5 inches long.
Oversize trigger guard to permit safe function with a gloved hand. Front of the trigger guard bow is recurved to accommodate the support-hand forefinger in a two-hand hold.
The rear sight is dovetail drift-adjustable for windage; front and rear sights have white-dot inserts for high visibility.
Unlike many competitors, Ruger completely re-engineered the 45 caliber gun (it is NOT a worked over 9mm). For example, the slide is 0.100 inches thicker than the Ruger 9mm to accommodate the larger 45 round,
In addition to the increased thickness of the P90 slide, there are several other external differences between it and previous P-Series pistols. Trigger mechanism was completely redesigned from the 9mm -- the result is a double-action trigger pull that is distinctly smoother and more even.  The release on the P90 is reversible; you decide which side you want it on and then leave it there until you change your mind.   
Ruger also upgraded the 45 floorplate over the 9mm model. It has an embossed Ruger eagle contoured to blend into the angles of the butt of the grip frame.  The floorplate is also thicker, allowing for a more positive seating when thrust home in a rapid under-pressure reload. 
A real pleasure to shoot and certainly as concealable as the ever popular Model 1911. It feels good in the hand and shoots well.
Ruger targeted this to be a “PDW”—Personal Defense Weapon— the standard to which they are engineered. According to military and law-enforcement procurement specifications, that amounts to 4.5-inch overall accuracy at 25 yards. The P90 passes with flying colors.  It’s a fine firearm and combines Ruger’s well-proven reliability, strength, and dependable performance with the greatest and most classic of all pistol cartridges."

Size: Medium frame. 
Flexible platform: Comes with extended 13 round magazine with custom Springfield Mag X-tension sleeve – this is like a full size weapon.  Or you can buy the shorter magazine that holds 10 rounds (without the extension sleeve) -- this transforms the gun into a smaller, easier to carry weapon.
XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.
The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness.* This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.(No trades. No silly low offers -- these messges will not be returned.)"

The Springfield Armory® XD® Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol has all the same great features as the standard XD pistol, only with the custom extended length (a full 5"") barrel.  The 5"" barrel provides a longer sight radius for enhanced accuracy, and faster recovery between shots to keep the shooter on target during rapid fire.  This is exactly the way it came from the factory -- no alterations were made.
This is a full-sized semi-automatic pistol meant for law enforcement, home defense, field carry, and tactical deployments. The ergonomic design of Springfield XD pistols optimizes pointability and shooting control. XDs have durable polymer frames and a Melonite®-coated forged steel slides.
Checkering on the frame provides a solid grip to keep the pistol in place when shooting, and dual slide serrations provide a secure hold when loading or clearing the weapon.
A grip safety (similar to a 1911) blocks the weapon from firing unless the safety is depressed, which happens naturally when the pistol is held correctly, but automatically goes ""on safe"" when the shooter's hold is released.
An articulated safety lever built into the trigger blade backs up the grip safety.
A loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition.
3-dot, steel sights on this semi-automatic pistol provide rapid sight acquisition, and are dovetailed into the slide for easy replacement with after market night sights.
Integral rail on the frame allows the attachment of aftermarket tactical sights and lights. An ambidextrous magazine release accommodates either hand.
The Springfield Armory XD Tactical Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance.* This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.(No trades. No silly low offers -- these messges will not be returned.)"
