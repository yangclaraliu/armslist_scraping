Mostly 5 and 6 shot.2x 30 round drum magazines2x 10 round magazines2x 4 round magazinesIt is true this is no longer imported, and not even the new RPK Molot shotguns come in 410. If you want to legally hunt with an AK-47, this is how you can in Ohio. For deer I recommend Brenneke Slugs. 1900fps and 800lb ft.  Turkey has to be within 25 yards, and I'd use Remington HD 000 Buckshot, and know your pattern. I have $1600 spent on this shotgun package"

I bought this rifle and the accessories from a law enforcement distributor and never got around to firing it due to my health. I doubt I will be able to use it, so it is for sale. Included in the package is:1 Brand New Springfield Armory M1A .308 semi-auto rifle with 18 inch barrel and factory black synthetic stock1 Set of original box and papers and one factory 20 round magazine1 Factory Tactical Case - Black w/magazine pockets1 Black Rifle Sling10 Brand New 20 round metal magazines, still in factory packaging200 Rounds Fiocchi FMJ NATO ammunition.
I HAVE REDUCED THE PRICE OF THIS PACKAGE AS OF 8/10 FROM $1799 TO $1600. ACT NOW TO GET A DEAL. BEFORE YOU MAKE AN OFFER, TAKE A MOMENT TO CONSIDER EVERYTHING YOU ARE GETTING. I AM NOT DESPERATE TO SELL THIS RIFLE, SO LOWBALL OFFERS JUST WASTE YOUR TIME AND MINE. IF YOU ARE OFFERING A TRADE, I ENJOY HIGH GRADE 1911'S, CLASSIC SMITH AND WESSON REVOLVERS, AND CERTAIN POLYMER PISTOLS SUCH AS GLOCK AND H&K. I AM NOT IN THE MARKET FOR M&P'S OR SIG P320'S AT THIS TIME.Serious inquiries only please. I will listen to reasonable offers, but the key word is ""reasonable"". The rifle package can be seen by appointment at my office in Homestead.  To purchase you will need a Florida Driver's license and sign a bill of sale.
I will consider partial trades on other high quaality firearms. I like high quality 1911's and classic revolvers, but have an interest in most good quality defense oriented firearms as well. So if you can use a good rifle package and have a handgun or handguns to trade, let me hear about it. Face to face transactions are preferred, but I may be able to ship this rifle to your FFL at your expense if you are not local.
Thanks for looking at my listing."

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 300 finished in our Mil Spec + Cerakote has all the same modularity and functionality as our popular V11 Carbine, but was built to accommodate the versatile .300 Blackout cartridge. This caliber offers projectiles with increased bullet weight which substantially increases its effectiveness on target all while reducing felt recoil to the operator. The DDM4V11 300 features a free-floating Cold Hammer Forged, 16” S2W barrel with 1:8 twist and carbine-length gas system—tuned to reliably cycle a wide range of 300 Blackout cartridges. The V11 features the KeyMod attachment system integrated into our SLiM RAIL 15.0, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from a Daniel Defense product. The longer 15” rail features an uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachments at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions, ensuring plenty of real estate for optics and accessories. It also allows maximum sight radius, for more accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights, and provides operators with the option to extend the support hand out closer to the muzzle in order to drive the gun more precisely and help prevent over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Daniel Defense’s rugged Buttstock and Pistol Grip provide the comfort and ergonomics needed for optimal control. The V11 300 is designed to be shot suppressed and un-suppressed utilizing various types of supersonic and subsonic ammunition. For reliable operation we recommend .300 supersonic ammunition while shooting un-suppressed, and subsonic ammunition should only be used with a suppressor. The utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-suppressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

Product Description The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72 bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

Browning, of course, makes some of the finest guns on the market today. The BPS is a unique shotgun on today's market because it is a bottom eject gun. This is concenient for lefties, but also for righties, because if you have to pick up your spent shells, you don't have to go chasing them. This design also affords the user the shortest slide action available, which means faster follow-up shots. This is a great gun for clays or for taking down game. It currently has a 21"" battle with rifle sights, perfect for turkey. Don't miss out on this one!"

I have a new in box Vortex 6-24x50 FFP scope for sale. It does have the EBR-2C illuminated reticle on it. I have all paperwork inside the box that it comes with. This is an amazing scope to look through I just decided to go a different route. I also have a Midwest Industries 30mm QD mount that would go perfect with it if wanted but it is not added to the list price. If interested in the mount I'd take $160 for it because it's new also.

Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use."
