I enjoy shooting what I own, have several 1911s and just cant bring myself to shoot this nearly beauty.  This is a pre 70 series colt 1911, with a nearly perfect beutiful deep bluing. These 1911s came with desirable adjustable Elliason adjustable sights and slide lightening machining from the factory. 100% hand fitted by Colt gunsmiths back when that meant something powerful.  The slide machining and springs mean you should only use light power ammo as it is designed to be a match gun.  Grandpa trashed the box, paperwork and tools, so this is pistol only.You really need to see this in person to appreciate the beauty, so I will not ship.  Value at $2000.http://harv.f0e.net/natmatch/"

Both with medium grips you you can buy other grips fairly cheap aroun $40 usually and these are extremely versatile. Great double action only gun for carrying safely. You basically get 2 guns for one price. I'll throw in 100 rounds cci of either caliber or a box of each or 150 rounds 9mm Ram hallow point Ammo you choose. Please call or text as emails will be ignored 3one6 two58 7six55 I recommend a good cleaning and lube before firing because it's been sitting dry for a while now but you can easily see how clean it is. I'm pretty sure the 9mm has never even fired as I bought the kit off eBay I'm not 100% but it's clean. I'll listen to any similar value trade offers. In firearms ATVs  motorcycles pretty much anything I might have fun with. thanks
