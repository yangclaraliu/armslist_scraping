Among these was the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) which was a finely tuned hunting machine of near-perfect balance and unparalleled accuracy never really seen before in a semi automatic rifle. Today, the BAR is still manufactured by Browning and Miroku out of Japan and even FN Herstal has begun manufacturing their own version of the BAR. Finding a BAR that still carries the branding of Browning and FN Herstal is beyond rare. This particular firearm came off the line in Belgium in 1969 and comes with a Bushnell optic from the same time period. This rifle is in good condition and is chambered in 7mm Remington Magnum making it ideal for big game hunting anywhere in North America and beyond! This is an extremely rare find for a truly serious collector."

You are looking at a 1999 Smith & Wesson Model 64-6 no-lock .38 Special six-shot revolver. The gun is made of corrosion-resistant stainless steel built on a S&W K-frame. The pictures were taken when it wore an older pair of Uncle Mike's grips, but they were too worn and torn for such a nice gun and have been replaced with a better condition pair of Uncle Mike's grips. It is double action only (DAO) with a factory-bobbed hammer. It has a notched rear sight, ramped front sight, and 4"" heavy barrel with a bright shiny bore and cylinder chambers.This classic S&W revolver is in excellent operating and good aesthetic condition. It was a law enforcement trade-in and was hand-selected from the shop's inventory as a limited use gun with very few rounds put through it. It was not carried or fired on a regular basis, but there are some cosmetic marks from occasional carry and storage. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.I have fired 100 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. It is the most accurate gun I have ever had the pleasure of firing and is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is very versatile. It is dependable and durable enough to carry or use as a house/vehicle gun. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails from folks who did not meet or were not able to verify the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now.

Also like a proper carry gun, it was well taken care of, with the internals inspected by a smith before it was relegated to safe queen status a while back. Timing and lock up remain in spec and the crane is tight -- no whipping the cylinder shut in the life of this revolver.No trades -- selling to fund other projects."
