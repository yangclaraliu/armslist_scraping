Some history behind the Security Force SKS's, there were only about a palette or two imported and were only imported once through KFS. They were made from certain factories and were made specifically for the Chinese Security Forces (the chinese police) and were made to higher standards than normal Norinco SKS's.

This is PWS's first foray into the direct impingement market. This is NOT your standard DI rifle, as PWS puts their custom touches on even their DI gun that separates it from the rest of the crowd.The bolt carrier group is PWS’s Enhanced Bolt Carrier. It is precision machined and isonite treated (just like the barrel). The bolt carrier has increased mass (it is significantly thicker than a standard BCG) which should both extend dwell time and slightly delay unlock. What this means is that it allows the chamber pressure to be reduced making extraction easier and thus accumulating less wear and tear on the system.There are a number of gaps and channels between skid pads on the BCG which provides fewer points of contact. With fewer points there should be less overall friction, and this should reduce the accumulation of residue and grime, as well as further reduce wear and tear.The Buffer Tube, machined from a single piece of 6061 aluminum, is one of the important features. It has a lip that extends into the receiver and provides support against carrier tilt (not as important since this is a direct impingement system). It has four drain holes to prevent hydrostatic locking of the reciprocating buffer, and is fluted to shed debris. It uses a standard carbine length H2 buffer and spring. The difference between this buffer and more commonly available ones is that the buffer itself is a tungsten weight housed in a steel body, coated in nickel Teflon. So it is both heavier and slicker. The tube uses a hex bolt to help align the tube to the lower receiver and two locking allen heads at the top to keep the buffer tube from rotating on the lower. If you are not familiar with the PWS buffer tube, what this boils down to is: No. More. Castle. Nut. On the Modern Musket this buffer tube also has a six-position stop, allowing for standard AR collapsible stocks to be attached.The barrel is a 1:8 twist that's been isonite coated, for maximum longevity and accuracy. The Rail is a PWS keymod rail, which is EXTREMELY lightweght. The muzzle device is PWS's factory FSC556 muzzle break/flash hider which does an excellent job at keeping muzzle rise down.The trigger is an ALG combat defense trigger, which tuned by Geissele for smooth take up. The charging handle is a BCM gunfighter, for easy of manipulating the weapon.scope is a 4x Primary Arms sitting on a American Defense quick release mount. Also has quality backup flip up sites Comes with a nice hard case, 6 pmags of assorted capacities 10,30,40It is precision machined and isonite treated (just like the barrel).

I know, you've been advised to move to 6.5 Creedmoor, right?  Even though the .270 is faster and harder hitting?  Before you buy that 6.5 line of hype, think about what you really need and want in a rifle and cartridge.  I can understand if you're recoil sensitive and fear the .270 and 30.06 rifles.  But if you're not, keep reading for a great deal on a shooter/collector setup. Ruger INTERNATIONAL (full length Mannlicher stock) RSI M77 shot very little and taking up room in the safe for far too long.  Produced only for a short time in center fire calibers.  It has an original Redfield Company scope, and there were not a lot of these rifles made.  It was purchased in the eighties for an Elk hunt that never transpired due to health problem.  This is the International model with the long Mannlcher wood stock.  I have seen them, though rarely, in other calibers and this one is .270 Win, so ammo is easy to find all over, a fast, flat shooting and highly respected hunting caliber.   It will come with ammo and some once fired brass as well as reloading dies.  It has a nice leather sling, too.  So, is this a DEAL?  BET on it.  Cash is best, but a quality firearm is never unwelcome.    Thanks for looking.  Face to face, guys, no shipping.  Still here, a pending sale fell through when a guy brought a really rough trade to the table and then tried to tell me I HAD to honor it.  I should take junk for an excellent rifle?  We had no deal, only conversation and bullshit.  He asked for photos, I sent photos.  I asked for photos, he sent a stock advertisement photo for M1... not even close to the garbage he brought to meet me.  I would have accepted an excellent M1, added money for an ACR... but I can find junk along the highway.  I might even take HK hammer fired pistol as part trade as in P30, P2000, or as even trade HK Mk23.  But no junk, please.  If you don't have cash, then I need to see real and recent photos of your trade firearm as ell as your thoughts on what you expect me to accept in terms of what your trade is worth."

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

And for all of the nickel and dimers out there in Armslist land (of which I'm not one but you know who you all are), I paid $500 for this gun, brand new, last year so we'll call it $450 since it's in mint condition and only 50 rounds down the pipe. The custom holster is an $80 holster, specifically designed for this gun right in front of my eyes, but we'll say $60. The DeSantis holster was $25,we'll call it $20. The pistol came with one mag, and they're $35 each (average cost of a P345 magazine) but we'll just call it $35 total because getting a gun with one mag sucks. $450+$60+$20+$35=$565That should satisfy you number crunchers. That's not including the ammo.That all being said, I'm only looking for $400.If you're interested, then feel free to shoot me a message and we can talk.Thanks a lot."

This particular model never came with any kind of scope mounts like some later models did. I had a professional tap some holes to mount scope mounts. mount included. This gun was also upgraded with TJ's custom liner and re-chambered from Mike Sayers in Kentucky. Reason I relined it was a bore scope showed some ring marks I wasn't happy with. It will shoot extremely accurate with this competition liner. Liner isn't even broke in yet, as I've been preoccupied with different things. The brass disc in the stock is from a Swedish Mauser. It's used to show the bore condition. I have no idea how that came to be placed into this stock. Where that is on the stock should be a Mauser cartouche? These clips can be finicky and sometimes don't feed right. This one has been adjusted to feed satisfactorily, but has bent marks on top. Solid heavy gun in great shape for its age.

Has plenty of field wear for that good old WWII feeling. Locks up well, shoots fine.Bought this at a gun show a long time ago. Neat historical curiosity but I never shoot it. Includes a holster of sorts and a box of ammo.Terrible self-defense gun. The trigger is like lifting a bowling ball. I don't know why the British made them DAO. The .38S&W is so slow out of the barrel you can actually see the bullet. The .38-200s must have been even slower, being heavier bullets. Do not buy this for a range gun, buy it because you like ancient top-break revolvers. Selling to fund other purchase.Gun comes with 50 rounds of .38 S&W to get you started.Extra pics with more detail and gun numbers are here: https://imgur.com/a/Iok7MPrice is $375 cash or best reasonable offer.
