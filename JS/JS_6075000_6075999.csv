They are both in the .32 Winchester caliber. However, one of the two has the factory target sights and according to collector handbooks, units with the factory target sights are rare and worth 3x the normal value. This pistol is in nice shape
There are 2 of these for sale; one of them is fully functional and dry fires fine. It has not been shot in many, many years, and was part of an inheritance.
The second one is a revolver has no serial numbers hidden by the grips. There is a “G6185” that appears in front of the cylinder. There is another marking on the underside of the barrel, looks to be 894B. I can only guess that this gun was produced some time between 1905 and 1934, but can’t tell without further help from a gunsmith.
This one also has an issue with the cylinder retainer; it should stay back but the spring that holds it is apparently broken. The action moves fine if you make sure that the cylinder release is all the way back. This one appears to be a mod 4 version, and the other may be a mod 3; I am not sure.
The one with the factory target sights has been valued at $1,200, and the other has been valued at $400 once the cylinder retainer spring is replaced, so I am pricing both of them for $1,400, for a faster sale."

Excellent reviews on this rifle!From Daniel Defense: 
The Daniel Defense V7 LW is the first rifle in the DDM4 lineup to feature the M-LOK® attachment technology with the Daniel Defense MFR XS 15.0 rail. Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 16” lightweight profile barrel, the V7 has a DD improved Flash Suppressor to reduce flash signature. The mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any condition and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts.  A free-floating MFR XS 15.0 handguard offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 6 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 LW has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the user may require.  The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

History: I purchased this gun after going to a range and firing my friends TRP 1911, it was my first time firing a ""range toy"" and I fell in love. Well that novelty faded more me and I no longer wish to own this pistol as I spent a pretty penny on it I would prefer to own a few other pistols. As far as how much it has been shot - no more than 500 rounds have been fired through this gun. All of the roungs fired were brass cased Freedom Munitions rounds or LAX rounds. The gun is a joy to shoot, but I have changed tastes.
What you get with this purchase:
-Spring Field TRP 1911 Black (Armory Kote) (Pictured)
-4 Stainless Steel Magazines - 7 rounds each (Pictured)
-5 A-Zoom Red Snapcaps (Pictured)
-Replacement Diamond Checkered Wood Grips (Pictured)
-Adjustable sights, keep in mind installed on the gun are Trijicon Night Sights (Pictured)
-608 .45 ACP rounds (200 LAX Rounds/408 Freedom Munitions Rounds) (Pictured)
-Wilson Combat 1911 Tool, Hex Wrench for Rod, and 4 grip replacement screws (Pictured)
-Bore Stores 1911 Case to house your new TRP 1911 (Pictured)
In case you didn't know, which if you are looking at this post you should know, the Springfield 1911 TRP is Springfield's Armory top of the line 1911, it is as nice as you go in the 1911 world without going custom.
I am in no hurry to sell this gun. That being said, I am accepting offers.

Below is information about the gun from the manufactorer's website - springfield armory:
The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

Adjustable Steel Sights Metal Folding Stock Bayonet Lug This gun is built like a tank, yet a pull on the charging handle has the sound and smooth feel of fine machinery. Likewise the folding stock, which locks open positively and securely, with no play; and it's very easy to deploy. With a forged steel receiver, the Golani is a rugged/solid weapon, combining the best features of the AK and the AR. Used by the Israeli Army for years, the Golani was finally replaced as their service rifle; not because there was a better weapon out there, but because the Golani was heavy, as an all-steel gun will be. But you probably won't be humping it every day all day like the Israeli soldiers did. The tag describes it as used, but I haven't shot it and it appears unfired, just as it did when I got it from an estate sale in its original box (sorry, I don't have the box anymore). Look at the pictures and I think you'll agree - it's in better than excellent condition."

I have a Ruger SUPER Blackhawk .44 mag that is ready to go out and slay some deer this year. This monster of a revolver is in working order and the perfect platform to take down a deer or whatever else needs putting down. However there is some pitting on it but does not affect the function of it at all. This is not a collectors grade gun, but its still a big awesome beast slaying machine. Action is nice and smooth like you'd expect with a Ruger and the SAO trigger pull is pleasent at around 3lbs. The cylinder is over engineered for ever the hottest of rounds like Ruger typically does on all it's revolvers. Also has nice adjustable rear sight. It comes with a nice tanned leather case and genuine walnut Herretts sharpshooter grips. Make me an offer, trades are welcome. Price is $400, Located in Marysville (Thursday evening thru Monday afternoon) or Athens (Monday evening thru Thursday afternoon)"
