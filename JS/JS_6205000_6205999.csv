And a good conceal carry holster that will go with it as well. I am asking $550 for it and am pretty firm on the price. Buyer must pass background check! This is  absolutely nonnegotiable! If you don't pass you don't get it. Buyer responsible for transfer and background check fees. I would prefer if the  transaction/background check was done at my FFL. Witch is in Lakewood off of west Colfax. Will give name and address of FFL if you decide to buy it.       Email me for more pictures. Thanks for looking!

The butt stock is a reproduction replacement, but the stock itself is in very good condition, with just one shallow dent on the left side of the fore end. This is a light rifle, so would work well for a beginner, or an easy pack for the seasoned shooter.

The only component not Springfield of those identified is the trigger housing, which is Winchester. Another nice feature of this rifle is that all the wood matches and the circle P armory stamp is pronounced on the pistol grip. A previous owner has slightly damaged the left side of the receiver stock where another cartouche mark would have been. Anyway, all of the components are tight, the barrel shows good rifleings, and there is no sign of rust anywhere. It comes with the sling that is pictured and six enblocs (ammo clips). This is a rifle that has a lot of rounds left in it, plus, as time goes by these are becoming more scares and more valuable.  Cash or USPS Money Order are only accepted methods of payment.
