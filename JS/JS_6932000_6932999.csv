The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. To enhance the beauty of this gun, our master engraver applies an elegant hand relief engraving to the flats of the slide. The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection.

This piece appears to be carried far more than fired, with the finish being close to 90%. It also wears factory night sights that are still quite bright. It has a thumb safety and the magazine disconnect, but I have found that the magazine disconnect actually has no effect on the quality of the trigger pull, so I don't mind it. I have replaced the rear slide plate with a Fixxer Punisher plate. This handgun includes an aftermarket Plano case, 2 blued 10 round magazines, and 3 stainless 10 round magazines, but only has the small backstrap that is already on the frame. Asking $400. Can do $350 without the stainless mags. Lowballers will be ignored, won't ship anywhere, must meet in person with a valid TN Driver's License.
 
(Note: Night sights are much brighter in the picture than they actually are. Picture is only to indicate that they are there.)"

The Model 59 is a lightweight version of the Model 50 with an aluminum receiver and ""Winlite"" barrel made from a thin steel tube wrapped in over 500 miles of fiberglass micro filament that was bonded and polished to look like blued steel. It has a 28"" full choke barrel and weighs only 6.5lbs. The barrel itself only weighs about 12 ounces. These only have a 2 shot magazine tube as they were marketed towards bird hunters. The Model 50 and 59 utilize a short recoil action much like most centerfire autoloading pistols, designed by David Marshall ""Carbine"" Williams. The infamous moonshiner who developed the short stroke gas piston used in the M1 carbine. There is a floating chamber in the barrel which the bolt locks into, this chamber recoils for a short distance upon firing and then allows the bolt to unlock and cycle the action. Unlike gas operated shotguns that use the expanding gasses of the burnt powder to drive a piston, or the Browning long recoil system in which the entire barrel recoils upon firing. There's one tiny scratch on the left of the receiver only visible in bright light, very minor finish wear where the bolt handle rides in the receiver, and light handling marks on the wood. Overall I'd call it 95-98%. Only about 85,000 of these were made between 1960-1965 and it was Winchesters last hand built shotgun before they automated their plant. Asking $500 firm and I am open to trades. I've run about 3 boxes of light target loads through this gun and it functions flawlessly. I can provide more pictures on request."

Magazine .223/5.56Accuracy, Reliability & QualityTesting and AccuracyCORE Rifle Systems continued research and development comes by no surprise. Genuine CORE Rifle System Barrels begin with raw bar stock cut to length. We then drill the bar stock and button rifle the bar stock. In the end, after all processes and procedures are met, we test our product. In our pursuit of excellence we invested in the Bill Wiseman Accuracy Test fixture. During the test phase, we mount completed uppers onto the test fixture and lock it in just as you would on a complete lower. We then insert a typical magazine and fire for effect. The Test Fixture employs a pneumatic firing process which means no human error on manipulating the trigger. It fires the complete upper the same each and every time. By doing this, we look for initial groupings down range. We look for consistent three-hole groups on the target.Our most important goal is to achieve a tight three shot group on the target consistently. This also works extremely well on zeroing optics to the upper. The results with our CORE Rifle Systems barrels have been amazing. It gives you immediate feedback on accuracy and consistency. We use the Bill Wiseman Accuracy fixture on both .223/5.56 and .308 platforms manufactured by CORE Rifle Systems."

You will not be able to tell it's even been fired.  OD green, 16"", 5.56, box, manual and all documentation.

Also, please note: There have been several inquiries on this handgun wanting me to lower my price or ship it out of state. My price is firm. I will not negotiate as I know what it is worth. If you want the gun, pay $300 for it. If you don't want it for that price don't waste my time and yours. This a brand new firearm. There is nothing wrong with it, I just decided to go another direction. I don't have to sell it. If I don't sell it for my listed price, I will keep it. It's as simple as that. Also, I do not ship out of state, so don't ask. This is for sale specifically in the state of Alabama. Thanks."

These are no longer built, Zastava is too busy with military contracts and their 5.56 AKs will no longer be produced. This example works great with every style of magazine I have tried. This pistol has the US Machine Gun folding adapter with a KAK Industries tube with a shockwave blade. Magpul K grip is perfect for this pistol configuration. Also currently has an ALG enhanced trigger in it, which was fit perfectly to the rifle, and provides a rediculous trigger pull both in weight and travel. It is easy to rip off a magazine if you want to, or get accurate shots. Comes as described without pictured sling, -$50 without the ALG trigger.These are pistols, not rifles. They have arm braces on them, which now according to the ATF, is not ""redesigned"" with use outside of their original purpose. Only face to face deals, I am tired of talking to people through here only to find out they are scammers, will not ship.Trades, interested in AK-74's not 47's.

It is used, as pictured, and there is holster swear and various scuffs. I believe the hammer may be aftermarket, as the strut length requires the little cup in the mainspring housing to not be pinned down (something common with using aftermarket hammers in older MSH Springfields, apparently). Comes with the grips pictured, two magazines, the case/papers, the magazine belt slide, and I believe I have the holster that came with it kicking around somewhere as well. It runs fantastically, it's quite accurate, and I think you'll enjoy it. Asking $625 if you're in the Denver metro, if I have to ship it my FFL charges me $30 to ship it anywhere in the lower 48.Will trade plus cash on your end for 45acp or 9mm ammo. Maybe a 590a1 valued at 300."

It does have minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, but only lightly handled. There are no major flaws/defects to be found on this pistol anywhere. The grips are nice and intact with the FNH Insignia on either side. There are no rips, tears, or gouges on either side of the grip, which features an ambidexterous mag release, allowing it to be held and released with either hand. The slide is in similar condition, with no severe scratches, or scrapes, rusting, or discoloration, though there are a couple of small, shallow nicks and cuts from having been handled. This pistol comes in the original FN Herstal carry case, and comes with 3 14-Round Magazines, as well as the original owner's manual, and trigger lock. This would make a great addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

Increased transparency in the blue spectral range enables outstanding recognition of details under low-light conditions. The MIL-DOT reticle is equipped with continuous illumination. It can be dimmed as far as needed to prevent the reticle from over-illuminating the target image even at night. The control electronics are equipped with a memory function which guarantees that the same brightness level is used that was previously set.
