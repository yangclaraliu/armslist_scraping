I'd be especially interested in a MEC universal charge bar. If that's not available, I'd be seeking MEC 302 or 502 series standard bars that would throw 7/8 oz., 1 oz., or 1 1/4 oz. of shot and as many powder bushings in popular sizes as I can find and afford. I might be interested in other reloading components you'd be interested in selling, such as wads or shot or Remington gun club hulls. In short, if you have MEC reloading components that are gathering dust and lying about unused, I'll be interested in buying them from you. No need to hassle with listing them here or on Ebay and dealing with the headaches of liquidating your unused MEC equipment. If you are getting out of reloading or parting out your equipment, this would be your perfect opportunity to offload your gear onto me, a local guy looking to get into it.  Please note that I am not interested in abused or worn components; I will pay a fair price for functional components based on their condition. I have cash in hand and am willing to travel a reasonable distance to buy from you. Thanks for your consideration. Please reply to this post with what you've got and your asking price. Thanks-- Steve"

The gun is real nice and conservatively in 97% with a few small scratches. I bought the scope on eBay for a good price, and have added it to the package, but I believe that the rear mount on the gun might not be compatible with the plunger type mount on the scope, so I didn't mount it. The scope does have some finish scratches, but the adjustments and tapering crosshairs are just fine. I suspect that someone a little smarter than me can get it mounted. These Balvar scopes are among the better quality rifle scopes in the 50's and 60's until they were discontinued in 1963, the same year as the gun. B&L was the leading manufacturer of optics at the time. Oh, a nice leather sling and sling swivels are included. And note that it has the original front sight hood and butt plate"
