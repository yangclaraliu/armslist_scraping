This rifle is intensely accurate with Federal 100 grain soft points, that accurate my GF was popping balloons at 250 yards with it shooting prone. I have regularly got sub-MOA groups with it using this load, some around the 1/2"" mark for 3 shots. I have had this rifle for 5 years, used it to kill several deer including a very nice 12 pointer... Only reason I'm considering parting with it is because I want to get into the AR scene *or* I would like a big-bore lever gun. I will be able to throw money in on the trade if I like the rifle that is offered enough. This rifle comes with 79 rounds of loaded 100 grain Federal's, and a box of empty brass.

Just the slides are selling for $280 on eBay just the bare slide so your getting a great deal for only $200 specially since the mag's are over $60.Priced cheap also because money is going to be donated to my wife's work for an employee.  Gun shoots amazing and has been my bedroom defense gun under the pillow for 2 years less than 150 rounds total through it. Great for someone who don't care about looks or simply go get it ceroketed which will fill all the scratches and will look new again.pick up in Utica only.  20 min from Johnstown an 20 min from Newark
