These were specifically re-barreled to accept .308/7.62x51 in the 1950's as the 7x57 round was becoming obsolete, however, not all of them were re-chambered. This allowed for the more common .308 and 7.62x51 rounds to be used instead. If you desire an inexpensive rifle to stash or simply want a reliable .308/7.62x51 rifle to enjoy at the range, then this is the rifle for you.    These are stock photos – exact condition will vary.   Must be 18+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $224.99 - ONLY ONE AVAILABLE"

I bought this with a chassis, which I now want to do something different with. If I recall correctly, it got a expedited bore break (ex: clean, shoot one, clean, shoot 5, clean, shoot 5, clean, etc) with brass fittings and nylon coated dewey rods, bore guide, etc.
Nothing stupid was done to this barrel; no real rapid fire, no mag dumps, no full out, no suppressed, etc. It was treated as the only barrel I'd ever be able to have, ever.
Has less than 500 rounds for sure, probably less than 200 rounds. It's getting hard to keep track. No bi-metal jacket ammo (steel cased) used in it.
$250 to meet locally. More to ship it.
Considering the barrels are -at least- $380 new, the Vortex is at least $50 new, and the pin+weld job was $50; this should be a pretty good deal!"

The Beretta APX, utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, can be easily modified with a replaceable grip frame housing and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The lightweight frame housing is made of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The APX’s extremely low profile and snag free design make it easy to carry and draw from a holster. Ease of use was the key driver in the development of the APX. A slide catch lever is located on both sides of the frame. The operating/locking system is based on a tilt-barrel, locked breech. Beretta APX pistols have a unique feature that allows the user to deactivate the internal striker mechanism prior to disassembly. This means the pistol can be field stripped without pulling the trigger. The Trigger Safety stops the trigger from traveling rearward through inertia, in the event the pistol is dropped. When the trigger is intentionally pulled, the Trigger Safety is instantly deactivated. The high-definition 3-dot sight system is designed for quick target acquisition. The new sight system, patented by Beretta, allows the user to adjust both front and rear sights. The sights can be removed for replacement with other types of sights. Thanks to a newly patented modular system, the pistol adapts to different hand sizes with interchangeable back-straps of different thickness and configuration for individualized performance. The pistol comes with a standard Picatinny rail (MIL STD 1913) under the barrel. Frame safety, magazine safety, and a loaded chamber indicator are available on request. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.Specifications:Caliber: 9 x 19 mmWeight Unloaded: 27 ouncesBarrel Length: 4.25 in.

WW2 German PP/PPK/HSC? holster + US M3 Enger Press '44 Holster, $145 shipped insured I do not know militaria that well so if I am off base here feel free to make an offer.
The German holster's leather is in good shape I THINK this is for a PP/PPK or HSC not 100% sure any advice is appreciated, it is inscribed with a German name Eugen Cohausz Sudlohn (Sudlohn is a province in Germany?) and an American David Watson 30112389 Col. 3BN. 395R presumably the man who captured it. The leather strap/latch is a bit cracked weak ill add more photos to illustrate it. Waffenamt is clear, no indication of a factory code anywhere. The M3 is dry and needs some TLC, inscribed with the pilots name SGT. Harry A. Vaughan 13153296 Phila PA. ""Butch"" and carved initials on the back side. Needs work as one of the male tabs/connectors is missing.
Ask if you want more photos of specific areas, looking to sell as a pair.
Mauser Banner barreled action, $325 Shipped Insured - Assuming this is 7mm Mauser (7x57), fair/good condition, some matching components (585). barrel retains half of the blued finish, other half is weathered like the rest. Bolt is not original but due to patina I think they've been paired for some time. Rear sight slider is stuck so it will need some penetrating oil love. More photos or questions? Ask.
Arisaka Type 99 Sniper, $2,200 Shipped Insured - Nagoya factory, numbers matching, staked screws, short cleaning rod, purchased this off the consignment rack. When I got it it had the typical closet find indicators (lint in the bore), some light surface rust in a few areas, staked screws, only bad part is the crack in the hand guard that was burned / repaired? All I did was give it a light ballistol rub and clean the bore (mirror) bolt, safety, firing pin had grease still packed in some areas. Ask if you want more photos of specific areas.
Kar 88 Carbine, $335 Shipped Insured - Erfurt 1894? (Hard to read the date stamp but I am fairly confident its 1894) Kar 88 n.m. Carbine - Shooter / Fair condition, this was purchased from an estate along with a bunch of other firearms, due to space and time constraints I have decided to thin the project herd, virtually untouched since I got her, just did an external wipe down with Ballistol and a bore snake. As you can see bore is practically shot out (ill try and redo the photos) and various dents on the barrel from who knows what. Some interesting characters on the right side buttstock (last photo). Receiver serial matches trigger guard, mismatched bolt, unit marked on the front sight housing.

Come in to the ctore, call us at 831-3106, or check out our website for more awesome stuff!!!!https://www.kelleystactical.com/Unlike every other firearm on the market, the SIG MCX was built for optimum performance with the 300BLK cartridge and a suppressor. The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes standard STANAG magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing the side-folding Pistol Stabilizing Brace. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle."

It shoots smooth accurate.  I've put maybe 200 rounds through it and it doesn't look like it was shot much before me. It does have some use marks on the exterior but nothing not to be expected from a 40-50 year old gun.

It installs and functions just like the HIPERTOUCH® 24 but with half the pre-travel and a faster reset. For installation and operational features of the HIPERTOUCH® family of AR fire-controls, go to the HIPERTOUCH® 24 page and watch the videos. A helpful read of the FCG Trouble Shooting Guide relates some issues customers will have during and after installation that are easily resolved with attention to detail and common sense. HIPERTOUCH® FCGs may not work in lowers with pivot holes that are outside the MIL-Spec dimensions. Also, will not work with many 45 short throw safeties, but works with mil-spec and most aftermarket ambidextrous safeties."

It has a thumb safety. Great condition and functionally perfect. Carried it a couple times but not much. I am including two brand name kydex holsters (bladetech and bravo concealment) and a streamlight tlr-1. One of the holsters is compatible with the light and one is not. I would be willing to discuss breaking up the equipment if you just want the light and the light compatible holster or just the gun and the non compatible holster. I don't want to sell the light without the compatible holster at this point. 2 magazines and original box included. Also have a couple hundred rounds of 9mm I am looking to part with potentially and could work into the deal. Just let me know if you want to discuss adding ammo to the deal and I'll get an accurate count. Pictures to come.
