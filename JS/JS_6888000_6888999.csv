The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
 
FEATURES: Safeties:  ambidextrous safety on both sides of frame. 
Loaded chamber indicator along side barrel.
Single and double action. Single action has a nice clean break -- it’s short, light (about five pounds) and crisp!
Real hammer fired – this is the classic hammer you can pull back with your thumb and actually feel and see firing the gun, a feature favored by many shooters as a more authentic shooting experience.
Breech-locking mechanism uses a Walther-style tilting locking block.
Construction: Steel barrel and slide.  Sturdy metal alloy frame.
5 inch barrel and military/ergonomic frame achieves legendary pointability and accuracy.
Recoil is very manageable. Strong, planted grip with checkered wood grips means that the recoil does not snap or kick  --  more of a ""push"" and really cushions the recoil.  Even shooters accustomed to a lighter round will be able to handle it very easily.
Full Pachmayer Signature Grips have full checkering all around (360 degrees) for a secure grip.
Double stack, high capacity magazine.
Field stripping is a snap, using Beretta’s sure-footed, quick lever takedown that easily removes the slide from the frame. From there, the recoil spring, guide tube and barrel are easily removed.
Unbeatable Taurus lifetime warranty (transferrable to all subsequent owners).
** The features, fit and finish of its more expensive cousins that it easily rivals. Note the absence of machine marks, a characteristic of higher end firearms.
 
Carry options: Drop the hammer all the way down and carry it chambered, hammer down, off safe for a first double action shot.  You can also keep the safety on, then thumb it off with and have a first double action shot.  If you are a 1911 fan, then you can also carry cocked and locked which is the hammer cocked, safety on with a first shot being single action.
Includes high capacity magazine."

This is a long range target rifle. 6.5 Grendel, with a .125 type 1 bolt. 26 inch Varmatch barrel from Krieger. Chambered and threaded by Apache Gun Works in LA. It has a JP Enterprises .936 adjustable gas block, under a 16.5-inch key-mod Free float handguard, that only weighs 15 ounces. Quick Detach 30mm, one-piece scope mount, that is rock solid, and does not mar the upper receiver or the 20-moa mount it sets on. The Neewer 6-25x56 MOA scope is currently sighted at 750 yards, with a laser and Hornady 123gn SST ammo. Removing the 20-moa mount puts you right on target at 100 yards. Bipod and key-mod bipod stud are included, as is a simple laser sight, mounted on the top-end of the handguard.
This is a serious weapon, and more than the average hunter needs. But If you want a nice Match rifle to take to the NRA Nationals, this is the weapon you’ve been looking for. It took me 7 and a half months just to get the barrel. The bolt carrier group from Cryptic Coats is as hard to get as the barrel, but I lucked up and only had to wait about a month. The scope is rare, and difficult to get from Japan. They only have one US distributer, and there always out. I will not answer Email about this rifle. If you’re interested, send me nothing but your phone number, and I’ll call you. I will meet in person at a gun store within 20 miles of Angier to do the transfer, which I will split the cost of. Included is two boxes of Hornady 123gn SST ammo for barrel break in and testing. The barrel is brand new. It’s never been fired. I am a gunsmith and this rifle is being sold to buy me a new lathe. The muzzle brake on this rifle was the last piece I finished on my old lathe before I bid it a fond farewell. 
The upper and lower receivers are a match set from Anderson.Rifle is worth more than I have it priced for. Will not go lower than 1800, and it cant be built for less. Parts alone are over 1800."

Combining our new polymer Burnsed Socket and patented RED Swivel, the Vickers 221 Sling allows users to switch from 2-point to 1-point mode instantly by pulling on the RED Swivel knob and reinserting it in to the Burnsed Socket at the rear of the receiver. The instantaneous adjustability of the sling is still maintained in both 1 and 2 point modes. Constructed similar to the world’s standard Vickers Combat Applications Sling™, a RED™ Swivel is sewn to the front of the sling towards the muzzle. A standard push button swivel and new molded Burnsed Socket are woven onto the rear allowing full adjustability of the sling for use with or without body armor. The 221™ Sling fits any weapon with two QD sling swivel sockets with the rear socket towards the end of the receiver. For SCARS, Sigs, HKs, or other weapon systems with eyelets at the rear of the receiver, a Universal Wire Loop with Push Button Socket can be added instead of the included push button socket."

Over the years, it has gone through several modifications, each time becoming more efficient and reliable.The Ultratech’s spring remains in an “at rest” position at all times except when deployed. This ensures that the compressed spring will not become fatigued, assuring users that when the knife is fired, it will operate effectively.

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorter barrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels. SK models can also use a variety of HK magazines - compact double stack 10- and 13-round with flat or extended floorplates, in addition to proven HK P30 steel magazines.

Selling my OD Green LCP (gen 2). It is a double action, hammer fired pistol. This little pistol has been my carry piece for the past few years. It has had around 600 through it and has been 100% reliable. I mainly carry Hornady Critical Defense and it has fed them without hiccups. I'm selling it because I've picked up a micro 9mm which has replaced it's purpose in my carry rotation.
The gun is NOT in mint condition and will show normal wear characteristics of a carry gun but it is mostly in pretty good shape cosmetically. No noticeable scratches on the slide. No rust or pitting in barrel. I've always kept this gun cleaned after any shooting and well oiled.
 
I hated this gun when I first bought it but then added a hogue rubber grip which aids tremendously in shootability. I've also replaced the original plastic guide rod with a Galloway Precision stainless steel guide rod and added a Galloway precison 13lbs heavy recoil spring for better reliability and easing the recoil and it's been a dream to shoot and has never given me any issues. All of these upgrades are included as well as the original factory parts.
 
Comes with one 7 round Ruger extended magazine and two 6 round standard mags with pearce pinky extensions (pictured, original flush plates included as well). Desantis pocket holster and a carbon fiber Kydex IWB holster. Original packaging and items included.
 
$140 cash only. No trades. No shipping. Price is FIRM and lowballers will be ignored as I don't need to sell the gun. Can meet around Saint Paul (Midway area) weekday evenings after 6pm or weekend mornings before 12pm. Sorry, can't drive out for this one since it's a small deal. First come first serve. BUYER MUST SHOW VALID ID AND PTP/PTC. No exceptions. Thanks for looking!

Hi there,
Going through the safe and selling some stuff I never got around to mounting.
First is a Monstrom Tactical S330P 3x30 Compact Prism Scope:
It is a compact, yet heavy duty prism scope with a fixed 3x magnification and a 30mm objective lens, ideal for rapid mid range target acquisition out to 500 yards. The scope uses a glass prism optical system rather than a refracting lens system like traditional scopes, allowing for better optical quality in a much smaller package. With crystal clear optics, an adjustable focus lens, and a comfortable eye relief of 3+ inches, it is comparable to sights several times the price.The glass reticle can be illuminated in red or green, in multiple brightness levels for a clean sight picture regardless of lighting or environment. And, unlike red dot sights, the reticle is visible with or without illumination, usable with or without battery power.
The S330P is 15 ounces in weight, 5 inches in length, 2.8 inches in height, and 2 inches in width. The illuminated reticle runs off one 3V CR2032 battery.Compact yet heavy duty prism sight with 3x magnification and 30mm objective lens, Ideal for rapid mid range target acquisition out to 500 yards.Features a glass prism optical system rather a refracting lens system like traditional scopes, allowing for better optical quality in a much smaller package.Unlike red dots, the reticle is visible with or without illumination, for a clean sight picture regardless of lighting or environment.
The second is a Dagger Defense DDHB:
Voted one of 4 Best EoTech Clones!Both red and green dot, four position/style reticles Comes with locking screws for your sighting adjustments APERTURE: 33mm LENGTH: 82mm WEIGHT: 291g FIELD OF VIEW: 15.8m@100m RAIL: picatinny An important feature of this red dot is that it could be strapped to a battle rifle in .308 or larger.Optic can easily be mounted on a rifle or shotgun but could also find its way onto a large handgun with a bit of rail space.

Lots of tactical mods done on this. Shoots both 2 3/4 and 3"" inch shells. Gun is in very good shape (a few tnicks but nothing bad) and fired very little. Shotgun started as older Remington Express Magnum (not the ""new"" Remington junk) and was sent to Fit 4 Duty. Barrel was cut down and a Wad Wizard Tactical/Breaching Choke system was permanently installed, bringing barrel to legal length (19""). This choke system is unique in that it not only allows for breaching applications, it also makes for tighter patterns of buckshot and other loads just like Wad Wizard's standard choke systems. A PRI Picatinny rail was also permanently installed on the receiver. Next, the gun was sprayed in Graphite Black Cerakote. Bolt done in Micro Slick. XS tritium Big Dot rifle sights were installed as well. Gun comes with the following upgrades: -PRI Picatinny rail installed on receiver -MagPul 870 forend and MLOK rail -Speedfeed stock -GG&G Stainless Magazine Hi-Viz Follower -Daniel Defense Burnsend Stock Sling Loop -Cerakoted Graphite Black/Bolt is Micro Slicked -XS Tritium Big Dot Rifle sights installed. Tritium still works. -Jumbo head safety (not installed) This gun shoots great and recoil is very manageable with both the vented choke system and excellent Speedfeed stock. Selling as I just need to pare down my collection. Here is information on the Wad Wizard Tactical choke system: http://www.wadwizard.com/breachingtool.htm Terms: Must be shipped to a FFL.
