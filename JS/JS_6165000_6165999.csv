As you can see by the photos, this is virtually a new gun, in immaculate condition.  The factory Trijicon night sights have lost most of their illumination, so the front & rear tritium tubes should be replaced to see them in the dark.  I spoke with Trijicon last week and they can replace all 3 tubes for $57.00 including shipping.  You can send them just the sights, or the full slide with the sights mounted. They can give you green front/orange rear, or green front/green rear.

The new TP9SA is a 9mm single action, striker fired pistol. The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights. The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm.

Putting up my NPAP underfolder for sale. This rifle was purchased in 2016 and has the RAK1 trigger. These rifles are built in the Zastava military factory in Serbia and imported by Century Arms. Non-Chrome lined Cold Hammer Forged Barrel. I have about 600 rounds through it. The gun shoots straight and has been kept clean. The bolt action is very smooth. There is a tiny bit of play in the stock once it is extended as with underfolders. The wood furniture has been beat up and ""retrofied"" to mimic Balkans war battlefield pickup handguards. They can be easily changed out with a new set if you choose to. It's a great shooter but I am not too fond of the underfolding stock so I'll let it go for my asking price.
 
Comes with everything below including free extras:
ONE 30 round Magpul Pmag
One 10 round Magpul Pmag
*FREE STUFF*
SIX steel Gibbs Matra (Bosnian) magazines. These mags are modeled after the Yugo Bolt Hold Open mags and are just as strong as any milsurp steel mags but have inconsistent build and I had to file down several of them to fit. A few mags have lead to failures to feed some rounds so you may need to play around with them and figure out which ones need more work. For the ones that run, they run well though. I will throw these all in for Free.
Yugo surplus sling. Has a name that is scribbled out.
AK Sight Adjustment Tool
4 cell AK mag pouch
Chinese Type 63 chest rig, modified with belt buckles for easy on and off.
I will throw in a hard case
 
Asking $550 cash only. No trades. No shipping. Price is firm. Lower offers will be ignored as I don't need to sell the gun. I can meet around Saint Paul (Midway area) weekday evenings 6pm or later. Weekends before 12PM. First come first serve. Please communicate.
 
Must have valid ID and PTC/PTP to purchase. No exceptions! Thanks for looking!"

I would not be letting this one slide, but I have an opportunity to purchase a 50 bmg that Ive been looking for and need the funds. I can sell this as a complete package, or split it up...doesnt matter to me, but pkg comes with case, rifle and scope, JP Enterprises .875 308 muzzle brake,  Harris BR 6x9 bipod and 8 boxes of ammo.....I removed the stock rail which is also included, and opted for the steel 2pc bases, along with a set of steel tactical rings...another $150 upgrade......just didnt make sense to drop 2k on a pkg and purchase cheap rings....anyways put it all together headed to the range and proceeded to sight in and break the barrel in....approx 30 rds. Three shot group with the federal matchkings measured just under 1/2"" at 100 yds. Haven't had the opportunity to try it at long range, but its a 1/2MOA setup. I have all the original packaging for all and will ship to the lower 48 for $35...... The rifle pkg with case, ammo and all $1325   If selling seperately?......the rifle alone completely stock $800 for rifle alone, anther $50 will get it with the muzzle brake.......and the scope $375.......the ammo will go for $15 a box.......the hornady superformance rds will need sighting, as I didn' get the chance to try them....rifle is sighted and zeroed with the federal match kings. Anyways...give me a call if interested nine eight zero 722 nine 0 27..........jody.     By the way the muzzle brake reduces the recoil to that of a .223, very important for getting back on target.....thanks for looking!!!!"

The Steyr M9 was designed by some of the same folks that developed the Glock, but without the focus on bottom basement pricing and mass production efficiency. This gun sits low in the hand, giving you about the highest grip possible for great control. It also has one of the best triggers of any striker fired gun, and an actual safety that is separate from the trigger. Overall this is the same size as a G19, just better feeling. The Steyr also had an at the time revolutionary sighting system consisting of a Pyramid type sight. I have had those replaced with with Tritium night sights. It comes with 7 mags total, so you never have to worry about the supply drying up. Three 15 rounders and four 10 rounders.

This is the 950BS model with a safety.
One of the neat features of this pocket pistol is that you don't need to rack the slide in order to feed a round into the chamber.  You just push the release button near the trigger and the barrel pops up.  Insert a round, close the barrel and it’s ready to fire.  This provides a 9 round capacity with a full magazine.  Speaking of magazines, they are readily available from Beretta and other vendors, along with other parts and accessories.
These pistols have a l-o-n-g history and were first manufactured in Italy in 1952.  This model was made at the Beretta plant in Maryland, as seen stamped on the slide.   
After researching on the web, these typically sell for $200.00 or less for used average condition, $250.00 for used excellent condition and up to $350.00 for NIB condition. 
Original box & user manual is included.

I have for sale or possibly trade a very nice ar 15. If you want a 75 grain bullet to group as a quarter size grouping then this is for you. First off I had this baby for a few years. The upper is a Wilson combat upper. It was $700 brand new and it a bull barrel with a 1-8 twist ss 5.56. I really don't want to sell it but I recently had a stroke and I need to get rid of it. The lower is nothing fancy it is a delton with Daniel defense lpk. Sold my scope and my quad rail but it does have a free loat rail on it. Pro mags sights magpul stock and one mag. I'm sure I'm forgetting other things but look at the pics. It was a safe queen probably shot less than 40 rnds. I only shot hornady 75 grain ammo. Only trade would be possibly a rra operator. Or something in that nature. Only reason I'm selling is because I just had a stroke and funds are tight. Or I possibly might trade for a diamond ring 1 1/2 carets to 2 carets white gold size 5 1/2 - 6. Thank you for your time and god bless

Gun is used but in great shape, and has work done to it. Kimber only made a few of these a year, hand lapped barrels and hand chambered. Once I recieved it, I had a Gunsmith blue print what Kimber did not from the factory, abjust the trigger to 2lbs, and thread the muzzle for my suppressor. I also sent the rifle to CDI Precision Gun Works in FL to have the stock inlet and had them install their after market bottom metal to make this rifle accept detachable AICS pattern mags. (10-round AI included). Before the work done this rifle was garunteed from factory to shot .5 MOA with both 168 & 175gr Federal Gold Match, after the work done it can group much better. With the right handloads it is certainly more accurate than I am. Best I can personally do with it is 5 shots all touching at 300m. Gun comes with matching 20MOA scope base as well.

This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. I have personally shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"
