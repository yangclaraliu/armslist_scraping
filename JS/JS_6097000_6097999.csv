The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Available with a tactical designed mil. spec. lower handguard with flash light. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability"

Thank you for looking.Purchased this rifle for my collection but never really shot it too much to warrant having it.  Seem to always go for my .308 ar platform when heading to the range.  Oh and FYI this thing is brutal on commercial brass, hard on military brass, and not too bad on steel cased.  No matter what type of ammo you have it eats it like candy, but if your a reloader your better off to buy steel cased and pull them apart and load your preference in the steel, as there is very little chance you will be able to salvage the brass."

Size M/L
Manufactured Pre-12', when Ops Core still used Ceradyne to make their shells. There is a Ceradyne Seamless Ballistic shell tag on the inside as well as the Opscore logo and size built into the shell but the Ops Core tag must've fell off some time ago. I also heard that some never came with the Ops Core stickers when they were manufactured by Ceradyne, so who knows.
The lid shows some obvious signs of wear in certain areas from use. Marks in the paint are seen throughout. There is a vertical piece of velcro to aid in mounting strobes further back and such.
The listing includes everything shown on the helmet. -Ops Core VAS Shroud-ANVIS 6/9 helmet mount-ANVIS Ground Mount w/ plate-ANVIS Low Profile Battery Pack (LPBP)-Core Survival Hel-Star 6 (Gen II/640 series)-Peltor Comtac Arc AdaptersEmail me for more pics, they're too high res to upload all of them.
