I had one guy assume I would ship and then he would pay me later.  I had to wonder what planet he lived on.Also, I am NOT interested in trades, which if you looked at how the listing is identified it doesn't include trades; this is cash only deal. I have about 1000 rounds of Prvi Partizan FMJ .38 ammo to sell too if interested.  I have 150 rounds through the pipe. These go for $1250 new.  I have my receipt from this past September for $1229.  These guns are pretty hard to find, especially slightly used ones.  I will sell this one for $900...firm (if the ammo is still available, I will sell with the gun for an additional $200).  I can can do shipping, FFL to FFL for $45 insured in conus. I'd have to check on ammo ship cost.I am sure someone will offer less, even though I just said the price is firm - which is something I personally hate about selling on Armslist (along with the messing around).  If you want the gun and can get a better deal elsewhere - which you won't, I suggest you go for it.  I don't need the dough, I just want to cull the herd.  There is a cylinder turn ring, which is part and parcel of a revolver and it came that way from the dealer.  Black finish is perfect. Box, papers included. 8 round capacity, great gun to shoot.  First time I fired it, one handed, I bullseyed from 30 feet.  Nice gun.  Thanks for tolerating my rant!"

That's the one on the rifle. Works great. The other two are a 7.62x39 and a .300 blackout, so you could shoot all three calibers without having to buy anything else. Just swap the uppers and you're good to go.The blackout does not come with a bolt or charging handle, because you can use the 5.56 parts for that, they're exactly the same. The only difference is the barrel, so just swap bolts and start shooting. That one is on the bottom.The middle is the 1:10 16"" 7.62x39 upper. This one uses a different bolt, and the bolt is included. Located in Asheboro, NC but I go to Charlotte frequently. Asking $1250 OBO Interested in trades or partial trades with cash. I like just about anything. Will trade for broken guns, ugly guns, or multiple guns. Let me know what you have. Thanks!"

The 24-VDC motor provides up to 360 and 9 inch-pounds of torque. Reloaders can harness all of the power and adjust it to their specifications by adjusting the units output shaft RPM's. This unit features the spring-loaded feed system for hands-free trimming where a single lever loads and unloads cases then disengages them from the cutter.

There is a micrometer adjustment for fast, precise cuts and the shellholder assembly makes adjusting the trim length quick and easy. There are six stations available for case preparation, four turning at 360 RPM and two turning faster at 550 RPM.

This is a great gun. I have been very impressed with how accurate it is despite it’s very compact length. Being an AR pistol this is a very portable gun, I carry it in a tennis racket case, and there is no SBR tax stamp required. That being said, this would be a perfect candidate to be SBR’d in the future. Fewer than 200 rounds downrange.

This is an original Armalite (not an Eagle Arms made in the Armalite factory) with 3 30 round factory steel magazines, 1 30 round Pmag, and a fresh 420 round can of Federal 5.56 NATO 62gr. steel core green tips. This model has a true H-bar 5.56 NATO chambered barrel, with a mid-length gas operating system. Came from the factory with a heavy buffer and mil-spec bolt carrier group. A few modifications have been made which include: 
- A.R.M.S. #41B front gas block A2 style folding front sight. This is, in my opinion, the best folding sight on the market. They do not wobble when in up position and truly do retain a great zero.
- Diamondhead rear folding sight. Makes centering on target a breeze!
- Troy mid-length Delta battle rail with two extra rail sections installed.
- Mag-Pul UBR adjustable stock. Rock solid, provides a solid cheek weld (and doesn't pinch your beard, for you guys that know what I mean)
- Mag-Pul AFG2 vertical grip
- Ergo Grip 
- Anti-tip followers were added to the magazines.

Pleasant area (30 minute drive).  $35 per 60 round pack of ammo.  Not looking for any trades.  Obviously, I don't want to drive a half hour to sell one box.  So, if you live around 30 minutes from Greensburg, I'd want to sell all three boxes to make the drive worthwhile.**** If you think I'm desperate for money, I'm not. So, don't ask for a lower price.  You're getting a discount as is.  The price listed is less than I can find 60 rounds shipped, or 120 rounds shipped.  I have some extra ammo and am just selling a few packs if somebody local has a Swiss rifle and wants a few rounds of the GP11.  If you need to feel like you are getting a deal, look at online prices for 60 rounds shipped.  This ammo has dried up before, and the price doubled on the sellers who had some in stock.  So, don't expect me to sell this way lower than market value when I can easily keep it and sell higher when supplies dry up."

This rare pistol was manufactured in 1932 and was built to handle the first 38 special +P. This came about because the police were out-gunned by the bad guys who were driving heavy duty cars with thick metal doors. Their 38 special service revolvers would not penetrate the doors. So, in 1931, S&W converted the 44 caliber N frame into the high powered 38 special +P. They called it the S&W Heavy Duty 38-44. This round was so popular with the police that the civilian population also wanted the high powered, low recoil pistol for hunting. Thus, S&W came out with the S&W 38-44 Outdoorsman with a 6 1/2"" barrel. There was only 4,761 of these pistols built before WW2 broke out. The pistols built after the war had a ""S"" prefix before the serial number. This pistol has serial number 403XX. The right side pistol grip has matching serial number as well as the barrel. (They only stamped the right grip with serial number.) I would say this pistol is 85-90% condition. The grips are sharp, the barrel has holster wear near the muzzle on the left side,the right side of the barrel has four spots of blueing loss from the holster. There is also some freckling on the side plate. There is light blueing loss on the front edges of the cylinder as well as a turn ring. The bore looks shinny. I also have a leather period holster for it. Patended Dec. 25, 1928. Everything is tight on this pistol; end play, timing, lockup. I have shot a few standard 38 specials and can hit a beer can four out of six shots at 25 yds. These pistols have sold at auction for around thirty-five hundred to four thousand for a 95% pistol with the box. I have contacted a couple of auction houses and have got estimate sale prices at around the twenty-eight hundred mark. I'm offering up this gem for two thousand to you local collectors for a few weeks before it goes to auction. I would consider a very nice S&W model 66 old school, pinned and recessed with a three or four inch barrel as partial trade. Possibly a 686 also. IF you have a pistol, send pictures with your offer. I live in Wenatchee area and could do a halfway meet. Don't be afraid to make an offer!"

The plates are Dutch issue as well and are ceramic stand alone lvl4 curved shooters cut. They measure approx 13""x12"". Well, people were very interested... two were afraid it would be too large. It is a size large. I'm 6'4"" w/44-46 chest and it fits great. The other gentleman was hopeful that it was green or coyote brown. The color is the awesome Dutch DPM (woodland). Value at $500 due to the condition and the very large stand alone curved shooters cut plates. You can only buy these bad boys if you're currently in the active military Or an leo. Search away for 13""x12"" curved shooters cut lvl4 plates. I'm still very interested in trades too. In trade Im looking for an 11.5"" bbl commando complete upper, A2 upper(maybe type 3 upper) , A2 front site, etc... Or a2 pencil bbl complete upper.
