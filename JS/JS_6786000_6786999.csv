It's a good 'for fun' rifle and I reckon it could be used to hunt with as well. The action moves fine though it could use a bit of lubrication and the carrier ejects cases just fine if you operate the bolt with authority. Move too slow and the casing won't get into the catch and sit in the chamber. Just something I noticed, it hasn't ruined any experience I've had with this nice gun."

Works fine just decided to put a magnified optic on my rifle instead. Like new condition with box and papers. $80 cash, $100 Trade. After talking to a couple people I think I should probably elaborate a little on this optic. I realize there are many different eotech clones on the market. Although it's a clone it's a nicer clone that gets very good reviews and even though I didn't use it much it preformed very well for me. Once I zeroed it it stayed zeroed. It has a red or green reticle. It's made from good materials. Sitting it next to my real eotech it's difficult to tell them apart. This clone cost $120 new. It's not the same as the $30-$50 clones out there. This one has maybe 5 hours of use on it if that. I'll be more than happy to keep it as a back up before I let it go for a even trade on a $40 dollar stripped receiver. I'm sure eventually I'll find a use for it again and be glad I still have it rather than hitting up the Wal-Mart for a cheap tru-glo just to run my next build. No more low balling. It doesn't bother me one bit to let the box collect some dust until I decide to use it again. It's not like I need to feed it or rent it it's own room."

I can send as many photos via text for any interested buyer. This rifle is amazingly accurate. I was really surprised but it can out shoot my AR15 when it comes to pure accuracy. This is a single shot so it would be perfect for teaching your kids to shoot safely. I am located in Gallatin but would be willing to travel. Make me an offer and the best offer gets it. I'm ready to just sell it, it's taking up room in my gun safe. Rifle functions flawlessly, smooth bolt and great trigger. Strong rifling.

The P226® Equinox features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function. The 9mm Equinox is a non-cataloged model. It is my understanding (as far as my research would take me, feel free to search for yourself.) that this pistol is part of the first small number of factory guns that Sig Sauer accidentally cut the slides for 9mm and finished the guns instead of scrapping the slides.

The Sig Sauer Equinox is ONLY produced in .40 S&W, this gun however, was made in 9mm. The story goes that Sig Sauer was starting the slides for a Equinox line production and accidentally used 9mm instead of 40 S&W. By the time the mistake was noticed there were already hundreds made. Instead of waisting all the slides and materials they decided to finish the 9mm equinox's and sell them. This pistol is one of these very few. Some say there were less than 300 made and very few if any remain untouched and unfired like this one is right now. This item is close to impossible to find and is surely a crown jewel for any gun collector.Osage County Gun, talking about a p229 they had for sale said: This is a non-cataloged item. Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration. We cannot guarantee we can get more once these are sold. OUT OF STOCKAny addition information or any addition pictures are available upon request, Please do not hesitate to ask anything!Email, Text or Call REDACTEDmust be 21 non felon Ohio resident."

The optic in the photo does not go with the gun, but the flip up sights do. I'd rather trade, but if you decide to offer cash, I have to get at least 600 because of what I have into it. Comes with 3 20 round mags. Keep in mind with the bullpup conversion, this will not accept 30 round mags because of the steep angle that is needed to seat an SKS mag, the 30 rounders hit the pistol grip, so 20 round mags are its max.
