The only thing 'wrong' with this pistol is that there appears to be a rack number or something similar from its previous life on the left side of the slide, which is just barely visible in the photo. It is hardly visible but again, I want to be foward about it so there aren't any surprises. Other than that this example functions and looks just like any other Glock.With that out of the way, it will come with its case and 2 15rd mags. I am looking to make a straight trade for a Glock 17, CZ P09, or Sig P320. I might also consider other similar 9mm pistols but there are really the only ones I'm interested in.

I'm wanting to get my slide milled for hey Trijicon RMR and have a new rear sight dovetail build in front of the RMR without having to wait more than a few days and without spending a ton of money. You may even want to have forward cocking serrations milled and maybe some slide chamfering as well.

I also want to use mags that cost less. Two rifles come to mind. The DPMS ORACLE .308 and the SW M&P 10 .308. What do you have? How much will you sell for? What kind of mags do they take? This is a private sale interaction only. I do wish to buy not at the moment but in a few months time. I do not want to exceed $1000 as I am not asking for scopes or ammunition. If you do offer extras such as grips, bipods or brakes I can negotiate for those. Keep in mind I am trying to get a rifle that weighs 8.5lbs or less.Would be willing to pay extra for the DPMS Compact Hunter in 308 win."
