It digests the 45 ACP or Auto-rim cartriges and has a 6.5"" barrel on the 5-screw N-Frame. The diamond Magna grips are correct for the gun but are stamped with a different serial number. Gun is in perfect shape with a fine bore and very minor blue wear and cylinder ring. Made around 1953-54 by serial number. Only 2,768 ever made from 1950-1961, with far fewer of these the earlier 5-screw variant. The rare and desirable Micro cockeye hammer is non-factory option used by serious target shooters of the era. I travel thoughout the state occasionally and may be able to meet you outside the Charleston area. Let me know."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, ambidextrous decocker instead of the manual safety on the standard CZ SP-01,  and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.Click here to view on our website"

The gun really feels great in the hand and has an excellent trigger for a striker pistol, I just don't like its appearance.  The gun will come with everything from the factory, including the box, manual, backstraps, speedloader, and lock, as well as three magazines.  It even still has the factory wax paper.I am asking $525 for this gun.  I am also interested in trades for quality 9mm pistols.  Of greatest interest to me are Sig P320s, most any type of CZ, and Walther PPQs.  I will also consider some Glocks or HKs or other quality 9mm guns, including 9mm 1911s (STI, S&W, etc).  +/- cash to/from you depending on the trade.Please have a permit to do business.  Thanks."

Model 6280 is the base for this holster design as it utilizes the unique SLS rotating hood design for a smoother single motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The 6360 is classified as a Level III Retention holster with the SLS as the primary security system; it also includes an internal locking device that retains the weapon in all directions when the primary device is open. This holster's design offers three distinct design differences from previous models. First, once the weapon is holstered, it ""locks"" it into place, providing an extra measure of security from standard Level II retention holsters. Second, the holsteris completely operable with the thumb, makingit very instinctive to use.. Finally, once the retetion devices are released, the weapon can be drawn straight out of the holster with no twisting or other motion required. The 6360 features a tensioning devce, molded sight track and SafariSuede lining to protect the gun 's sights and finish. Its wraparound construction and SafariLaminate Structure provide the strongest design combination available.

This is a Colt Trooper MK V Mfg in 1985 and is in outstanding condition, it has been very well taken care of. I am the 2nd owner of this fine firearm, I was acquainted to the first owner and I can firmly confirm and attest that this gun has been fired less than 20 times since it's purchase(as new) in 1986. Comes with Colt factory box (in OK condition some discoloration and tape here and there) along with the hang tag, user's manual and other paperwork. This .357 Magnum has a nearly flawless blued finish with a 4 inch Barrel and features the highly sought after Colt V Frame checkered wood target stocks with Gold Colt medallions and there is just something so majestic about that Colt Vent ribbed barrel ( Python, Diamondback, Boa, Anaconda etc). It also will come with a Custom Mahogany Wood Presentation Box/ Case with Crushed red velvet interior. Here is your chance to add this beautiful, rare and collectible revolver to your Colt collection. Located in Newland ( Avery County ) but I travel the general area for business and I am willing to meet in a mutually convenient location. NC residents need Purchase or Carry Permit and for those out of state,  I would be more than happy to ship to your FFL for the addition of actual Shipping costs."

It comes with a 16inch 7/1 twist barrell and a 16inch hand guard. It also has a custom trigger setup that is right around the 3 pound pull and it is polished to a crisp break. The other additions ar a spike tactial H2 buffer and a JPenterprise recoil buffer spring that almost eliminates the annoying bong sound of the AR. It has an ambidextrous saftey as well as the MAGPUL bad lever for quick bolt release. The bolt is a tomstactical black nitrade coat, I will say that having that type of slick finish really reduces any build up. The gun runs smooth. The AR is outfitted with all Mission First Tactical light weight stock and grip. The Scope included is a Nikon 3-9 buckmaster and right now it is sighted in for 100 yrds. I also have the MAGPUL flip up sights as well. Inlcluded in this package will be 4 30rd mags an extra buffer and buffer spring plus around 130 rounds of ammo. In order to purchase you must have an ID with you. I will be making a copy for my records. I am asking 900 for the rifle and really I have a lot more into it but I cant expect to get it all back. I am also willing to look at all trades plus cash. I am atempting to pay for my upcoming wedding and I do need some cash back. I like older guns of any condition so if a trade can take some off of the top I am ok with that."

This Shotgun model cost $1900 from black aces, feel free to go to their website to place an order to verify. Comes with (2) 10 round mags and one 5 round.

This is the new Gen2 model that has all of the latest upgrades from the older KSG that KelTec first put out on the market, these newer more dependable Gen2 KSG's are proven to be more durable and reliable as well! Given the extremely short length of the KSG compared to other 12gauge shotguns, the KSG (Gen2) is the ultimate Tactical Shotgun, especially since it has the capacity to hold FIFTEEN 12gauge shells too!! It holds 7shells in the left tube and 7shells in the right tube, plus 1 in the chamber, which gives you a total of 15rounds of 12gauge shells to fire before you need to reload again.. Also, I have added an A-2 style IRON front sight and a flipping MagPul rear sight on top of the rail to improve supreme long-distance accuracy since KSG's do not have any sight-systems built onto them, but my added sights are already locked in to achieve 2""-5"" groupings at OVER 100yards with 1oz 12gauge slugs; but both the A-2 IRON and the MagPul sights are easily adjustable and can also be moved along at any point throughout the top rail on the KSG.. It has had exactly ONLY 14rounds ever fired thru it in total since bought new from store.. 7rounds of 00-buck and 7rounds of 1oz slug and not one shell of either jammed, failed, etc.. I hate to get rid of it since it is probably one of the best personal-defense Tactical Shotguns I have ever owned with its short length and 15round capacity, but I do not get to shoot it as much as it deserves to be shot. So I am selling it for $800 WITH the sights included or I will also take $750even WITHOUT the sights included. However, the trade value must be higher than the cash price.. Thanks for looking"

With a delicate palm-swell, slender forearm, and shadow-line cheek-piece, the Model 48 Heritage just feels right. A handsome, matte-black Cerakote® all-weather finish compliments the dark wood grain, while fully protecting the metal-work from the elements. The Model 48 Heritage is for the shooter who desires all of the features expected in a contemporary hunting rifle, but with all of the tradition and warmth of a wood-stocked rifle. With careful attention to the way a rifle should feel in the hands, the Model 48 Heritage is fitted with a fancy-grade, oiled walnut stock featuring 20 line-per-inch, three-panel checkering, and a soft, one-inch recoil pad to help reduce felt recoil. Cartridges are held in an internal magazine with a lightweight aluminum hinged floor-plate for easy unloading. A free-floating stainless steel, match-grade barrel, with glass and pillar-bedded action ensure M.O.A. accuracy at 100 yards with prescribed Nosler Ammunition."

This rifle was sporterized a very long time ago and looks very similar to a Bannerman conversion, although I don’t believe it is. I have not fired this rifle, got it in trade a few months back but previous owner stated it fired fine. Nothing on this rifle is numbers matching, but it is complete and cycles well. Barrel has strong rifling, but it is also evident that there has been corrosion in the past...possibly put away dirty for several decades…IDK. Bottom-line, this is a crusty old rifle that has seen better days, but if Mosin Nagants are your thing then this might be for you. It could make for an interesting scout or brush gun project. I have read that the Remington versions are somewhat rare, although sporterizing it has taken away much of the collector value.
