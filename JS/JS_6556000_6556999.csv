When Smith & Wesson adopted model numbers in 1957, the Chiefs Special became the Model 36. Smith & Wesson J-Frame revolvers have had your back since 1950.  These small revolvers were designed to fire full power rounds and are as simple and easy to use as they are reliable.  Available in various calibers and with three diverse hammer designs, it is no surprise that the Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular, small-frame, defense revolver on the market."

Dated 1916. Rare and minty. The 1916, as you know, is the scarcest of all WWI Navy Lugers. The condition is outstanding, about 97-98+% of the original blue.  The loss is just sharp edge slivering, a couple small areas of the muzzle that have surface pin pricks and the usual side plate wear.. Probably caused by the holster. The gripstraps have not even started to gray. The condition of this is gun is unusually fine considering most of them went to sea and were subject to salt water corrosion.  All numbers match. After the war certain minty guns were selected for export. This gun is stamped very lightly on the right slide rail, Germany. The left side of the barrel group has the Imperial WWI marks, and is stamped Crown, Crown/M, Crown/M. The barrel is also stamped twice with a Crown. The front sight is dated 1916 like the receiver. The wooden grips are just super, showing almost no wear. Not a crack, chip or any flattened points. The slide rails, bolt face and feed ramp show very little use. The bore, like the rest of the gun, is mirror bright with razor sharp rifling. The gun comes with one correct three ring wooden based magazine."

The GLOCK 17 Gen4 is chambered in 9mm Luger and features a modular backstrap system, allowing a shooter to tailor the rough textured grip of the pistol to their hand size for optimal ergonomics.To make this handgun even more user-friendly, GLOCK introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols to make it right- or left-hand accessible. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 17 a softer shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol.GLOCK's Safe Action System (SAS) is a fully automatic three-point mechanical safety system. Once the trigger is pulled, each point sequentially and independently disengages, and then reengages. Together, these mechanisms greatly guard against misfires without increasing resistance in the trigger pull.Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of personal defense turn to the Glock 17 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments.Features and Specifications:Caliber: 9mmCapacity: 17 Round MagazineFrame: Rough Texture PolymerBarrel: 4.48"", Cold Hammer ForgedRifling: Hexagonal, 9.84""Sight: Standard GLOCK SightsTrigger: Striker Fired, 5.5 lb Pull WeightSafety: GLOCK Safe ActionLength: 8.03""Height: 5.43""Width: 1.18""Weight: 25.06oz (Unloaded)Color: BlackUses: Law Enforcement, Military, Self Defe nse, Sport Shooting"

I am selling a 1 year old Leupold RX-1000i rangefinder with box. I have used this only a couple of times this past hnting season. It is a great rangefinder with all of the bells and whistles, but my long range, walk a mile, stalking days are well behind me. If it isn’t within 300 yards, I am not shooting at it!  So I am selling items that I do not need,as my wife kindly reminds me each day.  SO, my rangefinder loss is going to be your hunting gain!   I have an extra battery, original box, instructions and carrying case as well. It is a great rangefinder and you will not be disappointed in its capabilities.  It does exactly as described.
 
Description: From Leupold Website
 
Integrating True Ballistic Ranging (TBR) technology that features angle compensation, the Leupold RX-1000i TBR digital laser rangefinder accurately measures the distance between you and the target.

The maximum range (reflective) of this digital laser rangefinder is 1000 yards, giving you a long-range performance. With a magnification of 6x, this Leupold rangefinder gives you a wider viewing angle. Moreover, the 14 mm eye relief of the Leupold RX-1000i TBR makes it ideal for continuous usage.

The 16.25"" chrome-lined, hammer-forged barrel has a removable 4-port muzzle brake with a 14x1mm left-hand thread. It has a reinforced black polymer stock set with a stainless steel heat shield inside the lower handguard and a fixed, intermediate-length buttstock (13.4"" LOP) with a trap door for the cleaning kit.

Arsenal's Bulgarian-made SAM7R rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. All firearms manufactured by Arsenal, Inc. use 100% brand new components, and every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank. Arsenal's hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel and eliminates internal voids and cooling deformations. Each forged receiver blank requires more than 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision and durability.

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. It will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle."

HERE IS WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT: Ithaca Model 72 is a variant of the Erma Werke of Dachau, Germany Model EG-71.. Made from 1973 to 1979, this rifle was offered in .22 Long Rifle and .22 Magnum only. It had an 18 1/2"" barrel. The lever gun was designed by Erma of Germany. Some years after Ithaca stopped production Iver Johnson picked it up and marketed it as the ""Wagonmaster"". My gunsmith had a Iver Johnson "" Wagonmaster ""in the shop when he was working on my rifle. He told me it used a lifter- not a carrier to cycle the round. Was told It is basically the same rifle that Henry is producing today. Ordered a carrier from Henry ( H001) they are not the same!!
I saw where Numrich had a 22mag carrier. Can it be modified to work with 22lr?Not according to my gunsmith and Numrich..Look at the picture for the .22 mag. carrier and the picture of mine.They are differant.He called and talked to them about 6 months ago.
Places I have tried so far:
Western Gun Parts Ltd. (W.G.P. Ltd.)- Canada -- we do not have any Carriers !!
Sharp's Guns ,Canada -- we do not have any Carriers !!
Bobs gun shop -- we do not have any Carriers !!
Gunbrokers ( they have rifles listed - no carrier parts)
BROWNELLS -- we do not have any Carriers !!
MIDWAY -- we do not have any Carriers !!
Jack First Inc. -- we do not have any Carriers !!
DIAMOND GUNSMITHING -- we do not have any Carriers !!
EBAY -- we do not have any Carriers !!
OUT BACK GUN PARTS, INC. -- we do not have any Carriers !!
Hoosier Gun Works -- No parts for rifle and you've tried all the source we would have!!
FlyingWoof - aol.com -- we do not have any Carriers !!
Jeremiah Logsdon -- Ithaca Gun Company— We do not carry parts for or service the 72.
 
 I should have known when I got the rifle in a trade something was up.Thought I was getting a deal...We have been working on this for 6-7 months now with no luck..My gunsmith tried to copy the old one just to much was missing to get it to work!!
I DO HAVE SOME RIFLES AND SOME AMMO TO TRADE!!!THANKS FOR LOOKING!!!GARY"
