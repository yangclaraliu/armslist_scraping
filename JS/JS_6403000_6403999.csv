This rifle is built on a Model 70 Winchester Classic, which was the short action, controlled feed, claw extractor model 70 that was made for a few years in the late 1990s. It uses 260 Remington brass with no modifications. You can shoot 260 Remington factory ammo in it should you so desire. This rifle is set up for across the course high power rifle competition and is complete with stripper clip slots (copied from a Model 70 pre-1964 target rifle), a Jewell two stage match trigger(1 lb. / 1 lb.), and a Tubb titanium firing pin with Wolfe extra power spring. Lock time is almost non-existent! The butt plate adjusts in/out, right/left, and up/down. The cheek piece is adjustable with a thumb wheel. It has an Anschutz style rail in the fore end for all your favorite hand stops or other accessories such as bi-pod mounts. Round count on the barrel is about 500. Barrel is a light Palma contour Krieger cut-rifled 6.5mm with a 1 in 8 twist, and was chambered with a Pacific Tool and Gauge reamer in 6.5 panther. The end of the barrel is turned for a .750 sight band. There are currently a set of basic Weaver scope bases attached to the receiver. I do have the Redfield style rear sight mount for this rifle at a slight additional charge. At the price I am asking you couldn't buy the parts, let alone do the work.

This holster was designed for maximum concealment, comfort, and function, and it was designed to ride the gun a bit higher above the belt line to allow a shooters hand to get a much better grip on the pistol. This results in a more efficient and faster draw.  The muzzle end of the holster is rounded for comfort when carrying and to prevent the hot muzzle from contacted the shooters skin. The bottom of the holster is still open enough to allow brass to fall out so it will not interfere with re-holstering. This holster works and conceals very well in appendix carry along with 3, 4, and 5 o'clock carry positions.  The holster has 2 sets of  loop mounting holes, with the belt loop angled out (the way it's shipped) the butt of the pistol rides much closer to the body and is more concealable.   The holster is friction adjustable for retention."

430,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6403430,For Sale:  Surefire tac light for Mossberg 500,"Marysville, KS, Ft. Riley, Kansas",$ 300,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 1, 2017",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This description is from Surefire's website. The description they have is infinitely better than what I could've wrote. I am willing to ship, if I get the payment first. I've used this for my home defense shotgun, but unfortunately I have to sell it to pay bills. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-500/590 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Mossberg 500 or 590 shotguns. This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. The DSF-500/590 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. The DSF-500/590 fits as-is any 500 or 590 shotgun variant with a 6¾"" forend tube (magazine tube). An included internal spacer provides a proper fit for 7¾"" forend tubes. The DSF-500/590 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Mossberg 500 and 590 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense. NOTE: To see our other DSF shotgun forend models, click here. Fits: Mossberg 500 and 590 shotguns with either 6¾” or 7 ¾” forend tube"

The Creed offers a reinforced polymer frame with signature ergonomics that shooters have come to expect from Walther. The Creed features a pre-cocked double-action trigger system and a bobbed hammer that ensure a no-snag draw from a concealment. This system provides the shooter with a light and smooth trigger pull, consistent from the first shot to the last. All metal components are treated with a corrosion and abrasion resistant TENIFER® coating, providing a matte black hardened surface. With an ambidextrous magazine release, low profile steel 3-dot sights, and front and rear cocking serrations on the slide, Walther refused to compromise on the quality or features of the Creed.

I bought it a few months ago with the aspiration of being the next David Gilmour; however, reality has kicked in and while it looks beautiful sitting on the stand, the chances of me actually ever learning how to play it are slim to none, so I've decided to enjoy guitars from afar.   Like I said, it is practically brand new. It comes with a gig bag, practice amp, some picks, and accessories. I paid $1,000 for the guitar by itself. I'll even throw in a black Yamaha F335 acoustic with a case that has been played just about as much as the Strat. This is a great deal for someone looking to get a nice setup. Will also consider trades for guns."

Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil.
