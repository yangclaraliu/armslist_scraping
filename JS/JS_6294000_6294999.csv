I also have some kevlar soft inserts from the newer version iotv that I got while in the service. They add an extra layer of 9mm protection. While I'm no ballistics expert, i think with the kevlar added it might stop a 223 round as long as it was over 100 yds. Either way it will definitely beef up the handgun protection. 125$ for the vest and inserts. Can't remember what size it is, but im 206 lbs and its fits. It's got a good amount of room to adjust the size. If you're between 165 and 210 it should fit."

The Browning 1911-380 combines two of John M. Browning's most lasting innovations - the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP CARTRIDGE - into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern ""pocket pistols"" that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved acccuracy. The grip is compact, yet is long and wide enough to allow the shooting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort."

I just want to build my own 22, Ruger 10/22 or Remington 597 are the most available aftermarket parts but just about any 22 will work, even some pistols. Let me know what you have and how much you want for it. Some A-hole scumbag stole both of mine, had one of each.  thanks"

Unfortunately for me, I then shot my friend's Sig P226 Navy Seal and fell in love with it.  As great as the CZ shot, the Sig felt more comfortable in my hand and I shot it slightly better.  So, I impulsively ran out and bought a P226 the next day for $1000 + sales tax.  Now I've got two pistols, but can only afford one, so the CZ is up for sale. 
The CZ is in almost new condition and has only been out of my house once, to fire those 175 rounds at the range.  The case, extra clip and all accessories are included.
I paid $800 + $68 in sales tax.  You can save around $175 for this virtually new, two month old pistol.

After the time period for a non-compete agreement with Remington was up, Dyke came back with Windham Weaponry to show the industry what real AR-15's are supposed to be like. Overall quality, construction, and performance of Windham Weaponry AR-15 models is an industry leader with no peers.  This particular firearm is the SRC Flattop model that has been outfitted with Magpul MOE accessories, an ambidexterous sling mount, reinforced pistol grip, flip-up sights, and a red dot holographic optic.

Their model 26 pump-action BB gun was a hit in its day. While they stopped making air guns for a few years, they're back in the airgun game in a BIG way! While most manufacturers quote their air gun velocities with super-light alloy pellets, Remington quotes them with lead pellets -- the same lead pellets you're most likely to use. No smoke and mirrors, no illusion, no gaming the system, no pulling the wool over your eyes: You use lead pellets and so does Remington! The Remington Express XP is for anyone who likes to shoot but doesn't want to bother the neighbors. The sound suppressor lets you deliver the goods downrange without alarming everyone -- including any possible critters that you're trying to eradicate. Good power, lower report, quality optics. It's everything you expect an airgun to be."

It is originally valued at $700, with an asking price of $550. If interested, you must be a red-blooded American who resides in Illinois with a valid FOID or CCL. The weapon system comes complete with (2) fifteen round magazines, and a chamber lock for secure transportation and storage. I will produce a bill of sale, as well as conduct a background check with the Sate Police. I am willing to go out to the range for anyone who would like to handle and fire it before buying. It is in pristine condition, with less than (100) rounds fired through it.
The 9mm Beretta has been the selected combat pistol of the US Armed Forces for over 25 years, and is a reliable hand-gun for home defense. It is also a good starter pistol for anyone looking to start training with hand-guns for home defense or concealed carry. It is easier to learn the fundamentals of pistol marksmanship on full size pistols like the 92FS as opposed to going straight to sub-compact weapon systems.

Picatinny rail allows the use of any aftermarket optical, electronic or flip-up sighting system.

Factory Pistol Case and all accessories This is the model you can drop in the HK .357 sig barrel to shoot an entirely different round with the same magazines. (I have one for sale in the following link) http://www.gunbroker.com/item/575032968 USP COMPACT The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol. Features & System Characteristics: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Grooved target triggers Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel No snag, bobbed hammer Flared recurve trigger guard Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Contoured, extended slide release Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator Patented Lock-Out Safety device Overall length: 6.81 in. Overall height: 5.00 in. Overall width: 1.14 in. Barrel length: 3.58 in. Sight radius: 5.35 in."

Comes with one 20 rd magazine. RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.
