I am a VERY busy father so I would much rather just sell all of this as one big lot rather than piecing it out but I am by no means planning to just give it away by accepting ridicules offers, so don't offer a hundred bucks and expect me to accept it. I have already researched every item in this listing to get a value and a Conservative total is $1300. FIRST person to offer anything over $300 for the WHOLE lot gets it all!!  I have priced everything below the prices I found online so that I know I am offering you the lowest price. I am accepting any REASONABLE cash offer as well as trade offers but I will be expecting a higher than cash value offer in your trades. Please do not send messages asking what I want in trade because I don't have specific items in mind other than possibly firearms. Just let me know what you have to trade and we'll go from there. I will be including a few extras to the person who buys it all like a pistol rack and some gunsmithing tools/accessories.
