For the same lower and upper brand new you would pay about $1650.. I have around 300 rounds down the pipe.Again, this is an AR pistol, not a SBR. The lower was serialized as an AR pistol, again it was purchased brand new as an AR pistol. It is your responsibility to know the laws and dos/donts when dealing with AR Pistols vs Short Barreled Rifles.The optic, shockwave blade, sling, and 40 round mag featured in some of the pictures are just the setup that I've been running on it and arent included in the price. What will be included is the complete upper and lower, the daniel defense case, and a daniel defense magazine (unused).This thing is an absolute blast to shoot but i've decided i want to sell it and look for a Daniel or Noveske .308.This is a very high quality AR pistol, I've had an offer for $1300 so we will start from there, best offer will win.Call/text me at REDACTED if interested.

Asking $1250 Bill of sale will be done for both parties Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged ReceiverEach SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.FEATURES100% new-production parts and components.Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook triggerCold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technologyHard-chrome plated bore and chamberRemovable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock.

This is a dedicated 22LR revolver from Ruger and does not shoot magnum ammo. The other Single - Six revolvers with magnum cylinders are not as accurate as these for 22 LR ammo.  The reason is they are over bored by several thousandths of an inch for the magnum bullets. Therefore they are not as accurate in the cheaper 22LR ammo. Call Ruger customer service if you want to confirm this. I love this revolver but can not justify having more than one of these. It is the product of a trade transaction. They are hard to find for part of the year due to limited production times.

I bought it several years ago, but now need the money to buy Christmas presents. I hardly shot it, but cleaned it each time. It's the carbine model with the side-mounted star/cross bayonet, an original sling, and an original double ammo pouch. The only aftermarket thing about it is the black elastic 9-cartridge holder on the stock. It also comes with about 20 stripper clips that help load it much faster, and 262 rounds of steel core 7.62x54r. These make great hunting rifles, as well as awesome truck guns, backup rifles, collector's items, cache guns, or main battle rifles. An often overlooked use for such an affordable yet proven and powerful rifle is to spend a couple hundred bucks on it, make a cache tube out of PVC, grease it up, and stash it away with some ammunition in case your other guns get stolen, or confiscated when the Ruskies or Chinese come over the polar ice cap. Overall this has been a good rifle to me, but I've got others, and need some liquid currency for Christmas time. I'll be here. Unfortunately, I still need the metal ammo can, and can't include it."

This gun was unfired before I got it, it had been locked up for its life when it wasnt in the bedroom corner according to its owner. I shot it to ensure it worked, as I had no intentions of ever selling it. It has had 1 mag full passed through it, which is I believe 10 rds. It shot great, no misfires or jams. I have a couple boxes of ammo that goes with it as well. I just got my second AR, so I am letting this go to make space in my gun cabinet as I dont plan on ever shooting it again. It has actually been hanging on our wall above our door as decoration since it looks awesome with the bayonet out. I will not entertain unreasonable offers. My stepfather already offered me $300 for the rifle but I think its worth more. With that being said I want $350 and this rifle is well worth that with it being all original and an older model built to last, not a cheap newer import stamped model.  DO NOT MESSAGE OR CALL ME UNLESS YOU HAVE THE MONEY NOW.......I am not holding the gun, I am not taking payments, etc, etcPlease email if after 10pm as I have a wife and two small children and I am a working man who has to get up at 5am."

The trigger is way better then the standard M&P9 trigger, clean breaks with the trigger stop that is adjustable to limit over travel.The sights are tall enough where if the battery in your red dot optic dies you can still shoot with the 3dot sight.

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.   The WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for any shooter.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380 ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. A single-action-only trigger, means the P938 handles like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release, and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The Blackwood edition pairs a natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame with Hogue Blackwood grips.Must be a resident of Tennessee with proper identification and legally allowed to own a firearm and complete a bill of sale. No trades...  cash only."
