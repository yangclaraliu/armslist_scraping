This tool allows reloaders to quickly and easily determine the ""proper"" bullet seating depth in their firearm by accurately measuring their rifles freebore. By having an accurate measurement of freebore reloaders can significantly improve their rifles accuracy by tailoring their bullet seating depth to their rifle. A few thousandths of an inch change between the bullet and the rifling can make the difference between just so-so accuracy and that tack-driver performance that leads to bug-hole groups. To use the Lock-N-Load Overall Length Gage Hornady caliber-specific Overall Length Gages are required for use (sold separately). These Overall Length Gages are made for all common cases from the 17 Remington to the 500 Nitro Express and are oversized to accept the same bullets your reloading.

The Witness uses a wide body magazine, and in the 45 ACP version shown here, holds ten cartridges, for a total loaded capacity of eleven rounds. Still, with the higher capacity than many 45 ACP steel pistols, the Witness is comfortable in most hands, and I find it to be extremely comfortable in mine."

This was the last production run of the iconic ""Humpback"" A5 made in the year 2000. Browning no longer makes this gun and it will continue to skyrocket in value. In 2015 Blue Book was $5000.00 for this gun and more recently I have seen used ones going for $6000. Mine is still new in the box, never fired. I will admit that it has been assembled a few times but that's it. This is the A5 to own. It is custom engraved and designed by JM Browning and has 24k gold inlay on a very cool picture of Browning outside the original factory. This gun has 2 chokes, choke tool, high gloss walnut stock and forend, all original paperwork & packaging. Pick up this gun now for less than Blue Book. $4500.00 firm. I would also consider trades for running and registered cars or trucks, 4x4, awd, hot rods, other guns, etc. Can ship through FFL, must be able to pass background check, etc."

I'll unmount it and pack it back in the original box unless you specifically want it left as is.The only problem is the spent primer tray.  It didn't seem to be fitting/working well (apparently a common complaint) so I tried modifying it which made it looser but then I was able to get it working great by adding a cardboard spacer and holding it steady with a mini bungee cord. I'm sure you could get a replacement easily if you don't like my ""fix"" or there were some interesting third party primer trays I saw as an alternative.$400 OBO"

THE FUNCTION OF THE REVOLVER IS STILL TIGHT AS NEW NOTHING IS LOOSE AND THE LEMON SQUEEZER FIRES VERY WELL. FINTS IN SLACKS POCKETS EASLIY BECAUSE IT IS SO SMALL WITH NO HAMMER. COMPLETLY OPERATIONAL WHICH IS AMAZING FOR A SMITH AND WESSON OR ANY WEAPON OVER 131 YEARS OLD.  EARLY MODELS ARE RARE AND OLDER MODELS AFTER 1877 GO FOR LESS.

The Cynergy made technological bounds with the invention of its low profile MonoLock hinge, and innovative recoil pad. It has long appealed to a younger generation of shooters with it's contemporary looks and to the older shooter with it's advantages of an ultra-low profile. And to the rest of us for both.. The Cynergy field takes the technological advantages and great looks and gives them with a more traditional style recoil pad that will allow customizing the length of the stock to the shooter. Today's most innovative over and under shotgun. If you're an all-around, one-gauge shotgun shooter, the Browning Cynergy, in any model, is probably the only shotgun you will ever need to buy. This Field model weighs just a tad over 7 lbs. in a 12 gauge with 28"" barrel. It's a perfect weight for carrying and sweet to swing with its ventilated top and side ribs on fast-flushing birds and yet very strong with its engraved steel receiver.The MonoLock Hinge means there is 300% more surface area to pivot on, for less wear and more stability. No other over and under shotgun gives you this strength where it is so critical. The rectangle locking pins provide additional strength and the action features a ""wear-in"" relief that allows wear without hindering lock up. When you pick up a Cynergy and shoulder it, there is a natural blending of arm and shoulder and many hunters' minds are made up in an instant.

Fits into any 1911-style holster. Has all the bells and whistles as the 45 ACP and uses 22 LR ammo for less recoil and less expense shooting. Makes a great 1911 trainer with affordable ammo or field-carry gun for small game -- or just plain plinking fun.
Constructed from an alloy called Chiappalloy and feels like the real deal, adding to the overall heft of the gun. With castings built in many cases to the exact specifications found on the Colt 1911, the overall feel and balance is very similar the classic Colt 1911. (A genuine 1911 designed from the ground up – not a converted plastic toy or paintball gun. Does not use the plastic parts or pot metal found on some 22 LR imitators.)
Safeties include the traditional 1911 left-handed thumb safety that blocks the slide and trigger as well as a firing-pin safety.
The grip angle is the same as the legendary 45 ACP Model 1911.
The 5-inch, fixed barrel is quality steel that is part of the frame – forming a solid piece of metal that produces excellent accuracy and a stable feel. Also easy to field strip because of the fixed barrel.
Sharp looking walnut grips are laser-checkered and remind you of vintage walnut grip panels. Very comfortable to hold and look good against the black finish.
It’s easy to work the slide to chamber a round (a plus for those who lack hand strength due to an injury or arthritis).
Shot this gun with expensive ammo and bulk ammo – I was impressed either way. Surprised me how well it grouped at 25 yards!"
