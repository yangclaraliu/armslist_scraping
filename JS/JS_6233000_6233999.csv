The Samson Manufacturing Evolution Series free float rails are customizable AR-15 handguards. The Evo rail attaches to a standard barrel nut with a two piece thermal bushing constructed of stainless steel, two locking tabs ensure the rail does not rotate under stress. The thermal bushing along with the generous ventilation slots help to keep heat from transferring into the handguard and into the operator's hand. The continuous top rail allows you to mount optics anywhere along the top of the rifle and allows same-plane iron sights to be mounted.  The interior of the tube is 1.56"" in diameter, allowing most suppressors to fit underneath.
 
Installation of the Evolution series handguards does not require special tools. Since the standard barrel nut (not included) is used to mount the handguard only the delta ring, weld spring and snap ring must be removed. This means you can install the EVO rail system without removing the barrel from the upper receiver, a step that requires specialized tools such as receiver blocks, barrel nut wrench or AR-15 multi-tool. The delta ring must be cut if you do not remove the barrel from the upper."

You also get 4 brand new D&H 6.8 mags, I paid ($20ea) for them. The black Aires High proformus bolt carrier group is in like new condition with only 60 rds though it, I paid ($225) for it. The carrier group still has the 5.56 bolt in it so you will need to buy a 6.8 bolt for it. I saw one on ebay for $75. The buffer is the standard buffer for the AR-15 but it works great with the 6.8. And also I added the Trijicon China knock-Off re dot scope witch I paid ($80) for it. It is a knock-off but it does work well and I'm throwing it in because it's collectioning dust on my shelf.

Other identifying markings found on the gun include ""Fabrique Nationale Herstal Belgique"" on the left side of the slide, some proof & inspection marks, as well as a very small NHM SAC CA import mark on the right side of the frame.Bought this one from AIM Surplus years ago when many Israeli military and police Hi-Powers were hitting the market.  They were in excellent mechanical condition but as expected most had some metal finish wear.The black enamel finish on Mark 3s tend to show scratches, and this piece is no exception. However that is just cosmetic, it has no serious flaws.  Compared to other regular Mark 3 Hi Power pistols the trigger pull on this is not bad at all, I'd guess that it's about 6 pounds.

It's a 6 shot with a 4-1/2"" barrel all blued.The gun is in perfect shape, bluing is 100 %, it's never had any issues.  I have had to make a few tools to work on it, like a jig for putting in the main spring and a split flathead screwdriver. It's just too big for me to carry concealed and too small to deer hunt with, so I'm looking for something else.It'll come with a speed loader and a box of .357 Hornady JHPs and the ""tools"" that I made for it.  And a nylon shoulder holster if you'd like it.  I might also have some .38 special JHPs depending on how the weather is this weekend.Yes, I listed this under S&W for the manufacturer.  They don't have Zastava and I wanted something.And, just because I know that you're going to look it up, here's the history: Zastava produced these in the early 90's, this one was 1992.  Most of them went to the Serbian military during the split of Yugoslavia.  The batch that came to the US was used as a service pistol, but I can't find out by whom.  Since that's the case, the trigger is what you'd expect from a service pistol--stiff.  I've never had any problems with it, but some folks online have.  If you have a tendency to PULL a trigger instead of SQUEEZE it, you're going to have trouble."

Tikka's are made by Sako of Finland and the barrels come off the same assembly line.  These are some of the most accurate rifles right out of the box.
If you purchase this rifle from Scheel’s, Bass Pro or Cabela’s you'll pay around $600-$650 plus tax for a total of $650-$700 out the door. Get this one for $525 plus your choice of premium quality scope rings.  The $525 gets you the rifle, bases and your choice of Votex Viper machined aluminum rings or Warne machined steel rings.  Feel free to call me @ REDACTED with questions."
