Product Description The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

This was listed with the Sadlak steel scope mount shown in the photos but people haven't been interested in the mount. The factory shipping tag is dated 1-29-98. I haven't found anything that shows Springfield's catalog number. The rifle is built with desirable original new GI parts from Harrington & Richardson. None of the marked parts are Springfield Armory reproductions. The op-rod, bolt, and trigger assembly are HR marked. The barrel is by TRW, dated 6-63.It has a GI contract rear sight with a correct M-meter elevation knob.The front sight is a standard 0.072"" width blade, tapered towards the front. The rifle has a California-legal muzzle brake. It screws on and is readily replaced with a flash hider if you live in a free state where flash hiders are not demonized.The stock is GI, walnut, and remains about new condition. There's few marks and no cracks or chips or major problems. The edges are still pretty sharp, not beat up. It appears that the left side forward of the grip was sanded, as the wood is slightly lighter colored there. The acceptance stamp is still visible though on the left side beneath the rear corner of the receiver. The grip shows two circle-P proof marks and thus I suspect the sanding to the left side was done during the rebuild and that this stock was removed from a rifle that was rebuilt and later destroyed, unused. The buttplate looks good, not scarred or ugly, with nice original finish.The bore is clean, shiny throughout, and looks as-new. No copper, dark spots, or defects visible. The finish at the bottom where the op rod often touches is still there, suggesting the rifle hasn't seen a lot of use.The finish on the hammer and op rod tab and cam areas shows little wear."

Gun fires smooth as silk and the the muzzle device makes barrel climb almost nonexistant. I will trade straight up for a Rifle Dynamics RD501 in any color. There are non on gunbroker and you cant get one from Mark anymore so price reflects that. I am happy to answer questions but if i even think you are a scammer I will not answer. This will ship from my FFl to yours. I also had the MKIV ambi safety installed at Krebs and upgraded the CTR stock to the ACS-L."

(also, i can email you more pictures, for some reason i'm only able to upload one pic while creating the ad)New-in-box, never fired Eagle 15 AR-15 by Armalite. This is the Optics Ready Model, so it does not have the A2 style front riser sight, instead relying on a milled aluminum gas block that acts as a front sight mounting point. I've just mounted up some aluminum flip-up sights made by Ozark Armament, really nice sights for the price. Rifle comes in factory packaging, tube of lube, and a MagPull Gen2 P Mag with a 15 round limiting rivet in place. If you're not familiar with the brand, Eagle is Aramlite's entry AR that gives S&W, Ruger, DPMS, etc a run for their money. Features include:-Full contour heavy barrel (doesn't get skinny under the fore grip)-Carbine length gas system-M4 feed ramps-Fully staked gas key-M16 profile bolt carrier-6 position collapsible stock-4140 chrome moly barrel w 1/8 twist (sweet spot for 5.56 bullet weights)-Chrome-lined bolt carrier-Upper and lower forged 7075 aluminumThe Eagle 15 is chambered in 223 Wylde which is compatible with both .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO. It's essentially a bore chambering feature that snugs up on the 223 round a bit, while still allowing the 5.56 to fit as well. Is rumored to offer up improved accuracy. You be the judge.The rifle is very well made, tight, no gaps between upper and lower, and will make someone a sweet shooter. I picked it up the Tanner show last weekend, and have changed my mind on what my needs are for a defensive weapon. My asking price is a great deal given the rifle's new condition and the added sights (the OR model does not come with sights) - I'm' essentially throwing in the sights for free. Due to Colorado's laws, guns sales between private parties still requires a background check, so we'll have to meet at a gun store that can facilitate the required paperwork. I have one in mind that will charge the buyer $16 for the check, but you'll pay no tax on the deal since it's between private parties.Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking!"

Extremely rare Winchester Model 12, 28 gauge in good condition, 70-80%.  All original, solid rib barrel, full choke, matching serial numbers.   It has a few light scratches on the right side of the receiver and a few nicks in the stock.  Approximately 2,600 of the Model 12-28 were produced, and only a few hundred has the solid rib.  Bore has a mirror finish.  Checkered pistol grip and forend. 
  The Model 12 Winchester was produced continuously from 1912-1980. Over 2,027,500 were produced both in standard and deluxe (Pigeon) grades. Pigeon grades were first listed in 1914 and disc. during the war (1941). Reintroduced in 1948, they were disc. permanently in 1964, after which the Super Pigeon Grade became available only on a custom-order basis from Winchester's Custom Gun Shop. These guns are worth 50%-300% premiums depending on gauge, barrel lengths, stock options, engraving patterns, etc. With an attrition rate of approximately 33%, Model 12s with rare features produced 50 years ago will only be much rarer today (and expensive). 28 ga. guns were built between 1937 and 1960. Gauge rarity in increasing order is 12 ga. (approx. 360,000 mfg. 1925-1943), 16 ga. (approx. 190,000 mfg. 1925-1943), 20 ga. (approx. 71,000 mfg. 1925-1943), .410 bore (Model 42), and 28 ga. (approx. 2,600 mfg. 1937-1943). Serialization breakdown by year of manufacture is provided under the ""Serialization"" section of this book. When collecting Model 12s, ser. nos. on the underside of receiver (forward end), should match ser. no. on bottom rear of Mag. tube.Serious inquiries only.  Sorry, no trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax."

The total production run was less than 8,000. This particular pistol has never been fired, according to the person I bought it from. We feel it is accurate but will not guarantee that as we are not gunsmiths or experts. The vast majority of the blue remains with small finish issues here and there but nothing major at all, it really looks great. The bore is immaculate. The grips have no issues I can see with the checkering at 90%+. We have not tested it and will not, especially due to it never having rounds through it. All moving parts seem to operate properly and I see no issues with its functionality. 5"" Barrel. I just noticed a red hue to some parts in the photos, the pistol has no red - i polished it using a rouge cloth and some of the rouge got on the gun."
