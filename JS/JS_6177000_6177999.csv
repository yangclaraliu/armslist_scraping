KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM RAIL 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.   Kryptek patterns utilize a multi-directional design to effectively conceal in a multitude of terrains that have either a lateral or vertical flow. The bi-level layering of the patterns incorporate background transitional shading and sharp random geometrical foregrounds to create a three-dimensional effect that ensures the utmost in concealment at both close and long ranges. These components, combined with colorations selected and matched based on input from testing and observations from Operators in the field, make Kryptek patterns optimal for many different environments.   LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

I bought it about two years ago and it pretty much has sat in my safe since then. I've only taken it out a few times. Once to site in the scope (200 yd zero) and the other time to give it a bit of a workout at long range. I have put exactly 65 rounds through it. It's a standard .50 BMG chamber, 30"" barrel with the Bohica ""fish gill"" muzzle brake and has the upgraded bolt handle.Comes with an adjustable bipod, Bushnell Elite 3200 10x40 scope (same one that Barrett outfits some of their 50 BMG's with from the factory), Butler Creek flip up covers and Burris Extreme rings (.50BMG capable).The lower is an AZ Armory billet picto lower with a Magpul PRS stock, Magpul trigger guard, DPMS Panther adjustable grip and will also include a Jimmy Plug for the magwell. The trigger is a bone stock RRA LPK. The hammer has been modified professionally per Bohica standards for smooth operation.The lower has had NO modifications to it and the only difference between this one and a standard AR15 lower is that the lower doesn't have the bolt catch installed (not needed in the .50) and it has a wolff hammer spring installed. Also, there is no buffer spring, buffer catch or buffer (as these are also not needed in the .50)this package also includes 200 rounds. This includes ball ammo, tracers, and armor piercing rounds I'm asking $4000 for the entire package. Let me know if you're interested."

Comes with Upper Sandusky, Ohio made rifled slug barrel with fiber optic front sight and apeture rear. This is an accurate deer hunting rig for Ohio, where I hunted with this shotgun until I moved to Indiana (it is also deer legal in Indiana). I shoot left handed, and as a bottom ejector, this is ideal. I have the left-handed safety installed. It can be switched back to the right handed side, though. It has a decelrator type recoil pad installed, which is very important if you want to shoot slugs. I also have a smoothbore modified choke ""roto-forged"" field barrel (no rib). These shotguns do not use screw-in chokes, however, their barrels are quickly and easily interchanged. Their barrels are also thinner walled and lighter for this reason, but they still are steel-shot compatablie. I also have many shotgun slugs that work well in the barrel that I could sell. Any qustions, just ask. This shotgun is by no means like new. It has considrable shine on the receiver from brushing against clothes and a spot of rust here and there, but it is still in good, fully functional condition. I will ship to FFL (at buyers expense), otherwise FTF in Indiana with Indiana resident."

It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR-15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be. The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT™ is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT™ from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability. The SAINT™ features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb. While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT™ features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT is easy to shoot to its full performance potential. Speaking of performance, the SAINT™ is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none. Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT™ includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference. A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT™ uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions. The SAINT™ is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory® low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with ½ minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation.

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.   The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in 10mm, this KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.   The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states.
