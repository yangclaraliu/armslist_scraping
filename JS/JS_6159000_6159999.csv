I originally purchased it to get into punching holes in paper at distance, but I never have enough time to go to an actual 100yd range. It comes with a Bushnell Banner 6-18x50mm scope, a generic bipod, and a custom leather adjustable cheek riser which I had made because I couldn't reliably attain a cheek weld without it. It also comes with ~150 rounds of mixed brand .17HMRs as I was hunting for the most accurate round, which I found to be CCI 20gr hollow points, those got me into the 1.25-1.5"" range at 75-100 yds. Its a fun rifle and a great way to start out scoped shooting. The rifle is in fantastic shape with about 200 rounds through it and has only been cleaned with a boresnake which I'll include. I'll also sell the hard case if you pay asking price, $400 obo. I'm interested trades, let me know what you've got!"

Being able to actually see the internal workings is even better.The cut-away started off as a new rifle. The barrel, gas block, lower receiver, upper receiver, stock, buffer tube, pistol grip and magazine have machined cutouts so you can see the internal parts and their movements as the gun cycles.The bolt carrier group and charging handle are fully operational and can be manually cycled along with the trigger and selector. The functionality of the lower is fully maintained, so the rifle is transferred as a firearm, as per all federal and state laws.Since the barrel has been cut open, firing the upper is a no-no. A dummy round is glued in the chamber to illustrate cartridge placement in the chamber and barrel, as well as to block the barrel, preventing it from being loaded with live ammunition.Comes with 10 dummy rounds for display in magazine.This is great for wall art and is a perfect instructional tool as well!Will ship for $20"

If you are shot while wearing any body armor, you will be subject to bodily injury. There could be bruising, blunt force trauma, fractured bones or even a risk of death even though the round did not penetrate. Therefore, you should never purposefully be shot while wearing body armor or attempt to test this product while wearing it. The armor may stop the bullet from hitting your body, but it will not stop the inertia from the bullet transferring to your body and causing death or injury. Before buying any body armor, it is recommended to contact your local law enforcement agency to determine the laws in your area. You need to take ultimate responsibility for your purchase and be certain that you are following all laws and regulations for your jurisdiction. By purchasing this product you certify that you have not been convicted of any felonies in any jurisdiction.

The issue has been resolved so feel free to contact me if you're interested. Hi armslist, I am selling or trading my ar pistol. Pistol was built on a zombie defense lower registered as ""other"". The complete lower was fitted with colt parts except for the buffer tube, buffer and spring. It also has a magpul ambidextrous sling plate, magpul moe flip up sights, a radical firearms 7.5 inch upper and rail, a smith and Wesson carpenter 158 mpi bolt and carrier bcm charging handle, and magpul pmag. I have roughly 900.00 into this pistol, and have had an armorer check it for function, as well as for proper assembly.  I have ran over 100 rounds through this gun to check for reliability, as it was to be a truck gun for me, but lack of a constant facility to train with it properly has me sticking to my hand guns. i would love to trade for a 15+ round capacity 9mm, depending on what it is or a glock 29.  I will also take cash offers, but I'm not looking to get 900.00 I understand that this is a used gun, and am willing to deal accordingly and am negotiable. Thanks for looking.there has been some concern brought about because of my choice in a mill spec buffer tube and the legality of the pistol because of it. I attached a letter from the BATF with their ruling in such a case to put potential buyers minds at ease."

If your are not familar with installation, you will need to remove the glass and window regulator, which requires 1/4"" (I think) rivets. If you have done that before, this installation is a snap. A couple of holes need to be drilled in the rear panel of each door, near the bottom for a one of the brackets.

But sadly I do not shoot it enough. I have put less than a hundred rounds through it. Shot about 50 rounds through this pistol so far. Love it, I really do. I just don't go out the range like I use to though and finding ammo for this gun is sadly hard enough as it is one of those odd ball rounds. I have never had a problem with this gun at all, it has worked flawlessly for me the few times that I have shot it. It comes with 3 ten round mags, 2 twenty round mags, two holsters, one black hawk, one IWB holster for it and 50 rounds of hollow points. Still has the original box, instructions, gun lock, the only thing that I no longer have for it is the initial bullet that comes with every gun. For some reason I do no have that. More than likely I lost it when I was moving, hope that small detail isn't a problem. I would be open for a trade, I would love to see if there are any 5.56 rifles out there that someone might be willing to trade, I do not want a DPMS though sadly. Have had a few rifles by them and just do not like the AR-15's that they have sadly. I also do not want any handguns or bolt action rifles. Sorry folks. Also, deending on what the rifle is and waht all comes with it, if we do trade, I might ask for a little extra money on top. For example, if you just have the base rifle: 700-750, I will only ask for a little cash on top of that. Just to make up the difference. But if it comes with sighs, scopes, mags and the such I would be a lot more willing to just do a strait trade. Hope this catches someones eye."
