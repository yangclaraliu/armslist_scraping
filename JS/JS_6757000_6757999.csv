I received this pistol in a trade so not sure on the manufacture date but from my research on the SN it seems to have been made in mid 2013. Great pistol! Make a cash offer or I might be interested in trading. Not looking for anything specific so just make an offer. Thanks for looking.

Works perfectly, no issues, has Barska's lifetime warranty. 20-60X magnification, 60 mm lens. Waterproof.
I was viewing bullet holes at 200 yards and had no problem seeing them, so good for longer ranges also.  Great for the kids for star gazing as well.
The only reason I'm selling this as I am now doing shooting competitions in prone position (laying down) and need a spotting scope with an angled eyepiece.
The tripod is a Velbon, not junk, they are well made with solid, quality hardware ... no issues, extends to 4 feet high and down to 18 inches.
Price for both is what you would pay for the Barska alone, and you can use the tripod for your other recording devices.  I live near Manchester & Clarkson and work near 40 & 94. Let me know a public meeting spot that's halfway-ish for both of us."

Overall, rifle is in good preowned condition, but does wear the typical battle scars from brass deflection typical of all 556s I've seen.  Expect typical wear in other areas.  Comes as pictured LESS the Trijicon RXO1.  You will receive the EOTech 552 pictured separately.  If you don't want any optics, please contact me and we'll discuss a reduced price for the rifle.  I have a number of mags and ammo I can include for the right deal.Willing to meet within a reasonable distance of Huntersville and sell face-to-face in accordance with applicable laws. Will ship to your FFL after clearance of payment and receipt of signed FFL copy.

An Auto-Brightness sensor continuously samples lighting conditions to provide optimal reticle intensity, or can be overridden should the shooter prefer the manual mode. The exterior lens surfaces are treated with Leupold's DiamondCoat™ that adds abrasion resistance and durability, and assists in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast. The aspheric lens creates a wide field-of-view, with sharp image quality, allowing user to keep both eyes open and focused on the target. Slotted windage and elevation dials allow positive 1 MOA adjustments without the need of lock screws. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro Reflex Sight is constructed with a lightweight aluminum housing, shrouded in spring steel for maximum durability, and has been waterproof tested to 66 feet. Includes battery, and protective cover."

In addition I purchased a whole new internal parts set from brownells as well. All of the parts are new and sealed in their packaging. everything from springs, to firing pin, safety selector etc(there is a wolf replacement spring for all the springs in this gun included ""also factory sealed"").  In addition the recoil spring and magazines have been replaced with Wolf Springs.

Overall in very good condition, but with a little love and elbow grease, can perform like practically new.
