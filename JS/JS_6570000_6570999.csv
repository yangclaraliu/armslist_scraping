The Remington® Model 870™ Pump-Action Shotgun is one of the most proven firearm designs in history. The 870 Express® is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it one of the most useful tools that an outdoorsman can own. The versatile, no-nonsense 870 Express can be used for hunting waterfowl, upland game, and deer, as well as a home defense shotgun, and informal clay pigeon shooting. At the heart of the ultra-reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and swing fluidly on fast flying birds. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun comes with an ultra-durable laminated hardwood stock and fore-end, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A durable, rubber recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. Functions with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells interchangeably. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes."

This rifle was custom built for me a few years ago by Rock Ridge Machine Works - the same shop that makes rifles for Creedmor. In the two years I have owned the rifle, I've taken it to the range 3 times, and put fewer than 100 total rounds through it. It has been a safe queen, and I need to free up some cash at the moment for other expenses.The rifle is based on original Remington USGI issued receiver and bolt, and rebuilt into a precision rifle. The original parts (receiver, bolt, butt plate) have all been reparkerized. The stock is new walnut with a very nice natural tiger-stipe grain to it. The barrel is a new Criterion barrel, and the scope is a new (reporduction) M82.The USGI manual is included for the rifle, as well as a scope manual.Surplus .30-06 ammunition is also available and can be included in a deal for a modest price.Please let me know if you'd like to see additional pictures - thanks!"

Has 3 chokes too.It also comes with an ATI stock which is installed, the factory stock, a pistol grip, and a hogue orange less lethal/hunting (some people cover the less lethal and use them for hunting) stock.I'll list everything below along with the prices they generally sell for alone:Mossberg 500 w/20"" barrel & extended tube ($400)ATI Stock (installed) ($89)Factory stockHogue Stock Set ($70)Pistol Grip ($30)28"" ported barrel w/ full, modified, and improved cylinder chokes (last ones sold for $200-$300 due to rarity)Rifle sock ($10)All in all, you're getting $600+ worth of stuff. I hate selling this, but as I can't properly and comfortably use it, I have no reason to keep it right now. I was excited to get it and use it this summer for some hunting/skeet but looks like I'll have to go another route right now.Asking $350 FIRM for this.

Made in Germany and imported via Interarms of Alexandria, VA. A recent (informal, i.e., not documented) appraisal by a gun dealer rated it nearing 98%. This pistol has only been fired during the factory test firing (paper target included). The wood grain grips are immaculate and well crafted. The pistol is in superb condition. It was purchased as unique collector's item. The only unfavorable detail, yet no ill-effect, is that the pistol was likely preserved in WD-40 at one time as was commonly done in past years. However, it cleaned up nearly perfectly with modern solvent and gun oil. Included in this sale is the original box, magazine, tools, factory test target and manual. The box is in good condition with some wear; the foam has some slight brown discoloration from the formerly-used preservative (likely WD-40 at one time as was done in earlier years). Matching serial numbers in two places on the pistol: 11.009871. Dates to approximately 6/1/1978. I'm happy to entertain any questions regarding this pistol. Note that I have one other very similar pistols that will be sold as well - 1970s Mauser Parabellum 9 mm (6-inch barrel) in immaculate condition.

While I was there, Al Jazeera was in the shop doing a news piece on the shop closing.Rifle has 650 round through it since purchased in August 2015. Always used high-quality brass, never anything cheap.It’s a great weapon to have, but just not very practical for what I’d really like to do: hunt. Also, the lack of opportunities to shoot anything but paper at very strict ranges in the San Francisco Bay Area makes owning this rifle less appealing. The rifle works fantastically. I was in Arizona last weekend blowing up watermelons and two liter bottles in the desert on BLM land north of Tucson, AZ.The Package Includes:1 - Sig Sauer 716 Patrol FDE (Flat Dark Earth)1 - Burris AR-536 5x36 Sight (Black) (SKU 300210)1 - Ledsniper® action Bipod Handle High Quality Polymer Bipod Holding System2 – 10 Round Magpul Mags, 1x Black, 1x Sand Color2 – 25 Round Magpul Mags, pinned for 10 rounds, both black color1 - Pelican 1750 Large Rolling Long Gun Case with Foam4 – Master Lock 140Q Solid Brass Keyed Alike Padlock with 1-9/16-inch Wide Body and 7/8-inch ShackleTerms:

Designed specifically for military and law enforcement operators, the APX has been put through extensive testing and evaluation at the professional end user level. The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences. The APX’s aggressive full length slide serrations make slide manipulations easy under any conditions . To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous. The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta."

HIt comes with a box (not original) and 3 mags.  It has been used but well taken care of—internals are great, everything works as it should, and of course it’s a flawless shooter.
I’d rather sell but I will entertain trades.  I am open to tons and tons of firearms, but here’s a small list—all will of course require cash on your end:
Howdah Pistol, Titanium Gold Desert Eagle in .440 Cor-Bon (for the wife), Barrett M82A1 (in .50 BMG of course), Krieghoff Trumph Drilling, 1874 Creedmore (Sharps Model), .276 Pederson, 1903 Springfield .30-03 (I have one but want another one), Chapuis Savana (double rifle) in .416 Rigby, Winchester 1886 in .50-110, H&H Royal Deluxe. 
This is just a small list and I’m sure that I’m forgetting so many others.  In fact, about the only pistol brands I’m not into are Glocks, S&W, Springfield, Kimber, Kriss, SIG, and Taurus—except one of those Taurus pistols dipped in that killer baby blue color!  Other than that, just try me!!  Please just make sure that you are a high-baller and that your offer isn’t insulting.  I know what I’m talking about and I KNOW MY GUN STUFF, though I’ll probably assume that you don’t and try to take advantage of you in a trade. For reals.

As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…
This rifle is the best Winchester that I have ever owned. Early serial number, Early I cut cartouched stock ( WRA over GHD ) as well as a RIA EB cartouche. ( Rock Island is likely the place where it went from a high wood to a low wood ). Early checkered push button safety.  All parts appear to be  Winchester marked with the exception of the front band. The handguard is a 4 rivet, but should be a two rivet.The stock is in great shape, as is the finish on the metal. NOT AN IMPORT . $1600 OBO . I can take more pictures of the inside, etc . if you are seriously interested. Thanks for looking."
