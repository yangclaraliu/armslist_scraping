Seems to prefer 55grn ammo for the best accuracyFull auto bolt carrier group(gun is still semi-auto and legal of course)Adjustable shoulder stockSight removed from gas block2 aluminum mil-spec 30 round magazines *loaded* with 55grn ammunition**Scope and rings not included, but will sell with gun for an extra $100.**I spent alot of time assembling this gun, deburring all the little parts so the detents and actions all work great, mags fall free nicely, and it shoots a nice group even in my hands, I managed a 2"" group at 65 yards. Trigger is the stock unit that I cleaned up with some fine grit sandpaper and polish, but there is lots of improvement to be had between a trigger upgrade and someone that can hold still better than I can! I'd expect one could easily cut my group size in half with a nicer trigger setup.Gun has about 300 rounds through it, I've cleaned it every 3rd magazine and kept the inner workings well lubed with slip 2000 ewl. Gassing is PERFECT, empties eject at the 4-o-clock area consistently. Condition wise, it's in beautiful shape, no scratches or plier marks from assembly, always worked on and shot from a blanketed table or my shoulder and kept in the case shown(case not inlcuded sorry).I love the gun and didn't want to sell, but I'm doing a varmint build now and don't really need to keep this one. GF's 10/22 is not for sale sorry:)The scope is a very cool piece, choose between 32 different reticle colors and brightnesses or simply shoot with the illumination turned off. I beleive it is a 50mm 4-16X. It extends your shooting time well into dusk, or even at night if you have some ambient light over the target.  The scope rings allow quick removal of the scope if needed, and while they are not perfect when removed and re-installed they are pretty close. The last time I removed and re-installed the scope it was shooting low about 1"" at 65 yards. Scope itself holds zero very well, I've never had to adjust it unless I've removed it.  I'll include the scope and rings for an extra $100...about $50 off what it cost new.Serious inquiries only and no trades please. Cash and local in person sale only, buyer pays transfer fees and I'll accompany you to the store/transfer place of your choice.Priced real and fair at $530, a good deal for all thats included comparable to similar AR's for sale. If the listing is up it's still for sale.Text is best 360-three-won-nine-4519"

And his automobile designs have included some of the most iconic automobile designs of all time including Ferrari, Alpha Romeo, Aston Martin, De Tomaso Mangusta, DeLorean, Audi, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Masserati, and Porsche to name just a few. At its introduction, the Beretta 9000 brought together unique and highly functional design elements such as their patented adjustable magazine floor plate that contributed to excellent ergonomics in a small package, and a fiberglass reinforced polymer frame with rubber over molded grips that provided an improved slip free grip for all weather conditions. One of many collectible Berettas - the 9000 provided a lightweight and compact design for easy carry, yet one that still included a very respectable 12-round capacity (9mm) and a slide that rides on internal rails inside of the frame, facilitating better slide management and a smoother cycle.My father once described Berettas as ""beauty with a purpose."" The iconic Beretta 9000 warrants inclusion in the most discriminating Beretta collections as another example of Beretta's unsurpassed ability to bring together both form and function. This Beretta 9000S (9mm Type F) is in excellent condition and includes a never worn leather OWB holster, Beretta hard shell case, manual, parts tube, new (spare) recoil rod assembly, and two like new OEM 12 round magazines, one standard and one with patented extended foot plate.   Local Sale Only.

All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

They are authentic SIG Sauer factory magazines, (manufactured by Mec-Gar), and have a phosphate-coated finish for durability.
It is reported they will function in the newer model P229-E2 which holds 15-rounds as standard capacity. But if you have the P229 “Classic” model the 13-round standard magazines are becoming hard to find and the newer E2-design 15-round capacity magazines are not backward- compatible!
While they have been removed from their packaging, three of these magazines have never even held a round in them! The other two magazines have minimal wear on the finish as they were usually carried in a Bianchi dual-mag pouch as backup magazines. The original springs in those two have been replaced with brand new Wolff +5% power springs, so you can be sure they are in perfect functioning condition."

These are for the ORIGINAL, “Classic”, model of the P229, (NOT the newer E2-design); they hold the factory standard capacity of 13-rounds. They are authentic SIG Sauer factory magazines, (manufactured by Mec-Gar), and have a phosphate-coated finish for durability.
It is reported they will function in the newer model P229-E2 which holds 15-rounds as standard capacity. But if you have the P229 “Classic” model the 13-round standard magazines are becoming harder to find and the newer E2-design 15-round capacity magazines are not backward- compatible!
While they have been removed from their packaging, three of these magazines have never even held a round in them! The other two magazines have minimal wear on the finish as they were usually carried in a Bianchi dual-mag pouch as backup magazines. The original springs in those two have been replaced with brand new Wolff +5% power springs, so you can be sure they are in perfect functioning condition."

No FFL required for Ohio residents  18+ legally able to own a firearm. It is your responsibility to know all laws in your state/city including mag capacity limits. I also sell on Gunbroker, but price items far less here since there's no shipping or FFL fees (with the bonus to see before you buy).
Face to face transactions get priority on a first-come first-serve basis to avoid bidding wars. Payment by cash preferred, but will also accept USPS Money Orders. I will ship where legal in the CONUS with an added $25 FFL transfer fee plus actual cost of shipping. I'm located in Toledo, OH with plenty more pics if interested.

Ruger Gun Info - The RUGER® LCR® is a double-action revolver that incorporates many features found in the famous RUGER® SP101®, GP100® and RUGER® Super Redhawk® revolvers, as well as several new innovative features. The unique fire control housing incorporates the same grip extension as the SP101®, GP100®, and Super Redhawk® revolvers. The craned cylinder assembly of the LCR locks into the frame in the rear of the cylinder and at the front via the ejector extension. The internal parts are installed through the top of the fire control housing or through the bottom in back of the frame. Therefore, no side plate is needed. The RUGER® LCR® has a transfer bar which is connected directly to the trigger. The transfer bar safety system provides that the hammer blow can be transmitted to the firing pin only when the trigger is pulled all the way to the rear. This is a positive internal safety feature. NOTE: The transfer bar is allowed some movement within the fire control mechanism so that the trigger pull is not affected. Due to this necessary “play” in the transfer bar, a shooter will sometimes hear the transfer bar “rattle” when the revolver is shaken. This rattle caused by the play in the transfer bar is completely normal in the LCR® ."

The smaller sizes also work well for in the pocket use. The construction of the holster uses the pressure from your clothing waistband to secure both the holster and the gun. They don’t come with clips or loops to secure it in place, as the outer “sticky” skin adheres to your waistband, undergarments and/or your skin. Since our inception, we have developed these holsters into a modular system, where you can use it IWB, in the pocket, on your ankle using our ankle rig and for police officers, on their tactical/armored vest, using our B.U.G. Pad. How does a Sticky Holster work? The outside skin is a super non-slip material that, with a little pressure, adheres to just about anything. That outer material combined with the inner closed-cell foam and the inner liner keep your pistol and the holster securely in place. In the pocket, it works like any other pocket holster. However, when you pull the gun, the outer layer grabs the inside of your pocket. Our modular products use the same “Sticky” material against itself to hold the holster and gun in place. In addition, with use and body heat, your Sticky Holster will conform to your particular gun, making a custom fit."
