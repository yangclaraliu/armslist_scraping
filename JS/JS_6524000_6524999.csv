Ergonomically, its very nice. Now, if it would only shoot. My my story goes like this,: I bought it new about 3 yrs ago at Academy. Because I have other pistols, it was a while before I ever shot it. When I got around to it I found out what everyone else knew.......it wouldn't cycle. I read some blogs about it and they all pointed to the sucky feed ramp. Disgusted, I put it in the safe and forgot about it. Several months ago I decided to do something about the pistol, so I called Sig. To their defense, they said that in the manual it says specifically to use only ""high velocity"" .22 bullets. I checked my manual and indeed, that's what it says,. But, LSS, they had me send it to them and they polished the feed ramp and some other things and sent it back to me. I loaded it up with HV bullets and it shoots perfectly......and is now a very sweet pistol.But I am selling it because I have purchased a .22 suppressor and need a threaded .22 pistol.....and no one sells one for the Mosquito. So, now you can buy this very nice shooting Mosquito that has been fixed by the Sig folks for $200 firm. I have not tried cheapo .22 ammo in it but I KNOW it cycles perfectly with the HV stuff (like Federal 1300fps).  And I know it has not had even a hundred rounds through it.i might trade something for it, but I really need to get a threaded pistol.call, txt or email. REDACTED. I actually live in Powell MO (15 miles north of Pea Ridge)oh yeah, it comes with three magazines and a cheapo Cordova holster......but it works......(and manual, case, etc)"

It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode.

A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow.

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2? barrel fitted with a compensating muzzle brake. Fit with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Carrying on the Scorpion’s reputation as a reliable pistol-caliber plinker without breaking the bank, the Carbine starts at just $999. Items are available for local sale in South East Houston, just a few minutes from Beltway 8 and I-45. We accept Visa/MC/Amex/Discover with no credit card fees. Also, we're in unincorporated Harris County, so our tax rate is 6.25%.  We also offer reasonable shipping rates (actual cost of shipping)."
