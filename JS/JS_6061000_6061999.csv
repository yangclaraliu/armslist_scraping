The S&W Shield .45acp will come with the original cardboard box that S&W have been shipping their guns out in anyways also will come with traditional lock, and all the paperwork it will come with the two magazines that come standard one is a flush fitting one that holds 6 rounds of .45acp and then the other magazine is the extended one that holds 7 rounds in the magazine. I got the pistol, and haven't even fired it once the only time it has been fired was at the factory. I will also include a box of brand new Federal HST defensive Ammo with the firearm. This is a great CCW pistol it's just I'm a Glock Armorer, and unfortunately had to sell all of my pistols due to some medical bills due to a messed up spine anyways that aside yes I also have both my Wisconsin, and Utah CCW permits, and both are mine are current, and valid also a valid DL. I would expect anyone interested in a trade that they also have a valid CCW or a valid DL so we could do a bill of sale/trade I guess that would be the wording. Anyways I'm only interested in Glock Pistols!**As a side note I had a Glock 29SF Serial#PWK813 which again I had to sell due to bills at that time so if by some miracle the current owner see's this add and would be interest in trading that would be great but again aside from that I look forward hearing from anyone interested in a trade, and thank you all for reading my post!**(I will either try to get pictures up on this site, and or if someone is really interested I could text the pictures to them when I can take a few otherwise they should be up hopefully no later than end of day tomorrow.)

It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter. The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all. This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction."

The Compact version is about the same size as a Glock 19 with great ergonomics and excellent trigger.
I put 150 rounds through this firearm, cleaned and lubed it and became a safe queen. With the low round count, the frame and barrel are excellent and the frame is great with only light markings from being stored in a holster. I carry an M&P Shield 99% of the time and this Sig is just too good to not be used. 
This firearm is set up to carry with some of the finest self-defense sights available in Trijicon HDs plus an IWB/OWB holster. Package includes the following:-Sig P320c 9mm pistol
-Original Sig case, holster & paperwork
-Trijicon HD sights (installed)
-SIG OEM night sights
-IWB /OWB Combo Holster  My asking price is $500 and I'm not desperate to sell it so please save the ridiculous low ball offers. Consider if you buy a P320c + Trijicon HDs online or from a gun store expect to pay $600+ including shipping, transfer fee, sales tax, etc. In this deal you also get the holsters and OEM night sights.
I have bought and sold many guns through Armslist with no issues and want to keep it that way. I only deal with responsible adults over the age of 21 with a valid Indiana Driver’s License. I don't want your private information - I just want to ensure the integrity of the deal."
