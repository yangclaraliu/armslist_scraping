You know who you are, and you know you want this pistol. You know that 10mm is the most powerful standard auto pistol round (without getting ridiculous like a desert eagle) - and that it's the perfect gun for hiking in Idaho. You love the idea of taking 15 rounds of hard cast 200gr. deep penetrating high speed lead into the back country with flawless Glock reliability- and it all weighs less than that 44 mag revolver you've been packing.You may not have realized this can double as a great gun to carry once you're back in civilization. Load it up with 135gr. hollow points and now you're prepared for anything a night on the town throws your way. Since this gun comes with 3 magazines you'll also be ready for a couple reloads.I'm including a couple of holsters that you can wear inside or outside the waisteband, as well as the magazine loader that came with the gun.This is a 3rd Gen Glock 20 SF- the SF means the grip is cut out to give you a higher and tighter grip to better control the recoil. I've taken off those annoying front finger grooves for you and scalloped the trigger guard, again to allow you to get high up on the gun.Your new pistol has just been broken in- it has about 300-400 rounds through it. The trigger is set up with a NY1 spring and the 3.5lbs connector- giving you a smooth clean breaking trigger like a great double action revolver. I have the original parts as well if you want it back to stock.Price reduced after a sale fell through! You can email me or message at 339-3080Local pick up only- scammers leave me alone - I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but Liam Neeson has are a very particular set of skills. Skills he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for people like you. If you let my listing go now that'll be the end of it. He will not look for you, He will not pursue you, but if you don't, he will look for you, he will find you and he will kill you."

The revolver was unique in that it had the ability to fire several rounds per minute before having to reload. Revolvers were typically issued to officers and mounted soldiers, however some were purchased privately or found on the battlefield by infantrymen.Distinguished by its octagon barrel and lever style loader, the 1851 helped to begin both the expansion of the West and the Civil War. The 1851 Navy is commonly considered to be one of gunfighter “Wild Bill” Hickok’s favorite handguns. The British government licensed the manufacturing rights and produced what is commonly known as the London Model.
