Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.Model: Solo CarryCaliber: 9MMBarrel Length: 2.7""Weight:17ozsSights: 3 DotFinish: Duo ToneGrips: SynthetricCapacity 6 +1MSRP: $924"

A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. I only have one!"

Every single number all the way down to the firing pin matches and is correct. The condition of the gun is immaculate for its age and the bluing is in great shape.

For sale is a USED Walther PK380, black tenifer-finished slide with polymer frame, steel 3-dot sight posts, chambered in .380 ACP with approximately 300 rounds fired through it.  This is a pre-owned, former EDC firearm, with blemishes that include: holster wear on the slide and front sight post, with minor oxidization and obvious wear marks along the barrel.  These are cosmetic issues only, and do not impact the function or effectiveness of the firearm; the pistol is well-maintained and regularly cleaned/lubricated, and I have never had a failure that wasn't due to shooter error.  However, I am disclosing the flaws to be fully transparent to potential buyers.ITEM(S): Your purchase includes:- One (1) Walther PK380.- One (1) Eight (8) round magazine, stock with pinky extension base.- All original tupperware and enclosed accessories, etc.SELLER'S NOTES: This was one of my first handguns, and an excellent starter gun for teaching purposes.  A double/single action design with an exposed external hammer, the Walther PK380 features a fully ambidexterous manual safety with a German-style paddle magazine release, making this a great option for left-handed shooters.  As an added safety, the Walther PK380 comes with an internal trigger lock, activated with an included key, to prevent manipulation of the trigger when not in use.Apart from its ambidexterous features and multiple safeties, the Walther PK380 boasts a lock breech design that makes for arguably one of the easiest slides to rack/chamber.  Recoil absorption is excellent, in part because of the round but also due to the ergonomic grips and framing.  The result is a felt recoil that is comparable to a .22lr, which again lends itself towards new/inexperienced shooters... and especially those with limited or compromised hand strength.SALES: Serious inquiries only, please.  Interested parties MUST possess a valid MA LTC. Seller will follow ALL state and federal laws and regulations WITHOUT EXCEPTION, FTF transfer at a licensed FFL or via MA E FA-10 with proof of valid license.  Buyer to pay transfer fee (if applicable).  No out-of-state sales, no shipping.TRADES: Willing to consider trades for Ruger LCR-22lr, Ruger LCR-22WMR, Ruger LCR-9mm, Walther P-22, Ruger SR-22, Savage Rascal.PRICING: New, these retail for around $400, and feature cheap plastic sights and a few other differences that (in my opinion) diminish the actual value.  Used models tend to run in the low $300s.  This is a great deal on a great little pistol."

Phosphate barrel with a 1:7 twist ratio. It has never been fired by me, as I just assembled it for sale. They test fire them at the factory when assembling the upper. So, it has been test fired only. I pulled the BCG, diss assemble it, wiped it down and reasimbled it. Then I lubricated the bolt with an AR15 light grease. I have been building AR's for over three years. This M4 mock in a mid-length gas system is one of my favorites. I am often asked ""how cheap can you build an AR?"" The answer is, I do not ever want to build a cheap gun. I want to build a quality gun at a fair price. So, this is the best for the price. Palmetto is a quality brand that uses USA made products.

First, the 1905 S update was for the spitzer bullet and involved some cleanup work in the chamber and throat but NOT any changes to the bore. The other changes came when Turkey replaced the sight (see the markings)in 1930 as there was a rebuild effort which included new barrels, ensuring that they could use the .323 ""modern"" ammunition. You can see the pristine ""in the white"" barrel with the 7.91 stamping in the photo. This indicates a new barrel that is safe to use with the larger size bullets (BUT due to age, theres no reason to use full power surplus ammo in these and NEVER 198gr) They also modified the receiver to take stripper clips. Another change, likely around 1930 when the Turks refurbed and updated their 88s was to put a cut-out on the left side of the receiver so it was like the 98. Supposedly, this is for hand/finger access to push down the stripper clips and putting your hand there, it is perfect for that. Other than those updates, it is a German manufactured gun. Stock, receiver, barrel jacket, trigger group...I included photos of many parts with the stamping. The Turks added a stamp to some parts. The parts stamped with the crescent moon are the safety lever, the bolt knob and the top piece of the bolt housing the safety. The triple stamp proof marks you see on the receiver are--LEFT: Hülse hart = receiver hardened MIDDLE: Lauf mit Schloss beschossen = barrel and bolt proofed (proofed with ""over-pressure"" cartridge) RIGHT: Lauf mit Schloss fertig = barrel and bolt ready (put together, functioning) The small one in the middle/top was stamped, as the rifle converted to the M88/05 standard. The stock is solid and in great shape. The barrel jacket is lightened in color and more a plum brown but it is not bare or rusty like many. The receiver has faded bluing but the stampings are sharp and clear. The trigger is superb on this one as well. This rifle has been cleaned to a high level. That means the threads were degunked on the barrel and jacket, the inside pieces of the trigger and bolt release were cleaned and though it is 127 years old, the bolt glides in and out but with less looseness than a Mosin. They really made rifles well and with a huge amount of hand labor and fitting. I see many of these listed at crazy prices but the high prices should be for super nice all matching ones. This is a rifle for someone who will shoot it. As it isnt numbers matching, and though it rates in the top 20% for condition of these rifles, that means about 1 in 5 are better, so for the museum like collector who wants the finest (it also means it is better than the other 4)...this is not for you. What this is, is a rifle that will shoot as well or better than a modern rifle as the bore is gorgeous (I tried to get good photos but that is hard to do), the trigger superb, the bolt locks tight and the rifle is overall..a beauty. By the way, that little cutout at the top front of the receiver is NOT for the tip of the spitzer bullet, but to use the older round nose bullet from before 1905 as they are longer. Little trivia there. These do best with the lighter weight spitzer ammo and not the 198 grain heavier loads which were used in WW2 for machine guns and K98s. Though this rifle can supposedly shoot surplus 8mm with modern diameter bullets (.323) it is an old girl and best to go easy. US commercial ammo is always fine as it is loaded to lower pressures and has .321 bullets (between the .318 and .323 of the old and new). The best is loading cast bullets to 1800-2000fps or so. You can work up great loads that outshoot any factory with much reduced recoil and wear and tear. I do that for all my milsurps in general. This rifle has an outer jacket in very good condition (relative to age and typical condition). There is some older pitting in the steel along the wood line but no active corrosion. The jacket has two shallow and small dents near the muzzle. The inside was cleaned and the threads cleaned and greased. The barrel itself is likely ONLY 85 to 90 years old and the outer surface is exceptional. Zero rust or corrosion as no water was trapped in the space as that will ruin these rifles. The bore is EXC with sharp rifling and no frosting and no anything. One of the finest bores on these rifles I have seen. The wood has its serial number nice and clear inside and is free from any cracks. Solid and clean The bolt is all matching to itself (the parts of the bolt) and the bolt head matches as well. No wear or anything other than a clean and strong bolt The sear has a sharp edge and the trigger is cleaned and crisp while an excellent target weight for a military rifle. This rifle needs NO cleaning at all as it has been detailed pretty well. All hidden cosmoline and gunk was removed.

Swiss 1911 Rifle All Match # 100yrs Old - Rarest Model Str8 Pull,"Davie, Broward, South Florida",$ 445,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 29, 2017",Rifles,no type,7.5x55 Swiss                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"OUTSTANDING CONDITION--** I HAVE 25+ PHOTOS I CAN SEND ANYONE INTERESTED**When you consider this rifle is a century old (made early 1917), it is AMAZING in design and condition. While most Swiss rifles are well above average for milsurps (never used in war and maintaining rifles is part of society) there are many that have had parts replaced and the bluing on many receivers is faded. Not here. First, the 1911 rifle was the lowest production of all the standard Swiss models. They even made more 1896/11s which are almost identical, but were built up to 1911 specs from 1896 models. The 1911 was only produced for 6 years, which is why it has such low numbers. The 1911 was the first model designed to use the GP11 ammo which is the modern one you can buy right now. The finest ammo is the Swiss surplus and as its 50 cents a round, and the fact that you would be VERY lucky to handload ammo that will outperform it, stock up! This rifle has all matching numbers including the stock, magazine, trigger.....all the numbers I can find. The stocks were the best marked of all the milsurps I have seen too (see photo of inside). The magazine is the part most often mismatched and for a 1911 design that uses stripper clips, it is very easily replaced like modern rifles so you can load spares. The Swiss cross stamp and cartouche is clear and sharp on the wood and all steel parts. Even the little ones have it. Not too long ago, Classic had some nice 1896/11s for close to $400 and they sold out fast. What you see most often are the K31 as over half a million were made and when they were replaced a few decades ago, many came to the US. The 1911 rifles were only made from 1913 to 1919 which is why so few were made. This is a rifle that was made BEFORE the 1920s, over a decade before the stock market crash, before Prohibition and before the Roaring 20s. Yet, it can hold its own against almost any modern rifle. The straight pull design is fast and positive so it has more capacity than a new Remington 700, faster reloading by far, lower priced ammo in general (than most calibers in factory ammo) and accuracy is darn close. Of course, you cant compare iron sights to a good scope, but these rifles were made by serious rifle lovers where shooting is more than a past time, it is a requirement. If you want a Swiss straight pull for your collection, I know the K31 is a few inches shorter, but EVERYONE has one. I have both, and if you already have a K31, this ancestor (parent is closer) of it is amazing to see side by side as the K31s were made up through 1958 and in service up to the 70s in some areas and this K11 is from WW1 days. WW1 vs Korea and the rifles are so darn close and in terms of accuracy, the K11 may have an edge. There are many photos and this rifle only has some bluing loss at the last inch of the barrel, likely from fitting a bayonet. This is a very common area of bluing wear. Thats pretty much IT! The wood has handling marks of course, but so few and so minor it is obvious someone loved and cared for this one. Compared to the others I see, this wood is far superior. In 100 years, it managed to remain in this condition. The magazine and triggerguard blue is superb as is the entire receiver. Check the finish on the magazine bottoms of others, as this one is awesome in comparison. These rifles are loaded with all manner of proofmarks and acceptance stamps in the metal. The bolt handle is the typical phenolic and is not cracked like many. The bolt, receiver and bore are beyond gorgeous. Oh, one other mark on the wood is from an oval sticker just ahead of the magazine. It will likely clean off as its sticker residue BUT since I see the stickers or the same mark on most others, I left it so the new owner can decide what to do. Its part of its history so I leave it. Below are the specs, and there are some great sites with the history of the Swiss series.

I will require the buyer to fill out a bill of sale with their Florida drivers license or Florida concealed carry permit. I will not sell to anyone under the age of 21 or anyone that can not legally own a firearm in the state of FL."
