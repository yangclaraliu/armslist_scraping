$600 firm in cash or best trade offer will be considered.
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment except AR pistol parts like the KAK Shockwave kits and around a 10"" 5.56 upper and shorter 9mm upper, PSA or Spartan lowers/side charge upper and folding devices.  I know I can get these uppers cheap from PSA, so will trade for one of those plus cash on your end or trade for a nicer upper.  If wanting to trade, just let me know what you have and the overall deal and I will consider.
No scammers and must be able to own a firearm in TX.  Can ship the upper anywhere for $20 more."

Whether it's single actions for cowboy enthusiasts or pocket revolvers for concealed carry, Ruger has delivered time and again no matter what the need is! The Super Redhawk Alaskan is a model developed for backpackers, guides, or wilderness professionals for added protection against the ultimate ursine: the North American Grizzly. The small but robust frame can handle the recoil of a .44 magnum round well enough to give the user a quick and accurate follow-up shot. This particular firearm has had relatively no rounds put through it and is in near perfect condition! Come in and grab it at a heavily discounted price and take back the wilderness!"

The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. Its open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. The 92 FS pistol is the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in Italy.

The tubular folding stocks on these rifles come equipped with a spring loaded cheek riser, and lock firm in the closed position when folded. These rifles are built at the Molot Oruzhie Factory in Molot Russia, and are newly imported to the United States Market. These are chambered in the versatile and hard-hitting 7.62x39. These rifles are built using 1.5mm RPK Receivers, making them 50% more reinforced than traditional stamped AK Rifles. Additionally, these rifles are built using heavy RPK-Style Chrome-Lined Hammer Forged Barrels, making them exceptionally rigid and extremely accurate. The barrels are threaded in the traditional 14x1mm left hand pattern. Also, these rifles come with a factory installed mil-spec side rail for mounting optics (these would make excellent AK-Pattern Designated Marksman Rifles!). These rifles have Black Polymer RPK Furniture, and a Warsaw-Length Buttstock with trap door containing a cleaning kit and cleaning rod. These rifles will also accept any standard mil-spec double stack AK Magazine. These will make great down-range investments given the future uncertainty on Russian Imports. They are very high quality, well-built rifles, and are made to last for generations. Please contact us with any questions. Note: This rifle ships from the factory with (1) 5 round magazine (we do have additional new/never-issued steel surplus 30 round magazines with bolt hold open followers available for purchase for $16 each). We accept almost all forms of payment (2% fee for card over the phone). *Don't forget to check out our other auctions!"

These rifles are built at the Molot Oruzhie Factory, in Molot Russia, and held to exceptionally high quality standards. These are chambered in the versatile and hard-hitting 7.62x39. These rifles are built using 1.5mm RPK Receivers, making them 50% more reinforced than traditional stamped AK Rifles. Additionally, these rifles are built using heavy RPK-Style Chrome-Lined Hammer Forged Barrels, making them exceptionally rigid and extremely accurate. The barrels are threaded in the traditional 14x1mm left hand pattern. Also, these rifles come with a factory installed mil-spec side rail for mounting optics (these would make excellent AK-Pattern Designated Marksman Rifles!). These rifles have Black Polymer RPK Furniture, and a Warsaw-Length Buttstock with trap door containing a cleaning kit and cleaning rod. These rifles will also accept any standard mil-spec double stack AK Magazine. These will make great down-range investments given the future uncertainty of Russian Imports. They are very high quality, well-built rifles, and are made to last for generations. Please contact us with any questions. Note: This rifle ships from the factory with (1) 5 round magazine (we do have additional standard capacity magazines available for purchase). We accept almost all forms of payment (2% fee for card over the phone). *Don't forget to check out our other auctions!"

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. Feel free to ask me questions if there's anymore things you would like to know ."
