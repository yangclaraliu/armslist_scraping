 The Marlin 1895SBL is an ideal Lever-Action Rifle for big game hunting at close to medium range, or defending yourself against large gnarly creatures in the backcountry. The 1895SBL has a stainless steel barrel and receiver, and a laminate wood stock for ultimate durability against the elements. The barrel has Ballard style rifling to handle all types of bullets—cast or jacketed. The full-length magazine tube holds 6 rounds of powerful .45-70 cartridges, and an enlarged lever loop allows shooter to cycle the action with gloved hands. The Marlin 1895SBL features side ejection, which simplifies scope mounting, and the gun comes with the versatile Lever Rail that allows mounting a standard riflescope on top the receiver, or a scout-style scope mounted farther out on the barrel. For quick, close-range shooting the 1895SBL comes with an excellent XS ghost ring, rear aperture sight mounted to the rail, and a front post with white line up the center. These sights are extremely rugged and do not get knocked out of alignment easily. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad helps absorbs recoil from heavy .47-70 rounds, allowing shooter to stay on target for fast follow up shots. A receiver-mounted crossbolt safety effectively blocks the hammer from hitting the firing pin. Sling swivel studs allow for the attachment of a rifle sling for convenient carry in the field with the hands free. Marlin 1895SBL is a very quick-handling Lever-Action Rifle that shoots a cartridge powerful enough to knock down any species of game in North America. The 1895SBL is built to hold up to rugged use in harsh environments. Made in USA.

I don't have pictures yet but will take some if interest is shown.
Looking for a higher end 9mm handgun, full size SIG or 1911, or new M1 Carbine nothing else will make me get rid of this rifle so please don't ask.  The rifle currently has XS peep sights on it and will come with ammo (see below) and an old Weaver 1.5x4.5 scope in excellent condition for the right trade.  Sorry no scope rings. Since these are no longer made the value will go up a little more, not too much but a little I suspect.  I will not sell ammo or scope separately.  I have learned the hard way about that.  Scope fits this small frame carbine, if you like scopes on a lever action if not there is value to re-sell. Check the other sites for the value of these rifles.  This rifle is a blast to shoot and carry.  44 mag recoil in a carbine is easy to manage.

There are approximatedly 335,000 of these made during the war. As the need arose for more weapons during the war many of the guns were assembled using Colt parts by MFG's such as Ithica, Sears, Remington, and Colt.This .45 is fully marked and in nice condition for the age. It's been fully serviced by a gunsmith and is in great operable condition. I just cleaned this gun after running about a 1/2 a box of shells through it with no issues. It shoots a nice grouping at 20 yards. Comes with a new 8 rd. magazine. Sights have been replaced and set for 20 yard shots. The barrel was replaced. Original barrel is included but is not useable.

Complete with all original paperwork, bushing wrench, lock, etc. The only handling this pistol has had was to take it out of its plastic shipping bag for the photos. It's exactly as shipped from Dan Wesson. This is 1 of 50 that Dan Wesson built as a special run.  Beautiful color combination.  The somewhat ""mottled"" look to the finish in the photos is from the factory Dan Wesson oil as it was shipped in its plastic bag and is not in any way a finish defect.  Wiping off the oil will reveal a ""not mottled"" finish underneath.  I didn't want to wipe off the oil so as to sell it just as it was shipped.  The new owner will have the pleasure of wiping off the firearm for the first time.UPDATE - new photo added, I did wipe off the factory oil from the right side slide flat (only) to show the true color.Given that this is a extremely fair price for a new Dan Wesson Heritage, my listed price is firm.  No trades.Will ship to where legal (+$25)."
