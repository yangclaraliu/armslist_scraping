Uses 2 piece throat (included - used but in good condition.). Most Winchester 8 round mag tubes call for a screw on 1 piece throat, however this tube will not accept the 1 piece. I've asked Gunsmiths, Range Officers, Gun Store Employees, Shotgun affecianados and online forums and no one knows why it is made for the 2 piece throat. If anyone recognizes the exact model this tube is made for I'd appreciate a heads up. Like I say, it fits into a 1300 receiver. (Buyer to pay any shipping charges.)"

A folding stock, lightweight Czeck rifle that looks like an AK, fires the same ammo as an AK, even sounds like an AK, BUT...completely different striker firing system with no hammer. Milled receiver, yet it is 1 pound lighter than a stamped AK. The standard Czeck rifle, the VZ58, first issued in 1958, comes with what is affectionately known as ""beaver barf"" furniture. A shortage of wood, combined with the superior properties of plastics led to tossing wood in a shredder and mixing it with plastic. That way any pieces of wood and even scraps could be used and large solid pieces were not needed. It is also much more efficient to change shapes. This folding rifle has had the ""beaver barf"" handguards removed, and a Mako slim railed front end installed. It has a top and bottom rail, and a forward grip looks great (get the folding one). As the grip was the standard AK shape, or just a rectangular slab, I replaced it with the finest ergo grip of all my military rifles from FAB DEFENSE. It feels great to hold. They make this $12 piece of plastic that slips over the buttstock with a dimpled rear surface. It extends the length just a tad but more important, it will not slide off your shirt as the bare metal does. It has enough ""grip"" to stay in place now. A black sling is added and you are left with a compact 26.5 inch package. Just over the legal minimum. It has the standard AK style slant muzzle-brake but you can easily add many others in under a minute. They sell an M16 style bird cage for $10 that screws right on and looks better. They just had a bunch of these come in and many have a plastic railed front end added. Atlantic Firearms and other places have them for $699 plus shipping with ONLY 1 mag, NO FAB Defense ergo-grip, no sling and no stock stippled panel. You are looking at $735 delivered PLUS what the FFL charges and then add $40 or more for 2 more mags and $25 for the grip and $12 for the sling plus $12 for that piece of plastic on the stock (makes a big difference). About $842 to get this same package in your hands. Or, $665 and it is yours! Below is the description from Century who makes them. Due to the import laws, the receiver and barrel are made in the USA, machined for a bar of steel, and then an original Czeck parts kit is installed. Local sales FTF with proper ID and if you are not local, I will ship to your FFL for $36THIS IS THE INFO ON THE RIFLE SOLD BY ATLANTIC--The rifle I am selling has 3 mags, sling, stock pad, Mako railed front end and ergo grip by FAB DEFENSECentury International Arms VZ2008 7.62x39 caliber semi-automatic Rifle. Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Includes 1-30rd magazines, poly pistol grip, a poly quad rail front to attach your favorite attachments"

Rifle was $700, pump $200, air stripper $100, currently has s simple mill-dot scope which was only about $50, total of $1050, but I'll sacrifice it all for $750, or $500 for the rifle...  Check out the Evanix Rex on youtube with Airgun Web TV's Episode 15, (shows a few other rifles too, good video)This thing puts out around 140 ft/lbs of energy with an 80gr pellet or cast bullet at around 870fps, enough to take a dear inside 100yards no problem, weighs only 5lbs and is the perfect survival/backpacker gun.Serious inquiries only, call anytime.  REDACTED"

I need help with $120 and I'm losing hope, I never lose my faith in G0d but I wont have a roof over our heads for my 2 year old if we don't come up with the money by tonight and this has broken me down more than you will ever know, we have been sleeping in my truck and I dont get paid till next Friday June 30th to pay the rest of the rent, my number is 615-439-8899, I would be more than glad to talk with someone and tell them our story and how we got here or please pray for me and my family as I'm just needing some help or a loan and anything that points me in the right direction, I dont care what it takes to save my family and will write a contract and sign it, let you hold my bank card or the registration to my truck I would do it or help would be something I would never forget, I'm really scared and have prayed and prayed and prayed and ask G0d to take care of this thank you and G0d Bless ANYTHING HELPS I'm only doing this for my 2 year old, if you can't help just please send me a message saying you will pray for me and my son thank you so much, I don't care what I have to do to keep this roof over our heads, if its a loan then I can give some collateral to hold, or I can do whatever to work it off I just need help, if its not the full $120 then anything helps even if its a little! Thank you and g0d bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, I don't care if I have to give someone my bank card to hold and my social security card, even the registration to my truck just so you know I have to come back to pay if its a loan, I posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, I have received messages saying people are cautious to meet in person, well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, G0d bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend"

Designed by Emerson and USA-built by Kershaw, this handsome auto takes Emerson’s tactical looks to the next level of refinement.The Launch 5's CPM154 powdered metallurgy blade steel offers more uniform distribution of carbides—so it takes and holds an excellent edge. It also provides good corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and toughness. The blade is stonewashed for good looks and to hide use-scratches.To lighten the Launch 5's weight, the handles and integrated backspacer are made of durable anodized aluminum. A machined texture on the handles provides a secure grip. The Launch 5 opens with a push button, recessed so that it is level with the flat of the handle. This is a safety feature and makes it harder for the knives to accidentally deploy. Left-handers can use their index finger instead of their thumb to press the blade-release/lock button. A reversible pocketclip is included and a lanyard tie-off is built into the butt end of the knife.TECH SPECS• Made in the USA• Designed by Emerson, built by Kershaw• Integrated backspacer and lanyard tie-off• Automatic push button open• Push button lock release• Reversible pocketclip, (left/right)• Steel: CPM154, stonewashed finish• Handle: Anodized aluminum• Blade length: 3.4 in.
