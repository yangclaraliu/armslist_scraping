Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine, and real windage-adjustable sights. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features an FEA (Finite Element Analysis)-designed slide and barrel that are stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil. The absence of removable pens and tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are all hard-coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. This EXO model is self-lubricating with an exclusive EXO (nickel/boron) coating to protect the slide from wear, pitting, and rust.SpecificationsType: PistolAction: DoubleCaliber: 380 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Barrel Length: 2.8""Capacity: 6+1Safety: Firing PinGrips: Black Polymer Grip/FrameSight Configuration: AdjustableWeight: 8.8 ozFrame Finish: BlackFrame Material: PolymerBarrel Type: 4140 SteelSlide Description: Nickel BoronSight Style: Adjustable"

For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find EL CEN series 1911 38 super, Detective Specials, Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 6 and 4 inch nicel Python.Hard to find Smith and Wesson guns such as 625-2 (model of 1988 which is believed to only have had 1500 made, all original), Pre-lock Lady Smith revolver, pre-lock 29-3 combat, chiefs special cs-9 like new, and an engraved unfired Smith model 29-10.Have several 1911 guns in brands such as Rock Island, Ruger, Springfield including Loader Operator MC and TRP Operator, Para Ordinance 14 45 limited stainless double stack with 4 mags, early Kimber combat carry with laser gripsAlso have a Walther PPK (Interarms Richmond VA the rarer one) basically like new and a Walther ppk/s with crimson trace laser and box, (smith and wesson) I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome. I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

List it in the correct city and state. In your discription you state there is no box and the gun has a 5 1/2 barrel... Your photo is of a 7 inch model 41 and is in a Smith and Wesson box...  So it sounds like that is NOT the gun being sold....Again it looks like a scam.   Most guys looking for one of these guns should know your price is about half the average price of one of these guns...  Sounds way to good to be true... Buyers beware...

I have more pictures. This is a Chinese SKS Type 56 rifle modified to a bullpup configuration with a SG Works stock. The rifle will be sold with the orginal 10 round non detachable magazine installed. It's up to you to modify it to accept detachable magazines (Easy Modification). I will include 4 30 round magazines if it's legal to sell them, but if it's not legal to transfer them in the state of MD the 30 round magazines will not be included. I bought this rifle in the early 90's. I bought it brand new. I shot it maybe 200 rounds out it, I cleand it, and then it sat for 25 years. About two years ago I saw this SG stock online, and bought one, installed it, and it actually works pretty darn good. I was suprised. It's a great CQB rifle, but don't let it fool you because it has a 20"" barrel on it, and believe you me it will reach out and touch something. So really you have the best of both worlds. I have never had any serious issues with this rifle aside from the standard SKS quirks, but I have also never used the rifle much. I would go as far to say it may not even be broke in fully yet. I've really only shot the darn this a couple of times. I have taken it to the range and shot it with the SG bullpup stock on it, and had one problem with the stock, and SG promptly replaced the part with an updated part, and it never failed again. So really the rifle is ready to go. The rifle comes with a Sitemark reflex site on it, and it seems to work pretty good. I paid $80.00 for the sight, so it's not an ACOG, but it does work. I love this thing, but I'm selling it because I want a Tavor. The rifle is actually a complete set, and comes with all of the extras I've listed below.This rifle comes with the following:1 SKS Type 56 rifle1 SG Bullpup stock installed as shown1 Sitemark reflex site installed1 Orginal SKS Type 56 stock not installed1 Bayonet1 Kit with all parts to put back to orginal condition1 Orginal SKS stripper clip pouch4 30 round magazines20 stripper clips1 Orginal sling1 Front GripIron sites for SG stock.

I should point out that I am not a professional gunsmith, so I will recommend that if you intend to fire this rifle, it would be worthwhile to have it professionally inspected because of its age. I personally have never fired this rifle, but the previous owner did fire it plenty and said it was excellent at long range.When the Swedes made these, they serial numbered about every piece of metal on the gun, and every number matches – which means it is the same complete set of parts that was originally assembled into this weapon in 1909. I see the crown cartouche and serial number on the receiver (of course), bolt, extractor, bolt retainer, safety, firing pin, sling band, bayonet band, butt plate, floor plate, and three separate pieces in the rear tangent sight. Even the magazine follower has the cartouche on it, though no apparent serial number. The stock's serial number is not visible without disassembly, but it is cartouched.The barrel's serial number is not visible without disassembly. It is import marked ""M96 SWEDEN 65X55"", and on a line below that, ""C.A.I. ST. ALB. VT."" The barrel length is 29"". It has very good rifling and no apparent muzzle erosion.The rear sight is an adjustable leaf, with marks up to ""20"", which probably is supposed to mean 2000m = about 1¼ mile — perhaps a little optimistic! The trigger is clearly a combat trigger, not a target trigger, but its break is quite crisp without any apparent creep. The stock and handguard are beautiful walnut, with marks, scratches and scuffs befitting its 100+ years, but I think it could be turned into a showpiece with a little work.The 6.5x55 round is one known for long range accuracy. Take a look at the Wikipedia description, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6.5%C3%9755mm#Sporting_use if you are not already familiar. It was one of the first successes of a 6.5mm round, and of course you see more and more variants of those today.The rifle is about 49¾"" long overall, and weighs about 9 pounds, 7 ounces unloaded, with the sling and cleaning rod.Included with the rifle are several accessories:- bayonet, scabbard and frog of the correct type that does fit on the weapon, but the serial number on the bayonet does not match the weapon.- cleaning rod that mounts in a slot under the barrel. This rod is of the correct type, but the serial number does not match the weapon. (Very common)- adjustable 1¼"" wide leather sling with brass keepers and buckle. It is of the correct type for this weapon, but it is not possible to determine its authenticity – however I believe it could be original.Also available to the buyer of the rifle at additional cost are a supply of ammunition, and equipment and supplies to make more. Of course this is an unusual round, and while you can buy all the new ammo you need, it's a great round to handload:- 60 rounds of handloaded ammunition, marked with the load information. Of course even I would recommend caution with anyone else's handloads, but he was loading them for his own use, so I believe he used due caution. Of course they could always be pulled down and reloaded to your own specifications.- 1 round that is apparently an originally military round- 83 shell casings in apparent new condition- 187 Remington Corelokt 140-grain PSP bullets- set of RCBS 6.5x55 dies in excellent condition (RCBS #13201), in boxThe pictures here are just to whet your appetite, but I have many others and would be happy to take more if you want to see something specific. When you're ready, let me show you this beauty in person!I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I'm willing to ship to a dealer at buyer's expense. Buy it from me and have it today – no sales tax, no dealer fees, etc. I will be offering a few other things, so check out my other listings and let's make a deal!PENDING SALE"

I never cared for shooting .40 and this is the only one I ever owned. You seriously won't find a nicer G22 on Armslist. There isn't a spec of carbon or the tiniest of scratch on the entire gun and has been sitting in my Liberty since 2014. I am the original owner.The gun has the original box, paperwork, cleaning rod, 2 backstraps (before they included 4), six magazines with Pearce Gen 4 textured extensions on all of them (they were $11 each but if that isn't your thing baseplates are dirt cheap to swap), factory mag loader, Pearce grip plug ($6), Glock extended slide release ($15), and a Ghost 3.5 connector ($20). The gun has not been modified or tampered with in any way aside from the connector swap. Again, if the lighter connector isn't your thing a new one can be had for as low as $15.The gun is mint. If you were to purchase it from a shop in its current conditon you would pay around $30 less than the price of a brand new one. Probably a lot more with all of the mags and features.I am after $500 or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls. No trades at this time.Buyer must be an Ohio resident or pay $35 in shipping to an FFL.I live in Central Ohio but travel to Toledo often. I would be willing to drive 30 minutes outside of my way to meet up.Thanks for looking!"
