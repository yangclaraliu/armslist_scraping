The quality of the pre-war rifles, the fit of the wood the finish, and overall internal machinery is a superb time in history for Winchester. This rifle was the rifle to do all the things the 1886 and 1895 Winchesters did, all in one amazingly designed cartridge, the .348 Winchester. Built with Winchester proof steel, the rifle could handle greater cartridge pressures, as well as retain better bluing during heavy use. For those who hunt large game such as elk, moose, bear, etc, this is the rifleman’s rifle. The 4 digit serial number, 26xx, dates this rifle to second year production, 1936. Overall, the rifle condition is excellent, with the blued finish retained better than 94%, with thinning on underside of receiver and lever. The remaining receiver and barrel finish is strong, but thinning intermittently. The stock is solid with over 92% finish remaining. There is some wear at the heel of the butt stock, and intermittent handling marks around the stock and fore end as noted in the photos. The lock up is tight and bore excellent on this rifle. It will make a superb collector piece for Winchester lever gun collectors!"

At this point, I'm only looking to trade for something in either 45ACP or 9x19. Please keep in mind: In addition to the gun, I'm including a lot of ammo. 1.) No I won't trade just the gun as I have no use for the ammo without the gun. 2.) If you offer me something worth the street value of the gun, I will ignore you because again-I'm including a lot of ammo. 3.) I get that you might be interested in the gun as a good backup but may not want that much ammo. Fair enough-please look for your backup elsewhere as I have no interest in keeping ammo with no gun that shoots it. 4.) Plese don't ask how much I'm selling for as this is a trade only offer. 5.) I swear I'm not an asshole but like all of you, I have more to do everyday than time to do it so I prefer not to have my time wasted. I divide my time between Alexandria and Woodstock/Mt. Jackson area and can meet local to either place. If we trade, I need to see your VA driver's license and a concealed carry permit. I don't care what state it's from as long as it's current. No exceptions on this. I'll show you mine as well. I won't copy your info and won't let you copy mine but we can take a quick look so we all know everything is above board. if you want a BOS, I'm happy to do that but VA doesn't require it and neither do I."

Caliber .308 Winchester (7.62x51mm NATO). Produced by Valtion Metallitehtaat (Valmet) Finland and imported by VALMET INTERNATIONAL ELMSFORD, NY. Phosphate gray finish of the milled receiver. Wooden hand-guard with carrying handle, black composite checkered pistol grip, wooden “club-foot” RPK style butt-stock, and RPK style heavy barrel with bipod. clean shiny bore. two magazines included.I acquired this rifle in a trade deal. when I got it it did not have a butt stock or a fire control group. A local wood artisian hand crafted the butt stock. it does not match in color but fit and functionality is equal to the original stock. it is missing a spring in the bi-pod which allows the bi-pod to swing freely. The plastic hand guard on the carry handle is missing. the fire control group was replaced with an ALG trigger group. An ALG recoil spring was installed to refresh the old spring.This colectors item needs some work to bring it back to its original glory. original parts are challenging to find for Valmet rifles. however,  the original parts could be found. If you are looking for a functioning RPK type rifle with the history and rarity of a Valmet, then this is for you."

Ignore the pistol grip stock in the pics, it will not be included, I was just too lazy to re-do all the pics so I am reusing the ones that the seller I bought the gun from took.  I have a bunch more pics, send me an email if you'd like to see them.   I also 198 pieces of LC sorted and prepped brass and 100 Sierra Matchking bullets that can be included for an additional $90.   $1050.00 FTF in Rochester NY.    Will probably use Firing Pin in Bergen for the transfer unless you have another FFL in the area you’d prefer to use.   Happy to ship, buyer to pay actual shipping to their FFL dealer, message me if you need a quote (probably around $40)."

It's in the sought after 44-40 caliber and has the standard 20 inch carbine barrel. The bore is exceptionally good for a 131 year old carbine, I'd rate the bore a solid 8 to 8.5 on a 10 scale. The rifling is still nice and sharp, there is very, very light scattered pin point pitting in the grooves but overall a great shootable bore! The front sight is the standard post style, the rear sight is the Winchester #44A ""ladder style"" flip up. The sight is intact and fully functional, the elevation slide holds position as it should from top to bottom adjustment. The finish on the barrel, magazine tube and receiver is a fairly even dark plum blue."

Includes a Kimber 6rd magazine and custom Kimber soft carrying case. Very lightweight and slim pistol for concealed carry. $699  Stainless Steel Slide and Barrel Fixed Low Profile Sights Ambidextrous Thumb Safety    The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

This is the Gen. 2 version, with the forward assist and dust cover. I have other AR's, and was just keeping this one unfired. It's still wearing the factory oil. I've only opened the box, to confirm that the rifle was complete, and properly assembled, which it is.       It will come with everything that it came with from the factory. It comes with a Magpul back-up rear flip-up sight, and a 30 round Magpul Pmag, all of the paperwork and the cable lock.       I'm also willing to throw in a Meprolight M21m, triangle reticle reflex sight, for the right trade! The Meprolight M21m was bought new by me, about a year and a half ago. It's never been fired on a firearm. I've only mounted it on another AR one time, to check fit. It is in the box, with neoprene cover, kill flash and paperwork. It was a little over $500 new. Again, it will be offered depending on the trade.       I will need to see an INDL and gun permit, no exceptions! Obviously, I will show mine also.       This rifle is for trade only! Just looking for something different, something that I don't have. Something new to me, to tinker with! Some trade interests:Mini 14Century RAS47CZ 527 Kel Tec SU-16SKSAK20"" AR-15CZ P-01,P-07Walther PPQ M2Sig P320Other Offers Welcome"

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature, consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels, is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. The P30SK Variant 3 can be fired in either double-action or single-action mode. The hammer is spurred for easier manipulation."
