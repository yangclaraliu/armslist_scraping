You will very quickly get the timing down and it is very close to full auto and completely legal.The revolutionary Binary Firing System™ will be appreciated by three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector that allows the user to switch from Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional Semiautomatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by simply moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. I have (4) of these left.  They are very hard to get.MAP pricing is $386.99.  I am below that.Call/text- REDACTED for details and pricingREDACTED"

Not more than 20 rounds have been shot through the rifle and it has been in a safe since then. Still has the original box.
Rifle is in Burleson, Texas (South of Fort Worth) and is sold out of a private collection. If you are in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area, I can meet you somewhere and you can save shipping and FFL transfer fees but I must see at least a TX Drivers License (CHL is even better!). Otherwise, rifle must be shipped to an FFL in accordance with federal law and shipper regulations. I will only charge actual shipping costs!
Because I am a private seller, I can only accept cash, money order, or check (sorry, no CC). Money orders and checks will still be held to make sure they clear."

I do know it is in near new condition and appears to have been fired very little. I took it in trade.

I am willing to trade this even for a 4 or 6 inch pre-lock 686 six shot with original Target grips in like new condition.
If you have a K or L frame 357 that is something less than the above, send me pics with a description and tell me how much cash you are willing to put with it.
Cash price is $900.
I’m in the mood to trade and here are some things I’m interested in.:
Smith & Wesson K or L frame revolvers in .357Mag. 686, 19, 66, etc. Not really interested in J-frames unless it’s a stainless .357Mag.
Older(70’s)  Belgium Browning Hi-Power
PCP Air Rifles. I been kicking this idea around. But if you offer a trade it has to include a set-up ready to shoot, so it must include a pump or bottle.
Micro pistols… maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out.
Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition. 
Money can go either way. If we trade firearms I require ID showing you are a Tennessee Resident 21 or over and a signed bill of sale (I will provide). I’m in the Murfreesboro/Shelbyville area."

It has A2 style sights with the rear being adjustable, an AR-15 grip and adjustable stock. It also has a ported barrel and a replaceable trigger guard insert. The condition is excellent with just a few minor use and handling marks. The action, which is basically identical to the model 1300, is smooth and reliable. The inside of the barrel super bright and clean. Doesn't appear to have been fired very much at all. Overall I would rate condition at 97%. There is no box or paperwork."

Comes with a lot of extra parts, gaskets, etc... Very little corrosion on this pickup. A little on the bed, light surface rust on the outer frame rails and one small dent on the driver's front fender. While this 22R has considerably more power than a stock 22R it is still a 35 year-old 4 cylinder, so don't expect it to be a tire-roaster. It does really run great, I'm very happy with the jetting and tuning I've done.  Needs no repairs or maintenance except two; the AC system is out of refrigerant. Compressor works fine. One frame-nut came off when the crossmember was reinstalled. I'll eventually fix it unless someone buys it quick enough. It's a very small fix.
