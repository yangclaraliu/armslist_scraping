It is a piston driven AR, which yields a lot of great benefits, in that it cycles faster, runs cleaner and more reliably, and is easier to take down and clean. If you have questions about the Piston vs. the standard Direct Impingement system, I encourage you to look it up. The Truth About Guns did a review on this gun, and it can be found at this link:http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/03/foghorn/gun-review-adams-arms-tactical-evo-rifle/The current version of this rifle can be found online at the adams arms website, though it is severely backordered:http://www.adamsarms.net/16-mid-tactical-evo-rifleThe lower is a Spartan Tactical ""MOLON LABE"" lower which has been colorized in Red and White. This stripped lower can be found at:http://www.joeboboutfitters.com/Spartan_15_Enhanced_Billet_Lower_Receiver_p/jb-spartan15.htmI am willing to include a lot of the accessories which I have for this rifle. Too many to list, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask me.There is currently a 3-9x40mm scope mounted on the gun, with parallax adjustment and illuminated reticle. It can put 5-shot groups in 2 MOA at 100 yds all day (with several sub-MOA groups mixed in)--and I haven't sandbagged it or put it in a vise or anything, that's just shooting from the grip pod (and I'm a crappy shot!). I also have a 4-reticle reflex sight with an optionally attached laser and a pressure pad. (reflex is on it now, but i can include the scope if you want)I have a grip-pod on this gun, as seen in the attached photos.  5 magazines--2x Magpul Gen3 window mags(awesome), 1x tapco AR15 Mag, and 2x steel mags. All work perfect.I currently have 922 rounds of brass cased 5.56 ammo (including 100 rounds of hollow point) to include with the deal. I can also include only 422 or 322 rounds if you would like, or zero. (All of this ammo is included in the list price) This gun has been meticulously taken care of and cleaned after every trip to the range. If you are a serious buyer, I would be happy to show you how to take it all the way down with the piston system--it's not difficult. I firmly believe that this is one of the nicest AR-15s I have ever shot, and it continually impresses me. I can honestly say that I have never had a misfire with it. I am just at a point in my life where this gun doesn't make a ton of sense for me to own. It's a great firearm and I would love to see it go to somebody who will use it and enjoy it.As always, cash talks, but I would also be interested in a trade for other firearms, or really anything of interest. I would consider any rifles, pistols, or shotguns, hunting/target/defense, anything. If you only want some of this stuff, you can make an offer on just part of it.  We can also work out a trade plus cash, whatever it takes. Worst I can say is no, so make an offer!Thanks for looking."

It is a piston driven AR, which yields a lot of great benefits, in that it cycles faster, runs cleaner and more reliably, and is easier to take down and clean. If you have questions about the Piston vs. the standard Direct Impingement system, I encourage you to look it up. The Truth About Guns did a review on this gun, and it can be found at this link:http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/03/foghorn/gun-review-adams-arms-tactical-evo-rifle/The current version of this rifle can be found online at the adams arms website, though it is severely backordered:http://www.adamsarms.net/16-mid-tactical-evo-rifleThe lower is a Spartan Tactical ""MOLON LABE"" lower which has been colorized in Red and White. This stripped lower can be found at:http://www.joeboboutfitters.com/Spartan_15_Enhanced_Billet_Lower_Receiver_p/jb-spartan15.htmI am willing to include a lot of the accessories which I have for this rifle. Too many to list, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask me.There is currently a 3-9x40mm scope mounted on the gun, with parallax adjustment and illuminated reticle. It is sighted in right now, and can put 5-shot groups in 2 MOA at 100 yds all day--and I haven't sandbagged it or put it in a vise or anything, that's just shooting from the grip pod (and I'm a crappy shot!). I also have a 4-reticle reflex sight with an optionally attached laser and a pressure pad, as well as a bushnell trs-25 red dot.I have a grip-pod on this gun, as seen in the attached photos. I also have the Magpul AFG if that is more up your alley. 5 magazines--2x Magpul Gen3 window mags(awesome), 1x tapco AR15 Mag, and 2x steel mags. All work perfect.I currently have 1042 rounds of brass cased 5.56 ammo (and that includes 100 rounds of hollow point) to include with the deal. I can also include only 542 rounds if you would like. (This ammo is included in the listed price) This gun has been meticulously taken care of and cleaned after every trip to the range. If you are a serious buyer, I would be happy to show you how to take it all the way down with the piston system--it's not difficult. I firmly believe that this is one of the nicest AR-15s I have ever shot, and it continually impresses me. I can honestly say that I have never had a misfire with it. I am just at a point in my life where this gun doesn't make a ton of sense for me to own. It's a great firearm and I would love to see it go to somebody who will use it and enjoy it.As always, cash talks, but I would also be interested in a trade for other firearms, or really anything of interest. I would consider any rifles, pistols, or shotguns, hunting/target/defense, anything. If you only want some of this stuff, you can make an offer on just part of it.  We can also work out a trade plus cash, whatever it takes. Worst I can say is no, so make an offer!Thanks for looking."

Purchased it as the solution to a problem that I created myself. I've been carrying mostly CZ pistols for a while. A recent dress code change at work meant I had to switch to slacks, and even with a good gun belt and holster, I found it difficult to carry even the compact CZ75 due to the increased weight. I thought a Glock 19 would be the answer to that. Turns out, it wasn't. Combine a wider gun with my decreased accuracy overall with the Glock and I just returned to being somewhat uncomfortable but carrying something that I am confident in using. I have always been fond of Glock in general, and love my 17 and 26, but for whatever reason, I find myself fighting the 19 to get anything out of it. Benefit from my impulsive buying!For sale is a gen 4 Glock 19 with around 120 rounds through it. Icluded with the gun are the box and all stock items that came with it, 3 magazines, a set of Ameriglo idot sights that never got put on, a stainless Zev barrel, a 3.5 ghost connector and rubberized Talon grips."

If you want to buy a number of them then we can talk 10-15 per crate. Worst I can say is no!I have a handful of surplus Polish Military wooden ammunition crates as well as a pair of Yugoslavian crates that I'm selling to free up some space. I'd like to keep them for long term use down the road but I already have another 20 stacked around. The polish crates are GREAT because no matter what caliber, they all share the shame dimensions and thus are PERFECT for storing a large quanity of mixed of calibers effeciently. In commercial cardboard box containers, the polish crates hold 1920 rounds of 5.56/.223 (in either 50rd or 20rd boxes), 1240 rounds of 7.62x39 (in the usual eastern block 20rd paper packed cardboard boxes), 900 rounds of 7.62x54R, or 2500 rounds of 9mm (in compact boxes, the type were the 9mm casings all touch each other in the plastic tray). It seems they don't really leave much, if any, empty space when fully packed. the 5.56/9mm packed crates I have require pull cords on one of the top layer boxes to be able to get a purchase on a box to pull out. the x39 packs a little more loosely but you still won't lose your packing organization throwing the crate around. The 7.62x54R also seems to pack damn near air tight. I am asking $20ea individually. If you want to buy a number of them then we can talk 10-15 per crate. Worst I can say is no! Here is the break down of boxes I have:

It was barely used when purchased this year. It came to me with all original furniture to be included with sale. It has had the furniture customized and upgraded to include a Zhukov folding and extendable stock in od green with matching pistol grip and quick attach points. It has had the barrel left hand threaded to typical AK 47 specs and comes with a tapco flash hider. The original finish was flawless except after removing the stock furniture it was discovered that due to a loose stock the finish had been rubbed down on the trunnion. Because of these it has been properly dressed with duracoat! The barrel was left out ofthe duracoat process as it wasn't needed. This AK has an upgraded tapco g2 trigger and is a very solid rifle. 922r compliant. Reasearch the SA85M will bring info that regards these AK 47's as being maybe some of the best out there for the taking. Pictures are available of before and after pics of finish and furniture."

This particular model was converted in 1861 from an 1831 Springfield musket, and has the state of New Jersey stamp from one of 20,000 they had converted. It has all four remaining stock cartouches, and is untouched otherwise. This musket is in very good condition, with minor pitting around the breech and other areas of the gun. Otherwise, it is smooth overall, and would make an excellent reenacting piece or collection addition. The cone comes out easy, and the bolster screw functions as well. The bore is smooth, and would be an excellent candidate to reline to shoot .69 minie balls, or to leave as is. I am willing to ship, and the price includes shipping through USPS. ($25)"
