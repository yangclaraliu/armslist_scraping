$1,200 in cash.  Not really interested in trades right now unless it's a good offer.  I appologize for not responding to the people that wanted to buy the rifle and the trade offers recently or not responding in a timely manner, five kids and trying to get my house ready to sell has kept me pretty busy lately. 
If offering a trade or trade +/- cash deal, please be specific on what you are offering and the details on the deal you are wanting to do and I will consider.  Please don't ask if I want to trade for an item, then several messages later(after the deal is or pretty much confirmed) you ask for cash or other on top(yes, happens often), let me know the deal up front, so we don't waste each other's time.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others depending.  Only ""wants"" right now would be another side-charging(preferably left) and folding KAK brace AR 9mm with 5"" barrel and AR in .45 ACP with 5""+/- barrel.  Maybe another Beretta 92A1 or M9A1 or compact model 92 and maybe a 3""-4"" 1911 in .45 or 9mm +cash.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

The polymer on the grip is scratched and worn down in several places. Slide finish is in good shape. Internals show signs of being shot so its not ultra low round count. There is a chip out of the leading edge of one of the frame rails, but the I have put 500 rounds through the gun with no malfunctions. So it is purely cosmetic.  My guess is this gun was a Agency trade in at some point in its life, but who knows. The gun functions flawlessly. I wouldnt hesitate to make this firearm my daily carry if you dont mind the size and weight. Comes with two mags amd some dim night sights. Manufacturing date is 1995."

A smooth single action trigger delivers accuracy and fast follow-up shots. Interchangeable backstraps and aggressive serrations ensure that the sculpted grip meshes comfortably in your hand for greater control. TP9 SF model designed for simplicity, without decocker, manual safety or loaded chamber indicator.The Black Rain Ordnance® BRO Spec15 Carbine Semi-Auto Rifle utilizes a 16"" M4 profile barrel made of 4140 steel. A 1:7 twist stabilizes heavy match grade and military bullets for long-range accuracy. The carbine operates with a direct impingement gas system, with a low profile non-adjustable gas block. The Spec15 comes with a MAGPUL® MOE® grip for solid control, and a MOE collapsible buttstock that adjusts to the perfect length of pull. The 12"" BRO M-LOK hybrid handguard allows the attachment of aftermarket AR accessories at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, and the flat top receiver features a Picatinny rail for sight attachment. An A2 flash hider minimizes muzzle flash after dark. The BRO Spec15 Carbine Semi-Auto Rifle from Black Rain Ordnance provides great platform for a wide range of shooting activities."
