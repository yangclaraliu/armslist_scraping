I also have a Beretta PX4 Storm pistol in the same powerful .40 cal. round, with both guns using the same 14 round interchangable mags. If you are looking for the ultimate ""BUG OUT"" combo to carry, this is it. With open sights the Beretta CX4 Storm Carbine is deadly with a big punch from 125 yards in. It also has the “Bad Axx” look with the after market faux 'FS' flash suppressor. The 'FS' also helps protect your hands from a hot barrel. Converts from right hand to left hand ejection and safety in minutes.
The Beretta PX4 Storm .40 cal. pistol with “Night Sights” and rotating barrel is not only extremely accurate, but has much less felt recoil by design, than other .40 cal pistols, and it uses the same mags as the Carbine, so you will never be without the proper mag. Get yourself a good tactical vest, and you are ready for the “Zombie Apocolypse.” SA/DA with hammer release for the pistol.
Comes totally with 5 mags, hard case for the carbine and factory Beretta case for the pistol.
Will consider selling the Carbine by itself first at $525 (w/o fake suppressor) with (2) mags and then sell the Beretta PX4 Storm pistol with factory case and (3) mags for $475. Call for a great COMBO price?
Call or email for the COMBO price. Both guns are LNIB and fired at range with a box of shells through each to test for 100% reliability. I'm a private gun owner, and will require a Bill Of Sale to an Alabama resident of legal age.Note: $525 price is for Carbine only, w/o the 'FS' which cost me over $100 just by itself. I can always use it on other guns, but it really gives the Carbine that CQC look. If 'FS' bought with carbine add $100.If you see the ad, it means it is avaiable, so don't ask, and no TEXT"

They either fall outside of the date range or have the wrong slide where the horse is in the rear instead of the center of the slide as it should be etc. etc. Don't be fooled by someone that simply calls their gun a Black Army Colt. Know what you are looking at and looking for. This gun is authenticated as shown with the paperwork and has the proper serial number and date range and the proper markings. This is truly an original Black Army Colt 1911 that was manufactured for only about eight months during the year of 1918. When the armistice was signed to end World War 1 in November of 1918 the US government stopped the production of the Black Army Colt. Over the last 106 years of production of the Colt 1911 there were only about eight months of production in which the guns had this finish. Please note the gun displays the proper fully blued trigger, slide release, hammer, magazine release, etc. that were properly blued in 1917 and put into the 1918 to speed production to end the war. You are not looking at a fake or a reproduction or someone who thinks they have something that they don't. This is the real deal and is in wonderful condition with incredibly even wear. I have never shot the gun, but have no reason to believe to be in anything other than fully functional condition. The previous owner told me he shot it 7 times. Please have your local gunsmith verify that this 99-year-old gun is fit to fire should you decide to do so. I make no claims to its operational capabilities other than it functions via the hammer, slide, safety, trigger, etc. like a brand-new gun. This firearm, holster, and certificate are stored in their own separate 10 square foot storage area with a dedicated dehumidifier. I have taken plenty of pictures to show the condition along with the original leather holster from the proper manufacture as shown. The certificate of authenticity is also included as shown. Let me know if you want more pictures. I have plenty.Cabelas had 3 guys examine it for over an hour and offered me $2,000 cash. Said it would go on their shelf at $3,250"

It's in great shape and comes with a few extras as well. It has a Geissele S3G trigger (a trigger with an MSRP of $240). A set of Magpul MBUS gen 2 back up iron sights. All Magpul furniture including stock, angled foregrip, and pistol grip. It also comes with 3 magpul pmags. One in OD green and two black ones still new in wrapper. All magpul furniture is OD green in color. And it comes with the original Daniel Defense hard case with foam inserts. This rifle runs like a champ and is in great shape. About a year after I bought it I decided to build another AR from the ground up. Since then this one hasn't seen much use. It mostly just sits in the safe and collects dust now. I'm asking $1,250 for the rifle or trade for a Bushmaster ACR. Feel free to text or email anytime of day or night.My cell is (502) 682-7057. I will respond as soon as I have time. Thanks!"

All Magpul furniture including stock, angled foregrip, and pistol grip. It also comes with 3 magpul pmags. One in OD green and two black ones still new in wrapper. All magpul furniture is OD green in color. And it comes with the original Daniel Defense hard case with foam inserts. This rifle runs like a champ and is in great shape. About a year after I bought it I decided to build another AR from the ground up. Since then this one hasn't seen much use. It mostly just sits in the safe and collects dust now. I'm asking $1,250 for the rifle or trade for a Bushmaster ACR. Feel free to text or email anytime of day or night.My cell is (502) 682-7057. I will respond as soon as I have time. Thanks!"

That really has a ring to it eh?  And so does that Enblock clip when it ejects on the eight shot ""Pingggg!"" 
 
The Canadian born weapon designer John Garand really created a piece of American history when he came up with this rifle. (That is Garand not Grand)
 
This particular rifle (according to the serial number - 4355908), was built to fight Communism in the Korean Peninsula in 1953 at the National Armory at Springfield Massachusetts (not the same as the modern gun company of the same name). The Springfield Armory came out with the highest quality M1 Rifles every year since they started making them in 1937. 
This rifle, as probably 95% of all M1s in existence today, has been rebuilt at a government armory and bears the government acceptance stamp on the stock to prove it. This is back when rifles were works of art not Legos that simply snapped together (M4s). Evidence of the care put into rebuilding this rifle is seen on the stock - a small amount of glass bedding has been put in place to ensure tight lock up between the receiver- stock-trigger group. (very similar to it's relative the M14/M1a) You can see it in the pictures. You can also see plenty of dings in the wood in the pictures. This rifle may or may not have seen oversees service but if you have spent one day in the military or even just seen a war movie, you know that a wooden rifle stock would get banged up. This stock has a rich red color in walnut stock as well as the typical dings from service in the field. Imagine, some of these dings could have been made right next door at Fort Bragg. I have refinished a couple old military rifle stocks and with a little de-greaser, fine steel wool, and a fresh coat of linseed oil (the original finish) the walnut stock will look beautiful. Right now there is some cosmoline storage grease still left in some spots on the metal and wood (it has a brown and greenish tint in the photos). 
Most M1s these days do not have their original barrels However, this one has the same barrel it has had since it came out of the factory in 1953. I could not get a good photo of the rifling, but it is there! The barrel is in used but good condition, it shoots straight. Even though this rifle was built after World War Two it looks identical to a WW2 serial numbered rifle. In fact, it has the most distinctive detail of a WW2 made rifle - the curved, milled two hole trigger guard. The finish is Pakerization (as all M1s are) and it is in good condition. The Gas Cylinder is stainless steel (as they all were) and for that reason it is painted. Springfield didn't have a good high temperature finish for stainless steel so they experimented with many kinds of black coatings. 
Included in these deal is an empty eight round Enblock clip, and a rifle case specially made for M1s by CMP.  
 
Why am I selling it? Well, it takes two hands to shoot a rifle like this, and there is another rifle I would rather put in my hands. 
 
Remember, General Patton called the M1 the, ""Greatest Battle implement ever devised.""
