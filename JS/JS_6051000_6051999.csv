I'm a flashlight guy. I have or have been through more than 100 flashlights and this one is the best. It's small enough to practically dissapear in your pocket and never gets in the way. It's 300 lumens is plenty for everyday needs and best of all it runs on just one AAA battery. I love that because AAA batteries are plentful and cheap. I like to use recharable AAA's and mine ussally last me about 2 weeks on one charge.The refined, ultra-compact Titan® Plus builds upon our groundbreaking Titan, the world’s first professional-grade keychain flashlight, by adding several useful “pluses,” including more than twice the maximum output—300 lumens of flawless white light! Its high-performance LED also generates two other useful light levels with a simple twist of the head switch: 75 lumens at its medium setting and 15 lumens on low. No matter which output level you select, our proprietary faceted reflector shapes the LED’s light into wide, smooth MaxVision Beam™. And, because there are no intense hot spots and it’s optimized for your field of view, you see things clearly and maintain good situational awareness—crucial for closer-range tasks and safe navigation. Titan Plus may be small and stylish, but it is constructed of durable nickel-plated brass that resists scratching and corrosion. This rugged light features a removable pocket clip that provides countless secure-carry options, because you’ll want to take this light everywhere you go. It also includes a stainless steel split ring for your keys—it is a keychain light after all—but the ring is connected to a useful quick-detach tailcap that permits quick detachment of the light from your keys with a simple pull. Powered by its included AAA NiMH rechargeable battery, Titan Plus can run for up to seven hours before it needs a charge. Or, for added convenience when recharging isn’t an option, it can be powered by a single disposable AAA alkaline, readily available worldwide. Activating Titan Plus is as easy as twisting its head switch counterclockwise for low output. For medium output, simply return to off by rotating the switch clockwise, then counterclockwise again within one second. Repeat the process a third time to unleash all 300 lumens from its microprocessor-controlled LED. For sheer versatility, portability, durability, and functionality, the compact and lightweight Titan Plus packs a serious punch. This rugged, go-anywhere keychain flashlight belongs in the pocket (pant or shirt) or purse of anyone who wants to be ready for anything, anytime, anywhere. It’ll turn heads in more ways than one.FeaturesVirtually indestructible, high-performance LED is regulated to maximize output and runtime at three useful levels: 300, 75, and 15 lumensProprietary faceted reflector creates broad, smooth MaxVision Beam™ that matches your field of view—and allows for better situational awarenessHead switch—simply twist counterclockwise repeatedly to activate and set output levelsPowered by an included rechargeable AAA NiMH battery; can also be powered by a single readily available AAA alkaline batteryRemovable pocket clip allows countless secure-carry optionsIncluded stainless steel split ring securely attaches to keysQuick-detach tailcap allows for rapid detachment of light from keys for stand-alone useBacked by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee"

Only 0.8 lb more than the new lite version and easier to maintain. I have 2 new, still in the box. Bought for sons, but have changed my mind due to their responsibility level. These are really cool items that come with their own carrying cases. I also bought scopes for each and 2-25 rd magazines for each, that will go with rifle as well. These rifles have threaded heavy fluted barrels and are super quite with a suppressor and some subsonic ammo. Buy one or both. Below MSRP and you save tax and shipping cost as well. Price is for each. Buds Gun is the cheapest place and is where I got these from. Total was $605 each plus tax, shipping, FFL. so more around $675 each.  Sorry, not intersted in trading."

Thanks for understanding.Original owner and purchased in Nov 1994. 20"" heavy barrel with 1 in 9 twist. Stock A2 battle sights with 8/3 rear elevation turret out to 800m. Rifle length A2 stock with hinged butt plate field kit storage.  I've kept it around always thinking I'd shoot it more, but I think 23 years is long enough to say goodbye.  The only AR platform I shoot any longer is the AR-10 so the 15 is not going to see any attention from me ever again.    *Brand new Caldwell XLA Pivot 9-13"" bipod with a Harris #5 Swivel Stud adapter underneath for a rock solid fit on the front/underside of the heat shield. *Uncle Mike's padded shoulder case with 5 external mag pouches, middle slip pocket and front velcro. *4 each 30 round PMAGs, 2 each 20 round/1 each 8 round factory Colt aluminum mags. *2 slings: Condor Speedy adjustable 2 point web sling and a standard 2 point USGI with metal hardware. *2 front sight posts: KNS Precision Hooded Crosshair aperture front sight(.01"") post included which is really nice for center hold irons shooting, but it's currently outfitted with the stock .07"" front sight post that came from Colt. *Brand new Hoppe's .223 Bore Snake and also a .223/5.56 magazine well vise block to make cleaning a breeze.*Recoil pad which adds 1 1/4"" to the length of pull that I used on another AR which you might find useful if you are taller/bigger.  This Colt has spent the lions share of it's life in the safe and if I had to put a number on rounds through the pipe it's certainly less than 500 and that was over mabye half a dozen shoots. When you inspect the BCG, shell deflector and hammer face you will be hard pressed to discern it's even been fired. Took it out Sunday and put a mag through it the irons are set on mechanical zero and I hammered the silhouette steel gong at 200 repeatedly it's only going to get better the more time you spend dialing it in. Please let me know if you have any questions not addressed. This will be a cash only sale and for pick up at my home in South Tampa only. Thanks again for your interest and have a great day.***You must bring and present your valid Florida drivers license or CWP and be willing to fill out a bill of sale.  I'm sorry there will be no exceptions I'm simply not comfortable selling a firearm to anyone who can't/won't fulfill this request.  I realize a private sale does not require these steps it's simply my own expectation in order to complete a sale."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.Features:- Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes - Corrosion resistant Hostile Environment blued finish - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories - Ambidextrous magazine release lever - Extended slide release - Patented Lock-Out Safety device  Specifications:- Caliber: .40 Smith and Wesson- Overall Length: 7.64""- Overall Height: 5.35""- Overall Width: 1.26""- Barrel Length: 4.25""- Sight Radius: 6.22""- Weight without Magazine: 1.7 lbs.- Magazine Capacity: 13 (includes 2 magazines)- Trigger Action: Single Action/ Double Action- Trigger Pull: Single Action: 20N Double Action: 51N- Sights: Fixed"

Absolutely gorgeous gun! My favorite looking gun in the collection. Thing is I just don't like shooting revolvers. I picked it up because it looks cool but whenever I shoot, it's always the sigs in my collection I take to the range. So I thought I'd see if any sig owners out there would be open for swapping a nice Sig for this revolver.As this revolver is older and rarer, I would prefer something older/rare in he sig department, such as a W. German made sig, but I'm open to any creative trades."
