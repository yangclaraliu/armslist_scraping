Mag Weight: 0.20 ozMag capacity: 15 roundsUsed in Low Round Count (approximately 30 rounds/two magazines fired)Comes with Two MagazinesFor further information and fastest response to inquiry, call at REDACTEDA recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers.

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber."

Optical engineering advancement produces a generous 3.3 inches of constant eye relief while decreasing overall scope length to 13.9 inches. Its 3x to 15x magnification range make it a viable choice for myriad applications, from LE and military operations to benchrest competition to varmint and big-game hunting. The TARS features a patented illuminated-reticle system with 10 levels of intensity, including two for use with night-vision optics. Its non-forward emitting LED is much more efficient than current systems; One CR2032 battery provides 30,000 hours of use. Four reticle choices are available an intuitive MOA reticle (Model 101), Trijicon-exclusive JW mil reticle (102) and two duplex versions (103 and 104).

I am thinning the herd as it is and I already have one TRP (just like this one) and one TRP operator, so I guess I don't need this one. When I shot it, it shot GREAT just like my other two (in other words, it was hard to miss with this thing). I'd love to keep it, but really have no need for it.  The only ""issues"" I see are a couple of spots on the bottom corner of the front cocking serrations where the Armory Coat appears to be wearing likely due to the limited holstering. VERY small but noticeable if you are looking for them. See the last photo. If you are looking at this auction, you know likely know the specs of the TRP. In short, the gun includes night sights and G-10 grips, two factory magazines, and all included factory gear, paperwork, and box. If you have questions or would like additional photos, please ask. Will ship to FFL only or you can pick it up at my FFL in Mooresville in accordance with applicable laws. Please email me with questions."

I am asking $2000 for the rifle by itself as it is $2500 new without the extras and I have put about 100 rounds down range and cleaned it every time so the rifle is in amazing shape. Photos show it with an aim point t2 micro red dot that is not included in price. I paid $750 for the aimpoint and mount, if you want that to come with it the grand total will be $3000. You cannot build this rifle for that price as I have somewhere in the ball park of $3500 or more invested in it. I can be reached at REDACTED. Please only serious inquiries only, no low ball offers. This gun runs like a top and I have had zero failures out of it. It mostly sits by my night stand. Thanks-Matt Stewart"

This is not the cheaper DI model(Direct Impingement), it is the gas piston one. This AR is super accurate. Less than 50 rounds through it. It was only used to sight in this awesome Trijicon scope(INCLUDED). The scope has a Larue mount which are the best. LWRC also installed a super nice Geissele trigger for enhanced accuracy. The OD green matches beautifully with the green optic scope. This rifle has no scratches or scuff marks, as I said it was only taken out of the safe to season and zero the scope. I have the original box it came in. The barrel was cleaned after every shot, to ""Season"" and improve accuracy. This rifle is light as a 556 and as easy to shoot but has much much better accuracy and range. I love the handling of this rifle better than an AR10(too heavy!). If your thinking about a hunting rifle this fits the bill perfectly, hunters love this rifle and caliber for deer and hog hunting. I'll include any Ammo I have from Silver State Armory or other. This is LWRC, the Ferrari of AR's. This rifle is super beautiful and I always get a lot of attention at the range. I have all the high end AR's and none come close to LWRC. This rifle with scope and all extras from LWRC is priced less what I paid for it directly from LWRC, my loss is your gain, it won't last. Special Ops use them as well as DEA. The U.S. Army wanted the LWRC in 6.8 but could not afford them. They have even surpassed h&k imho. Wet, or super dirty LWRC rifles fire all the time. Get this rifle before this December 21, because you will NOT be able to buy an AR anymore in California, you will NOT even be able to purchase one or inherit one from anyone ANYWHERE! Those are the laws that are going into effect immediately. The government may make you register them but they CANNOT and will NOT take them away from you if you already have them. Call any large gun stores like Turners, they will tell you everything is gone. If you go to your local gun stores like Turners Outdoors, all AR's are COMPLETELY GONE! And they don't even have junk like Ruger or Anderson. People who know firearms know how valuable AR's are if and when disaster strikes. Sounds dramatic, but I'm really pro 2nd Amendment, and remember the L.A. Riots and who's businesses were saved. I'll even pay for transfer. Good luck Everything will be gone and over less than 1 week!"

M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol Concept With the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require.  From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design convertible from safety-decocker to decocker-only, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition.  Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive Pointability The Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.  Versatility and easy Accessorization One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more. Easy to Use and Maintain The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over."
