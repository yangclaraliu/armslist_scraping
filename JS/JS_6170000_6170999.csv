Famous Polish quality in a P-64 Makarov Pistol. 9x18 caliber, 6 shot, semi-automatic.  We paid a premium for them but we think the premium was worth it due to their overall condition and the fact that the imports stamps are done so well and put in a less obtrusive place on the firearm. They are stamped under the bottom side of the barrel, on the frame,  forward of the trigger guard. This leaves the sides of the slide unmolested and retains the beauty and value of the original markings. 
We are calling these Good / Very Good but I can tell you that as a batch they are quite nice. Expect some holster wear and light rubbing on the finish, particullarly on the sharp edges but overall very clean and functional.  Importer stamps blend well and are not obtrusive.
These are clean and ready to fire."

I also have 1 speedloader- HKS 36. Very clean. As far as appearance goes, on an amount of wear/flaws/etc., I'd say 9.5/10. It's a very light gun, even when loaded- only 5 rounds. It's a great EDC, if revolvers are your thing and the DAO is nice for EDC. Really nice for girls, as it's not really a large gun. My wife felt very comfortable with this in her hands and the .38s aren't bad to handle and get back on target. I'm asking $350 firm cash only. No trades- trying to make Christmas easier on the wallet. I'm not willing to travel and will meet in Maumee."

I have added magpul back up sights, magpul vertical grip and 2 30 round magpul pmags to it other than that it is completely stock. Everything on the rifle is anderson other than the upgrades so this isn't some garage build. This rifle has been treated with rf85 so it does not need oiled, just rinse with soap and water and it's good to go. There are plenty of great reviews online of this rifle, and it passed a 5000 round torture test with no oil. That speaks volumes for the quality of anderson rifles in my opinion and that is why I bough it. All together I have around 1000 bucks in everything but am willing to sell for $700 cash firm. No trades."

I'd entertain trades but I am mainly interested in USPSA shooting these days so only looking at good target revolvers.  May entertain a nice side by side shotgun too?  Don't have one of them yet."

This is high-quality remanufactured ammunition designed to perform to the standard of the Mk262 that Special Operations Forces favor over the SS109 (""Green Tip"") currently use with line units.
 This ammo will reliably fragment and transfer maximum energy to the target at longer ranges (and from short barrels) than either SS109 (62 gr. steel core) or M193 (55 gr. full metal jacket) ammunition
 We load the Hornady 75 gr. boat tail hollow point bullet to a velocity of 2790 feet per second from an 18"" barrel. Brass is military contract and we use a primer with a hard cup designed to minimize ""slam fires"" in the AR-15 series rifle.
 If you plan to reload, you'll love this ammo. We have swaged (not reamed) out the military primer crimp, and we have trimmed the brass during our process to 1.745"" (max length is 1.760"") so you should not need to trim for several firings.
 Please note: this ammunition is loaded to 5.56 NATO pressures and is designed for use in weapons with a 5.56 NATO or .223 Wylde chamber.

 -QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS-
 What is the difference between your 55¢ per round ammo and the stuff I see everywhere else for 25¢-35¢ a shot?
 Let's look at two issues: 1- cost; 2- performance.
 -COST
 Ammo priced in the 25¢ per shot range is usually Wolf or Tula brand. Two significant difference exist between our ammo and the Tula and Wolf ammo. Tula and Wolf use steel cases and copper washed, steel jacketed bullets in their lower priced offerings.
 Cheaper, steel-cased ammunition is harder on your rifle's chamber than softer, more smooth functioning brass-cased ammunition like we use. Cheaper steel-jacketed bullets are harder on your barrel than copper-jacketed bullets like we use. In short, you will experience more malfunctions and will wear out your rifle more quickly with steel cases and steel bullets. Is the cost savings in ammunition worth the cost in wear and tear on your rifle?
 Well, that depends on how much your rifle cost eh? For an inexpensive ""beater"" or ""truck gun"" the cost savings in probably worth the trade off. In a rifle with an expensive high-quality barrel (or a cheap barrel that just shoots great!) probably not!
 Brass-cased, copper-jacketed bullets that you find in ammo at the 35¢ per shot range avoids the wear and tear problems of the ammo that uses steel in cases and bullets.
 -PERFORMANCE
 Reliability
 The second difference, (and this applies for cheap guns or fancy guns) is in how the ammunition performs. For hunting or defensive work, steel-cased ammo will almost certainly cause more malfunctions. This is fine for training ammo. In fact, clearing more malfunctions could even offer a training advantage! But for serious work, reliability is a must.
 Terminal Performance
 Aside from reliability is the issue of ""terminal ballistics."" Terminal ballistics refer to what happens when the bullet you chose hits the target you chose. The choice of bullet should match the choice of target. If your choice is paper or pop cans, terminal performance isn't an issue for you--shoot the cheap stuff, unless you're shooting at longer ranges where wind becomes an issue. (Longer, heavier bullets buck the wind better!)
 The vast majority of the ammo you see in the 35¢ per shot range uses either a 55 grain lead core, copper jacketed bullet or a 62 gr. bullet with a copper jacket and steel core. We use a 75 gr. lead core, copper jacketed bullet. To cut to the chase: the heavier 75 gr. bullet is much more likely to stop a bad guy or humanely harvest a game animal than the cheaper 55 gr. or 62 gr. bullet.
 Why?
 The 55 gr. and 62 gr. bullets are more likely to zip right through the target leaving a wound similar to a .22 long rifle bullet. The 75 gr. bullet reliably tumbles and fragments in the target to cause the wounding, blood loss, tissue and organ destruction so critical to putting the bad guy or animal out of action.A NOTE ON SHIPPING
I do not treat shipping as a profit center. I charge the rate I have to pay UPS or FedEx because USPS will not handle ammunition. I can ship you 1,000 rounds for only a little more than it costs to ship you 20 rounds.
 As shooters, we are all in this together. I want you to stock up on quality ammo at a great price, so I will do my best to suit your needs and circumstances. Contact me with any questions friends. I'm in this business WITH people like me, FOR people like me.
Thanks for being an armed citizen!"

The price accurately reflects the state that this pistol is in, so my price is FIRM. It has a few scuff marks and scratches, but works 100% and I haven't had a problem with it. I am not open to trade offers at this time, but am willing to take half of the price of this pistol in either 9MM or 7.62x39 ammunition. That means $95 in either caliber+$95 or $190 in cash. All other offers will be ignored. Thanks and MAGA!"
