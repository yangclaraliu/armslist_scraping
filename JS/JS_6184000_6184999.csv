The added 1” length not only helps with precision shooting, it also increases the velocity of standard 50 GI ammunition. Furthermore, the increased muzzle weight of the 6” slide and barrel allows more powerful 50 GI hand loads to be shot from the M4. Typically, velocity gains of 25% and muzzle energy gains of over 60% can be achieved, talk about reaching out and touching something – HARD! The Model No. 4 is a formidable handgun hunting pistol but also serves well as a back-up pistol in bear country or just for enjoying the sheer pleasure of launching .50 bullets with extreme accuracy – it’s a blast!Even from afar the imposing six inch slide with that huge bore tells everyone you mean business. The M4 is a pride and joy around here and while held to the same standards as all Guncrafter Industries pistols, we know that an M4 customer will press the pistol to the limits and be happy to call in and let us know how we made the perfect pistol. Hunting, plinking, or chasing the smallest group the Model No. 4 will do its part.I am willing to part with this for $3,300 with the back and extra magazine.THERE IS NO BETTER DEAL OUT THERE FOR ONE OF THESE MODEL 4s"

I cleaned the cosmoline off and transferred the ammo from the spam can to the ammo can in the picture. Includes 4 magazines, the can, 1 holster, 2 cleaning rods.One gun is an absolute beauty. Tight, clean, and jet black. The other has wear on the edges and isnt pretty. I hope the buyer is a C&R guy and is familiar with these guns, but dont buy them planning to carry one using the hammer back/safety. The safety just isnt that reliable because its an import add on. The internet says some dont block the sear and some dont engage at all.  Ths black one seems safe, the less pretty one has a hinky safety that should be removed/filled unless the gun is just a range toy.Anyways. Heres the package for less than i paid for it.  Will not separate."

I bought this gun a little while ago and just haven't shot it as much as I thought I would, less than 150 bullets through it, so I am in no hurry to sell it. That being said, all reasonable offers will be considered. If you have any questions or would like to make an offer, email me. Possible Trades: Could be interested in a 300 Blk out."

It is a fun shooter that mimics a 9mm Luger and its famous toggle action. The Stoeger Luger, however, is actually a blowback action with a toggle action cosmetic. This gun is picky with its ammo. As with many .22lr handguns, it likes CCI Mini-mags the most. I tried Remington Golden Bullets and it had many failure-to-fires. It also had a failure to extract.

The finish is blued with gold leaf inlay on the cylinders. These are a very limited run in 1998-99 for Ruger. I'm told only 1000 of each caliber was produced. A must for anyone's Ruger collection. There is some small chips on the ejector housing from being in the safe. Thank you for your consideration
