First the good, the trigger is a huge improvement with a distinct, shorter tactile reset and much smoother pull. Also, the frame has a stainless steel chassis to reduce the already negligible flex. Additionally, there are now 4 interchangable backstraps instead of just 3, the new one being a medium/large. The tool used for disassembly and that holds the backstrap in place is also much easier to remove and replace. Now the one update I'm not sure I care for, the factory stipple job, man this thing is grippy and I prefer to have great checkering or stippling on the front and backstraps but little to none on the sides so I can change my grip if needed. Your mileage may vary.Additionally, I bought a set of Trijicon Night Sights that I haven't yet installed and an El Paso Saddlery holster. I paid $150 for the Trijicons and $95 for the holster and these items are available for sale.I expect my full asking price (exactly what I paid) for this brand new firearm and accessories, it might be the first M&P40 M2.0 in Abq. Again, this is a brand new firearm, zero rounds fired outside the factory!"

Most likely from the 1960's or 70's, the gun has a capacity of 2 plus 1 to make it legal for waterfowl hunting. Shoots good and is a neat old gun, these used to be nicknamed goose guns and were a popular favorite of hunters. Unfortunately I'm not a very good hunter but that's my fault, not the gun's. There is some minor surface rust and slight pitting in the barrel but it's a smoothbore and I haven't had problems with it. One piece wooden stock that could use some refinishing if you wanted a project or could be left alone, would make a great truck or barn gun. Bolt action shotguns are less common nowadays but this one was built good and strong, she ain't pretty but she'll shoot every time. Asking $140 OBO."

I don't know. I doubt it but I am not an expert on these things. My guess is it is a nice old Springfield that some one was trying to make it look like a sniper version. But it is a nice rifle. It is drilled and tapped on the receiver and the front sights have been removed or the barrel has been cut back to remove them. I think this rifle would be great for re-enactments or to turn into a sporter as it looks to already be modified,"

Packs one heck of a punch, not for the meek, let me tell ya.  Makes a .44 Magnum or 500 S & W feel like a BB gun (I have both, and this statement is true).  Its a single shot handgun, that loads and ejects thru a rotating cannon type of breech from the rear.  The long barrel adds to its accuracy.This would be ideal for someone that requires the take down power of a rifle for hunting, but in a small package. I bought this strictly to target shoot though.  It includes the Redfield long eye relief scope as pictured.  2 x 6 times magnifying.Comes with a carry bag that fits it.This is a pretty rare gun, I have never seen another since owning it, take it to the range and you WILL have the most powerful handgun there.$450 firm price, I will not ship it, PA buyers only.  this is considered a handgun, must be transferred FFL, my local shop charges $30, buyer covers transfer cost."

If you'd rather not trade for our, of be open to selling it, please just make me an offer. I'd like to get around $90 dollars for it though as this is the cheapest I've found the 3.4'' barrel. 
Also l do realize that there is a consensus that .22lr is terrible for self-defense. Before you criticize me, please understand that I'm a 5'1'' female who weighs less than 100ibs. I do understand that it's not ideal, but it's the only thing I'm able to shoot at all effectively and I think it's better than nothing, because without it I'd have no chance if I were to be attacked.These are pictures of the gun/barrel, that were taken earlier today.https://imgur.com/a/qzJdH"
