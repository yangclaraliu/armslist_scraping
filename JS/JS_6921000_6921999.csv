When innovation and inspiration collided the 828U was born- the first O/U worthy of the Benelli badge. With the strength of steel and the weight of aluminum, the 12-gauge 828U has redefined the category. The 828U features a patented steel locking system and plate, which eliminates the transference of stress-causing shot pressure to the receiver and hinge pins. The compact, easily removable trigger group increases safety and reliability. A redesigned opening lever provides a smoother, more consistent opening action. From butt to barrel, there is nothing about the 828U that hasn't been rethought and improved.  Progressive Comfort and the 828U. The Progressive Comfort System is housed within the 828U walnut stock. The progressive nature of the system allows for a constant smooth level of recoil absorption, regardless of light or heavy load. Steel locking plate. At the heart of Benelli's Steel Locking System is a solid steel breech block that locks directly to the rear of the barrel, keeping all pressure from the shot shell contained inside- preventing its transfer to the receiver and hinge pins. Adjustable drop and cast. Benelli has created the first O/U that allows for a custom fit stock. With 5 drop and 4 cast shims the 828U can be adjusted to one of 40 possible stock positions. The adjustable stock allows a shooter to find their natural alignment with the barrel and target, which translates into more broken targets. Opening lever. The 828U triggers reset when the top lever is unlocked instead of by opening the barrels as traditional O/U's- creating a smoother, more consistent opening action. Impulse activated ejectors. The ejector system in the 828U is all contained on the barrel. When the shell is fired pressure activates the ejector. This innovative design eliminates the need for linkages between trigger group and the forend- allowing for a stronger, more streamlined ejection system. Removable trigger group. The compact and removable trigger group makes for easier cleaning and eliminates complicated linkage between forearm and trigger mechanism, significantly increasing reliability.

Massive 5 shot cylinder. The 460 round is the flattest shooting round due to the 2300fps velocity. Zeroed at 200 yards you can shoot 0-250 yards without needing to adjust your POI. Plus it can also shoot 454 casull and 45 colt (OK to hunt with in unit M). With the Hi-Viz fiber optic sight it's easy to find your target. For such a hand cannon it is very light weight, balanced, and easy to shoot. Not many rounds fired out of this one (less than 50) timing is good, locks up tight, forcing cone looks good, cylinder gap and condition look good. I hate to see it go but other projects want money. May consider partial trade."

I could just put another threaded barrel on it but I spent a lot accurizing this 1911 for the Clark barrel and that seems like a waste.

The exact functionality of these knives are defined as OTF spring assisted models--meaning they are single-action out the front knives and the ""blade slider"" helps manually start the blade before the spring officially engages and deploys the blade but needs to be manually retracted. Each model features a hollow ground blade comprised of AUS-8 stainless steel which is the ideal balance of edge retention and ease of maintenance. Additionally, the wide-body handle design offers an ergonomic feel especially since the trigger is on the broad side of the handle and every OTF includes a slide safety found near the base. The legacy of Smith & Wesson knives and tools is built on fine craftsmanship, quality and dependability. Their expansive line consists of assisted opening, folding and fixed blade knives, as well various multi-tools and accessories in an effort to offer something for every need and every job. This model features a dark grey aluminum handle, an integrated glass breaker function, a dagger style blade in a black finish and the pocket clip is statically designed for tip down carry only on the traditional side of the handle."

I would do it myself but I do not have the skills.  Will gladly send more pictures upon request. Here's a description from the original seller:This particular m95/30 was originally manufactured as a support carbine (aka short rifle) during WWI, as evidenced by it having the rear sling swivel on the bottom. Also, it has the correct short rear sight. After the war, it was updated to the 8x56mm spitzer round, and then saw use in WWII. All original markings are intact, including the 'S' over the chamber. It was originally manufactured in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and then reworked in Austria. The serials on the receiver and barrel match each other, and the serials on the bolt and stock do not match.  Carbine is in Good overall condition for its age, with normal wear from long-term storage and some handling. It has its original factory blued finish, with a good bit of wear and some freckling and light pitting in spots. The wood stock has several small dings and dents, but is overall still solid. The bore shows wear, but still has distinct rifling so should shoot fine. It has all of its parts, including bayonet lug, sights, and sling swivels. The only bit missing is the stacking rod. Mechanically, everything works properly including the straight pull bolt, magazine follower, and adjustable rear sight."
