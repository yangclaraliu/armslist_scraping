Good bore, Smooth cycling and excellent lock up. I value the pistol at a conservative $500.00. This is much less than what similar pistols sell for on Gunbroker.com. If you can find one at all. + no tax and no shipping charges.     Included is a wooden/glass display case and 2 boxes of ammo. TRADE ....   I would like to trade on a small - mid size double action quality revolver or pistol. All offers appreciated, all trades considered. All emails answered. Love the gun but, in the present environment, I would prefer to have something a little more potent in the truck. Thanks for looking at my listing."

Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment.  Might trade for an excellent condition CX4 in 9mm that takes 92 mags or the PX4 mag version and I'll get the 92 mag adapter.  If you don't have as many factory mags(not interested in 10rd. mags or off-brand) as I do, I will need some cash, nice optic or other to make up the difference.  Might also consider a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 Gen 2 that accepts Beretta 92 mags or maybe even Glock 17/19 mags, but will need some cash or other, since I can pick one up from PSA for $450 right now.

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (model 8500 only), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. (Model 8500 only.)   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.     Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.

This rifle has a C39 V2 style milled receiver with a US made barrel, tapco g2 trigger group, with stock, sights, gas block, bolt, and bolt carrier from a demilled Hungarian FEG AMD 63 underfolder parts kit. Barrel is not chrome limed but is of quality steel. I've cleaned it after every time I've shot it. I've put less than 500 rounds through this rifle. Rifle functions, includes 9 Yugo bolt hold open magazines. The box as pictured is included also as is the cleaning rod. The magazine catch is removable with a aftermarket pin and c clip so you can easily take it out it and swap or modify it. The reason why I am putting it up for sale or for trade is I decided I want a lighter stamped Ak instead, preferably with a fixed stock. So if you want a milled underfolder and are willing to trade something like a Wasr 10, Highstandard AK, or some random parts kits gun let me know I will be very interested. The only thing I really want in a trade is something with a forged bolt carrier and bolt carrier group, preferably forged front and rear trunions, bayonet lug, and cleaning rod. Whether it's an 18 gauge or 16 gauge reciever doesn't matter too much to me. I'm not interested in any IO rifles or RAS47s at this time. Either contact me through here or call or text me at REDACTED. I will need to see your Florida drivers license and ccw permit to sell or trade. I do not wish to ship this out of state at this time."

The ALL NEW OMNI HYBRID MAXX features a fully-patented metal reinforced polymer upper receiver along with a fully-patented metal reinforced polymer lower receiver.  The Omni Hybrid lower features a patented hammer and trigger pin retainment system, preventing movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing.  The Omni Hybrid also featured the patented over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin.  This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin thus increasing strength and durability from recoil and consistent firing.
