402,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6792402,"For Sale/Trade:  Model 1868 U.S. Springfield Rifle aka ""Trapdoor""","Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 600,"Listed On: Monday, June 5, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For your consideration is a Model 1868 U.S. Springfield Rifle aka ""Trapdoor"" produced at the Springfield Armory between 1868-1872, with rougly 51,000 in total quanity. This Rifle shoots the 50 centerfire cartridge, and the action was also designed by ""Allin"" of the ""Allin Conversations"" post Civil War Rifles, and would serve as the standard action until 1890's on Rifles and Carbines. It has rear long range adjustable slide leaf, and a front sight which also serves as a bayonet lug. It is marked on the top of the barrel ""1869 / U.S."" and serial numbered on the reciever. It features many Civil War era parts, such as the lockplate, barrels bands, and other mounts. 
 
The condition of this Trapdoor Rifle is Good to Very Good by the condition standards for Antique Firearms. It is missing the cleaning rod. The Civil War Lockplate from Springfield no longer bears its original markings, it seems they were lost to time. The Rifle is serial numbered on the side of the reciever and marked on the top ""1869 / U.S."". The metal parts are smooth, it has rougly 20% of its original finish left, and the wood of the stock has a few superficial cracks and bruises, most notably on the reverse side of the reciever where there is some damage to the stock, and at the toe of the buttstock, where a small piece of wood seems to have come off when this Rifle was put in its Rack. The stock features original Regimental Markings, indicating what Soldier it belonged to and where it should go on the rack. The buttplate also features some original regimental markings, and are probably original Civil War Markings, or Indian War Markings. In the wood you can see the number ""82"" and on the buttstock the number ""33"" and some earlier markings in the metal as well, that are hard to read. Overall this Trapdoor is in good to very good antique firearm condition, with some minor wear to the stock and metal. The Regimental Markings and original Civil War era parts make this ""Trapdoor"" an excellent pickup for somebody looking for a good Indian Wars piece, and to own the original ""Trapdoor"" Rifle."

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. is excited to announce the latest development in the Mark Series line of pistols - the Ruger® Mark IV™. Ruger has long set the standard for reliable, affordable and accurate .22 LR handguns, beginning with the introduction of the Standard Pistol in 1949. Since then, the Standard Pistol has undergone a series of enhancements with the development of the Mark I, Mark II™ and then the Mark III™ in 2005.  While the heavily redesigned Mark IV maintains the same classic outward appearance as the Mark III, it incorporates a significant improvement customers will love - a simple, one-button takedown for quick and easy field-stripping. A recessed button in the back of the frame allows the upper receiver to tilt up and off of the grip frame without the use of tools. The bolt simply slides out of the receiver and the barrel can be properly cleaned from chamber to muzzle.  ""We are thrilled to be introducing what we consider to be a monumental improvement to this iconic pistol that has been with Ruger from the start,"" said Ruger President and COO Chris Killoy. ""This one-button takedown alleviates the headache that our Mark III owners are all too familiar with and we anticipate the Mark IV pistols being some of the cleanest rimfires at the range,"" Killoy concluded.  The MKIV Competition includes other significant improvements such as a one-piece grip frame that is precision CNC-machined from a solid piece of stainless steel; an ambidextrous manual safety and a redesigned bolt stop for more ergonomic operation. The magazine drops free on release for faster reloads and a redesigned magazine disconnect safety prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed. Internal improvements include changes to the hammer, sear, bolt and firing pin for smoother, more reliable feeding.   Specific features vary by model, but the legendary, one-piece barreled receiver and internal cylindrical bolt construction remain the same. The robust design ensures permanent sight-to-barrel alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs. The Mark IV is compatible with a variety of Mark III aftermarket accessories including sights, scope bases and magazines.  The American-made Mark IV Competition ships with two 10-round magazines.                                       Features Updated Takedown Mechanism: Simple design uses one recessed button at the back of the frame allows the upper receiver to tilt up and off the frame for easy cleaning and maintenance Loaded Chamber Indicator (absent on Standard, MK I & MK II )- provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded Comfortable Grip- features natural pointing grip angle with checkered, non- slip grip panels providing a positive hold. The manual safety and ""American"" style magazine release are conveniently located on the left side of the frame. Magazine Disconnect (absent on Standard, MK I & MK II )- prevents discharge even when the magazine has been removed; upgraded MKIV variant allows magazine to drop free Ambidextrous Manual Safety- positively locks the sear when applied; can be converted to left side only Internal Cylindrical Bolt- ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving- slide designs ""American"" Style Magazine Release (Bottom Style 'European' release on Standard, MK I & MK II )- thumb actuated button allows for easy magazine changes Caliber: .22LR Magazine Capacity: 2- 10 Round Finish: Stainless Steel Barrel: 6.88"" Slab Side Action: Single Sights: Black Target Front / Adjustable Rear Weight: 44 ozs.

Won't find another 1-8X anywhere near this price. I love the scope on my Ar-15. The retail on Primary Arms is $389.99 so $325 is a great price!Primary Arms does it again!We took our popular 1-6x variable scope back to the lab, and the engineers crammed in even more magnification. Now it’s a 1-8x! Look through it and you’ll find the patented ACSS® reticle combining bullet drop compensation, wind holds and moving target leads in one easy to use system. The second focal plane design is simple and strong. The ACSS reticle stays the same size regardless of power setting, so you'll need to crank it up to 8x magnification to use its advanced features. This scope is very fast and instinctive from 0 – 300 yards, and very precise from 300-800 yards. The brightness knob on the left side of the tube illuminates the center reticle through 12 brightness settings using the included CR2032 battery. This tough scope is waterproof, fog resistant, and covered by the Primary Arms Lifetime Warranty. Flip up caps are included, and a “cat tail” scope lever is available from 3 Gun Stuff (product code GS-460)."
