This includes the original CMP paperwork documenting its authenticity and four en bloc clips. The wood appears all matching and is free of cracks. The metal is somewhat worn on places, but is consistent throughout. The rifle appears to have come as is from a depot and was not refurbed (as many are now) by the CMP. The rifling is in excellent shape and is sharp and shiny. I have shot about 60 rounds out of this with no mechanical issues at all and it is smooth and accurate at 100 yards. The bolt timing is also good. I believe this has all SA parts, to include a '53 dated barrel.Terms of sale: I will only sell to a NH resident with: 1) A valid NH conceal carry permit and, 2) a valid NH drivers license...No exceptions, unless you want to go through an FFL at your cost.

The SIG MPX redefines the submachine gun category with a new level of operator safety, in-field adaptability and proven reliability in the harshest environments. Completely ambidextrous, the SIG MPX is great for left- or right-handed shooters with its dual-sided selector switch, magazine release, charging handle and bolt release. The SIG MPX operates from a fully-closed and locked rotating bolt, offering enhanced reliability and safety in use. A short-stroke gas piston allows the SIG MPX to run all weights and brands of 9mm ammunition with no adjustments to the gas valve. A full-length picatinny rail allows for solid, consistent mounting of optics and targeting lasers.The BFSIII™ is a 3-Position Trigger.  In position 3 it will fire 1 round on Pull and 1 round on Release. This makes it one of the fastest semi-automatic triggers on the market.  The BFSIII™ is ideal for Tactical and Competition use. The BFSIII provides greatly reduced split times between rounds and the ability to place two separate shots into a tighter group.     Trigger Operation: Position 1 – Safe –Will not fire. Position 2 – Semi – Fires 1 round per pull. Position 3 – Binary – Fires 1 round on pull and 1 round on release."

I've got 3 bolt action rifles and I only need 2 for hunting so I'm getting rid of the .338.This rife has a Houge overmold pillar bedded stock which helps tremendously with recoil. It has a 24"" free floated stainless steel barrel with a #2 contour and 1 in 10 twist, HACT 2 stage match trigger, 3 position safety, and a forged 1 piece bolt with 2 locking lugs and M16 style extractor. I never messed with the mag, it's an internal 3+1 mag with a drop plate, but for $100 you can buy a kit that will let you put in 5 or 10 round mags (mags included) and is super easy to install. I don't need 5-10 rounds on tap in a bolt action rifle, so my money was better spent in other places. This rifle is also based off the Weatherby so there is a lot of aftermarket parts and accesories for it.As far as the optic, I just have a little Nikko stirling Nighteater 3-10x42mm. It's nothing special like a Nighforce but it is a really nice scope. It's waterproof, fogproof, and shock proof, 13.5"" and only 16.5 oz. It has a nitrogen filled 1"" tube and 42mm objective lens with 3.5"" eye relief and  the lense is Microlux ETE coated which is developed to improve light transfer to the eyes for low-light shooting conditions and has a factory lifetime warrenty (no receipt needed, if it brakes just send it back).Other than that, I'm not sure what else to tell you. If you have any questions please feel free to reply to the ad, or call or text me at REDACTED. You pay FFL transfer fees and range fees if you would like to shoot it before you buy it (bring your own ammo). I am located on Camano Island but I can meet you almost anywhere at any time."

I'm not a collector, and therefore cannot justify keeping it. Must be willing to sign my bill of sale and show Missouri ID (I will not record your address).  Cash only, please.  Feel free to email me for additional information or images, and thanks for looking."

Today  I have a NEW AR 15, 223 and 5.56 that I built, so here goes the discription as best I can. And my rifle building skills are far superior to my camers skills, lol. It is an OMNI hybrid lower, reinforced polymer with Zinc inserts in all the right places and is rated far beyond the mil spec aluminum lowers for durability and strength, it has a sling mount built right into the end plate for a quick click attachment of a single point or other slings with clasp type clips. I put extended swivel and take down pins for easier break down, I put a trigger and hammer pin locking systen to stop the pins from walking which can be very common with AR's. It has a mil spec Carpenter 258 steel M16 AR 15 full auto BCG, and I also added an enhanced firing pin and extra strength hammer spring for reliability for use with steel cased ammo because of the harder primers on most and I have done this before with great results. I added an extended arm charging handle for easier working for those with arthritis or weaker hands. It has a standard A2 pistol grip but I filed off the finger bump that I find annoying and far from comfortable and includes a brand new 30 round HEXMAG. Now to the upper, It is a HARDENED ARMS Upper that has an A2 profile barrel, 10"" quad rail hand guard for easy attachents of the accessories of your choice and a simple but effective tube style red dot sight, the upper is a railed flat top out to the end of the handguard and I have put some camo rail covers on it which you can leave or easily take off. I can tell you the upper and lower are a nice and tight fit, not sloppy like some which means they will stay that way for a long time. Now, other than the uppers maker putting a couple rounds through it for testing it, I have not put a round one through it , I did bore sight it so it should be close enough now for any close encounters and should only require a few clicks at the desired range to finish up sighting it in. I am asking $575 FIRM because of the extras I put into it and is worth every bit of that, I have around $700 into the build so my loss is your gain. This is a fine rifle with nice functional tounches, additions and features and I am sure it will serve you well. PLEASE, NO OUT OF STATE BUYERS, NO CHECKS, IN PERSON AND CASH ONLY!!!! I AM ONLY SELLING IT BECAUSE I want a different rifle and am now retired and disabled living on a very small fixed income so to have what I want I have to part with something that I built for myself."

Runs and drives alright, has 230k miles. Loaded with leather and pioneer cd player. Here are some pros and cons:
 
Pros:
 
Trusty 4.6L V8, Starts right up every time! 
 
Working Sunroof!
 
5"" Liftabrand lift kit with extended shocks
 
New Coil Bank, Sway Bar Links, Pittman Arm, all new brake Pads and rotors plus one caliper, oil pressure sensor, spark plugs and fuel filter.
 
Jeep XJ Ecco wheels on 31x10.5x15 tires, with 2"" adapter spacers all around.
 
24"" Light Bar behind grille
 
Dixie Horns! Nothing makes a crowd smile more than Dixie Horns.
 
Custom bent, true dual off-road exhaust straight piped from the manifolds back to dual glass packs in the rear. Loud and proud!
 
Towing package!
 
ORV and Trail stickers good til April of 2018!
 
On to the cons:
 
Needs an EGR soon, runs funny til it warms up.
 
Rear coil springs will need replacing soon, starting to get tired.
 
Needs an alignment, goes down the road and upwards of 70+mph straight but steering wheel is crooked.
 
Both passenger windows need new regulators ($15 each DIY).
 
Both front fenders and front bumper cover have been trimmed to avoid rubbing, not perfect but works.
 
Shifter needs adjusting
 
There's rust, on rockers and fenders but what 24 year old Michigan car doesn't have any. Frame and underbody solid, doors solid.
 
That's it! This has been a fun project and second daily driver but I have a new project coming up and need to make driveway room. Would make a fun toy or gnarly daily driver for the next owner. 
 
$950 cash or trade for the above.

An Auto-Brightness sensor continuously samples lighting conditions to provide optimal reticle intensity, or can be overridden should the shooter prefer the manual mode. The exterior lens surfaces are treated with Leupold's DiamondCoat™ that adds abrasion resistance and durability, and assists in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast. The aspheric lens creates a wide field-of-view, with sharp image quality, allowing user to keep both eyes open and focused on the target. Slotted windage and elevation dials allow positive 1 MOA adjustments without the need of lock screws. The Leupold DeltaPoint Pro Reflex Sight is constructed with a lightweight aluminum housing, shrouded in spring steel for maximum durability, and has been waterproof tested to 66 feet. Includes battery, and protective cover."
