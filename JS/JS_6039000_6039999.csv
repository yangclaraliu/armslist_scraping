It was on a project shotgun of mine that I traded for a pistol, and I do not have a weapon to put this on now nor do I believe I will be getting one anytime soon.I am the only owner of this, it was brand new in box when I bought it. It is ""used"" in that it was installed on my Remington 870 Tactical for the last few years - the vast majority of which it sat in the shotgun case/bag in the safe. I fired it a few hundred times - obviously only in the back yard and range, never took it into combat, never got into a shootout, never HAHO'ed into a hot LZ or inserted from a submarine on some SEAL mission. I put it on my HD shotgun and shot it some.It's in very good condition- not perfect, as there is a little wear mark here and there on the metal, nothing major but as I said, it's not ""New In Box"", it was installed on the gun for a few years. You can see the screw to the mount has been used a few times- that's the time of wear and marks I'm talking about, purely a little cosmetic age etc. Plus unless you plan on using this on a shotgun, you will need a mount of your desire, which will remove the base and screw anyway. (The included base is too low to use on any rifle setup. So you'd want a quality mount of various mfgrs and heights/styles/etc. I use Daniel Defense lower 1/3 mount on my other R-1 and M&P 15-22.) ---The glass is perfect however.If you are unfamiliar , this is one of the most highly respected and desired nonmagnified optics on the market. This has 12 brightness settings- on setting 8 of 12, a high-quality battery will give it FIVE YEARS OF CONSTANTLY ON BATTERY LIFE. Reducing the setting to 5 will give it EIGHT YEARS of CONSTANTLY ON BATTERY LIFE, and still a full year on maximum. Also, there are $1 generic cheap batteries you can find at the dollar stores which still give this at least a year of battery life CONSTANTLY ON. Aimpoint has the highest level of technological circuitry in optics on the planet and their construction/ruggedness is also legendary. These are professional, combat optics- the best of the best.It was a ~$550 piece of kit new. The only difference between this and the $600+ T-1 is the T-1 is black, and includes night-vision settings, the R-1 is silver and does not have the night-vision setting.Reduced to $375"

It's a Russian Saiga, the factory-sporterized AK47 variant, chambered in 7.62x39 (the standard AK47/SKS round). I got it in a trade several years ago from a freind that bought it new from ClassicArms (at my recommendation). He never even shot it once, eventually traded it to me, and I've had it out to the range about twice in the years I've had it, for a total of maybe 100 rounds (at most.)The rifle is dead-nuts accurate, and runs 100% perfectly. It's in very good condition, and comes with FIVE factory 10-round magazines, and the original owners manual.Also, though it's obviously in it's factory-original, unconverted state, I'm including most of the necessary conversion (and other) parts. There's a US-made telecscoping stock, a US-made pistol grip with mounting hardware, a set of US-made foregrips*, 2 new East-Bloc 30-round mil-surp steel magazines, two scope rails (one is a dual picatinny rail, the other with standard 1-inch rings), and a bullet guide from Dinzag (with mounting screw and receiver hole plugs).The only thing not included for the legal, hi-cap conversion is a Tapco G2 (or other brand) trigger group, that only runs around $25 last I checked. The price is the same whether you need the conversion parts or not, because.......well, because I obviously don't need them anymore either,LOL !!So, for those not familiar, the Saigas are widely considered among the highest quality AK variants you can buy,anywhere, being made in the same factory right along side the Russian military's Kalashnikovs, with genuine Russian receiver, chrome-lined barrel, and trigger group. None of the usual substituted parts nearly all other AK's have to have to get legally imported.These have also been banned from importation by you-know-who, and are unlikely in the extreme to ever be imported again.After Hillary's coronation, the price goes up $200 !!I'm primarilly looking for the cash, but might consider certain trades, plus cash, but only if they're very much in my favor.Buyers must be legal to own firearms, and be a legal Georgia resident over 21, with ID. I'll show my Ga. DL and carry permit.Please respond with enough detail that it is CLEAR that you're a legitimate LOCAL buyer, or I'm not even responding. If the ad is still up, then I still have the rifle.If you live in Augusta, Cartersville, or Albany, then,sorry, you're gonna have to drive HERE to get it !Thanks for looking.......* I believe the foregrip/handguards may require some additional adapter, but these handguards are not really necessary for the hi-cap conversion, you can just leave the original handguard on."

I won't be doing much hog hunting until next summer and I already have a .270 for deer so I don't really have a use for a 300 blk right now. I haven't gotten into reloading yet so I can't plink around with this as much as I would like.The components of the gun are as follows:16"" Sanders Armory straight fluted barrelNickel Boron side charging BCGSide charging upperStainless Steel pistol length gas tube Stainless Steel gas blockCompetition muzzle break15"" Mlok free float handguard (Does not include magpul iron sights or vortex scope)The side charging upper is great for running a scope and operating one handed reloads.There has been a total of 75 rounds fired through the gun and I have most of the brass left over."

Dope charts available at request.  I will let this gem of a rifle go with the accessories listed above for an even $1,000.00, keep in mind you're getting $100 in mags and a $340 trigger upgrade from stock!2. Remington 700 AAC-SD / .308 - This is an off the shelf rifle with a few modifications.  First I replaced the stock trigger with a Timney set to a crisp 1.5lbs break (can be raised to 3lbs). Second I replaced the flimsy stock with a firm and fully aluminum bedded M40 Bell & Carlson stock.  With those two upgrades I have been able to hold down to 0.765 MOA with a 185gn Berger VLD / 45gn Varget combination. I have a handload sheet and dope charts available at request. I have tested this rifle on a 10""x20"" sillouhette at 800yds with success.  This rifle I can let go (with the original stock and trigger included) for $750.00 NOT INCLUDING NIGHTFORCE OPTIC.3.  Nightforce ATACR 4-16x42mm F1 Rifle Scope w/MOAR reticle.  This thing is fully loaded with all features and, let me tell you, has amazing optical clarity.  It is by far the absolute best rifle scope I have ever put my hands on!  I wont talk your ear off about features, but rather redirect you to the Nightforce site so you can read up on it. This scope lists for $2300, but I will let it go for $2,000 even with orignal box and paperwork.4.  NOT PICTURED: I have a Dillon 550B reloading press FULLY LOADED and 2 complete quick change sets for .308 & .223.  It comes with every peripheral that Dillon offers (bullet tray, stand, extra bin bracket etc.).  I have standard FL/RS dies as well as Forster Ultra Micrometer bullet seating dies for both calibers.  I also have PLENTY of the reloading components specified in the previous two items and can negotiate that into a deal.  Altogether I have $750.00 invested in the reloader.  I will consider this item a BEST OFFER & will not be listing a price.  This baby is a workhorse and will last decades if properly maintained, just ask anyone who owns one!5.  NOT PICTURED:  Pelican 1750 rifle case - $160.00 OBOPlease contact Brandon to make a deal or for clarification on any of the items listed @ REDACTED.
