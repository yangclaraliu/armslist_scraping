Hostage Target Video  We want you to be safe!  When using steel targets safe shooting distances are as follows:  Handguns - 15 yards or greater, Rifles - 100 yards or greater. Steel targets should never be shot with a 50 BMG or steel core bullets. Any bullet with steel in jacket could dimple AR500 when shot at close range. (If bullet projectile is magnetic it contains steel). BB, pellet and airsoft guns should not be used. They will bounce back. Superior Ideas, Inc. assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for use or misuse of targets. You are agreeing to these terms as buyer. AR500 Steel targets are great for AR15, AK47 and other assault rifles at 100 yards. They will last virtually forever with various handguns, including Glock, Browning, Ruger, Smith & Wesson, 1911, Springfield XD, Sig, etc. at 15 yards or greater. Superior Ideas, Inc. assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for use or misuse of targets. You are agreeing to these terms as buyer."

This ammo has been incredibly reliable and is very accurate. I am only selling because I no longer have my .308 rifle so I don't have a use for this now. MAGS ARE NOT INCLUDED AND ARE NOT FOR SALEMy FIRM cash price is $0.57/round (FIIIIIIIRRRRRRRMMMM!!!)So if you buy ALL of the ammo that's $535 rounded to the nearest single whole dollar The ONLY trades i am open to are as follows:1,845 rounds of .223 55gr BRASS ($0.29/round)1,670 rounds of 5.56 55gr BRASS ($0.32/round)1,570 rounds of 5.56 62gr BRASS ($0.34/round)OR other combinations of 5.56 and .223 as long as it's brass (NO HOMEMADE RELOADS). Just use the chart above to calculate how many rounds of which you would need to make an even trade, I can help you with the math if you need it.If you have a ton of WOLF ammo I may be interested as well at and i will give $0.23/round credit to my ammo or if you happen to have enough 2,270 rounds for an even trade. But i will not accept other steel ammo (especially not monarch or tulammo) Only WOLF.I came up with this round conversion through depreciation. Since I am not a retailer i cannot post my ammo at the $0.60+/round it goes for normally. With that in mind I depreciated the .223/5.56 rounds and my ammo by $0.03/round. Therefore giving us a blance of how many rounds it would take to make a fair and even trade. Even if we put them all back up to retail price, the conversion would stay sound because they would all increase together. I can also accept partial cash and partial ammo trade.OH YEAH!!! I will also accept a Sig P938 LOL!!! Hit me up if you are interested. Text ONLY at REDACTEDI Can meet around Thousand Oaks and 281You can buy some or all of them. But if you buy a single box (or 20 rounds) you need exact change ($11.40). As I stated already the price is $0.57/round FIRM so NO I WILL NOT TAKE $10 A BOX. DON'T ASK!"

Recently, I have been downsizing my firearm collection because I am trying to save up money for an engagement ring. While going through my things, I realized that I had a lot of extra ammo lying around that I no longer had firearms for. So that being said, I am offering it up for sale at nicely discounted prices. The ammo is brand new and has always been stored in dry, climate controlled areas (inside of my house). All of the ammo was purchased between 2 years ago until present. Feel free to offer and I will go lower if you offer on the entire lot. I really would like to sell as much of the ammo today as possible. So priority (including price) will be given to offers that can be completed today. Some of the ammo has been moved into Plano Storage containers. This was simply done to maximize conditions for the ammo. Thanks

Disclaimer:
ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!
I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!
I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""
Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!
I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales
Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.
I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.
Cash only – no checks, charges, credit cards, payments, cashier’s checks, or promises of riches from a Nigerian prince, nor will I ""hold-it"" so you can run home and get ""permission"". If you don’t have ""permission"" and cash, don’t waste my time.

Before I talk about the rifle I would like to share a little about me and the situation that has brought me to sell it. I am a former Marine and purchased this rifle custom built by Mel Ewing over at snipercentral.com after my deployment to Afghanistan. I have put around 200 rounds through the rifle as I just do not have a lot of time to shoot it. Anyway, I recently decided my life needs some more adventure so I am opting to try my luck in the French Foreign Legion. The money from this rifle is essentially going to fund this entire adventure. Without further ado, on to the rifle:As the title suggests, the rifle is a Remington 700 SPS Tactical chambered in .308.Standard Remington heavy barrel contour with .820"" diameter at the muzzle and 20"" long.Factory XMarkPro trigger.TacOps large bolt knob.Bell and Carlson Mk1 style stock. Has a semi-beavertail forearm with wide barrel channel and a semi-vertical pistol grip. The stock has an aluminum bedding block and the barrel is free floated and the rifle can be fired right or left handed and is the lightest of the B&C tactical stocks. B&C part# 2956.GGG Heavy Duty XDS bipod.Bushnell Elite 4200 Tactical 10x40mm scope with mildot reticle and .25 moa knobs. The scope has a 1"" tube and large tactical knobs with plenty of elevation adjustment. Mounted with a Nightforce Standard Duty 20 MOA aluminum rail with Burris XTR Aluminum 6-screw tactical rings.Run of the mill Winchester sling.Ships in a Plano rifle case with a snake-style bore cleaner, Trijicon lens cleaner tool, and some muff-style hearing protection (simply because I'll have no further use for it).
Asking $1000 OBO.
Imgur link for more pics: http://imgur.com/gallery/uaQ8KAll-in-all it is a great rifle for entry-level or advanced shooters alike. It will definitely reach out and touch something up to 1000 yards. There is some minor scuffs and scratches on the stock as black does virtually nothing to hide them, but overall I would consider the rifle to be in excellent condition. Please contact me with any questions you have, and thank you for taking the time to view my post."

Single shot break action
35 Whelen – Great cartridge 30-06 necked up to 35 Caliber
If you want the 30-06 necked up farther see my 375 Hawk/Scovill listing!
26"" Barrel as this caliber can really reach out a long way.
This is a 1996 Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation Commemorative Rifle
I doubt that adds a ton of value to a basic H&R Single shot but it does add a bit on the neat factor, which is why I bought it.
It has the laminated (Plywood) Stock and is blued.
Has a RMEF Medallion embedded in stock and more RMEF Engraving on the side of the receiver
There are no iron sights but I will include the one-piece mount.
I put an old Weaver K-2.5 and some standard Weaver rings on it but am keeping them so they are NOT included.
This is a great gun and includes the original box. It has a couple handling dings from being in my gun safe for twenty years.
I did run less than 10 shots through it to sight it in. In fact, I have 2 pieces of brass and 17 loaded rounds, so I probably only shot two rounds through it.My intention was to use it as a light weight mountain rifle but I am less inclined to climb the mountain than I was in 1996.
Cool rifle for not a ton of money.
I have a small amount of loaded ammo that I made from 30-06 cases plus I also have another 85 rounds of 30-06 brass that I intended to use to make more 35 Whelen cases but never got that far.
I will sell them with rifle for $25.00

With carefully considered insights from our pro-staff and veteran hunters, Benelli design engineers have spent nearly 10 years in development with a focus on three areas of critical importance to the serious waterfowler: Improved ergonomics, intuitive, flawless functionality and an updated design, style and feel for the latest in modern waterfowling reliability that’s all about the end game: Absolute superiority in the most unforgiving conditions. COMBTECH &COMFORT TECH 3 Comfort Tech™ was the first of its kind. By splitting the stock diagonally and utilizing shock-absorbing chevrons, the entire stock was essentially turned into a recoil pad. This chevron system, now 13 years old, is still the most efficient design possible, and was the basis for the SBE 3 stock. The chevron size and location has been optimized on Comfort Tech 3. Furthermore, Benelli engineers have developed a new cheek comb pad, Combtech, which greatly reduces facial impact and vibrations. EASY-LOADING SYSTEM A beveled loading port, redesigned carrier and a new two-piece carrier latch have all been incorporated into the new SBE 3 to make loading the magazine effortless INERTIA-DRIVEN SYSTEM The hallmark of Benelli strength and reliability, our clean-burning Inertia Driven System never requires adjusting, cycles consistently in conditions that border on the unfair and easily handles everything from light field loads to 3½"" magnums. From a cleanliness and speed perspective, gas systems simply cannot compete—whereas Inertia-Driven Benelli shotguns are known to fire 500,000+ rounds and still function without flaw. OVERSIZED BOLTHANDLE & SAFETY A larger bolt release and safety, along with an outward angled drop lever make the SBE 3 quicker and easier to operate–even with gloved hands."
