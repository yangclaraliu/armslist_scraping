Manufactured by NPZ, Russian made elcan competitor.In perfect condition, never used. Going to change for something with more magnification.

Optically both are about equal with maybe a tiny advantage to the ELCAN, that’s no small achievement on the WOLF Optics PSU since the ELCAN is the best combat optics available. Using the premium German SCHOTT glass in the WOLF Optics PSU has probably helped that a lot. The WOLF Optics PSU has a slight advantage in offering a half degree wider field of view at 4x. The ELCAN has great daylight reticle illumination and digital power control, but the WOLF Optics PSU has a more contemporary tactical focused reticle design. Lastly, the WOLF Optics PSU is about $850-900 cheaper than the ELCAN SpecterDR.""Optic in action from Army-16 expo in Moscowwww.youtube.com/watch?v=WMmW992JawEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdhLLFtXVQwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKijLRKt-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTidLiicgXwManufacturer's write up:The 1x/4x32mm PSU, WPA’s flagship scope, was designed to combine the best features of both the 1x and 4x sights. When set on 1x, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view facilitating rapid “both eyes open” target engagement. Set on 1x it can be employed similar to a reflex sight, providing quick hits on multiple or fast moving targets. With the flip of a switch the magnification increases to 4x providing target identification, ranging and engagement at extended distances. A Bullet Drop Compensating reticle combined with a simple to use “no math” telemetric rangefinder provides fast and reliable hits.Built to survive harsh conditions the PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body. The design is both shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics provides a sharp and bright image with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The illuminated reticle features seven intensity settings and is powered by a readily available CR2032 3-volt battery. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters. The telemetric rangefinder allows ranging out to the same distance. Capped adjustment turrets provide quick and trouble free zeroing. Once zeroed all ballistic corrections are made using the reticle.Very compact in size, the PSU is only 7.4 inches long. Weight is just 24 ounces. Eye relief is a generous 2.75 inches. The PSU mounts easily to a MIL STD 1913 Picatinny rail and features two QD levers. These allow rapid attachment and removal, no tools required. Extremely robust, the PSU is a perfect match for an AR-15 or other Modern Sporting Rifle.Magnification easily changes from 1x to 4x32mm objective provides a large Exit PupilVery wide field of viewCompact size, only 7.4 inches longIlluminated 800 meter BDC reticleIlluminated 800 meter telemetric rangefinderSeven intensity settingsPower provided by common CR2032 batteryOnly 24.6 ounces with QD mountFits Mil Std 1913 Picatinny railQD levers for rapid on/offShockproof and watertight construction--------------Specifications--------------Magnification: 1x and 4xField of View 1x: 26Field of View 4x: 6.5Exit pupil: 8mmEye relief: 70mmAdjustment range of the sight by height: +0-10 mils, min.Adjustment range of the sight by direction: +0-10 mils, minThe height of optical axis to the seat plane: 37.5mmPower supply: CR2032 3VOverall dimensions: 7.5x3x3 inWeight: 24.6 oz."

Optically both are about equal with maybe a tiny advantage to the ELCAN, that’s no small achievement on the WOLF Optics PSU since the ELCAN is the best combat optics available. Using the premium German SCHOTT glass in the WOLF Optics PSU has probably helped that a lot. The WOLF Optics PSU has a slight advantage in offering a half degree wider field of view at 4x. The ELCAN has great daylight reticle illumination and digital power control, but the WOLF Optics PSU has a more contemporary tactical focused reticle design. Lastly, the WOLF Optics PSU is about $850-900 cheaper than the ELCAN SpecterDR.""Optic in action from Army-16 expo in Moscowwww.youtube.com/watch?v=WMmW992JawEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdhLLFtXVQwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKijLRKt-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTidLiicgXwManufacturer's write up:The 1x/4x32mm PSU, WPA’s flagship scope, was designed to combine the best features of both the 1x and 4x sights. When set on 1x, the PSU provides a huge 26 degree field of view facilitating rapid “both eyes open” target engagement. Set on 1x it can be employed similar to a reflex sight, providing quick hits on multiple or fast moving targets. With the flip of a switch the magnification increases to 4x providing target identification, ranging and engagement at extended distances. A Bullet Drop Compensating reticle combined with a simple to use “no math” telemetric rangefinder provides fast and reliable hits.Built to survive harsh conditions the PSU is manufactured from a solid aluminum alloy body. The design is both shockproof and watertight. The fully multi-coated optics provides a sharp and bright image with accurate color rendition and excellent resolution. The illuminated reticle features seven intensity settings and is powered by a readily available CR2032 3-volt battery. The BDC reticle provides ballistic compensation out to 800 meters. The telemetric rangefinder allows ranging out to the same distance. Capped adjustment turrets provide quick and trouble free zeroing. Once zeroed all ballistic corrections are made using the reticle.Very compact in size, the PSU is only 7.4 inches long. Weight is just 24 ounces. Eye relief is a generous 2.75 inches. The PSU mounts easily to a MIL STD 1913 Picatinny rail and features two QD levers. These allow rapid attachment and removal, no tools required. Extremely robust, the PSU is a perfect match for an AR-15 or other Modern Sporting Rifle.Magnification easily changes from 1x to 4x32mm objective provides a large Exit PupilVery wide field of viewCompact size, only 7.4 inches longIlluminated 800 meter BDC reticleIlluminated 800 meter telemetric rangefinderSeven intensity settingsPower provided by common CR2032 batteryOnly 24.6 ounces with QD mountFits Mil Std 1913 Picatinny railQD levers for rapid on/offShockproof and watertight construction--------------Specifications--------------Magnification: 1x and 4xField of View 1x: 26Field of View 4x: 6.5Exit pupil: 8mmEye relief: 70mmAdjustment range of the sight by height: +0-10 mils, min.Adjustment range of the sight by direction: +0-10 mils, minThe height of optical axis to the seat plane: 37.5mmPower supply: CR2032 3VOverall dimensions: 7.5x3x3 inWeight: 24.6 oz."

This is not your cheap home-built AR filled with entry level parts, then with a few thousand rounds of cheap, corrosive ammunition through it. This is a new, unfired, unmolested rifle with all good parts. 
This AR comes furnished with a complete Troy 16” upper. It has a legit 1-7 twist barrel and 13” Alpha Battlerail. The battlerail has never had anything mounted to it. You can find this upper on Troy’s website for just under $1,000.  Troy ARs are very highly regarded.
It has a BCG Gunfighter charging handle and SNS Industries lower (Made in USA, no longer available -- these are very nice lowers). ATI molded very comfortable rubber-paneled finger groove grip. Stock is a standard M4 mil-spec (don’t know the brand). Amend2 polymer mag included. Another mag I have to locate but for now I have only one available for immediate sale.
Included are 45 degree sights. It is not configured with standard fixed or folding sights at zero degrees, which might get in the way of an optic.I am the second owner and the first owner was a dealer, and this was his personal rifle, which he claimed was only test fired.  I broke it down to clean it and found that there was a little residue inside, possibly as much as one box of ammo but very little wear.  I have only put 20 rounds through it to test it, myself.  I love the gun but my wife says I can't keep it.
I have done a national search on Armslist and gunbroker.com, and found that the cheapest offering of a complete Troy 16” upper like this one on a complete gun was $1,100-$1,200, so $1,000 is the best price you will find in the country. I am not planning on being very flexible on the price because it appears to be the lowest cost Troy in the country.
Sale requires that it be registered through a local FFL, according to Washington State law
Trades are unlikely, but I might remotely consider trades + cash:"

The scope also comes with the Vortex VIP lifetime warranty which is completely transferrable. If anything ever happens to the scope, you send it back to Vortex for a no questions asked repair/replacement. I have room to shoot at my house so when you come to look at it, you can even put some rounds through the gun before buying. I am in law enforcement so please do not contact me if you cannot legally purchase the weapon. I will ask to see driver’s license to ensure you are over 18 and I will ask that you provide a handwritten and signed note stating that you can lawfully own/possess the firearm.

NOTICE REGARDING EVO 922R KITS The EVO 922R PARTS AND FOLDING STOCK KIT (“EVO 922R KIT”) is intended to be used in conjunction with a CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol. Under federal law, attaching a stock to a firearm with a barrel less than 16” amounts to making a short barreled rifle (SBR). Prior to making an SBR, the owner of the firearm must first register the firearm with ATF and pay the appropriate tax. Additionally, federal law (the “922(r) statute”) prevents a person from making a rifle using more than 10 of the parts listed in 27 CFR 478.39 if the resulting rifle would be “non-sporting” under federal law. A Scorpion SBR would be “non-sporting” under federal law, hence the EVO 922R KIT. ATF has taken the position that an SBR is made when unassembled parts are placed in close proximity in such a way that they “serve no useful purpose other than to make a rifle having a barrel less than 16 inches in length… or convert a complete weapon into such an NFA firearm…” See ATF Ruling 2011-4. CZ-USA takes no position on exactly what “close proximity” means in the context of dealers and distributors of firearms. Purchasers of the EVO 922R KIT, including dealers and distributors, are solely responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the assembly, manufacture, and possession of SBRs and SBR components, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. § 922(r) and 27 CFR 478.39 and related regulations and rulings, and encourages you to consult with your attorney or to contact ATF should you have questions for your particular circumstance.
