After a tremendous amount of research and testing by Bill Wilson and the Wilson Combat team we are excited to announce the availability of our custom AR platform rifles chambered in 6.8 SPC caliber. The 6.8 SPC (6.8x43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an AR pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil. When built to the level of quality and precision Wilson Combat has achieved the 6.8 SPC is also capable of outstanding accuracy and reliability. In our match-grade, Spec II chambered 16″ barrels, The 6.8 SPC is capable of pushing a .277 caliber, 85gr bullet to over 2900 FPS. 110gr bullets easily achieve 2500 FPS with factory loaded ammunition. Appropriate hand loading can achieve even higher velocities and enable the use of heavier projectiles up to 130 grains, which dramatically improves terminal ballistics over a 5.56 Nato/.223 Remington at long range.This added ballistic performance makes the 6.8 SPC perfect for home protection and SRT/SWAT teams. The 6.8 is a truly ideal hunting round for medium to heavy game and turns the AR into a serious hunting rifle."

Pic was when the gun was assembled. Barrel was broke in per Rainier arms standards. Gun and barrel were thoroughly cleaned after every trip to the range. Every other time i shoot my gas guns i take em down completely and clean them, so this barrel was well taken care of. Somebody give this thing a good home.NO TRADES. Price is firm."

I've had it a little over a year and it has run flawless. It has had a couple hundred rounds through it. Included is the original box and everything that came with the gun from the factory. Shoot it as a pistol, or add a stabilizer brace, or use the included shoulder strap. I did the SBR thing but recently was bit by the MP5 bug. I have a letter from the ATF stating that I can return the gun to pistol status and sell it. Sig suggested retail is $1852. It currently has a Franklin Armory BFS-III Binary trigger, factory trigger included . Trigger sells for $429.99 plus shipping. If you don't know about the BFS-III go to youtube and do a search, it will blow your mind. It also has a 3 lug suppressor mount. I added a pic with the can (not included). I will sell the gun, as in picture #1 with BFS-III for $1350 and I will include 3 more magazines ($100 value) with pouch plus stock trigger. Add up the extras and subtract from my asking price and you are buying the gun for less then $800. If you want this reply to ad with your phone number and I'll get right back to you. Not interested in a trade, and will not part out. If you see this it's still available, no need to ask."

WALTHER
H&K Model MP5 SD .22 Long Rifle 16.1 Inch Barrel Retractable Stock SD-Type Forearm Pistol Grip Adjustable Sights 25 Round
Features metal receivers, compensator, SD-type forearm and retractable stock with Navy pistol grip. Front sight adjustable for elevation. Rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation. All black finish.
The H&K MP5 SD is a rimfire rifle authentic in looks, feel, and operation. This HK clone is engineered as a dedicated .22 Long Rifle. It’s built with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK MP5-style sights. The sound dampener (SD) is actually a compensator. It is attached to conceal the 16.1 inch barrel that extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The MP5’s magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed for ease of loading with dual grips for holding the spring when loading. A 25-round and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The MP5 SD estimated retail price is $519.
 A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK MP5 SD. When the magazine empties the bolt remains open. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The safety switch rotates 90 degrees, as does the 9 mm MP5."
