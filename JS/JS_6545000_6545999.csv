The blade is made of vacuum heat-treated VG-1 San Mai III® blade construction. It's costly and difficult to fashion, but the resulting blade it yields is virtually indestructible. The handle also plays a big role in the overall performance. It has a double quillon guard, bolster, and pommel made of highly polished 300 series stainless steel and a gorgeous black linen Micarta handle. It will easily accommodate a wide variety of gripping methods while serving as a very formidable impact weapon as well.I of course would like to get the amounts I see at the current knife shows, 800-1000, but I want to sell it quick and not take a loss, so I will let it go for the 600.00 I paid for it, when it wasn't asdesired and hard to find.  So shoot me an offer of either 600 in cash or a gun trade offer of around the same value.  Let me know if you have any questions.Thanks"

Excellent Condition, no issues. Selling due to financial constraints (new baby, wife says its gotta go)With a similar design to the classic Model 110, but able to stand apart as a unique firearm, the Axis is a dependable, affordable rifle made by the trusted hands at Savage. The crisp Axis trigger has a pull weight of approximately five pounds. The bolt design is the same as the bolt on the trusted Savage 10/110, a design that allows the lugs to bear evenly on both sides in their respective bolt lug recesses at the front of the action, making for very even pressure on the rear of the cartridge case and assuring consistent alignment of the cartridge with the bore. The uniquely designed recoil lug of the Axis action is not sandwiched between the barrel and receiver as in many rifles, but is inserted into the synthetic stock, meaning that when the stock is removed from the barreled action, the recoil lug goes with it. The bolt handle is a unique design as well, having a skeletonized look from the top side, much like the underside of some bolt handles. The detachable box magazine of the Axis is well-crafted, and easy to insert and remove, even while wearing gloves. Among other premium features, the highly accurate Axis includes an attractive, smooth receiver, a heavily textured grip, a free-floated sporter-taper barrel, a very effective recoil pad, and sling swivel studs."

I've found something I must have. Haha. I'll take $950 cash until Monday evening. Up for preferably trade is a Kimber Custom II 1911. The gun has been modified for carry and cosmetics. All internals are factory Kimber. This is a government model (5"" barrel). Factory case, paperwork, etc. included.  Upgrades include the following:Fiber optic front sight (red, green, white tubes included)Rear sight is serrated and all black for quick acquisitionVZ grips G-10 with scoop in black and greyTorque grip screws with o-ring4- 7 round mags with tapered slam padsWilson Combat magwell The gun has seen around 100-150 rounds or so. It functions flawless as most Kimbers do. It shows no signs of wear, and has been carried very little. Gun was thoroughly cleaned after each use. It is exceptionally accurate. No idiot scratch. Accessories included are as follows:Azula all leather molded holster (black leather with black stitching) OWBAzula all leather molded 2 mag carrier (black leather with black stitching) OWBGalco all leather molded holster with spring clips (black with black stitching) IWBAzula all leather molded 2 mag carrier with spring clips (black with black stitching) IWBGeneric MOLLE nylon holster with single mag pouch and retention (I attached it to a backpack for travel)UTG drop leg tactical holster (single drop strap, double leg strap) 38"" leather belt with brushed stainless buckle (Amish made, thick black leather)All accessories are coordinated in color, finish and stitching. This makes for a very nice year round carry package, both inside and outside the waist. Three mags will come loaded with SigTac hollow point defense ammo. I will also include 50 rounds of factory range ammo of my choosing to get you started at the range. This is is a complete and comprehensive range and carry package. It's all inclusive. Here's what I'm looking for. I own several full sized 1911's, hence the reason I can let this go as a package. I'm looking for a Sig C3, Springfield Range Officer 4"", or Springfield EMP4. May consider other 4"" 1911's, but mainly looking for those listed. May consider a Glock 30 gen 4 with cash or Springfield XDS 4.0 with cash. May also look at M&P 2.0 with cash, as well. Depending on accessories, ammo, and travel, may need cash to even the trade. I'm open minded and willing to negotiate. My cash price is $1100. OBO . Far less than I have in it.  May also consider a 2 for 1 deal. Entry level bolt .308 and carry gun, or entry lever bolt gun and cash. May also consider a small revolver and small carry gun.  I'm pretty open to offers and will politely reply to all. Feel free to ask, worst I can say is ""no thank you"". If it's listed, I have it. Please let me know of interest, and I'll send several pics and full details. Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing from you. Please be safe and have a good day. Also, I am a public servant and work strange schedules. I will return emails as soon as possible."
