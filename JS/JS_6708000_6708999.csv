The 20 moa rail is removable as it mounts with 6 set screws.  The receiver is NOT drilled and tapped for scope, it has a dovetail rail.  The original Savage Anschutz peep / aperture sight and also a Williams FP target low sight are included and can both be mounted as the mounting bolts for the Savage / Anschutz sight and the base for the Williams sight are the same size.   The Willimas sight uses the base.  Remove the base and the original sight mounts directly to the receiver with out the base.  The scope is a Bushnell 6-24 Mill dot and is surprisingly good...no it is not a Nightforce....but really good for the money....you will have no problem making squirrel headshots at 100.   Scope is like new with the box and papers.  Original swivel slings with one additional standard swivel stud mounted through the bottom rail.....this is so a bipod can be mounted.   A blackhawk cheek pad was resewn to fit this rifle.  The riser is removable so you have good cheek weld and eye position with either iron sights or scope.   The peeps are std .050 target apertures and the hooded front sight has a aperture  insert suitable for hunting or std targets at 50 or 100.   The rifle (metal) was manufactured in Germany by Anschutz with the Anschutz model 64 receiver.   Only the stock was made by Savage.   Theses were sold for a few years in the USA as Savage/Anschutz, and in Europe a Anschutz/Savage.  The beautiful stock always got gawkers.  More photos here: https://1drv.ms/f/s!Au11snxSmYXRhjj1HZF9tcBxA_Yo"

(Yes I will consider all trades, I do like firearms) Brand New .556 / .223  1:7 twist barrel AR15. (Update: tried out this brand new AR15 tonight, superb  shooter! Very lightweight and absorbed the recoil very well without transferring it to me!  Rifle runs perfectly and is easily on par with my best go-to AR in my bunch, and a better looking design hands down. This is the new 2nd Generation ATI Omni Hybrid Maxx with aluminum quad rail and 6 position collapsable and lockable butt stock. Buttstock has a small switch that will, when activated, lock all of the looseness out of the multi position stock. Works perfectly and long overdue for the 6 position stock design. Has all amenities: dust cover, forward assist, full length even-heighted picatinny rail, removable flash hider. It rates between 4.5 and 5 stars across the board from customers for reliability and design and ruggedness, and is lighter than all ar15's on the market. Internet says it surpassed all mil-spec torture tests including being run over by a 8000 pound forklift and being hung on at the buttstock by over a 250 pound weight with no flex or distortion in shape. I have never shot it (correction- shot it tonight for first time, see above for report), and I just bought a vintage Marlin 30-30 today and need to recoup some money.  Comes with new magazine of course.Thanks."

It is in great shape for its age and functions well. The OSP was built for and used in Olympic Competition shooting, and this particular gun was purchased in 1985 and used in the Olympics for a few competitions. The original owner I purchased it from still holds an Olympic record to this day with this pistol.Walther OSP Competition .22Manufactured in 1985, date code is ""IF""Chambered in .22 short2 walther mags includedextra trigger assembly housingextra Walther OSP barrela couple of grips (both right and left) which are semi-custom, so may not work for everyone.I have more pics that I can text if you would like.For more information, here is a link: http://www.carlwalther.com/osp.htmAsking $1000, Text/Call REDACTED - but if you are serious, let's talk. I didn't know where to start and with some evidence can be convinced it is worth less. I will be listing on GunBroker as well since I realize there might not be a market in Albuquerque for a pistol of this nature."

I grabbed an Anderson LPK and the rest of the parts were mil spec ones I had laying around from a previous build. Just decided to slap them all together and see how it would turn out. For a very basic no frills rifle I really like it. The upper came completely assembled from PSA. The BCG is PSA's generic full auto one they sell, same with the mil spec charging handle. I even threw on a metal rear flip up sight that I'll include with the sale. This rifle is good to go to the range!Haven't even had time to get out to the range with this one yet.
