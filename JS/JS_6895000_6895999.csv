I am use to a much bigger gun and thought I would go a bit smaller for carry. It shoots fine, actually, very good  right out of the box. Recoil is light, in my opinion. I just need a gun with a fatter grip. It does come with 4 mags. 2 flush and 2 extended. All paperwork that came with it. Supposedly, free batteries for life, for the Crimson Trace, once you register it, which I have not. So save yourself a few bucks plus the tax on a new gun and grab this one up. 500 is what Im asking. I would consider trades as well. Looking for XD subcompact 9mm - HK P30SK - Sig 320c - Other Sigs possibly."

This is the V1, which has the DA/SA trigger with manual safety and decocker on the left side of the frame. Haven't had any issues with this handgun at all, my P2000 is just my go-to gun, but I've only put a few hundred rounds through it.What you would be getting is the Handgun itself, three 15 round magazines (one is a .40 S&W magazine, only difference is the magazine body is marked .40S&W, but is otherwise identical and holds 15 rounds of 9mm), the original box, and some night sights that have yet to be installed. I'm asking $575 for the whole package. Willing to meet within a reasonable distance from the Irmo/Columbia area. Not looking for any trades at this time."
