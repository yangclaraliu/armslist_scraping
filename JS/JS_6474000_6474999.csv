The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts."

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Loaded Chamber Indicator: Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.Heinie Sights: Features the famous and genuine Richard Heinie ""Straight Eight"" Sight, using the rapid and accurate dot over the dot systemNew Unique SA/DA Trigger System: The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered."

I actually purchased a battery but it is the wrong connector. These airsoft guns are truly insane. They actually seem more real than the actual firearms that they sit next to in my safe.

This pistol started life as a commercial ""Government Model"" but due to the need for military arms was one of a small group transferred to a military contract and reworked to military configuration. The original commercial serial number was crudely removed by peening (both on the frame and on the slide) and a military serial number stamped over it. The pistols also received standard military proofing including the inspector's initials (G.H.D.), the ""P"" proofs, and the ordnance crossed cannons. The frames were also stamped with ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" and the military designation ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"". It is interesting to note that slide retained the standard commercial markings and the Colt commercial ""VP"" proof is still found on the left side of the trigger guard. Most of the commercial pistols of this period were fitted with the Swartz firing pin safety and these non-military components were removed, leaving empty the small milled out areas in the top of the frame and underside of the slide. Lastly, the pistols were refinished in the standard military parkerized type finish and fitted with the military style grips. All these things together make for a very unique variation of the 1911A1 pistol.This pistol is in good overall original condition. The frame and slide are serial numbered to match. The parkerized finish does show holster & handling wear with general thinning to the sharp edges and top of slide. There is no significant pitting however there is a ding to the right side of the rear sight. The barrel is interesting in that it is properly marked ""COLT .45 AUTO"" beneath the chamber but has no other markings, commercial or military. The barrel is finished dulite blue but polished in the white over the chamber area. The grips are in good condition, with normal wear, but no cracks. This pistol appears to be in perfect mechanical condition and everything functions properly. The bore however is rough and although there is some strong rifling remaining, it exhibits some pitting throughout. It comes with a war-time military contract magazine which shows some moderate corrosion along the sides....."

This pistol started life as a commercial ""Government Model"" but due to the need for military arms was one of a small group transferred to a military contract and reworked to military configuration. The original commercial serial number was crudely removed by peening (both on the frame and on the slide) and a military serial number stamped over it. The pistols also received standard military proofing including the inspector's initials (G.H.D.), the ""P"" proofs, and the ordnance crossed cannons. The frames were also stamped with ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" and the military designation ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"". It is interesting to note that slide retained the standard commercial markings and the Colt commercial ""VP"" proof is still found on the left side of the trigger guard. Most of the commercial pistols of this period were fitted with the Swartz firing pin safety and these non-military components were removed, leaving empty the small milled out areas in the top of the frame and underside of the slide. Lastly, the pistols were refinished in the standard military parkerized type finish and fitted with the military style grips. All these things together make for a very unique variation of the 1911A1 pistol.This pistol is in good overall original condition. The frame and slide are serial numbered to match. The parkerized finish does show holster & handling wear with general thinning to the sharp edges and top of slide. There is no significant pitting however there is a ding to the right side of the rear sight. The barrel is interesting in that it is properly marked ""COLT .45 AUTO"" beneath the chamber but has no other markings, commercial or military. The barrel is finished dulite blue but polished in the white over the chamber area. The grips are in good condition, with normal wear, but no cracks. This pistol appears to be in perfect mechanical condition and everything functions properly. The bore however is rough and although there is some strong rifling remaining, it exhibits some pitting throughout. It comes with a war-time military contract magazine which shows some moderate corrosion along the sides."
