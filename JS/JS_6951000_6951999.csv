I have a whole collection beyond the gun in this listing, mostly older Winchester rifles and shotguns as well as some old colt and s&w pistols plus a few others. If anyone would like a list please let me know and i will email you. Anyways, this listing is for a Marlin Firearms co. model 39A .22 calbier short-long or long rifle. Based on the serial number I believe it was made in 1955. Its my understanding that Marlin co. is highly revered amongst both collectors as well as folks who use guns as a tool for hunting etc as they are both valuable as well as very well made and reliable. This gun is old, but is in very good working condition, as far as i can tell the quality of the wood finish and blueing is still very high. My camera is of poor quality and wont really do this rifle ustice, If anyone is interested in this would be glad to provide quality picturres Asking price is 550.00$ Price is negotiable."

This rifle is ready to go hunt today and it's already been bloody out to 221 yards right through the boiler room the heart looked like burgered ground chuck it's a stone cold knock out machine for freezer meat.   - Nikon Buckmasters 3-9x42 with BDC reticle.  Bungee lens covers included, but not shown.- Talley Manufacturing lightweight one piece base/mount size medium for 1"" tubes and objective lenses up to 44mm- Air Tech Slip On recoil pad(new never mounted)- Bull Dog 52"" waterproof scoped rifle case - Gun Monkey backpack sling adapter with 2 Browning Excelerator Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity slings.  Fantastic for hunting and hiking, but especially for climbing a stand or using a climber.  No more tow lines and potentially banging the rifle around....it's on your back.  If you don't like the backpack setup just take off the adapter and use one of the 2 Browning Excelerators like you usually would, but you are going to love the backpack no more adjusting for a slipping rifle when hiking.  - Green light with scope mount.  These are fantastic for just b/f sun up or just after sun down you can light up game and they don't even blink.  Have taken many hogs with this setup.Nothing else to add, but feel free to ask any technical questions I'm a tech dork and enjoy talking about all things hunting/shooting.  My firearms are always cleaned the day they are fired and maintained meticulously."

It is a great shooter and 100% made in America with a Lifetime Warranty. I am downsizing and decided to only keep one gun of my most often used calibers and I have several .270 Winchesters. I will ship the gun in a new Plano Plastic case via USPS Priority Ground.My feed back is perfect on Gunbroker and I guarantee your satisfaction. I spent $90 this year for new ruger rings, $65 for professional trigger job, and $35 for new plastic case. When you add it all up this is a ""great buy"" for this all ""Made in America"" classic. I will sell the LNIB Redfield Revolution 4-12x40 Scope for $150 if interested Thanks for looking."

Because of the design, this gun even has a threaded barrel with no pin required in NJ making this a rare rifle chambered in this caliber that you can easily swap out and in different muzzle breaks as you wish. The front seamlessly opens into a bipod and comes with the attached sling and two Magazines. I can't find a single scratch on the gun and has been well maintained even though I've only owned it for a little less than a year. Really fun to shoot, ultra compact when folded and gets a lot of questions at the range since it catches people's eye in action. Price negotiable."

It appears to be unfired but has years of handling marks and in/out of safe marks. All original, numbers matching. Imported in the mid 90's, this is not your run of the mill AK. This one is for the true AK aficionado. Finding a SLR 96 is rare, but finding an unfired one is nearly impossible. Check any of the normal gun auction sites. Please keep that in mind before you make an offer. I had plans to use the milled receiver for a Krink build, but I can't bring myself to ruin such a hard to find item by taking it from its original configuration. Comes with cleaning kit, oil container, and manual. Has the pinned muzzle brake and 45 degree gas block.There are some marks on the dust cover and charging handle and a crack in the butt stock. The internals are pristine with not a single mark on the piston or bolt face. Barrel looks just like it did when it came out of the factory.More pictures available upon requestSerious inquiries only, pleaseCall or text only. 574-2one5-22six2EMAILS will be IGNORED due to endless spam/scams.APPARENTLY THE STATEMENT ABOVE GOES UNNOTICED, SO I WILL PUT IT IN ALL CAPS!
