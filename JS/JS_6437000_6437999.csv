The floor plate is epoxied shut.* I get asked alot if you can open the magazine up to clean it or to convert it if you move to a free state.

This Super Match “SUPER1911” is hand-engraved by Rob Bunting of Baron Engraving in Trumbull, Connecticut. Rob is a highly skilled and creative engraver who has engraved some of the most popular firearms. In explaining the engraving pattern he featured on the Super Match II 1911 (and the SuperAmerica .308 rifle), Rob said, “First off, 1911's are one of my favorites to work on! When I saw the serial number was special, I thought I would try something a little different for this one. I tend to do leafy scroll, which I like very much, but I wanted to simplify the look this time around. This pattern has a very strong central spine with leaves placed more formally at regular intervals. The spine receives very little shading and the leaves are heavily shaded and cross-hatched, which creates a very strong contrast in the design. I think that is what makes it nice. I also removed a fair amount of background from between the scrolls and put in a nice strong punch dot pattern down to increase the contrast. Black fill in the cuts makes the whole thing pull together and pop.” The new Super Match II 1911is designed for competition right out of the box with all new features and an accuracy guarantee of one-inch five-shot groups at 25 yards. The .45 ACP features Kimber adjustable sights, fancy walnut grips and match grade trigger. Barrel length is five inches and weight is 39 ounces with unloaded 8-round magazine."

DESCRIPTIONThe P226 Extreme Semi-Auto Pistol comes tricked out from the factory for winning shooting competitions. The Extreme model comes with Sig's SRT (Short Reset) trigger to enhance fire control and accuracy, G-10 wrap-around grips, front cocking serrations on the slide, and SIGLITE® night sights. The P226 operates with a double action/single action design, with only 3 controls: the slide stop, the magazine release, and the decocker, enabling the pistol to be deployed quickly without having to flip a mechanical safety on or off. Sig semi-automatic pistols have several built-in safety features, including a hammer block and firing pin block that make them suitable for safe carry. The P226 Extreme is constructed with a black, hard-coat anodized aluminum frame, and a Nitro coated stainless steel slide. The frame features an integral 3-lug Picatinny rail for attaching aftermarket sights and lights.

The only ones I have seen on here are in different states with sellers unwilling to go through FFL. If I can get my hands on either piece it would be great, Ideally Id like to own both but I will settle for one unless I can find them both at reasonable prices. If you have one you'd like to get rid of please contact me with what you are looking to get out of it.Thanks"
