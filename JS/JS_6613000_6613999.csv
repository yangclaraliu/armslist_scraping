I've also added a tritium front sight and a magpul sling attachment to the front rail.
Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI
With one-piece Monoforge upper design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter. The 9” user configurable rail system with individual rail sections allow the shooter to place accessory rails where they are needed while maintaining its low profile ergonomic fit and function. Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-Enhanced Rifle. LWRCI Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard. Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.
Gas block is easily accessible enabling the user to pre-restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure from running a suppressor.
Includes a Picatinny rail at the 12 o’clock position, and is compatible with accessories like the M320 grenade launcher and the M26 shotgun. Gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. LWRCI manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that is 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter. The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.call or text REDACTED"

I only took it the the range a few times, and it comes with 1 serbian style, bolt hold open magazine. The butt stock also has a rubber butt pad, which aids in recoil reduction and makes for a very smooth shooter"

I bought all the tools to assemble this platform firearm. The rifle is built on a Barnes lower receiver, the crown jewel of the gun is the bolt carrier group (BCG) it's made by Fail Zero. It's nickel boron coated and requires no lubrication for thousands of rounds. I still lightly oil it though. Lol. It's not your entry level BS AR. But it's not entirely one brand either. I picked all the parts I wanted. Very low round count. Of I had to guess no more than 1k rounds through it. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, and easily shoots .223 Remington as well. Also has a Nikon scope, ALG defence muzzle brake, magpul accessories."
