** Broke down how I came to my asking price. Listed the cost of everything new from my cheaper local FFL.
* LCR 9mm - $550 + tax
* XS sight - $70 + shipping, tax & install
* extra clips - $15 + shipping & tax
* holster - $10 + tax 
* ammo - $23 + tax
* Total - roughly $720 after taxes, shipping and sight install.
* Asking $480. So about $240 less than new.  **** I need a ""I'll take it"" reply before 1pm, pickup tonight or tomorrow night. If not its getting traded in towards my M11A1 Im picking up late this afternoon."

All original equipment will come with it. Including the original trigger. It will come with 2 Magpul magazine part kits. I did do a rattle can paint job on it witch I didn't like. So I removed it the best I could. It still shows some paint in places but nothing to bad. I am asking $500 for it. Which I would say is a great deal! The AK it's self was originally $600 and the trigger is was $250. Plus the Magpul furniture and the PWS muzzle brake. So my loss is your gain!Buyer MUST pass a background check!!!

Serious shooters who care about the details welcomed the precision features that made the Range Officer® perform far beyond its price tag. We insisted on the best components and manufacturing techniques, like forged national match frames and slides, both features found on our top end 1911 models. A gun is only as good as its barrel, so we didn’t skimp there either. We added a national match stainless steel barrel and precisely fit bushing for maximum accuracy. Many of those competition gun customers couldn’t help wonder why we didn’t make a self-defense version of the 1911 Range Officer®, so we did – in both 9mm and .45ACP calibers. New for 2016 is the 1911 Range Officer® Operator® model. We’ve kept the same great “under the hood” features that made the original Range Officer® great, but added features to turn this pistol into a formidable self-defense pistol for carry or home use. The five inch barrel with fully supported ramp provides an extended sight radius, making your job of getting fast hits on target even easier. Speaking of sights, the front is a shielded fiber optic tube while the rear is a low profile combat style that won’t snag during the draw. There’s no reason a functional combat gun can’t look good. The 1911 Range Officer® Operator® sports a Parkerized finish that looks sharp and will ward off corrosion and rust. Checkered Cocobolo grips provide a firm hold without shredding carry holsters and clothes. Serious 1911 fighting features are all there too. The classic flat mainspring housing is checkered for positive grip, and the extended beavertail safety includes a memory bump for positive activation. Add a long aluminum match grade trigger, skeletonized hammer, and rail for light or laser and this pistol is good to go.

This is a 10 gauge shotgun with vented barrel and walnut stock. This beast of a shotgun is a Collectors Gun that isn’t made any longer and it looks new. It was produced from 1975 until 1989, at which point Remington Arms bought the design and used it as the basis for the Remington Model SP-10.It has a 32 inch barrel and shoots 3 1/2"" magnum shells. It sports a beautiful walnut stock. This shotgun comes with a ventilated rib, a bead front sight, a cross-bolt safety, and a fixed full choke. Its wood, metal, and bore are all in Excellent Condition. The Ithaca Mag-10 is a well-built All American semi-auto gas operated shotgun that features a stainless steel breech block assembly that's made to withstand years of heavy duty use. And as those who own them know, they are built for strength and endurance. The Mag-10 also works well with lead loads, making it an excellent goose or turkey hunting gun. Ithaca Mag 10's are for those who don't own a Rolex….yet.Overall this gun is in very solid shape. Very minor storage marks on butt stock.

Sorry, but not interested in trades at this time.This is a fully customized Glock 19 that has been fine-tuned and upgraded to near perfection.  It has had roughly 200 rounds through it in order to fine tune and test the weapon and specific upgrades as they were completed and once the entire project was completed. It shoots like a dream and is easily the finest Glock I've fired.  The trigger pull currently measures just under 3 lbs. with a clean break and almost no travel.  Depending on your intended use, the trigger pull and travel can easily be user adjusted in a matter of minutes (ie. you may want to increase the pull weight slightly for self defense though I find the current setup ideal for competition type shooting).  Listed below are the most significant upgrades and modifications that have been done:  -Custom milled and cut slide, reducing slide weight and improving aesthetics.  -Slide was ultimately finished with a dark grey ceracoat finish.  -DPM Systems Advanced Recoil System replaced stock guide rod and spring. Dual spring system drastically reduces recoil and muzzle rise, improving accuracy and speed of subsequent shots.  - Pyramid Ultimate Trigger System is completely user adjustable where pull weight, pre-travel, and over-travel are easily altered to a level that is best for you.  This package also includes Titanium Nitride coated (TiN) trigger bar, safety plunger, and the skeletonized stryker/firing pin.  -Trijicon front and rear sights are easily visible in any light conditions and they are constructed of metal making them extremely durable and nearly indestructable as opposed to the plastic stock sights.  -Modified frame has had a mass reduction removing material around the grip and just below the trigger guard allowing for a more comfortable feel and increasing room in order to accomodate three fingers below the trigger guard. Modified magwell to allow for easy mag removal in the event of a magazine failing to drop and finally, customised trigger guard.  The frame was ultimately finished with a custom ""spilled sprinkle"" stipple job that is very unique, looks great, and has a better feel than more typicl pin point stippling work.    -Zev dimple fluted and Titanium Nitride coated (TiN) match barrel.  -Zev oversized safety, extended slide stop, and custom rear slide plate and grip plug.The handgun shall come in its glock hard carry case with a lock, all paper work and manuals, and two 15-round magazines.  If you have any questions, please ask.  I also have many more pictures that I'm happy to provide upon request.  I may be reached via email or text message at REDACTED."

I'm happy to include this stock with purchase at a great price if your interested.  The upper also has an upgraded compensator/muzzle device that serves to reduce felt Recoil, which is negligible, and reduce muzzle rise.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  I may be reached via email or text message at REDACTED. HK MR556 Upper Kit Consists of:Complete MR556 Upper Receiver, Barrel Assembly, HK 16.5"" cold-hammer forged barrel, upper receiver with forward assist, extended convertible charging handle, HK Free Floating Quad Rail System handguard.Complete MR556 Bolt Carrier Group AssemblyTungsten Filled HK Proprietary Buffer WeightHK Proprietary Buffer (Action) Spring*Note that as the MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is not classified as a firearm, purchases do not require an FFL.MSRP $2,199
The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit includes a complete upper receiver/barrel assembly, bolt carrier assembly, buffer, and buffer spring allowing most high-quality 5.56 mm AR-style rifles to be retrofitted to HK’s pusher rod system. The Upper Receiver Kit is the core of the HK 5.56 mm proprietary gas piston operating system. It employs a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.
The same operating system is used in the combat-proven 5.56 mm HK416 as well as the G36, XM8, HK417, and a variety of other Heckler & Koch arms. The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is designed to be fully interchangeable with all high quality AR-style firearms, simply by attaching it to an AR lower receiver using the standard takedown pins. Due to the shortened length of the HK buffer and HK (action) buffer spring, these parts do not work in fixed stock AR-type rifles. Installation of MIL-SPEC hammers in non-HK lower receivers is required for reliable function. Additionally, the MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit does not work in lower receivers with fully automatic or selective fire mechanisms.
However, the HK416 Upper Receiver Kit (available to military and law enforcement customers) is designed to function with fully automatic and selective fire lower receivers. The HK piston driven operating system virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.
Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente). The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.
The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The Upper Receiver Kit uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging technology. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.
The unchromed 16.5-inch barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. A thick, heavy contour also contributes to its excellent accuracy.
The Upper Receiver Kit also includes the HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard with its four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails. This premium machined alloy handguard allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The Upper Receiver Kit also has a Picatinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights."
