They had a reputation of being extremely fast shooting guns, due to the inherent speed in the inertia recoil system. This still holds true today. Gun is very clean with slight barrel marring due to chrome bore. I think previous owner may have shot some steel though the gun, but it in no way effects the operation of the shotgun. The wood is simply oiled, and there are no cracks or dents. Metal is in excellent condition rating a 98 out of 100%. The bolt carrier does not show wear, and I know that they will eventually by my other Benelli. Mostly wanting to sell as there are a few things I am interested in purchasing with the funds, but always open to offers. Silver Eagles can be part of any offer, we will agree on a current value.

If the ad is still up, I still have it so please don't message me with ""Still got it"" or ""Text me"". Please send me a detailed message with your location and trade offer. I'm sorry to sounds kind of rude; I'm really not, it's just that I get SO MANY useless and ridiculous messgages when trading a high-end firearm that I'd rather not get stuck in text message conversations with people trying to convince me that their DPMS AR-15 w NC-Star scope and a Ruger LCP is an equal trade.  Anyway, this rifle started life as a heavey barrel short action .308 Savage 10FP LEO (law enforcement model) and then a free-float Choate tactical sniper stock was added and the Accuracy International bottom metal (the thing that allows you to use detachable box mags) was installed. This rifle takes Accuary International .308 mags. Yes, I know they're expensive as hell (about $80 to $100 each) so I'm including 3 of them (two 5rd mags and one 10rd mag and yes they're all marked ""AI""). One of the 5rd mags is painted and the other two are mint.  The paint on the rifle is just Krylon spray paint. The original color of the stock underneath is black and OD green. The scope is a Vortex Viper PST 4-16X50. This scope has tactical turrets and an illuminated reticle. It also is a first focal plane reticle scope so that's super sexy.  The bipod is an authentic Harris 9"" HBLMS bipod and is included.  Again, I'm only looking for trades, not cash.  Keep in mind that the bottom metal and 3 mags are alone worth $550ish so please don't offer me your Glock .40 as a striagt trade. Again, trying not to be a jerk but I get a lot of silly trade offers. Also, the rough value of this package is hard to pin down and I'm certainly not trying to get every penny out of it that I put into it (that'd be silly) but the scope is roughly $700, the bipod about $110, the bottom metal and mags, as I mentioned are about $550, the rifle + tactical stock is about $1,200 so please just keep in mind the rough value when making a trade offer.  Trades can be anything. I'm open to whatever and I enjoy seeing what offers roll in. Please just keep them reasonable and PLEASE include the trade offer in your first message to me. I can follow up from there but I've never seen the point in the people who message me with ""Intersted, message me"". Again, please include where you're located too when you're offering a trade. I'd trade this for one single high end gun or multiple guns. Just let me know what you have, where you're at and roughly when you might be available to meet."

I've got an AR-10 style Smith & Wesson M&P10  in .308. I'm looking to hopefully trade for a VEPR .308 rifle in 20 or 23 inch with the traditional front sight block and some cash dependent upon values we agree to. Squareback receiver would also be preferable but not required. Also willing to straight sell the rifle too. A trade would save me a little leg work is all. This is was one of a few Smith ARs I've had and tinkered with. Was going to be a DMR style rifle. It is truly unfired as I've never gotten around to actually shooting it after some furniture changes. I've just lost interest in it and have been longing for one of the .308 VEPRs to tinker with next. The M&P has the plastic hardcase, manuals, and flashhider and will also come with what is shown. 4x 20rnd Magpul Pmags,   Magpul Midlength MOE Handguard, Magpul K2 grip, BCM  Gunfighter Stock, Yankee Hill Machine Slant Brake, Impact Weapons Components Bipod adapter, Champion 6-9"" bipod, steel 45 degree offset iron sights.I'm asking 1550 for the rifle. But again values can be discussed in a trade as well. I am only interested in trading for the aforementioned VEPR rifle. Hit me up to chat. I live in Canton and will only do a face to face meeting.

Handgun purchase rules apply.*************  It was brought to my attention via an email that the Magpul sights are on backwards. This is correct, and intentional. I prefer to keep sights in the ready position, not folded. By having the both sights mounted in this manner, it allows both sights to slightly fold forward during concealed weapon retrieval (like from under a vehicle seat), instead of possibly getting caught on a object, that could hinder rapid retrieval. If the purchaser would prefer the sights to be mounted in the traditional manner, I'm more than happy to take the 60 seconds to change them around to any position you prefer.
