A beautiful shotgun from my uncle's estate, which was hunted every migratory season and cleaned and put in the safe. It looks pretty good for a carefully used 40-year-old bird gun.A silicone-treated soft case will go with it.I did have it listed for $500 (they're sold for $587+ at Academy), but I must sell for only $290 to pay off Christmas bills that are coming in.

This Rifle was procured from a Museum in France that was closing their doors and once belonged to the Greatest Swiss Marksman and many beleive the greatest Target shooter to ever live Conrad Staheli. I acquired this Rifle along with his competition Rifle that he used to win gold in the 1900 Paris Olympics which is also listed for sale on this sight. This Rifle is a beautiful example of old world Craftmanship and is in incredible condition for its age. It retains nearly all of its original browned finish with traces of bright vivid case coloring in protected areas. One of the greatest and most innovative features of this Rifle is the rear tang sight that is built into the receiver hidden away from view to keep the very clean look of the rifle. It can be easily flipped up when needed then lowered so it becomes flush with the rear tang. Another great feature is the profusely engraved Horn Grip Cap that is engraved with the figure of Zeus King of the Gods. Along with that the Receiver, Trigger guard, and, underlever all have very tasteful engraved scroll  work. The Wood is near perfect with sharp checkering on both the buttstock and forearm and they both retain nearly all of their original varnish. The wood appears to be semi deluxe with a small amount of figure to it.  The top of the barrel has a beautiful checkering that was no doubt done by hand given the age of the rifle and is engraved with the makers name J. Rosler Salsburg who was listed as a Gunsmith to the Royal Austrian Court from the early 1880s to mid 1890s so you know his work was top notch. The bore is absolutely incredible and would rate a conservative 9 out of 10. All of this is contained in a very petite package weighing only 6 lbs. This is an incredible opportunity to own a beautiful museum quality piece from the old time Gunsmiths of the past. It is near impossible to get this type of quality today and if you do it will cost you Triple my asking price on this fine piece. This is considered and antique and as such can ship directly to your home. I will ship to the lower 48 for $40 insured. If shipping is required I would prefer payment by PayPal but will accept money orders, cashiers checks and personal checks with a 5 day clearing time. This Rifle is truly a Museum piece and sat in one in France for the last 60 years which would explain the incredible condition. Email, Call, or Text REDACTED. Many more pictures are available upon request."

For example this Gun holds a very exciting 16+1 rounds of .40cal. Other manufacturers like STI also make high quality comparables. Para was purchased in 2015 by the major Gun manufacturer Remington so these originals are becoming harder and harder to find because owners are hanging on to them.
I purchased it brand new last year in a ""pair sale"" with another gun that I wanted that will remain nameless. I fired ONE Magazine through it and immediately after oiled and cleaned it knowing I would be selling it down the road. I was very surprised by how smooth and accurate this gun was right out of the box. I hate to let it go.
For those that are not .40 fans the magazines do fit 10mm which is a very nice defense round and the barrel could be reamed out or swapped for a 10mm barrel. 
See the Pictures below, The 3rd Picture is derectly off the Para Website and what They were Retailing them for.

Over $2,200 invested****($1,450 rifle--$600 Scope--$125 Optilock mounts and rings--$25 stainless swing swivels---$65 Bore lapping) ****I bought this gun and scope in August 2016 for this deer hunting season and went out 2 times. I finally had to admit, I am just too damn old for deer hunting anymore. ****Except for a few marks on the grip and the two scrapes/dents on the forearm, (see pics) the gun is real close to mint. Metal is 100%. Marks on the stock are from some a-hole who threw a bag of ammo on the bench at the range and it landed on the gun making it slide an inch or two across bench. The marks on the left side are small dents. The marks marks are on the right side that took the scrape and are about 1/4""x3/16 each and tip to tip about 3/4"" between the two with some dents. ****Barrel is super slick/clean: The gun was meticulously broken in. I used the Tubb Final Finish 10 bullets each of the 3 finest rounds. Cleaned barrel after every shot for 30 rounds. Cleaned barrel throughly after 30 and then after every 5 rounds after that for a total of 100 rounds. Shot approximately 50 additional rounds cleaning after every 6 to work up loads. ****Scope is VX-R 4-12 x40, 30mm tube adjustable illuminated red dot ballistic circle and drop reticle. The reticle is a little thick for punching paper but a GREAT hunting scope in low or bright light. Dot adjusts from nothing when off to very faint to bright for brighter light, I really like the scope. It is as close to mint as you can get. Have Nikon scope covers on them you can have but the smaller cap fits tight, better than nothing. ****Sako Optilock are rock solid, stainless base and blued as seen on the scope. ****The 140 Sierra Game King were shooting so well I didn’t work up any of the Berger or Hornady 140’s. I found 40.8 grains of IMR 4350 with CCI 210 primers all in front of the Sierra Game King set to a COL of 2.802” was a perfect load for me. (same hole 2 out of 3 times off a bench for 4 consecutive 3 shot groups widest spread was outside to outside 3/4” at 100 yrds.****For ""buy now price will throw in the rest of the 140grn 6.5 bullets I have. I'm guessing 150-200 or so between the Bergers, Hornady and SGK and any cases I have left over (probably about 50 Lapua I think.

I purchased this a while back from an estate of a long time collector who had this 40+ years. It is British proofed with the Broad Arrow and Crown over X1m stamp on the slide. I believe this to be a possible British SOE gun, basically their version of our OSS and were a direct action Commando unit(think Strike Back WWII). I had previously owned a Colt 1903 pocket model which had identical markings to this, and which the twin of appeared in Brunner's Colt Hammerless book 1. Those particular 1903's were a limited run sent directly to the SOE pre-WWII. This 1911 is marked near identical, however, the only way to be document it is to order a letter from Colt which I have not gotten around too. If you read about the SOE, they used a variety of weapons as guns were scarce pre-war. I may be mistaken and this could be just a regular Brit proofed pre-war Colt ordered pre-war, but the Broad Arrow stamp makes me think it is something special(again, near identical to the SOE 1903 I owned previously). The overall wear shows use and has some possible blood staining on the right side(very light pitting, can barely feel it with your finder nail). The pics show the rest, it is a fantastic Colt. Email with any questions before you bid. Thanks for looking and Happy New Year!"

The barrel is made to be quick change and this firearm is also set up to be multi-caliber (other caliber options are in the works) once they become available. One of the major benefits of the Origin 12 is its forward charging handle that does not move while you are shooting, so you won't lose a thumb or tear up a barrier. There are many different magazine options out there that can hold all the way up to 30 shells! The gas block is set up so that you can adjust the piston thrust for perfect cycling of most shells, even low brass! Metal sights are included with the purchase of this shotgun.

I have fired perhaps 300 rounds through it. Some to sight it in, some hog hunting (very effective) and some to be sure it would fire three 30 round magazines in rapid succession.

Has approximately 500 rounds through it, 0 malfunctions. Fun gun to shoot, I have just decided to stick with 5.56 guns. I have shot steel, aluminum, and brass through the gun. The bolt catch does not function as a last round hold open with stock Glock mags. The mags need extra power springs to actuate the lever efficiently. ETS glock mags seems to operate the bolt catch well though. Ready for a sig brace, or switch out the tube and go shockwave blade. Looking for $700, much more invested, but its a buyers market. No trades at this time, but it doesnt hurt to ask, may consider a nice AK."

In excellent condition, Like New with the Box and all Factory Paperwork.       Taurus Security System Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.           Model: M380IBULSS         Status: Available         Caliber: 380 Auto               Grips: Rubber         UPC: 7-25327-33097-4         Capacity: 5               Weight: 15.5 oz.         Barrel Length: 1.75""         Frame: Small               Action: DAO         Front Sight: Fixed         Order #: 2-380129UL               MSRP: $465.56         Rear Sight: Adjustable"
