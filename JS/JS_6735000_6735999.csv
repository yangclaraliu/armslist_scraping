It's black powder ammo made by UMC and it is over 100 years old or at least very close to it. As you can see in this photos the box actually looks pretty darn good with a very bright colorful label. The ammunition itself looks just about as good as 100 year ammo can. The brass cases are clean with very little dark spotting and no active corrosion. The primers look good too however I do not know if ammo this old will fire or not and can't guarantee that it will. The box does say that these cartridges are reloadable any times. You must be at least 18 to purchase this ammo. I can ship, but the buyer will have to pay to ship upfront. I did some research and these are going for $75-$100 a box on other sites. I would like to get $60/per box or $200 for all (4) boxes. I'm not interested in any trades at the moment, just cash. Text (43 Spanish) to Michael at (Six Zero One) - 573- Three Two Zero Two."

It comes with everything as it would from the factory, box plus extra backstraps (beavertail style as well), the supplied mounting plates for optics and three 15rd magazines. I also have a little ammo to go with it, which includes: - 160rds S&B 180gr FMJ (not real warm, but not terribly weak) - 20rds Sig Sauer V-Crown 180gr JHP - 20rds Federal Hyrda Shok 180gr JHP - 20rds Hornady 180gr XTP - 20rds Hornady 155gr XTP Total:  240rds of ammo I do want to sell the ammo with the gun, but I know people can be leary of buying ammo.  All of this ammo was bought after I had the gun, so it's not old stale ammo.  Plus, I'm not charging all that much or the ammo anyways (nowhere near what I paid for it at least). Like I said, the gun shoots well, I've just got other projects on my mind.  These run new at about $700 before tax at Buds.  For the G40 MOS plus the ammo I'm asking $650 firm, so that's about $100 less than what you'd pay for just the gun alone. I live outside of Danville and I'm willing to meet up with you as long as it's reasonable.  Not looking to trade. Thanks for looking!"

I'd been looking into a more easily concealable 1911-format pistol and had been reading up on the EMP4 Conceal Carry Contour and all the awards and great press it's been getting. Subsequently, being such a popular and in-demand pistol, it was literally sold out nationwide, couldn't even find them on gunbroker. So, when one popped up at an online retailer I jumped on it, and now regret the decision since I really have too many pistols already and have no real need for it. So here's the deal. I have already paid for the pistol and it's been transferred in to a local dealer. I paid $969 for it, plus the $50 transfer fee. If you will reimburse me the $1,020, I will release to you and the pistol is yours. You will still need to do the background check at the dealer, since I will not actually be taking possession of it. That's it, simple as pie. This is your chance to own the most popular, well-reviewed new gun of 2017, sold out nationwide and nearly impossible to get right now, at a very good price.**EDIT: Absolutely NO trades....

This gun was purchased from a reputable arms dealer. It was also a surplus weapon,  made in 1957, and was sitting in a warehouse for 60 years. Since I got the gun I've put 100 rounds through it,  without problem. It shoots 7.62 x 25. It's a cool round. This weapon out performs .357 mag in ballistics testing. On a dummy,  with police department Kevlar vest,  the round goes through the vest,  dummy,  and out the back of the vest. It's a fun gun to shoot, a little sporty, but not hard to hang on to because of its weight. This gun was originally built without a safety,  but in order to ship to U.S. it had to have one installed. It does work just fine. There are now reproductions of this pistol,  however,  this is an original with good serial numbers. Call or text REDACTED.  I'm pricing at what I paid for it."

It's nibix with a Nickel Boron finish to it. I'm the first owner and I would have to say there is about under 500 rounds through it with no issues to it whatsoever. Just don't know the exact amount. It gets cleaned every range trip and just overall a great fun to shoot. It has a Midwest industries mount that makes it fold in half with the red dot still attached. The red has been sighted in by GA Firing Line on Canton Rd in Marietta. It also takes glock 17 mags and here's everything I would include to it...- Magpul Angled Grip- One 33 Round Glock Mag- One 15 Round Pmag- Fieldline One Strap Range Backpack - Midwest Industries Mount To Fold Gun- Primary Arms Red Dot With 50,000hours Battery Life- Adjustable Buttstock- 1/2x28 Threaded Barrel For A SuppressorBasically it will come with the original box and I still have the boxes for all the attachments I put on it also. Honestly, it's a very nice firearm that's perfect for a backpack/truck gun that I put together and there's nothing more for me to say. I feel like I'm forgetting something but I put mostly everything about it in the discription. PLEASE RESEARCH THE RED DOT AND MOUNT THAT I PUT ON THIS FIREARM IF YOU ARE GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PRICE. IM ALSO A NICE GUY SO I DONT MIND NEGOTIATING THE PRICE BUT I WONT GO TOO LOW. Thanks for looking!

It was manufactured from 1949 to 1968. The 11-48 is a long-recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun based on the Remington Model 11. Shells are stored in a tubular magazine under the barrel. When a chambered shell is fired, the barrel and bolt recoiling together (for a distance greater than the shell length) re-cock the hammer, eject the spent shell, and feed another shell from the magazine into the action. The 11-48 was revolutionary in that it ushered in stamped steel components for a lower cost of assembly, and featured truly interchangeable parts not requiring fitting by a gunsmith, and it was reliable in the extreme. The impact of these changes can be seen on every Remington shotgun since, and is also prevalent on competitor's models. The 11-48 differs from the Model 11 in the shape of its machined steel receiver and the use of less expensive stamped steel internal parts. The new easily removable aluminum trigger housing was to be featured on its successors, the 1100 and the 11-87."

I purchased the VBOB about 3 years ago and honestly don't use it enough to justify having it. The VBOB is a great .45 1911 that shoots great and feels perfect. The round count in the weapon is very low, if I had to give a number I would say around 150-200 tops. The holster and double mag carrier are not cheap either and fit the weapon perfectly. I have one factory mag and 2 Wilson 47D mags to go with it. I am not looking to make money off this gun or expecting it to sell for what  new one does ""roughly 1800 after taxes,shipping,transfer"", however with the addition of the 2 Wilson Mags and the Kelley gun leather which are probably close to 200 alone I am not giving this away either. My price is 1625$ I am slightly interested in trades such as Beretta Silver Pigeon 20 guage or custom rifles in the 280AI caliber and I can work other items in to deal as well."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed.

Billet A2 style front site with Ruger flipup rear. 16 inch barrel 1n 556 NATO with 1-8 twist. Custom ruger flash hider and pistol grip.   Features:  The milled gas block is located at a carbine length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface. The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability. The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed. The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting. The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Includes one 30-round Magpul® PMAG® magazine."
