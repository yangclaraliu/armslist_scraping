If any of those situations sounds familiar, contact us today! We offer MN Permit to Carry & Renewal courses, as well as general firearms instruction. Our focus is on beginner and first time shooters, as well as those looking for a more personalized / custom class experience, with 1 on 1 or small group instruction.  For those new to firearms:
- Instruction is provided in a non-judgmental, no-expectations environment. We'll cover the basics and help you become comfortable and familiar with handling a firearm, even if you've never held one before. 
- We will introduce you to the basics of handgun use and provide some simple and effective training exercises to help you improve your shooting, and get comfortable with safely handling firearms.
- Our instructor is highly experienced at working with new shooters, and putting those who are uncomfortable with them at ease. As someone who didn’t hold a handgun until his mid 20’s, and knew virtually nothing about them at the time, he brings that beginner’s perspective into his teaching.
For those with experience:
- Instruction is offered in small group or 1 on 1 format. This allows us to cover the legally required basics, then transition to addressing your personal questions, or work on improving marksmanship skills, or addressing more advanced defensive firearm use and considerations.
- Firearms and defensive tactics perspective from an instructor with law enforcement, criminal extradition, VIP protection, security contractor, corporate security, and active shooter threat response experience.

Guns with the name World Challenger were made by one of two makers either Andrew Fryberg (1896 to 1910) or Meridian Fire Arms (1905 to 1915) for and were sold by Sears Roebuck & Co. So, the gun was made sometime between 1896 and 1915.The guns were designed for the ammunition of the day which was either black powder or early low pressure smokeless powder.
They were not designed for more modern high pressure smokeless powder and certainly not three inch magnum shells or steel shot.  Therefore I do not recommend shooting this gun unless you are a competent reloader who can load low pressure shells or plan on displaying it over a fireplace as I did.
 
A rare gem to survive 100 years of freedom.

I stoped by this afternoon for a preveiw and was impressed by the selection and the amount of vendors. This is a great place to trade as well as buy and sell. The cost is only $5.00 to get in and that money goes towards the Shrines operating costs such as building maintanance and expenses so that they dont have to take money that they raise for the hospital to go to these expenses. Its located between Audio Jam and Carman Dodge Jeep on the Northboud side of Rt 13 in New castle DE.

Very well built, compact 9mm concealed carry handgun. Purchased it new from Cabelas about 2 years ago. I've only taken it to the range a couple times when I first purchased it, and it probably only has between 40-60 rounds through it. I shot whatever basic range ammo the range had, and I did shoot 6-12 Speer Gold Dot +Ps through it and never had any issues at all. Kahr says to give their pistols a 200 round break-in period but I felt more than comfortable carrying it based on the range time, having so few rounds through it.With the gun, I will include the original 6 round magazine with an aftermarket pinkie extension. I can get all fingers and a very solid firing grip on the gun with this extension, love it. I'll also include a Kahr extended magazine (8 rounds, I believe), and a pocket magazine holster. Also included is a leather Jason Winnie holster. I absolutely love this holster, and soon after I purchased it and used it for a bit, I bought his holsters for my other CCH. This pistol has spent most of its life in the leather holster, so it is in great condition, experiencing little to no holster or handling wear. I'm sure there is some kind of blemish or two, so it's probably not in mint condition. Asking $350 obo. The selling price for a new one is $400. This one is in excellent condition and includes over $100 worth of extras. Please feel free to ask questions. I am not looking to trade, and I do not NEED to sell this in a hurry or anything."

COLT initially marketed the firearm as the Z40, and reportedly used it as the prototype for their first “smart gun”. Sales of the Z40 were lackluster and accompanied by the negative press from the ill-conceived “smart gun” technology, COLT cancelled the line. CZ was left in the lurch with several thousand blanks for the firearm and produced them under the CZ name as the CZ 40B. Once the stock was depleted, CZ shelved it and stopped production.
 With the legendary CZ internals, this little firearm is specifically made for the .40S&W round, and is a gem. It’s super accurate and a comfortable shooter. They’re exceedingly uncommon and worthy of addition to any CZ collection.
This CZ 40b DA/SA with safety has the same trigger and mechanism as the more familiar 75B, and can be carried cocked-and-locked, or DA. It is in very good condition and comes with one 10-round magazine. The CZ 75B .40 magazines fit, so extra 10 or 12 round magazines are easily obtainable."

The closed bolt KG-99 was the result. It is the pre-cursor to the TEC industries TEC 9. When Kelgren left Interdynamic to found Kel-Tec in 1989 Garcia continued making the gun under the TEC Industries brand as the TEC 9. The KG 99 was by all accounts a better gun as Kelgren was responsible for quality control. This is a mid 80's weapon. It comes with a rare original Interdynamic assault case which houses the pistol, 2 original PREBAN 32 round 9mm magazines, and a barrel shroud which you can hold while firing the GUN."

It's 23"" barrel has fully adjustable TruGlo rifle sights and accepts Rem Chokes (Wingmaster HD Turkey Choke included)."

Here is a link to the Eberlestock website for more product info. http://www.eberlestock.com/JP9%20Blue%20Widow.htmIncluded will a universal bow and gun carrier (Formerly known as the buttbucket/ripcord combo)I will also include a Spike Camp duffel.
