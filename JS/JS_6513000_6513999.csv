You have until 3/9/2019 at midnight Eastern time ( 10:00 PM my time in Utah ) to start the process of buying this. I am sick of people respond and not really being sincere or interested. I can keep this upper and still be really happy, don't need to sell it.
I have a 5.56 20"" upper made by Armalite. Second picture shows Armalite markings. Offered with or without bolt carrier/charging handle, will be $300.00 if you want bolt and handle. Only 250.00 without. My bolt carrier hasn't been cycled much by actual gun fire so it and it's gas rings condition-wise are basically new. It is older military style non-removable ( A2 ) carry handle type with a stainless barrel. It has the fully adjustable rear sight, brass deflector, dust cover and forward assist. It's a 1 in 7 twist. I bought it new in 2005 directly from Armalite but I only put about 20 rounds through and the bore looks super nice. I have a newer A3 replacement with a detachable carry handle that can made into a flat top so I don't really need this one any more. Overall in great condition with a couple of tiny knicks only. Looks pretty new!! I can ship it anywhere in the 48 or Alaska. The picatiny top piece pictured is yours for free. I never sighted it in proper so I took a laser bore sighter and got the iron sights on at about 20 yards to start you off, so it should be on paper at 50 or 100 yards right off the bat. You can't buy this classic A2 style new any more anywhere as far as I know. This has not been used much so it's close to new. Add $15.00 for me to send this UPS, you pay shipping."

205,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6513205,"For Sale:  Enfield No.4 MK1 project rifle, ,303 British","Fond du Lac, Appleton, Wisconsin",$ 110,"Listed On: Monday, February 27, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is NOT a fully complete rifle. It's a project/parts gun  If you aren't real familiar with these Enfields, the stock is 2 pieces. In the case of this one, someone sporterized the front wood portion and installed a black Monte Carlo buttstock. The barrel and receiver are intact. It needs a replacement bolt and a magazine. This is a good candidate for either restoring or sporterizing. I considered making a fun sporter project out of this one myself, but do not have the time right now. The bore is excellent. I test fit a magazine and bolt from another rifle just to test basic bolt operation. It operates fine, but was not fired. Once this rifle is completed it should obviously be safety inspected. This could be the base for a cheap fun shooter or hunting rifle. These look pretty nice with a Monte Carlo stock. This one would only need the front portion to match the butt. I've seen the new complete Monte Carlo stocks on fleabay for about $70. The front sight blade is loose and will need a little attention. It will never again be a numbers matching rifle, so build it to your preference and enjoy it.   This is a private local sale. Being sold in ""As Is"" condition. I'm willing to travel within about 30 miles of Fond du Lac,WI."

See pics for details. Thanks. The MSR RX22 was the joint development by three German companies: Anschütz, German Sport Guns and ESC Ulm. The goal of this cooperation was to develop and produce a highly accurate semi-automatic rifle with excellent shooting performance that is suitable for the dynamic disciplines as well as semi-auto precision shooting. The MSR RX22 offers an extremely accurate self-loading rifle platform with excellent shooting performance and exceptional reliability. This new Anschütz rifle operates on a force-locking blowback action system with a hammer lock.
The MSR RX22 barrels are manufactured to the same exacting tolerances of Anschütz' target barrels with a special button-rifling process. The barrel also features a recessed target crown. The single-stage trigger's components are hardened and finely ground to produce a fast trigger with a very consistent release. The trigger can be adjusted from 3.3 to 5.5 pounds, and it is set at 4 pounds by the factory.
The MSR RX22 was designed for ease of use for either a left- or right-handed shooter. The cocking handle can be located in any of three positions on either side of the rifle for a total of six possible cocking-handle locations. The trigger-locking safety is easily engaged by way of a large selector switch on either side of the rifle.
The MSR RX22 is available in four versions. The Desert and Black Hawk models feature a side-folding stock that is collapsible for length of pull and adjustable for cheek weld. Both rifles have Picatinny rails on the side and bottom of the foreend for attaching accessories. The Precision and Precision Black models have fixed wooden stocks and foreend components. All rifles have a full-length Picatinny rail on top for mounting the included flip-up iron sights as well as your choice of optics.
The rifles come equipped with one 10-round polymer detachable single-stack magazine, and magazines with capacities of 2, 5, 20 and 22 rounds are also available as accessory items.Has flip up sights and a case. All paperwork and accessories as well. Thanks for looking. I can accept debit/credit cards for a minimal fee as well."

It's the model with the full aluminum bedding throughout the forend, so the barrel is truly free floated and passes the dollar bill test. Tactical bolt knob installed, as well as detachable bottom metal (polymer) by Legacy Sports, which includes a 5rd magazine and a 10rd magazine. Weaver 20MOA picatinny scope mount for reaching out far.  I was banging 12"" steel at 800yds with 175gr Federal, but could not go further yet due to shooting range limitations.  This rifle loves the 168gr+rounds.  SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED. Will include the 9""-13"" bipod (Harris knockoff) and the butt cuff/cheek riser. Keeping the sling. So I've got about $950 into the rifle with the listed parts. Asking $750 to fund another project. Can send better pics upon request, and following contact with a serious buyer. Rifle is pristine and has been kept in a Pelican case. Will meet at local FFL in Palmdale for transfer. Thanks, Tim"

Built by Mauser for the German Army in 1945, near the end of WWII. It was accepted by the Germans and stamped with at least 4 Waffenamts. After the war it was sent to Czechoslovakia and had a post war stock put on it (as indicated by the finger grips). Around 1947 it was sold to the Israeli’s and the Star of David was stamped on it. Most German K98’s received by the Israeli’s had the Waffenamts ground off. However, this rifle has at least 4 remaining Waffenamts (see pictures). In 1957 it was rebarreled to 7.62. The barrel and stock was stamped with “7.62”. Eventually this rifle was sold to Ecuador and later imported to the United States by Century Arms (small import stamp on barrel – see pictures). Beginning in 1968, firearms imported into the United States had to have an import stamp. It is plausible that this rifle was used during the Six Day War in June 1967 between Israel and Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Of course there is no way to prove this, but circumstantial evidence suggests it. Rifle comes with genuine, period correct Israeli sling and Israeli bayonet. The bayonet was designed for the K98 but is not original to this particular rifle. The bayonet does not fit very well on this rifle, but I’ve never tried to force it on. It’s been a safe queen for as long as I’ve owned it. Due to its rich history, I’ve never tried to shoot it. I know everyone says their rifle is rare, but this one genuinely is. There are not many Israeli Mausers in the market and very few Israeli K98 Mausers still has Waffenamts remaining on the rifle. Plus, this rifle comes with Israeli sling and bayonet. I will ship to C&R holders (you need to provide a copy with your payment) or I will ship to your FFL. Shipping is an additional $35 to the final bidding amount."
