Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.Model: Solo CarryCaliber: 9MMBarrel Length: 2.7""Weight:17ozsSights: 3 DotFinish: Duo ToneGrips: SynthetricCapacity 6 +1MSRP: $924"

It has never been fired as it has been sitting in a case in my gun cabinet.  I added a 20 MOA rail and a Limb Saver butt pad.  I also bought a 5 round magazine so I comes with both a 3 round and 5 round magazine.  Its a beauty and would make an excellent life long shooter for you.  You can find a lesser Tikka that is blue barreled or with a synthetic stock, but I believe this rifle is the best you could find for my asking price.  The barrel is a cold hammer-forged Sako barrel of highest-grade stainless steel or Cr-Mo alloy. It is free-floating in models with wooden stock. The barrel is fastened to the receiver by a sturdy thread for safety and accuracy. It is hand-crowned, as a good and even muzzle crown is essential for accuracy.The steel trigger has vertical grooves for added grip, even when wearing gloves. It is easily adjustable through the magazine well from 1 to 2 kg (2 to 4 lbs).

Shoots incredibly tight groups at any distance you can take it out to. Only reason I am selling is because where I live now just doesnt have enough range space to utilize it to its fullest capabilities. I have put in a few aftermarket upgrades as follows:RPR Aluminum trigger shoe - $30 (Although I do not use it. Once I got it and put it on I realized I preferred the one it came stock with)RPR Titanium Bolt Shroud - $50 (Looks and performs exponentially better than the plastic one it comes with out of the box)RPR Titanium Fluted Bolt Knob - $25 (Matched the titatium bolt)I also added a muzzle brake to the end of it as well. I still have all of the original hardward as well as the original box and all original paperwork. Everything else comes stock from the manufacturer. I am also selling the 5 lock, Heavy Duty hard case that I keep the rifle in. I have already molded and cut the foam to fit the rifle perfectly and I would have no need to separate the two. This case is the best. Airtight, excellent handle for carrying, 5 latches that all have locks on them.This rifle has less than 80 rounds through it. I have tracked and charted every round that has been shot through it and it has exceeded my expectations. Whoever gets this will be ecstatic especially with warmer weather coming up and more shooting days in future.Overall, beautiful rifle, incredible shooter, comes with great extras and a low round count!

I had a friend of mine who is test the gun out and tell me some info.I have fo sale one 28"" choked, ribbed Beretta Silver Mallard AL 390 12 gauge MADE IN ITALY. The trigger is gold colored. If was inherited and I have no use for it. The previous owner was not a shotgun enthusiast and he never mentioned it nor do I remember him going to a range with it. He liked handguns. On that note, the gun is almost in perfect condition except for the stock which has a couple of scratches in it. My friend told me thought the gun was never used. It is tight and smooth and with the exception of the stock scratches, looks as if it has just sat in its gun case for years. It has a 28"" barrel, my friend said that it was choked but it also has three additional chokes, a Beretta cleaning kit and the original manual, blue plastic manual case and a green sick sight (sort of glows). It holds 2+1 shells. Included is a aluminum Target Zone case which is in ok condition however I do not know the combo so it will be left open. I am sure there is a way to change it. The case is included for free so if you don't like its condition, not rough by any means but not perfect you don't have to take it but the price will not change. I will ship it in that case regardless.I was offered a decent price for it at a local gun show but the dealer told the sales person he ran out of cas right in the middle of the paperwork! UG! I had many people stop and ask about it but only tire kickers.I located some info on the Beretta Website using the serial number-This shotgun was manufactured in 1996ish Exact Model # AST39057  Product Description 390FLD 12/26/3 MC3 SILVR.Hope that helps!! I will include that printed copy with the sale.I am a retired Police Sergeant and prefer to sell face to face. I will not deal with scammers nor will I ship it to you in the State of Florida  if I think something is suspicious. It will be shipped to a dealer first! I will follow all federal and state laws."
