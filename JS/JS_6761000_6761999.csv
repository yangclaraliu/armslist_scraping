Has a free float rail, fab defense buttstock, 16"" barrel. I also recently put an Ares Armor adjustable compensator on here. Now it feels like shooting a .22lr and sounds like a .308. Also has binary trigger from franklin armory. Rifles with these triggers have three position safety selectors, safe, semi, and binary mode. In binary mode the trigger will shoot on the pull of the trigger, and shoot on the release, making for extremely fast and controllable strings of fire. This is literally as close to fully auto as you can legally get without an ATF tax stamp.https://www.franklinarmory.com Rifle itself is worth about $1900 plus scope, and case i have for it is about $300Im going to continue upgrading these parts so if you want it, the trade value is just going to continue going up as new parts are installed. Next upgrade is either going to be a nickel boron or titanium nitride bolt carrier group and a new pistol grip. And after that it will be a new barrel, followed by some back up irons from troy and a better optic with a flip magnifier, cerakote, pressure switch light/laser. When its all said and done, this rifle will probably be around $3000-$4000 in value. No hurry to part with this. It is a great rifle.Im open to considering any trade. Worst ill do is say no. Mostly I am a fan of pistols."

These are great shooting pistols and were introduced in the early 1990’s. The P7M10, like the 9mm P7 models, is a fixed barrel, gas delayed, striker fired blowback pistol. They are of superb quality and craftsmanship. In my opinion, the P7 series pistols are the finest handguns HK ever built in their 50-year history. Accuracy is excellent, due to the 4” fixed barrel and the low bore axis makes them point very naturally. The P7M10 is the model that was brought onto the market for the then-new 40S&W cartridge. As the name would suggest, the magazine holds 10 rounds. In typical HK fashion, it was built to very high standards of excellence. This particular example was made in West Germany in 1992. It has the factory nickel finish and is in outstanding condition inside and out with a mint bore. I’ve owned the gun since 2008. I don’t shoot much 40S&W, so it was shot less than 200 rounds by me. It was perfectly reliable with minimal recoil. I have no idea how much it was shot prior to me owning it. Judging from the great condition, I would guess not too much. Both the steel and the grips are like new, This is perfect for the Heckler & Koch collector or German pistol collector. It’s also perfect for someone who wants a great shooting pistol for the range. This HK will last a lifetime. Its built like a tank. It comes as shown with no box or papers and one magazine. These guns are getting harder and harder to find, especially in this condition. Value has gone up on these over the years and will continue to, so buy for now and the future. I ship everything Fedex 2-day from an FFL."

It has the 16.5” heavy barrel. If you are unfamiliar with the VEPR, they are Russian built by Molot. Molot builds the heavy RPK machine guns which is what this is. It has the same extra heavy reinforced receiver and heavy profile barrel as the RPK, but it is chambered in 7.62x39 and has the shorter barrel. The thick barrel is cold hammer forged, chrome lined, and has a muzzle nut over the threads to protect them.  The heavier barrel aids in heat dissipation as well as makes it more accurate. The wood on this is the more beautiful grade that came on the more expensive ones. The VEPR is the Cadillac of the AK world and has a nice finish. It will come with both a 5 and a 10 round magazine, cleaning rod, cleaning kit, box, and paperwork.
If someone were looking to convert this to pistol grip configuration, all you would have to do is change out the buttstock and install a traditional stock and pistol grip. You do not have to move the trigger group and guard like on the Saiga’s. Everything is already in place.
This is not one of the less expensive ones that were imported with the crappy wood. I am asking for $775 for this beauty. You can call or text me at 210-seven 22-zero six 33. If the ad is still up, I still have it."

It has the 20.5” heavy fluted barrel. Molot builds the heavy RPK machine guns which is what this is. It has the same extra heavy reinforced receiver and heavy profile barrel as the RPK, but it is chambered in 5.45x39 and has the fluted barrel. The thick fluted barrel is cold hammer forged, chrome lined, and has a muzzle nut over the threads to protect them. The fluting not only reduces weight, but helps to dissipate heat quicker, and also makes the barrel more rigid for increased accuracy. The wood on this is the more beautiful grade that came on the more expensive ones. The VEPR is the Cadillac of the AK world and has a nice finish. It will come with two 5 and two 10 round magazines (total of 4 magazines), cleaning rod, box, and paperwork.
This is not one of the less expensive ones that were imported with the crappy wood. I am asking for $850 dollars for this banned beauty. I am not looking for any trades. You can call or text me at 210-seven 22-zero six 33. If this ad is still up, I still have it."

This gun has REAL ENGRAVING not that fake engraving you see on production revolvers. This gun I believe to be unfired and it has a Mint Bore. This gun came to me out of a large gun collection and as you can see the gun is super pretty. I see no issues with the mechanics of this gun and as you can see the gun has a REAL firing pin on the hammer and NO side plate lock. The gun is both double and single action and the trigger pull in both modes is typical S&W, smooth with a crisp release. The gun is not perfect as it has some normal marks/blemishes from being around since the late 1980's or early 1990's when it was made. The gun has P018D on the bottom of the frame in front of the trigger guard, not sure what that means?? It may be the marking of the engraver??? There were no other markings on the gun other then the factory stampings you see. This gun is stunning and ready to go!!! The model 27 is the top of the line S&W .357 Mag Revolver and this one is special for sure and will be the envy of all who you let handle it!!!"

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.
