The wear on the slide is the only cosmetic issue, as it was holstered in a Kydex rig, and it has left it's marks on the slide. If you look at the pictures, you will see no wear marks on the barrel, because it really has not been shot enough to be broken in yet. The gun comes in the original Glock box with all three magazines, speed loader, lock, papers, etc. Great deal for someone wanting to do competition shooting.

Increasing your first hit ratio and improving your time on target. H.U.D. stands for heads up display. Years of research have come to this point creating the most advanced reticle in the world. Everything you see is designed out of necessity solving the problems on hand. Targets don’t always stay still. They are there one second gone the next. Wind comes and goes changing direction. Sometimes there is no time to do the math or look at a data book. ACSS ® H.U.D. deals with reality of fast on the fly shots to complete firing solutions. The 4-14XFFP is very fast at 4X and very accurate at 14X remaining true in all magnifications. B.D.C./Auto rangeThe bullet drop compensation is correlated with Auto Range. Once your target fits on the proper slot the reticle ranges and BDC in one aiming point increasing effectiveness by reducing your time on target. No need to run data and turn turrets. The Auto range feature is set to range at all angles and even while moving! Wrong range estimation is the number one reason shots are missed!Auto WindWind is always a factor in any long range shot and the number two reason shots are missed. The ACSS® H.U.D. includes 5-10 mph wind holds at each range. This increases time on target again by not having to run or look at data.Auto LeadsA revolutionary featuring dealing with the most difficult targets Movers! A moving target is much harder to engage.

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine."
