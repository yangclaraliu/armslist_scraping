Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and another 9mm stripped lower and cash or??  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

The 4 means it is manufactured with alloy frame (as opposed to 5 which would mean a stainless steel frame), the 3 signifies the type of action, and the 9 is for the cartridge (9x19) Got blued steel finish, original wood grips.

Many years ago I owned Kimbers and Springfield 1911s but ended up selling them basically because I'm just not a huge fan of 1911 styled guns. So recently I read some pretty decent reviews about ATI 1911s. So I found one and bought it because I wasn't looking to invest $1000 in gun I wasn't sure I wanted to keep. Although the 1911 weapon system is excellent it's just not my preferred pistol. So I'm selling this ATI. I've fired about 100 rounds with zero problems. Included is a very nice bladtech ITW kydex holster, 150+ rounds of wolf ammo, and 3 mags. *** about the mags, I bought 2 el cheapo mags, the silver ones. They work, however they will not seat into the gun unless you press the mag release. They will drop free though. I've tried sig, kimber, and I think magtech mags in it and they all go in with no problem. Asking $575 obo. Text is probably best however I will answer emails. I work midnights so text whenever and I'll get back to you asap. 33zero-68seven-341three."

Today, there’s a plethora of small handguns chambered in .380 ACP. There are so many that it’s easy to forget that Diamondback Firearms LLC of Cocoa, Florida, has been setting the pace for .380’s since 2009, when it was first introduced as a revolutionary DB380 micro-compact semi-automatic pistol. The polymer-framed DB380 was well ahead of its time, featuring the patented ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure real windage-adjustable sights. The DB380 continues to set the standard for small, concealable handguns. The steel trigger with dual connection bars allows for a crisp, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a slide and barrel, designed to be strong for more durability with less felt recoil. The absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
