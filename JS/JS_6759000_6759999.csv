The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. Its open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. The 92 FS pistol is the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in Italy.

The frame accepts Glock17  9mm slides, as well as the Glock 40 caliber slide. The Smith and Wesson 40cal slide is also compatible with the Sig357 barrel configuration, which essentially gives you 3 different calibers to choose from. Unlike the Glock, this frame includes a uniquely extended beaver-tail, and most notably a super tactical 1911 pistol grip rather than the standard Glock styled pistol grip.

The gun has an original 16"" barrel and is semi-automatic. I bought it for PPC in USPSA and then picked up an MPX instead so I'm selling this one on. Just ran it this past weekend without a hitch. No jams, runs like a top. I had many ""go fast"" parts added, these are as follows. StormWerks Tac Rail Title II Faux Suppressor with integrated barrel nut Simmons Red Dot Sight C3junkie Extended Magazine Release JJ Customs Ambidextrous Cocking handle Trigger Job by the famed Bill SpringfieldThroated the barrel Replaced all the springs in the gun with new parts Polished the feed ramp for feeding reliability. The parts and gunsmithing work along is over $500, but in my opinion the look and how the gun runs was worth it.  The gun will come with five (5) 32 round stick magazines, two (2) 25 round stick magazines, a three magazine carry bandolier, and a green web sling. Spare and original parts will also be included, these are: Original cocking knob, magazine catch, various springs, and original barrel nut.  The rifle was very reliable in my service and I never had much trouble out of it. My asking price is $1050"

These should not be confused with the Sterling Arms X-Caliber pistols made in Lockport, NY. Ithaca manufactured the barrels for those pistols and are so marked. These pistols features a unique firing pin which detonates both rimfire and centerfire cartridges. From the information I garnered, and according to S.P. Fjestad, author of the ""Blue Book of Gun Values"", only about 300 units were ever produced. All units were released in .22 caliber and production ceased due to unsolvable production issues. The specimens shown are marked Ithaca, in New-in-Box condition and UNASSEMBLED as they came from the factory. The pistols were made in two variants, one with Williams iron sights and the other outfitted with a Weaver rail. My understanding is that the Weaver rail variant is rarer. Other features are 10"" barrels, Goncalo Alves wood stocks, hardware, and all original serialized owner's manuals ans boxes. Purchaser will also receive an original 1989 Ithaca catalogue listing the pistols. Much rarer than the Ruger Hawkeye, This is an opportunity to at-once own both variants released from the Ithaca factory in pristine condition. A must-have for any collector of the Ithaca brand or colectors of single-shot handguns. Serious inquiries only. Purchaser assumes all shipping, handling and insurance costs."

I am not interested in trading for anything other than a factory S&W magazine (no Promags, etc.).I'm located in Brentwood and will travel a reasonable distance to meet you. Contact me through Armslist and we can exchange phone numbers."

This is a large frame (original Vaquero), not the current ""New Vaquero"" model. The large frame originals are capable of ""Ruger only"" loads. It's the blued model with Ruger's faux case hardened frame. The revolver exhibits a slight turn line on the cylinder from handling but has not been fired outside of the Ruger factory. The model number is 00511 and the catalog number is BNVBH-453. Now the backstory on the rare part....Ruger transitioned from the original Vaquero to the new Vaquero late 2004 early 2005 timeframe and stopped making the originals. Thus gun was made in April of 2010 (based on the spent shell casing that came with it from the factory), 5 years after the end of production and 5 years after Ruger stopped the faux case hardening on their blued single actions. Furthermore, the notorious Ruger warning label on the barrel was much smaller and on the underside of the barrel. Prior examples were larger and on the side of the barrel. After acquiring, I called Ruger to verify the manufacter date. Between that and the model/catalog number (which were unique to this particular gun), I was able to find out through a few searches this was one of Ruger's parts clean up releases that were only sold through Davidson's, and that there were likely less than 200 or so made. The late production alone makes it a Ruger collector's object of desire, but the barrel warning label variation puts it over the top. If interested, feel free to reply with your number. I'd be happy to text additional pictures, including the factory label showing model/catalog as well as the dated spent casing. Price is $500"

See description below. Sale must occur in St. Pete. Text REDACTED.The Overwatch Precision Defensive Applications Trigger (DAT) is a flat-faced, direct drop-in replacement for your GLOCK OEM trigger. Each trigger shoe and trigger safety tab is machined in the USA out of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, and affixed to an NP3 plated, Gen 3 OEM trigger bar by 316 Stainless Steel coiled spring pins. The trigger shoe and safety tab are both Type III hard coat anodized to MIL-A-8625 standard.
The broad, flat face of the trigger allows a uniquely self-correcting, straight rearward press. Trigger reach is shortened by 0.24"", making this an ideal option for smaller statured shooters. Pre-travel has been reduced as much as possible without compromising firearm safety features, resulting in a clean, crisp break, and reduced overtravel. Robar's NP3 plating provides virtually impermeable corrosion resistance and smooth, grit-free operation.
End Result: This trigger is a tank. A sexy tank, and it comes in colors.
Important Notes:
In case you were wondering, Gen 3 trigger bars are completely functional and safe in Gen 4 weapons.
Also, our lawyer says that this should be installed by a qualified gunsmith."

The stock is definitely military (Greek maybe?) and is stamped with a serial number. I'm also throwing in a very nice reproduction bayonet that came with the rifle. I prefer to sell the rifle but will listen to trade offers, especially those involving other military surplus rifles.

Has a 4 inch barrel, all matching numbers, lanyard loop, original grips, original finish has holster wear, some patina, but over all pretty good. Based on serial number and features,I believe the gun to have been made around 1942. Underneath the matching grips, ""WA"" and ""1942"" have been carved. Grips have some wear. I believe this revolver was part of some military or police contract given the carvings and loop. The gun is in very good shape, with strong bore and rifling, however, there are some mechanical issues that require work. The cylinder timing is OK, however should be checked. The hammer falls and drops, but the arm doesn't always move the cylinder. Shouldn't be a hard or expensive fix for a gunsmith. I don't mind sending more pictures. Please include a phone number in your first email. I'm not keen on trades, but I will entertain offers of  CZ75's, GI spec 1911's, newer 38 revolvers, or military type handguns."

Do some research on PWS and you will find nothing but stellar reviews. The long stroke piston system uses the best of both worlds between the AK and AR platforms and gives you a real sewing machine of a rifle. I have over 8 years of tactical experience and this is by far the best system I have used. The Upper is used with approximately 2000 rounds through it. I have never had to do a single corrective action drill on it and it is in excellent condition. I am selling to upgrade to a PWS MK116 Mod 2. Upper has a Matte Black duracoat finish complete with the proprietary bolt carrier and piston. Also has BCG Charging handle and PWS Flash hider. Email me for further details. $700

These EOTech red dot sights combine the high-accuracy optics of the EOTech EXPS2-2 Red Dot Sight and the zoom-enhancing properties of the EOTech G33 Red Dot Magnifier into a single potent reflex sight. The heart of the red dot sight is the EXPS2-2, a highly compact, tactically-oriented red dot sight that features a large ring reticle with two 1-MOA aiming dots. The relex portion of the EOTech HHS2 Holographic Hybrid Reflex Sight w/G33 Magnifier features true two-eyes-open aiming, allowing you to get a full picture of the battlefield while maintaining precision accuaracy, and it's 7mm raised base allows you to use iron sights even with the red dot sight equipped. EOTech has equipped the EXPS2-2 red dot sight with easy to adjust side illumination buttons, and it's transversely mounted 123 lithium battery will rarely need replacement. The EOTech Holographic EXPS2-2 Hybrid Magnified Red Dot Sight is also highly versatile, capable of mounting to your weapon with the integrated locking quick detach lever. The EOTech HHS-II Holographic Hybrid Magnified Reflex Sight evolves beyond the original red dot sight when you attach the included G33 magnifier. Shorter and lighter than it's previous incarnation (the EOTech G23), the EOTech G33 3.25x Red Dot Magnifier is a powerful optic that will boost the power of your red dot sight by 3.25x, enough to add long-range accuracy to the list of features on your reflex sight. Each of the red dot sight accessories features tool-free azimuth adjustment and a wide field of view that won't diminish the incredibly fast target acquisition capabilities of the EXPS2-2. An easy to adjust diopter allows for precise focus with the EOTech HHS-2 Hybrid Red Dot Scope w/ G33 Magnifier, no matter the target. What's more, these EOTech red dot sight accessories allow you to switch between 3.25x magnification and 1x magnification at will with the included Switch to Side (STS) mount, which will flip the magnifier to the side of your weapon and out of the way with a single motion, adding even more versaility to your firearm. When you want to combine the precise tactical advantage conferred by the EOTech EXPS series with the long-range firepower of a scope, choose the EOTech HHS-II Hybrid Holographic Sight II with EXPS2-2 Sight and G33 Magnifier."

As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot….

The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run… This receiver was made by Underwood Elliot Fisher ( serial number 2404xxx ) during WWII and was sent to Winchester as part of the "" lateral support "" program. Evidence of this is the bevel marking of WTA.  This I believe that this rifle was assembled very late in the war as many parts are late war Winchester ( Cartouched W marked M2 stock, 4 rivet handguard , Hemphill rear adjustable sight, flip safety, M2 mag catch, and C marked front band.) The rifle is in excellent condition with most, if not all, parts being Winchester.NOT AN IMPORT . $1395.  Questions welcome. FFL to FFL outside Oklahoma."
