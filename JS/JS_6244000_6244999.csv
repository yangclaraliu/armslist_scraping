Other than that it has not been handled. Has NEVER cut anything. And hasn't been played with. I just got this knife in a couple days ago...This is sort of a hard combo to come by.  This Microtech Combat Troodon features mat black handle. As well as the trigger (button) and glass breaker.  The blade is a double edge with half sarations on each side.  Blade is also black to match. And made of elmax steel ! This knife runs about $480.  I will sell or trade it depending on what you have. Cash may be added on either end depending on the trade offered. I do NOT need to sell this. But will sell ($470 cash firm) or trade up or down depending on what you have."

I purchased it new from Rocky Mountain Shooters Supply in Fort Collins approximately 6 years ago. I've made a couple minor furniture changes and a younger, dumber me gave it a GI rattlecan 'makeover'.Rifle includes all original furniture with the following installed: Pro Mag pistol grip, UTG drop in quad rail, GG&G single point sling back plate, Magpul AFG (Angled Foregrip), and a Truglo red dot (needs a fresh battery). It also comes with a desert ATACS single point sling. No case/bag will be included.Most of the furniture/optic is on the lower end, but this is a trusted and reliable Mil-spec platform to build on. Buffer tube threads are a little jacked up from me having a brain fart while disassembling, but it only affects the last 1/8 - 1/4 turn.  I've never touched the barrel nut or gas system on this rifle, all torque specifications and roll pins are still in place from factory.I have removed the buffer tube castle nut to swap back plates. Some of the indentations are not perfectly square, it was not tightened using a torque wrench, and it is not currently staked.Trigger is not bad for Mil-spec, I like it better than the one that came with the Palmetto State Armory lower parts kit that I put in my new AR15.I'm selling it because I finally got around to building my 'dream AR15', and I'm about to start university so I'm pinching pennies where I can.  Transfer will be be made in accordance with Colorado state law to include cancellation of the transfer if myself or the FFL suspects a potential strawman sale. No magazines will be included with the firearm since all mine are 'grandfathered' under everyone's favorite law. Buyer must cover background check fee. Feel free to suggest a FFL if you are interested, I'm not familiar with any in the area. I'm in no hurry to sell, but I'm also not dead set on the price. I've had a hard time gauging a fair price since the sport version is mainly what you see for sale. Text (720) 561-146seven or e-mail through Armslist. Cash sale only."

Fired 120 rounds through it and then began customization process. Added a genuine Russian Tula triangle folding stock (rolled edges, ribbed buttplate). Had my trust info laser engraved and then subsequently stripped it down and sent it off to Area 15 in Mesa, AZ for sandblasting and Tactical Gray Cerakote application. Reassembled with new Arsenal OEM hardware including 4.5mm stock hinge pin, top cover hing pine and detent/spring, trigger pins, etc., as well as new Tapco G2 trigger and Krebs Custom retainer. Also polished contact points on the bolt for smoother action. Has not been fired since the reassembly with new parts. New this gun costs $1,299. Triangle stock was $110, Tapco trigger was $28, Krebs retainer was $12, and Cerakoting was $180; not to mention the replacement hardware from K-var. I've since lost interest and my mind has been made up for a while that I just want to sell it. Recognizing that my trust info is laser-engraved onto the ejection port side of the receiver, I'm discounting the gun to account for that. I've already looked into numerous options for having it removed to make it more sellable - including milling it off and touching it up, etc., but ultimately this should be the buyer's decision on how they want it to be removed - because there are pros and cons to each option. Included in the sale are the original box, manual, accessories, a spare Circle ((10)) black polymer, 30-round magazine (cost $45), and an Arsenal Bulgarian Krink booster/flash hider (cost $89) for when you finally get your tax stamp back.

Rifle was made in 1909 and features original 10-09 barrel. All parts are correct to include straight bolt which is rare because virtually all rifles that went through arsenal were given new barrels and bent bolts. Finish is very nice hand burnished bluing from Springfield, the stock Proof stamped and appears to have an armory repair of a former crack on the forearm and an original M1907 sling marked 1918. Here's where the unknowns start, the marine corps never specifically marked it's rifles however there are clues. This rifle has an armory drilled hatcher hole drilled on the receiver as well as a high globe front sight cover, both common in Corps rifles. I can answer any other specific questions, please do you're research on original m1903's before offering a mossberg 500 with a few dozen laser pointers taped to it, thanks."
