Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth melted edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.  One seven-round, single-column magazine is provided with each LC9 pistol. The magazine’s standard flat floorplate aids concealability, while the provided finger grip extension floorplate offers an option to shooters who prefer a longer grip surface with more hand-to-pistol contact. Firearm Features The Ruger LC9 is compact and just slightly larger (less than 1 inch in both height and length) than the popular LCP. Its rugged construction consists of a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and a black, one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame. Ruger’s dovetailed, high visibility 3-dot sight system on the LC9 contains a windage-adjustable rear sight and a fixed front sight. Safety features include an internal lock, manual safety, magazine safety and a loaded chamber indicator which provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.SPECIFICATIONS Catalog Number: LC9Model Number: 3200Caliber: 9mm LugerCapacity: 7+1Barrel Length (inches): 3.12Barrel Material: Alloy SteelBarrel Finish: BluedSlide Material: Through-Hardened Alloy SteelSlide Finish: BluedGrip Frame: Black High Performance Glass-Filled NylonMA Approved: NoCA Approved: No WHATS IN THE BOX Ruger LC9 Pistol7-Round MagazineGun LockInternal Lock KeyInstruction Manual  NC RESIDENTS ADD 6.75% SALES TAX ADD 3% FOR CREDIT CARD FEE USPS MONEY ORDER SAME AS CASH 10% RESTOCKING FEE WILL SHIP TO FFL ONLY $25.00 SHIPPING NC RESIDENTS MUST HAVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT OR PURCHASE PERMIT FOR HAND GUNS CALL OR TEXT : REDACTED Email : REDACTED"

Believe it has heavier than norm stampped receiver. Shoots well, reliable. Has zeroed fine. Have had it for a while, but am looking at consolidating calibers and platforms. So looking at getting rid of some of the gear and long guns that I have. Looking to either sell or trade, though trade would be more interest if the gun is something that is interesting or more useful to me. More so if it is a platform I am consolidating to. Though, may consider another AK with a fixed stock likely not top of my list. Have extra mags that can be added for added cash or trade. As well as a Romanian  drum, not Korean junk. Cash price is $800. Low ball offers, shady offers, anything that is not coherent, or just morons will be ignored as will anyone wanting it for whatever they ""could"" have bought it for 20 years ago, let me know when you get the timemachine up and running, otherwise please quit the whinning."

This rifle includes the factory cold hammer forged and chrome lined Bulgarian military barrel that the original rifle would have come with. I recently had the rifle KG Gunkoted by Mad Pig Customs from Connecticut and have yet to shoot it since. It includes 5 Bulgarian Circle 21 and Circle 10 magazines as well as the stock stored cleaning kit. If I can find it, I will also include a Tapco sight adjuster tool.
The rifle for the most part is as I received it, however I have upgraded the trigger to the ALG Defense AKT trigger and have also swapped out the sheppherds hook retainer for a Red Star Arms retaining plate."

The most accurate out of the box 9mm you can buy.  It has about 550 rounds through it, I shot it for the 500 “break in” rounds, then shot another box through it, and put it in my safe, it smoothed out wonderfully and is ready to go.  
This is the harder to find non-decocker model so it has the much better trigger and ability to be improved if you choose to have it worked on since it only has a safety.  
This thing is an IDPA monster, it is like shooting a lay z boy recliner, no recoil, stays on target and is FAST. 
Seriously one of the best guns I’ve ever shot. 
I’m funding some other rifle projects otherwise I would keep this thing, and I will miss it as these things are pretty hard to come across."

It's really a  neat trigger. When in single action it is fully cocked un like a glock where it would be kinda half cocked. So it has a light trigger pull. This is a very unique 45.  There is a small chip in the guide rod but it does not affect performance whatsoever.  I called Taurus and it's five dollars for them to send a new one.

Gun comes with vortex viper HS-LR 4-16x 50 scope model # VHS-4307-LR. Comes with a Caldwell 13"" bipod and soft cheek rest/ ammo holder. I also have leupold rings and bases that come with it and it currently has a 20 Moa base and a different set of mounting rings on it so you can switch it out and set it up any way you like. Guns in absolutely mint condition. I have all receipts for the gun, accessories and scope. The scope has a lifetime warranty on it which even covers abuse from user. Gun was purchased new in summer 2016.  I set it up thinking I wanted to get into long range shooting but also hoped to use the gun for hunting whitetails. As I found out it's a great long range gun but not what I wanted for deer hunting in northern Minnesota. So far I have 87 rounds down range. It shoots absolutely great. Sub moa all day long even with inexpensive Remington core lokt ammo. It shoots everything I have tried great and I really like the hornady eld-x ammo for the price. I have 3-4 boxes of HSM/Berger ammunition and 1box of hornady eld-x ammo that go with it. I have not tried the HSM/ Berger ammo but expect it will perform great. The gun has been properly and meticulously broken in. The barrel was epoxy bedded by a gunsmith and is removable. I am willing to separate the scope and rifle or would be willing to trade the gun for a nice AR-10 SPR TYPE RIFLE. If you have any questions please call or text me at REDACTED. Will not ship but I am willing to meet. Thanks for looking. Asking $900.00 for the package. It is basically brand new.

Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes."

Introduced by the U.S. Army in 1873, this cartridge was first known as the .45 Government. As it made its way into commercially produced firearms the name .45-70 appeared, because it was loaded with a 70 grain blackpowder charge with 405 and 500 grain bullets. Virtually all rifle making companies of the late 19th century chambered their single shots and lever actions for the .45-70. As those companies and their rifles faded away, the .45-70's popularity did not. Factory .45-70 ammunition has been cataloged continuously since 1873 but never in the variety of loadings available now, in the 21st century. They range from 405 grain lead bullet, low-velocity loads for deer hunting and target shooting to high-velocity 300 to 400 grain jacketed bullet ones meant for large game. The Model H010B .45-70 can handle them all. Its receiver is brass fitted with a 22 in octagon barrel underneath and a tubular magazine of four-round capacity. Its pistol-grip buttstock and steel-capped forend are crafted of beautiful American walnut and cut with checkering to provide a sure grip. The buttstock wears a brass plate. The model H010B will be factory issued with fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear peep sight with blade front. Because the receiver is drilled and tapped, scope mounting is an easy option.

I acquired this one fairly recently, but after taking stock of where I'm at, I just don't see myself actually using this any time soon. Here's the price breakdown of what you're getting and the costs you'd normally pay for each:-New Remington 700 Mountain Rifle barreled action in 7mm-08Rem w/ ADL box mag and spring, trigger guard, etc. ~ $550-Custom bolt work work done by Carl Kampfeld (spiral fluting w/ lightened bolt handle) of Kampfeld Customs ~ $150-Talley 30mm low Light-Weight rings/bases - $50-Timney 510 trigger at about 2# or so - $130-Magpul Hinter stock with Magpul DBM (painted by prior owner) ~ $300-One box (20rnds) Nosler Ballistic Tip 140gr ammo - $30I had high hopes of having a relatively lightweight stalking rifle in a light recoiling but still effective caliber, but I won't be doing much hunting of that type for a few years, most likely. The rifle will just be sitting in my safe during that time, aside from an occassional short range trip. I've not shot it myself, but the prior owner stated it's unfired, and it looks to be true.Aside from some minor tuning of the trigger, mounting a 30mm scope of your choosing, and checking all screws/bolts for proper torque, this is a ready to roll rifle.
