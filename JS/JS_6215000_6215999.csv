197,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6215197,For Sale:  Soviet 1PN58 Night vision scope. 3.5x. Partially working,"Hilliard, Columbus, Ohio",$ 250,"Listed On: Saturday, December 31, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a 1PN58 Night vision scope.  This optic was made in the early 1980s and it believed to be an early model because it shares a few similar parts to its predecessor the 1PN34 such has the ridged power dial.  The optic has been converted to accept modern US batteries and will come with a basically new set.  Currently, the scope will run for 2-3 seconds before the auto-shut off kicks in.  This happens when too much light enters the optic so the intensifier tube is not damaged.  It will still do this in a dark room with the daylight filter on so a new tube may be needed.  The current cam is designated for the SVD though it will work fine with other 54r rifle with a similar barrel profile or you can adapt to shooting other calibers with it.  It also comes with a drop case.
 If you are not familiar with Soviet optics or this optic in particular I recommend doing some research on it first however, if you have any questions before buying I will be happy to answer them.   Price is $250.  I will entertain some trades.  Mostely interested in Soviet firearms or ammo.  Looking for an M1895 with accessories and light or no import marks"

MAS 1936/ Mle 1936/ FRENCH M36. FRENCH MILITARY BOLT ACTION RIFLE, Caliber 7.5 mm French (M1929 cartridge), approx. 2700 feet per second muzzle velocity, effective range 400 meters with the issue iron sights. 5 round internal magazine loaded from the top individually or with charger clips. Overall length 40.1”, barrel length 22.6”, unloaded weight 8.29 lb. Produced by French government-owned Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS).
HISTORY: The MAS 1936 was successor to the French Lebel and Mannlicher-Berthier rifles of WWI through the 1930’s. Because of the peculiar rim and body shape of the Lebel cartridge, which made feeding difficult in automatic weapons, a modern rimless cartridge, the M1924, was developed, then modified resulting in the M1929 cartridge. The most successful of bolt action designs for the new rimless cartridge was the M1932, slightly modified and adopted as the MAS 1936. Production began in 1937, with interruptions during the German occupation of France, resuming post-war and continuing until 1952. Prior to the outbreak of WWII, the MAS 1936 was only produced in sufficient numbers for a few front-line French units. After the fall of France to Germany, the Wehrmacht adopted captured MAS 1936’s as the Gewehr 242(f) and issued them to some German occupying garrisons. Following WWII, France resumed production and the MAS 1936 was extensively used by French troops and colonial defense forces in Algeria, Indochina (VietNam), in the Mideast during the Suez Crisis, and elsewhere.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION: The MAS 1936 is compact, about 4” shorter than the U.S. Garand and German K98Kar rifles also used in WWII. Prominent features include a forward bent “dogleg” bolt handle, a 2-piece stock, stacking hook alongside the barrel, hooded front sight, and a wicked 17” cruciform spike bayonet stored under the barrel. The action is a modified Mauser type, with the main difference being the bolt locking lugs, which on the MAS 1936 are near the rear of the bolt and lock into recesses in the receiver bridge, rather than front bolt lugs engaging recesses directly behind the chamber."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".  This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

As a woman I didn't realize the punch the rifle packs. THe rifle has a 30 or 32 inch barrel I don't remember which but think 32. I can measure it tonight when I get home. It is in excellent condition. Was a 45/70 but a gunsmith did the work to make it into a 110 grain cartridge and it is perfect. I have fired a total of 11 rounds through it of black powder and a 510 grain round.  Comes with a beautiful Leupold 3-9 x 40 scope, about 60 rounds of reloaded ammo with ff black powder. Also comes with sling, all the dies needed for reloading with doubles of most of the dies.  A bullet mold may be available as well its a 480 grain mold.  The rifle is excellent. I am asking 625 for it with all the extras included. Thats a great price.. May consider some kind of partial trade but need some cash to go with the deal..  Am open to offers but no low ballers need try it. I'm not giving it away. The handi H&R rifles are great rifles and this is truly in beautiful shape. email me for more pics most of these are photos of similar rifles I can't get the system to download right now but can text or email pics to you.  The gunsmith added a buffalo nickel to the right side of the gun on the metal frame. Contact me for more information and thanks for looking. This rifle will take down any animal on the North American continent from a very great distance. Local trades and deals are preferred. If shipping is involved I will require it be through a ffl only. Payment will clear my bank before it goes anywhere.

Also good for bedside protection, compact and light.  Double action trigger makes it far less likely to fire accidentlly.  Uses forward tilting barrel rather than spring loaded slide for loading, much easier for girl (or someone with a medical condition, like my wife) to load.  Inexpensive to practice with, 22lr ammo is availalbe for around 5-7 cents per round (compared with about 30-35 cents per round for .380 or 9mm)LIKE NEW CONDITION.  Have original box and paperwork.  Could likely pass off as 'new', but I wouldn't do that, not totally honest.   Fired one day at range to get used to it (approx 50 rounds thru it, then cleaned). Bought it for my wife to carry, but she preferred my Sig P238, so I had to spend about $700 and buy a second one for her.  Loads of fun  :)Private sale.  If you are in Louisiana (and appear to be legit) there is no FFL required and no government documentation.  No sales tax or FFL fees.  $260 out the door, complete.  Can be picked up in Baton Rouge.  Have had too many out of state people send fake 'cashiers checks' for it (wanting me to send them money in return or send a deposit slip so they can get my bank account info - not dumb enough to fall for either of those scams.)  Local pickup only.    Thanks."
