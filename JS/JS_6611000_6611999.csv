This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 14+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Dark Earth Frame, Black SlideAction: Double OnlyFast Action Trigger"

The Czech's made, and still  make some of the world's finest firearms.  They even made many firearms for Mauser.  The pictures don't do it justice.  Looks good + in person. Finish is well over 80%.  Pic's make the finish look thin.  It's not.   Finish is more like a steel grey, and not ""blued"" like western guns.  The non-civilian factory finish just isn't up to western standards, but the CZ70 is known for being an extremely reliable and durable firearm.  If you want a real steel conceal carry pistol that is a proven firearm, then this for you.  I also have .32acp rounds available for local sale.  While not quite as powerful as .380acp, the .32acp round has a well mannered recoil,  and is much easier to keep on target.  Until the 1980's most European police departments used .32acp semi automatics.  The magazine is a brand new quality Italian made replacement for a Walther PP, which the CZ70 was based on.  However, I had to grind away the finish to allow it to work smoothly in mag well.   I will likely be getting more of these, but right now, I just have the one in stock.  I will be keeping one for myself.  It is anticipated that none will have the factory mag, so they all will come with new Walter pp magazines.  I probably will have to put the grinder to them too. While the mags aren't pretty, at least they are brand new and should last the lifetime of the gun.  The pistol looks in excellent working condition, with a pristine bore.  I believe this one was made in 1972.

Full description below.  The C-A-T® is a true one-handed tourniquet proven to be 100% effective by the U.S. Army’s Institute of Surgical Research. Tests proved that the C-A-T® completely occluded blood flow of an extremity in the event of a traumatic wound with significant hemorrhage. The C-A-T® utilizes a durable windlass system with a free-moving internal band providing true circumferential pressure to the extremity. Once adequately tightened, bleeding will cease and the windlass is locked into place. A Hook and Loop strap is then applied, securing the windlass to maintain pressure during casualty evacuation. The C-A-T®’s unique dual securing system avoids the use of screws and clips which can become difficult to operate under survival stress or where fine motor skills are compromised."

More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc.

Cerakote Flecktarn","Kearney, Kearney, Nebraska",$ 700,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 3, 2017",Rifles,Anderson Manufacturing                                                                                ,6.8mm SPCII                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a custom built AR15 chambered in the popular 6.8 SPC II.  Here are the parts to name a few (you get everything pictured including scope, mag, ammo):Anderson Upper W/ dust cover and forward assistAnderson LowerMarrix 15"" Keymod Handguard18"" Blackhole Weaponry (BHW) Barrel, 6.8 SPC II Spec, Threaded 5/8-24 with Flash HiderRifle Length Gas SystemAnderson Charging HandleRock River 2-Stage TriggerMagpul MOE GripMagpul MOE Adjustable StockPSA FA Profile 6.8 BCGBurris PEPR Scope MountMueller APV 4.5-14 Scope with Extended SunshadeThe barrel, receivers, stock, and handguard have all been done in Cerakote for a durable finish in Flecktarn pattern.  Colors are Sniper Green, Magpul FDE, and Graphite Black; all done with H-Series cure after being sandblasted, painted, and properly baked. The Mueller is coated with Alumahyde, but could use another recoating.I accuracy tested it with a 10 mph wind in 40 degree weather, and was able to get good results from factory Hornady 110 Vmax ammo.  My 7-shot group at 100 yards produced a 1.04MOA group size (I can text the picture of it if interested).  With a proper rest, and more favorable shooting conditions, this should be sub-MOA shooter no problem. The previous owner of the barrel said it was lightly used and had just over 1/2 MOA groups with a 90 gr bullet.  In addition to everything above, also being included will be an ASC 6.8 25 round magazine, 3 full boxes of Remington 6.8 115 gr ammo + 8 additional rounds (68 rounds), and over 45 pieces of Remington and Hornady 6.8 brass.   It shot great, and ejected at 3 o'clock position.   Have lubed it up and shot it, and it runs perfectly.   Holds open on last round,  and cycles well picking up the next round. I personally have a 16"" 6.8 and speak highly of the round.  It has replaced my 30-06 for preferred deer round here in the state.   It has significantly more power than 223 for hunting (over 30% more), and lacks the recoil and weight of a 308.   With most ammo, the 6.8 will outperform rounds like the 6.5 Grendel under 250-300 yards.   People have used this caliber for everything from coyotes, to hogs, to deer, to black bear, to elk, and even moose and brown bear.    There is a great group of supporters at sites like 68forums if you want to reload and load to higher pressures than Remington and factory companies offer.   I'm asking 700 for the whole package, Firm on price.  I am open to trades listed below, and can put cash on top for right item.To replicate this gun with these quality parts and the Cerakote, you would be into this gun over 1400 with no magazine or ammo.If you are interested in additional ammo, I have 12 boxes of Hornady Vmax 110 gr as well for $14 per box.  These are an all-around great coyote and deer round, or anything with thinner hide.   As stated above, they shoot great out of this gun.Only reason I'm selling is I already have a 16"" version, and don't need both.  Please don't hesitate to ask any questions should you have any.   This is a great way to get a low recoiling hunting gun, and time to practice before the seasons start up this fall. Must have CCW or handgun purchase permit so I know you're legit, no exceptions."
