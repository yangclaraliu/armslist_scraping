Looking to sell, but only to buy more firearms so check out my trade conditions, as I have no problem trading if it is the right trade. The E2 edition is a discontinued rare product that comes with a modified grip that is much more ergonomic and fits the webbing of your hand with much more contact providing a lot more control when firing the pistol. It is a big game changer for me. This special edition also comes with the short reset trigger (SRT) which is another really great feauture that reduces the reset diatsnce the trigger travels after firing. This is another great feature for reacquring your target and getting back in place and ready to fire at a quicker rate. It has a DA/SA system that has an excellent trigger pull that is crisp and smooth on the double action and an awesome single action trigger at 4.4 lbs that breaks just right. The Sig Sauer brand in general has been good to me, and this firearm is no exception as they don't need my review to count toward their sterling reputation- everyone knows the 226 is considered to be one of the greatest pistols ever engineered.        If you look at the pictures you can see the gun is flawless, however I had just cleaned it before I photographed it and there is some oil on it. Cosmetically and mechanically this gun has no flaws it is in like new condition wth 250 rounds fired through it.                                                                                   Must be processed through a licensed FFL.                                                                                          *Buyer pays FFL transfer fee."

I have owned the gun for only a few months and need to sell it quickly due to financial situations. The gun has been absolutely amazing when it comes to carrying, reliability, and accuracy. The gun has had approximately 42 rounds through it. The gun comes with a extended 12 round magazine with pinky rest (which turns it into a full size grip) and a 9 round magazine for concealed carry. When you buy the gun it comes with a hard case, owner's manual, extra fiber optics for the front site, two magazines, the original XD gun lock, and the wire brush to clean it. The gun has the always popular 1911 style back strap safety, front fiber optics, and Springfield's grip zone technology. The fiber optic helps tremendously with aiming quickly and the grip zone helps you grip the gun even if your hand is wet or oily. This gun has great reviews everywhere and has been voted by some as the best concealed carry out there. I will definitely buy this gun again when I have the money, but like I said I need the money more right now. I am selling it for $485 OBO, which is less than it is worth, but will entertain any reasonable offer. The gun will be sold to the person with the best offer. Call or text with an offer and we can meet somewhere within reasonable distance. Please feel free to call or text anytime during the day or night, no matter the time. Thank you all, Taylor.

Also installed on the gun is an Apex Trigger with the Apex Spring Kit. The only other modification I've done to the gun is sanded down the white dots on the rear sight. The right side of the rear sight also has some minor damage from a sight pusher tool but does not affect the sight. The original magazine plates and original trigger and springs are included. Overall, this is a great starter gun. The only reason I'm selling this thing is to fund another project."

It's a flawless shooter with accuracy that is only limited by the abilities of the shooter.

I still have the parts and they will be included. As stated above, an extra magazine and the original box as bought from the importer will be included. Also the original beat up grips that I replaced. I have three BHP's and can attest to what awesome pistols they are. I wouldn't expect anything less from a pistol designed by John Browning. The BHP's are a must have for any gun enthusiasts collection.PRICE:Circumstances and priorities dictate that I must pare my BHP collection down by one.
