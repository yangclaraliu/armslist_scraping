The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most.

It is a reweld build from a PLO parts kit. The reweld was done by Matt Yeamans (aka turbothis on the forums).  This rifle was built from a demilled parts kit. Unlike most of the PLO kit builds you see around, this one has ALL MATCHING SERIAL NUMBERS. They are all original serials, nothing has been force matched or faked with unserialed parts. See the pics of the serials for verification. I was able to find serials on the front receiver stub, bolt, carrier, top cover, gas tube, buttstock lower tang (so even the rear receiver stub was the right one for this rifle), and the recoil spring assembly. The rear sight leaf has the same serial, it was hand scratched and is very faint. I am unable to get it to show up in pictures.  The barrel on this rifle is in surprisingly great shape. See the pics for a ""bullet test"" picture. The bore is bright and shiney with strong rifling.  The new center section of the receiver was finished with cold blue. The rest of the finish was left untouched. I did my best to blend the cold blue with the original finish. It has a very cool ""battlefield pickup"" look to it that is all original.  US made parts on this rifle are the FCG (Tapco G2), receiver (reweld receiver counts as US made), and the gas piston. The piston is a replica early type fluted gas piston. I also have the original Russian gas piston, which I will include with the rifle. Not lloking for trades, but if you need it shipped it must go through a dealer."

The High Tower Armory 90/22 is a compact, maneuverable stock kit for the Ruger® 10/22® which utilizes a fully ambidextrous bullpup design for superior balance and ergonomics. This incredibly durable, military grade polymer stock will reduce the overall length of most 10/22’s to about 26 1/2 inches, just over the federally required minimum length for rifles. The HTA 90/22 also features a CNC machined monolithic aluminum Picatinny optics rail and aluminum bedding block, as well as an ambidextrous steel charging handle which cycles the factory 10/22 bolt from forward positions. The HTA 90/22 trigger linkage is made of Melonite treated steel for the most consistent and efficient transfer of energy, having a resistance to flex three times greater than aluminum by weight. A safety extension is included to allow the original factory safety to be activated, in addition to a safety selector located near the trigger. Also included is both an extended magazine and automatic bolt release which replace the factory releases and allow for much faster manipulation of your rifle's controls. Additionally, a shell deflector can be attached to the stock making it safe and comfortable to shoot left handed. This kit comes complete with a removable dummy suppressor, two side mounted Picatinny rails, and a detachable ammunition storage box for holding spare rounds in the field. Accepts factory 10 round magazines as well as most aftermarket high capacity magazines."

This is the gun that 5 time World champ T Bone Dooley used. Steve posted this to the SASS Wire back in 2004:Nate Kiowa Jones#6765SASS Wire Vet Member # 2404posted May 18, 2004 12:55 PM""I have one of these TNN guns here. I personally think it will be the ruler of the Classic Cowboy shotguns. TNN has addressed several issues with this gun. As mentioned, the hammers are close for easier one-handed cocking. Even just out of the box it is do-able. Mild Bill was concerned that the gun couldn`t be opened with it cocked. Not to worry, the lever works under the hammers and it will open and with these large heavy hammers, it will be easy to reduce the hammer springs even more. As Old Scout mentioned it points well. The Liberty`s and the newer Rossi`s don`t have enough drop in the stock. They tend to shoot high for most people. When I shoulder this gun there is no rib visible, just bead. If you see rib, you will shot high. The next issue is there is no tang safety or hammer blocks to complicate the gun. That was the biggest problem with the Liberty. All that extra junk makes it hard to tune. The internals of this gun are very similar to the originals. Next, this is a 3"" chambered long forcing cone gun. Strawberry lars knows shotguns but I do disagree with him about 3"" chambered long forcing guns compared to 2&3/4"" short cone guns. Felt recoil in minimal with this guns. I talked to one of the guys at TNN and they tell me that this gun has passed the drop test, but he also mentioned that they did a 12/20 test. They dropped a 20ga round in a chamber and then a 12ga round on top of it and then test fired the gun. He tells me that the barrel showed no damage but they did bust the stock. The barrels are heavy. They are of the newer stronger mono block design. Basically, the chamber area is all one piece. I not sure how the side locks are mounted on the original but this gun has them positively attached to the receiver metal, not the wood. The problem with the liberty locks is they attach through the wood and over time they get loose or they get tighten to a point that one trigger will shoot both barrels.It also has a really cool roll-over steel butt-plate. We shot it Saturday with everything from 3"" mags to 50gr black powder loads. Hulls just fell right out. The only negative I can see is it needs a larger front bead. (they have since added the big #4 bead) I do think this gun will be the gun for classic. I am currently doing an action job on this one for a customer.""HERE IS THE CUSTOM WORK DONE TO THIS SHOTGUN, IN STEVE'S OWN WORDS:""As to what I have done with this gun, they come stock as all blue so the first step for the color-cased guns is to take them apart de-burred and de-horn and send everything out for a true bone meal and charcoal color-case hardening. Once I get the parts back The next step is refitting and polishing the parts so the gun will run with lighter springs. Then I just lighten the hammer springs, and the firing pin springs. The old V type latch spring and the sear springs are the weakest parts for hard CAS use so they are changed out to hand fitted piano wire springs They dont break. When finished the gun easily cock both hammers at the same time with one thumb. The latch lever will open easier and the barrels will fall open wide of their own weight. For the barrels, I polish the chambers and chamfer the chamber mouths for easy loading and unloading. For the right handed shooters, I reverse the triggers, front trigger on the left and the rear trigger on the right. With the triggers setup like this, the front trigger is on the left side and once it is pulled the finger can easily slip straight back to the rear which is now on the right side. You don't have to reach around the front trigger to get to the back trigger. I think this is a faster setup than even the single trigger guns because you don't have to let up on the trigger to get a reset required of the single trigger gun. This setup can make it seem almost like both trigger were pulled at the same time.""Finally, I had my local gunsmith very slightly shorten the stock and add a recoil pad, per Steve's instructions:""Also the stocks on most of the CAS SXS guns are designed for aerial targets. When you point them toward the ground the positive toe of those stocks tends to dig into your shoulder when you fire. This will eventually cause the shooter to let the stock move down on the shoulder which brings the front end up. The shot goes high. Savvy shooters will lean way into the shot but that usually doesn't work for the lady shooters. So, now that positive toe is nailing them. For the shotguns besides shortening the stock, I like cut them so the pad is about 5 degrees negative. That helps take some of the felt recoil away shooting at our ground targets.""Actually, I don't shoot in Cowboy Action Shooting...I just love this gun! It's the one Steve McQueen used in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and Lee Marvin used in ""The Professionals""! The action is like glass and it's a hoot to shoot. The only reason I'm selling is I badly need the cash. You're not going to find another classic like this - anywhere!The price for this beauty is $800, cash or CREDIT CARD. I also have some cases of Winchester ""Low recoil, low noise"" shells available to the buyer. I'd prefer not to ship but, if necessary, I'll add actual shipping costs.This gun is in Greenfield.Contact me at REDACTED."

This mil-spec receiver is made from an aircraft grade single block of 6061 T-6 Aluminum. The solid blocks of aluminum are CNC machined on state of the art equipment in the great state of Texas, USA, with tolerances held to one thousandth of an inch. Finish is a hard coat anodize per MIL-A-8625. The receivers accept all mil-spec internal parts and are compatible with all other aftermarket mil-spec upper and lower receivers. Rifle Specifications:  LIFETIME transferable Warranty on the rifle. 6061 T-6 billet aluminum upper and lower receiver. 16mm deep ""low shelf"" mil spec receiver with adjustable tension screw for rock solid up to lower fit. 16 inch HBAR contour barrel. M4 cut receiver and barrel extension. 5.56mm NATO chamber that will also shoot .223 rem. Flip up BUIS front and rear A2 style adjustable removable sights. QD aluminum front battle grip with water tight storage compartment. UTG Red/Green dot CCO/CQB sight with lockable turrets and quick detach mount. Padded assault style soft case with mag storage. Full owners manual and maintenance guide. Cable style gun pad lock perfect for disabling the ability to use the rifle when being stored. Threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi. YHM Phantom flash hider with aggressive serrated crown and the correct crush washer. Rock solid FSB with top rail. Carbine length four rail free float handguard. Gas port is correctly sized for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel and all external steel parts are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. These barrels are of HBAR contour (.750 under the front sight base) . This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. This twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights. The barrel is mounted on a Billet A4 upper receiver with built in Mil-spec M1913 Picatinny accessory rail. It is made from certified 6061 T-6 solid blocks, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX. The upper features a forward assist, hinged ejection port cover, and built in brass deflector. The buttstock is the heavier wall, stronger M4 buttstock, not the cheaper carbine buttstock. This buttstock features 6 positions for maximum shooter comfort, reinforced honeycomb design for heavy duty use, and the correct M4 lock nut peened into place. All parts are semi auto including the properly headspaced MPA tested bolt, M-16 carrier, and fire control group. Includes (1) one new thirty round MAGPUL Pmag window magazine with the priceless “anti-tilt” follower."

Welles served under President Lincoln, distinguished himself as a political leader nationally, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party. Secretary Welles was also instrumental in the creation of the Navy’s Medal of Honor. Using original photos and hand drawings of the Gideon Welles Serial Number 9 as reference, the master plate used in the creation of the new Silver Eagle pattern was hand cut for production with full coverage on both sides of the receiver cover. The Silver Eagle pattern, like the Henry Rifle itself, is one piece of American history without rival. This model is built on the award winning Henry Golden Boy platform. The rifle features a traditional 20"" octagonal barrel outfitted with buckhorn sights; a gunsmithing masterpiece that closely mirrors its legendary predecessors, the original Henrys when they were patented in 1860."

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip.While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.Capacity is 5+1 shells."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.Made in U.S.A.

Does not include the custom sights seen on the rifle, although I might be willing to throw them in for just $50 more. Gun enthusiasts, top notch law enforcement, and the highest level military will tell you that LWRC is basically the Cadillac of AR-15's. Well, haha, I would actually call it the Ferrari of AR's. This is honestly the baddest ass AR I've ever seen, and not merely because of the LWRC name. It has an absoluetly gorgeous limited edition burnt bronze finish; no other rifle looks like it.  Being a rifle designed for the military, it already has a built in semi auto, AND full auto option on the safety selector switch, if you so choose to convert to full auto with just a few extra parts. Full length top rail from the rear of the receiver all the way to the tip of the hand/heat guard at the end of the barrell. More rails can be added to the bottom and both sides of the guard from tip to tail. More rail space/mounts than you could ever possibly need. Truthfully, forget the cheap-ass $700-$800 AR's, you're much better off investing in something like this, one of the top notch rifles you can find on the planet. The one place you should absolutely not be cheap, I mean the ONE place, is when you're buying a rifle like this. I'm highly disappointed that I have to get rid of this rifle, before getting to even try it out, but life calls and I need the money for my kids/family for Christmas. Due to this, I am really trying to get the full price listed, but there could possibly be a little bit of wiggle room depending on how much of a response I get. That is, as long as it's a truly reasonable offer, as I do have it priced to sell already, especially considering it is a rifle with such high demand/reputation. Do yourself a HUGE favor, get an early Christman present, and get the nicest semi-auto (or full-auto if so chosen) rifle money can buy!!! I promise you will not be dissapointed with this bad boy."
