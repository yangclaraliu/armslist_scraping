Build by Shadow USA, based out of Riverside County, California, this is a great pistol from the early era of stainless steel 1911s. From what I've gathered, Shadow USA was a small, possibly one man operation run out of the owner's garage. However, the builder knew exactly what he was doing when he constructed the pistol, as it functions smoothly, and is wonderfully built. This pistol would be a great addition to any collection.The grips currently on the pistol appear to be cocobolo wood.Near the muzzle on the right side of the slide, the pistol has some minor scratches that should be fairly simple to remove, beyond that, the finish is almost perfect.Includes the hardcase, original grips, two magazines, and fifty rounds of Winchester White Box.I would prefer a trade, but I am willing to sell for $1100 OBOI'm looking for a higher end AK-74, such as an Arsenal. That said, I will consider all offers. The worst I can do is say no."

The receiver on this rifle is in excellent condition with no visible pitting, and the interior is pristine.The rifle is built on an original USGI Springfield Armory receiver (SN in the 2 millions) that was reparkerized at the CMP. A new production Criterion barrel and new production American walnut stock and handguard were installed - also at the CMP. This is a very nice blend of collectability and shootability.

Firearm enthusiasts know the federal regulations. This rifle has an overall length of 26.2 inches and 16 inch barrel. You't don't have to register this firearm. Research the law before you decide to purchase.So you have a rifle the size of an M4 without the registration. Rifle capabilities in a carbine package.Firm price $1300. Please NO trades. To save any haggling low-ball issues, asking price is a reasonable good deal based upon versus online gunbroker prices: cheapest starts $1500 (bidding), shipping $35-40, sales tax (at least $110) depending in what state you live, price of background check (if required). Brick and mortar gun shops average asking price is  $1900 new base price WITHOUT taxes.Private sale in person with me means no bidding, no shipping price, no sales tax. No background check or fee required (I love Nevada). You also are buying yourself time to save up resources for a later conversion.If you live near Reno, Nv, in person private sales, you are getting reasonable good deal based upon fiscal contrast to online or brick and mortar shops.I do recommend this rifle as a bug out weapons platform or for serious advance users with adaptability to diverse exotic weapons. So far I've encountered people using business hooking techniques ""Serious buyer"" in their emails then try to low-ball price. To weed out the haggeling buyers, when emailed I will ask if the person is paying the asking price. Makes things easier for both parties. If a person buys a Hummer and complains about the gas, should that person have bought a Hummer? Should that person buy a gun out of their budget too?I am aware there are not a lot of south paw shooters out here, I will post on gun broker later this week to reach out to more left hand shooters nationwide. I will take down this ad that same time as well. This post was worth a shot. Thank you for viewing this post."
