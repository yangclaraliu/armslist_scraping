Came off a rifle I traded for. I looked these up on the internet. Apparently from the early 70's and these were available in several magnifications and were their flagship models. It appears that Bushnell still honors their lifetime warranty on them as well. . Rings included, picatinny size. Internet forums give a value of $50-$60, I don't see it and would be happy with a 100 round box of high velocity 22, like Stingers, Mini-Mags, ect.Hurricane Optima found in grandpa's stash. Missing turret cap but functions. Has 1 original lense cap, lense cloth, and box. One end of the box has a piece of a Fred Meyer price tag. I do not know how old it is, guessing sometime in the 60's maybe 70's because that is when grandpa was last hunting. Rings (look cheap to me) included, looks like 3/8 Weaver. Further research tells that this is from the early 60's, possibly late 50's. Very well regarded Japan made. Believed to be made in the same factory as Bushnell and a few others, but I can not confirm that. Seeing as it is in such good shape, I had it on a 10/22 for one session but it is scratch and ding free, it seems like a natural to put on a similar vintage 22 for that sort of time period classic. Entertaining any reasonable trade offers."

I fell in love with the aggressive stippling on the m and p that is only available in the pro series . I have since moved on too something else . It has been shot about 2-300 times and has zero handling marks . I would rate the gun a 10 as it has never been carried daily. I paid $734.00 after tax and extra mag at Simmons I will take $500 for the setup .Not interested in trades or desperate so don't ask if I will take less I want I we'll leave it in the safe before I give it away.

Before I picked up the 40-caliber version I owned the 9 millimeter and I will say without a doubt I like the 40-caliber version myself just a little bit better not to mention it is a lot more realistic to the original 1911 as far as power it will do its job and it has beautiful cocobolo grips to match! The grip safety fitting is very tight and nice as it should be for a gun with less than a hundred and fifty rounds! Please send your trade offers and your cash offers be reasonable and I will be thank you very much for looking I am also accepting multi-gun trades on this piece as I know not everyone has guns in this price range please be reasonable and make sure the condition on yours matches the criteria here thank you again.

This is a beautiful rifle. I am only selling it to fund another project. This rifle sells for $750+ brand new. This one is in great condition. I am asking $350. I have more pictures than what I was able to post. The rifling in the barrel looks excellent as well as the hardware. The only issue with the rifle is that the front sight came loose and does not stay in anymore. I have the sight, but you will most likely have to spend $5 to buy a new front sight and install it. It is not a difficult process. I also have a Native American-style leather slip case that will come with the rifle.Feel free to contact me with any questions you have. Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

This is not a cerakoted frame. The pistol itself has probably 4000-5000 rounds through it. It was maintained well as it was one of my two daily carries for the duration of my ownership. The firearm has functioned flawlessly in its current configuration for the time for the time I have owned it. Comes with 3 mags though only two are pictured.
ASKING $620 FOR EVERYTHINGThere is some wear on the left side of the slide from the slide contacting my belt every now and again while in the appendix position. I can provide pictures of the wear upon request .
I have two sets of sights included in the sale. I can install the other set upon request as I have the sight pusher to do it.
-CURRENTLY INSTALLED- Ameriglo U-RAP rear sight(Essentially a half ghost ring two dot tritium night sight. Its the one in the picture) and corresponding height tritium orange front. The picture somewhat distorts the actual size of the front sight. It is a fantatsic set of ""combat"" sights.
-INCLUDED- A set of 10-8 Front red fiber optic with blacked out lateral linear serrations with U shaped peep. Comes with an extra stick of green and red fiber to change the color of the front sight.  -Factory standard glock front and rear sights.
 
There are a few non standard items installed on the firearm to increase primer strike reliability while still maintaining a smoother then stock trigger pull.
NON STANDARD ITEMS INSTALLED
-Zev Technologies minus connector for slightly smoother and easier trigger pull
-Zev skeletonized lightweight striker for increased reliability of primer strikes
-Lone wolf extra power striker spring for increased reliability of primer strikes
 
ALSO INCLUDED in the sale( if wanted)
-Gcode OSH standard trigger guard retention holster. This holster requires the RTI wheel for function. Included(but not pictured) is the paddle style belt retainer you can attach the RTI wheel to, but the RTI wheel itself is not included as I still have other holsters for different platforms I still use.The wheel itself can be purchased for $27 from gcode holsters at https://www.tacticalholsters.com/product/gca25.html.
IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE HOLSTER, THE PRICE DOES NOT CHANGE. I am selling as a package deal for the price, with or without the holster.
 -Uncle Mikes double mag pouch. An item I had laying around that I did not actively use. It is included in price. If you do not want it, the price does not change.
If you have any questions about the firearm, sights or holster, please let me know. I can take additional pictures if needed. I am willing to travel a reasonable distance for the trade, so please let me know of your location and we can work something out. I do not require a bill of sale, but I do require visual verification of TX DL and or TX CHL/LTC.I also have this ad posted on texasguntrader.com here https://texasguntrader.com/index.php?a=2&b=942412"

This is a rare rifle to find - not the common american 1898 Krag. This one came out of Norway just after WW2. No import mark; Norway is on of those countries that when they are done with rifles they melt them down instead of sell their stock. This rifle was built in 1914 and has a nazi capture mark under the barrel. All numbers match on every tiny component except for the extractor. Even the stock matches, though it has sadly been sporterized. This is serial # 1519 meaning it was the 1519th M1912 Krag made. The bore has strong rifling, with darkened lands but bright grooves. I have thoroughly cleaned the bolt and dissselmbled the rifle and there is no rust or pitting anywhere. Very good condition. Rifle has not been drilled or tapped in any way. Only sporterization was the stock at some point. Before telling me that the rifle is expensive for 'just a sporterized krag' look to see how many others you can find for sale online and what they're asking price is.
