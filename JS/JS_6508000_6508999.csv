This gun has aftermarket trigger and aftermarket grips on it.  The reason I am selling it at 75 is two-fold.1. There is a small metal piece connecting directly to the trigger spring that is cracked on one side. This does not affect the ability of the gun once assembled and I am sure this part can be requested from SCCY.2. The front metal pin that holds the frame together seems to shift around. The pin is not going to fall out or anything but I feel that it is a defect.That being said...thus would make a good truck gun, pepper gun, or possibly a good gun just to knock around with. The gun is in good condition and has not had a large number of rounds shot through it. If you need more pictures I can supply them via email."
