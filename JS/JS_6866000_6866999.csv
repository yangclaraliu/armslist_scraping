The lack of a forward assist, brass deflector, and ejection port cover help keep this rifle's weight around 6 pounds, and I find aesthetically pleasing as well. I qualified with an A2 in basic training and never used the forward assist so think it's a bit redundant anymore.Carbine is chambered in 5.56 NATO, has a carbine-length gas tube, 1/9 twist, lightweight profile barrel, ""F"" Height front post sight, commercial buffer tube. Upper and lower mate tightly with no rattling. Good solid carbine. Nice and lightweight, just like a carbine should be!Comes with:- 1 15 round Hexmag- 1 10 round Gen 3 PMag- ErgoGrip MCR lightweight pistol grip.

It is a one off hand airbrushed work of art. Each grip is meticulously airbrushed by hand with an airbrush. This isn't made to look ten thousand years old like some battlefield worn pieces out there as each ware mark is given much thought and placed where it would actually accumulate ware in battlefield use. Unlike other battlefield worn items that are just painted and rubbed with sandpaper to look vintage with no forethought as to placement of ware positions and often looks like something that was dug up from the fifteenth century and not something that was just used for an extended period of time.What would you rather have ?This P320 grip module hand airbrushed by an artist....Or...A painted and sanded down to look scratchy grip by someone whom isn't an artist and most likely makes holsters and mills slides.... And who's never painted a picture or airbrushed a picture.Myself... I'll go with an artist... And I will also point out my very reasonable prices. Most others charges well over $100 for a single colorway vs my hand airbrushed artwork for $75 !! It's a no brainier.If you have an idea or vision of a grip module you want airbrushed or simply want this distressed digital camo in a different color please let me know and I can custom make you anything you want. You're only limited by your imagination..

This pistol is a idea that spawned from putting a Sig Sauer p210 slide on a CZ 75 frame and it was done with forgings no parts on this pistol are from cast. The only thing I can say to describe holding it is it reminds me of my Sig Sauer P226 with E2 grip except Slimmer in the grip with a similar Contour making it the most comfortable gun in my collection next to my Browning hi-power Mark 3 the pistol is in Flawless brand new condition has never been fired and is ready to go to the right home the magazines that I purchased for this pistol were not cheap they were $50 each at purchase time I have three extra and the two original magazines all still in the box or plastic. Do not miss out on this item it is a very rare pistol and it is way better than buying a Sig Sauer p210 these days they are charging $2,000 plus and you can have this pistol for $650 cash or trade value $800 with the magazines."
