Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.   Technical Information   Weight: 1.46 lb Weight, w/ Entry Receiver Extension: 1.63 lb Length, Stock: 8.00-11.36"" LOP Adjustment: 7-Position (0.56"" / position) LOP Adjustment Range: 3.36"" LOP, Collapsed (M4/M16): 11.10"" LOP, Extended (M4/M16): 14.46"" THANK YOU FOR VISITING MONEY MARKET PAWNSHOP ON ARMSLIST.COM We are FFL dealer located in Portland Oregon We BUY, SELL, TRADE and LOANS on firearms and more.

Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock. This stock requires a rifle length buffer, buffer tube extension and spring which must be purchased seperately. The AR-10 PRS can be used on an AR-15 for additional clearance between the charging handle and the cheek rest.

No scammers. I am savvy to all of the scammer tricks, so don't waste your time. This is a serious gun, owned by a serious gun lover. I am selling this gun as I am moving up into the Wilson Combat league. Gun is in PERFECT condition and I purposely bought the Gen 3 vs the Gen 4. If you put them both in your hand and fire them, I found that the Gen 3 felt better and I was able to shoot it more accurately than the Gen 4, so I bought the Gen 3 (not giving you a sales pitch… rather, sharing information)."
