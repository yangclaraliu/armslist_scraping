The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
 
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
 
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The Remington Model 700, a rifle with no equal, and a superior performer in every way. Its accuracy and dependabiltiy have become the standard by which all other centerfire rifles are measured and continually fall short. Still the most accurate rifle out-of-the-box, the Model 700 brings its famous action and renowned consistency to this diverse family of guns-all equipped with their externally adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger system. Its stronger, smooth action, consistent accuracy, classic beauty and unequaled value have made the Model 700 BDL the hunter's favorite for 40 years. Technology:  Externally Adjustable Trigger: It breaks like glass, has virtually zero creep and offers a level of shot control unmatched by any factory trigger today. The X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger system delivers true, custom-grade performance in a production trigger and is user-adjustable. 3-Rings of Steel: 1. Recessed bolt face completely encloses cartridge head for maximum protection against case rupture. 2. Barrel surrounds bolt shroud for additional strength. 3. Barrel threaded into receiver machined from hardened steel. American Walnut Stock: High-gloss American walnut stock is enhanced by a distinctive black fore-end classic Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, and generous skipline cut checkering. Hammer-forged Barrels: Of all methods, this produces the strongest barrels with unmatched consistency. Model 700 barrels have exacting bore and rifling dimensions and a carefully tuned exterior contour.

Premium saddle leather body with a reinforced thumb break. Optional calf strap (#318-171, not shown) is sold separately. Ankle Gloves for small revolvers are an open top design, meaning they do not have a safety strap and thumbreak. Instead, they have a tension unit, and work with both hammered and hammerless guns. Other models have a retention strap (thumb break) that runs behind the grip frame (not behind the hammer). They work with both hammered and hammerless guns, but some guns with factory supplied custom or oversized rubber grips will not fit because the retention strap is not long enough to wrap around them."

Overall a great gun at a great price (+/- $450).   The feed ramp has been polished and the guide rod and spring upgraded to prevent failures in extraction and ejection, as well as feeding malfunctions by the slide not going far enough to the rear or cycling so fast that the round in the magazine hasn’t been pushed up far enough for proper engagement.  Not sure if it was needed by I replaced it anyway since it seemed to work like a charm on the first CZ999 I own (No failure to feed, extract or stove pipes - absolutely amazing)."

Original grips also included.It has been totally disassembled, media blasted and refinished per original 1945 manufacturing specs (black oxide).

Barrel is 1:8 rifling made of 4150V Chrome Moly. Has a pistol length gas system which aids in running the subsonic rounds. Has a 13.5” M-Lok free float hand guard for improved accuracy. B-Tac BCG is MPI/HPT tested and coated with 9310 Black Nitride for improved function and finish. Rifle has all Magpul Moe furniture and has flip up iron sights installed as well so it is ready to go out and shoot. The lower receiver is a new Anderson with all PSA components installed. Also throwing in a section of M-Lok rail with a forward grip installed and two 30 round magazines. 850 obo 16” – PSA 5.56 chambered upper receiver so no worries with firing .223 with this rifle. New rifle with less than 10 rounds down the pipe to test function and sight in the iron sights. The barrel is 4150V Chrome Moly and has 1:7 rifling to handle the heavier 62 grain and up bullets accurately. Has the recoil reducing mid-length gas system underneath an 11” Keymod free float rail to also aid in accuracy. Rifle was assembled with all PSA parts including the BCG and charging handle so you are getting a very good solid rifle. The furniture is all Magul MOE and has flip iron sights installed so you are good to go and you already have backup sights once you add your optic. Rifle will also come with two 30 round magazines. 800 obo Will sell both together for 1,450 or a reasonable offer price is pretty firm. I will throw in an additional 2 - 30 round magazines for 6 total. May consider a taking a pocket 380 on trade plus cas cash deal, really only looking for a Smith & Wesson Bodyguard."

Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame."

This pistol was bought brand new from the gun store about 2 years ago.  Only has about 3 or 4 boxes of ammo shot through it.  Mechanically like new.  Some small blemishes on the finish here and there.  Gun store says those can be cleaned up.  Comes with original box, paperwork, and original Colt 8-round magazines (2 of them).  Also included are two more 8-round magazines by Wilson Combat.  Also two boxes of .45 ACP ammunition.  Finally, also included is a custom inside the waist band leather holster by MRT Custom Leather.   Beautiful pistol and has that classic Colt feel.Email me for more images.
$950 firm.
Requirements for purchase:
Has to be face to face.  No shipping.  You need to be a North Carolina resident.  You need to be legally able to purchase or own a handgun.  I will need to see your driver’s license.  I will need to see either a valid pistol purchase permit (which I will retain), or a current concealed weapon permit.  I will fill out two bill of sale documents, one for you and one for me.
OR, to make it easier and for sure everything is covered, we could go through a dealer with a FFL.  That would be fine as long as you pay their fee, which would probably be around $25 I’m assuming.  The dealer I would use would be Fuquay Gun & Gold in Fuquay Varina, NC."
