First thing if you are a C&R holder, New Jersey does not recognize those type of FFL .. so the gun must go to a regular FFL dealer, next thing All guns in New Jersey are considers firearms. This includes all antique, BB, pellet and all black powder guns. So if the gun you purchased falls in this category you will need a FFL. SO WITH THIS SAID... THIS IS A ESTATE SALE I'M SELLING FOR A CUSTOMER .. IT IS A ROSSI MODEL 11 COACH HAMMER GUN HAS 20"" BARRELS .. GUN IS NIB UNFIRED ..TAKES 3"" SHELLS.. HAS BOX AND PAPERS SN.. 36986 I don't know a lot about the gun, only what the owner tells me. I'm not a gunsmith but I go over them and give you the best description I can. I make sure they are functional but I do not test fire or take firearms apart, so if there is a problem I did not see it. Therefore it is being sold AS IS no exception. If you win the bid it is yours. Don’t bid if you have any doubts, please ask questions and I will do my best to get the answer you are looking for. Don’t bid unless you intend to buy it. FULL payment and the FFL must be received with in 7 days of the end of the auction or bad feedback will be left. I have had too many non paying bidders...guns I sell on Gunbroker, the FFL must be sent with payment. I will no longer hunt down FFL..... If your check comes without a FFL your check will be sent back to you, and the appropriate feed back will be left, the gun will be re listed and you will be blocked from bidding again.. Have your Dealer email or fax the FFL to you, so you can print it out. also if you win the gun have the guns info and auction number sent with payment so I know what gun is yours .. Don't assume I know what you won. i do sell many of the same makes and models on GB .. THIS HAS BECOME A BIG PROBLEM ...and people still do what they want no matter what I tell them...Payment must be a CERTIFIED BANK CHECK or POSTAL MONEY ORDER. shipping is $40....NO personal check.. After I receive payment and FFL I will ship the gun and provide you with a tracking number. Payment must be received within 7 days of the end of the auction... All gun will be insured with signature required when shipped... I need to do things this way due to pass problems with FFL. If the dealer does not want to give you his FFL go to a different dealer .. according to ATF a signed copy was the normal practice but they made provisions to accept e mails and faxes ..... Do to all the FFL who forget to e mail or fax their FFL has caused many problems..... so if you should have a issue with your FFL they know the rules just like I do. if there should be any issues call me before you do anything. i would hate to cancel your transaction . I sell too many guns on GB and when a FFL does not do the right thing it just delays the whole process ... this makes life easier for me.... Thanks for understanding.Shipping: USPS Money Order, Certified Check, western union, money gram, cash deposit."

We also specialize in a vast array of collectibles, including western memorabilia, antique cars & automobilia, Revolutionary & Civil War relics, early Bowie & folding knives, and period nautical artifacts. ~ Very Rare, High Condition M1886 Bullard Large Frame Deluxe Lever Action Rifle with Checkered Pistol Grip, Special Length Barrel, and Half Magazine, .45-70, mfg. 1886-1890. Bullard rifles were the finest repeating rifles of their day and a top competitor to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. They were only produced for a brief period of time and Deluxe models, such as this one, are seldom encountered. This example is all original top to bottom and remains in very high condition. The special order 25"" octagon barrel features a standard rifle front sight and adjustable semi buckhorn rear. The barrel and magazine tube retain approximately 90%+ bright original bluing with only slight freckling beginning. The receiver, hammer, lever, and forend cap retain 85% vivid case color with the balance having just faded to silver. The stock is beautifully figured Deluxe grade wood featuring a checkered pistol grip and forearm. It should be noted that not all Deluxe Bullards had extra fancy wood and it is quite rare to see wood of this grade. A coat of varnish has been applied to the buttstock only which has crazed with age. It must have been wrapped in cloth for sometime after as there is a slight imprint made in the varnish. It should be easy enough to remove the finish and reveal the original surface underneath but we will leave that to the next owner. Otherwise the forestock retains it's untouched original finish. The wood has never been sanded or cleaned and shows tight, perfect wood to metal fit throughout with sharp original checkering. The toe of the buttstock has been rounded slightly, and a chip has been repaired on the tip of the pistol grip utilizing the original piece. Original Bullard hard rubber buttplate shows little to no wear with slight rounding at the base. Lower tang and rear sight still retain vivid fire bluing. Clear Bullard Repeating Arms Company address, serial number, and top of frame marked ""Cal 45 70"". All clean, original screws throughout. The action is crisp and functions flawlessly. These guns were actually very well known for their amazingly smooth action. The bore is absolutely flawless with perfectly clean and sharp rifling front to back. Not even a hint of frosting. Bullard rifles were actually better quality, particularly in design, than Winchester however they just couldn't keep up with the competition. If you've been looking to get your hands on a truly spectacular, high condition Deluxe Bullard look no further. These do not turn up often. Not to mention this one is chambered in one of the most sought after calibers! No FFL required on pre-1899 firearms or contemporary muzzleloaders.

I hate to sell but with family and work obligations I just don't have much time for it anymore. Was setting it up to hunt Nimisila which is an electric only reservoir so I have a new minn kota endurance 55 motor for it that has never seen the water. The blind folds down for towing and can be removed for fishing season. Trailer has brand new lights, rims and tires. Asking $ 900 cash, but would entertain trades/partial trades towards a zero turn mower, utility trailer with fold down rear gate, or firearms/ammo. Would also entertain trades that include high end turkey decoys (dave smith, zink, etc). Make me an offer, worst I can say is no. A couple items from frequently asked questions:-The dementions are 16'x6'.-The boat was originally a 1960 fiberglass MFG Lapstrake 3128.-It does not have a capacity plate. After several conversations with the Ohio dept. of Watercraft (nice folks btw) boats from the 60's do not require a plate due to being grandfathered in; however, the expectation is that you follow the capacity expectations per their formula. Per their calculations the weight limit is 960lbs (people + gear) and based on the dementions they do not recommend exceeding 75-90 hp should an outboard be added."

163,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6989163,For Sale:  Real Colt Dragoon 2nd Gen  Percussion,"West, Toledo, Ohio",$ 575,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 12, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"LET'S STOP KIDDING OURSELVES about 2nd and 3rd generation Colt percussion pistols being ""collectible"". I have been involved with percussion weapons since well before Colt got the bright idea to remake these guns in the early seventies. They started this production strictly to capitalize on both the renewed interest in Old West type guns AND the increasing value of original antique weapons of this type. They did this against a background of the IRS at the time allowing for the investment of IRA retirement funds in what were referred to as 'hard assets' as well as stocks, bonds, and other conventional investment mediums. In real terms that meant that each year a tax payer could put as much as $4000 into things like collector coins, art, and even guns and deduct it from gross income. A neat idea, and this""hard asset"" provision drove the demand for guns crazy at the time. Unless you're sixty-five or seventy years old you're not likely to remember this. So Colt started selling these guns as ""collector items"" and the market responded by thinking that they would be a great investment as they would undoubtedly go way, way up in value. Hah! I was only 23 in the early seventies and didn't know any better. But I soon learned. In the 1980's the IRS disallowed IRA investment in hard assets, and gun demand softened up. There were thousands of idiots who, like myself, bought an early production new in the box Colt Navy for $400 or so - thirty-five or forty years ago. I say idiots, because virtually none of us at the time ever thought these guns, whether a C series or an F series would NOT go up in value as time went by. Well, forty years later, they haven't, despite gun gougers trying to get eight or nine hundred dollars for them on gunbroker, gunsamerica, and elsewhere. When they actually DO sell, it's usually for five or six hundred dollars, or even less, which is one hell of a crappy increase in value for something that sold for $400 in the seventies or eighties. Despite Colt's marketing b.s. at the time, these were NOT legitimate ""collector items"" back then, nor are they collector items today. And unknown to virtually all buyers at the time was the hard fact that since Colt was selling these things as ""keep it in the box, keep it unfired, keep it unturned"" ""collectorItems"" few realized that these guns VERY often would not function properly if one tried to actually shoot them. I have defarbed several of these guns and the problems are usually connected to the wedge having never been correctly fitted and the cylinder will not properly headspace against the breech of the barrel. That means that the hammer will not hit each nipple hard enough to fire a cap. Right out of the box some wedges are barely even driven all the way through the frame at all. And driving it in properly will cause the barrel breech to bind up on the cylinder face and jam the action. And for some odd reason, nipples on the various models are not of uniform size. About a third of the time nipples must be removed and turned down to properly accommodate a cap. Since these ""investment items"" were not meant to ever be fired Colt apparently didn't attend well to good functional fit. Remember, these precious things were meant to be kept boxed up forever, so few owners would ever realize this. Since Uberti percussion pistols were made to be used, the fit and function is much more reliable. This particular Colt 2nd generation WORKS AS IT SHOULD and looks good. I'm selling it for $400 for the gun and $225 for the work on it. It too, is NOT A COLLECTOR ITEM! It is however, a good shooter. Don't be buffalo'd by gun gougers high dollar ""collectibility' b.s. about a pistol being 'new unturned' Buying these guns, including this one, will likely result in a net loss of value over a period of years. An inflation chart shows that 400 1975 dollars would be worth $1781 in 2017. A $400 gun bought in 1975 SHOULD be worth nearly $1800 today, which would be a value gain of four and half times. That sure as hell hasn't worked out that way for these great ""collector items"". Buy one of these to shoot, not to ""invest"" in. This is how I see it after fifty years.  $15 shipping."

This variation combines some of the best features of Beretta's offering with a Vertec style grip, skeletonized hammer, accessory rail, G-Decocker only, heavy brigadier slide, 4.7 flush cut barrel, and dovetail front sight. I won't go too much into detail, as I am sure this will only garner interest from those who already know what they're looking at.I am the second owner and the original owner claims he never put any rounds through it. I did not and will not be shooting this as it is strictly for sale. Original owner also installed a factory Beretta steel trigger, extended magazine release, and a D-spring that has not been installed yet (all original parts are in a bag that will come with gun). There are a few dings from what looks like magazine insertion so please refer to pictures. Below is a picture of the serial number as well as the Beretta serial report from their website verifying authenticity that it is a true Elite IA and not a frankenstein gun. This gun does not come with any magazines or original box/papers. What it will come with is a Beretta box, Beretta lock, and 92FS manual."
