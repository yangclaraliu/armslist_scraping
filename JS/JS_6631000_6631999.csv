I had a local gunsmith lighten this trigger for $75, which breaks around 5lbs now (originally it was about 7lbs pull). I paid around $650 for this gun so my small handed girlfriend could enjoy shooting with me (as this gun is 85% the size of a standard 1911) but she prefers shooting my target pistols with red dots. This gun has seen range time maybe twice and just sits in my safe. It would be a perfect pistol for a child or small handed person to shoot. It is extremely reliable - of the 200 or so rounds that have been shot through it, not a single malfunction. This model has dovetailed in front and rear sights and three white dots on the sights. The sights are setup for a 6 o'clock hold. At 25 yards, Ive gotten 3"" groups offhand - so its not a target pistol, but its still a very accurate plinker. It is in excellent condition. Make an offer."

Burnt Bronze Ceracote. New, unfired, in plastic case. Matrix Aerospace made Ruger uppers and lowers. See pics for other details. I have one just like it in grey that isn't as nice looking. It's been a great gun and is my favorite hog rifle. Reducing the number of personal items I'm not using, so trades are highly unlikely. I prefer email communication but will discuss by phone if we get that far and set location. I only meet in very public places and not after dark, for your safety and mine. Thanks."

It's in fair overall condition, it looks like the previous owner didn't really take care of it as it came with a damaged original sling, a light gouge on the front barrel band, and some portions of the blueing gone, and some minor dings on the matching stock. It's an earlier rifle with the flat butt plate and glossy blue. There are two cleaning rods included, one original era, but incorrect for this particular rifle, and a correct style reproduction. The bore is absolutely perfect, shiny and strong rifling. I have not attempted to take it apart, so I can't say if it's a duffel cut or not. 1942 dated, ar manufacture code, all waffenampts intact. The rifle is almost assuredly a vet bring back, the stock has the original finish and a waffenampt on it. There are no X's on the gun, and the bluing is original.

600,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6631600,For Sale:  HK VP9,"Renton, Seattle, Washington",$ 739,"Listed On: Monday, June 5, 2017",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use."

From my personal collection a fantastic premium pocket pistol in excellent condition perfect for concealed carry.  This is a 380 ACP that you can carry with confidence and conceal with little effort.  It is perfect for pocket carry, ankle carry, or even wallet holster carry with no imprinting for anyone to see.
The KAHR P380 is one of the finest pocket 380 ACP pistols you can find.  The ""P"" denotes KAHR's Premium Series line in part due to the Premium Lothar Walther Match Grade polygonal Barrel.  Don't confuse this with their ""C"" Value Series line. 
Everything is as it came new in the box.  Comes with two magazines.  This is definitely one of my favorite pocket pistols but I have my eye on something else so someone else has the opportunity to own this quality pistol.
Must meet all legal requirements, be over 21 and an Ohio resident for Ohio Private Sale.  I keep records of all my firearm transactions so be prepared to provide a copy of your driver's license or CCW.
