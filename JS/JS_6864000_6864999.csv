Until now you could either have a binocular, or monocular. Using a bridge adapter to utilize two monoculars as a binocular has been done for years, but it has significant drawbacks. The weight of such a unit is over 800 grams, and they typically cannot be collimated. Many people enjoy using two monoculars when hunting. One on a neck lanyard for spotting, and one on their rifle. Yet most wish to avoid the cost of purchasing a binocular and two monoculars. The MOD-3 overcomes these problems by utilizing Optical Pods that are waterproof, Nitrogen purged units that can be installed into either a monocular or binocular. Power is conducted to the intensifier tube and indicator LEDs by means of spring loaded, gold plated contacts. Even the springs are gold plated to prevent corrosion. The Optical Pods can be assembled in the MOD-3 Binocular Bridge to form a full function binocular. A latching mechanism firmly holds the Optical Pods in place and is easily manipulated with one finger. Installing or removing the Optical Pods is accomplished in just a couple seconds. The Binocular Bridge has the features you expect to find on a night vision Binocular. It has IP adjustment, dovetail mount, IR LED, IR LED “on” indicator lights in the viewing plane, and low battery warning. The same style gold plated contacts that conduct power to the Optical Pods are also utilized in the Bridge assembly. These conduct power from the Optical Pods to a circuit board and eliminates the need for wires in the joint which moves as you change IP adjustment. This prevents any problems with wires breaking and failing in this area. The IP adjustment is accomplished through IP screws such as the AVS goggles employ. The screws have ball detent ‘bumps’ as they are rotated, preventing vibrations from accidentally changing your settings. The MOD-3 Binocular can be collimated and weighs in at 618 grams. The other half of the MOD-3 system is the MOD-3 Monocular Adapter. This adapts an Optical Pod into a full function monocular. It has the same circuitry as the Binocular Bridge which means you have a flood IR LED, IR “on” indicator, low battery indicator, and battery extender circuit. It uses the 3V lithium battery as well. It also accepts the IR Spot/Flood adapters like the PVS-7 goggles use. Like the Binocular Bridge, the Monocular Adapter releases the Optical pod with the press of one finger, allowing instant changeover from monocular to binocular. The monocular housing is waterproof and has a side mount like a PVS-14, allowing you to use it as you would any other monocular with head and weapon mounts. The monocular is 75 grams lighter than a PVS-14.

I can restore this gun myself and re-list them for a lot more than I am asking now or you can restore it and resell it yourself for a good bit more. These guns were made in Finland and imported by Ithaca from 1970-1981. This particular gun was used in Finland and has 2 small badges in the stock. I'm told that the badges are trophy badges indicating taking of a bird that is the equivalent of our turkey. This one has not been bored for the proper ejection of the 3"" shell that I can tell. It has not been threaded for a choke either.functionally the gun is sound and operates as intended. Other than the finish its in above average condition for a gun this old. I am a certified Cerakote applicator and have spoken to my gunsmith and found that the cost to coat with Cerakote or reblue is the same and would add probably $400-$500 to the value of this gun.These are rare and have a cult like following here in PA!Feel free to make an offer.

The blue on the shroud is pretty good too.  The wood is also original length (uncut), with the original buttplate.Now for the not quite perfect: There are some light scratches to the blue on the receiver, just behind the forearm wood on both sides; a little more on the left than on the right.  Maybe from a zipper on a hunting jacket over the years?  That's about the worst of it for the blue.  There are a couple of nicks on the bottom edge of the magazine, but they are not too noticeable.  The wood has been refinished.  The wood itself is nice, and the forearm was actually done nicely.  The butt stock was done well too, except that the area on the pistol grip next to the receiver was overly sanded to a degree.  (see pictures for stock condition).  Want a perfect stock? Swap a stock off of a less desirable and easier to find .300 Savage - that's an option for someone wanting an original stock.Come See it in person in Janesville!I might consider some sort of trade for a first year (1906) or very early .32 or .35 pre-model 8, with no extra holes, of course.  I have an '07 .32 shooter that could use a companion!I'd be glad to answer questions and send additional pictures if you like.  See the additional pictures for the exact condition.  I would prefer a face to face transaction, but I will ship; you pick up shipping costs.Due to the scammers out there, if I have to ship, the only method of payment I will accept is a Postal Money Order.Thanks for looking!"

Sitting on an Anderson lower. This rifle has a Magpul stock and grip. Nikon 3-9x40 scope and P series mount. I've put around 300 rounds through it, functions flawlessly and is super accurate. With this rifle I'm including 360 rounds of Wolf fmj 123 grain and some soft points. Will also. Come with two 20 rounds ASC magazines and one 10 round ASC magazine. I painted it tan last year out of boredom and it turned out pretty good. There are a couple Small paints chips. :reaction: Next is a AR pistol chambered in 5.56, I believe it's a Midwest industries upper but dont quote me. Barrel length is 6.5"" with a 1:7 twist rate. This upper is also sitting on an Anderson lower. Has Magpul grip and Magpul MBUS sights. I recently added a Kak industries Buffer tube and Shockwave blade. It has anti walk pins and a single point sling. Around 500-600 rounds down range flawlessly and super accurate. This pistol will come four 30 round magazines and approximately 300-400 rounds of re manufactured ammunition. I will also throw in several hundred primed and sized 5.56 casings.I am gonna start this $1,350 OBO :hook1: Trades I'm interested in first is a Quality 1911 45 acp, either full or mid size single stack with No rails, possibly with cash depending on what's included.
