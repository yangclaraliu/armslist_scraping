This scaled-down model of everyone's favorite combo gun, the Taurus Judge, still gives you the ability to fire your choice of ammunition in a size that fits in most pockets. In addition, the lighter, polymer body frame has new updates for improved handling and accuracy. The internal transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear, an important safety feature. The exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions. An extended ejector rod allows for positive extraction of fired cases. Like all standard Judge revolvers, the Public Defender Polymer fires .45 Long Colt rounds and 2-2/"" .410 Bore shotgun shells interchangeably.    Fires .45 LC & .410 Bore Interchangeably    Lightweight Polymer Frame    Extended Ejector Rod    Ribbed Rubber Grip    Red Fiber-Optic Front Sight"

I'm not in a hurry and I love this gun but I have two Gen 4 Glocks so I thought something different would be nice.

I'm interested in selling it with the accessories I have for it but not my magazines. The rifle is as new. I have qualified it once and including that it has less than two 30rd magazines of ammo put through it. I have the box it came it with manuals, sig sling, oil, basically everything it came with except the magazines. I'll include one spare 20rd magazine I have for it as pictured, magpul sling, holosun sight, and guitar case.I will sell to residents of NC only. I will not ship. I am looking for 1,500 cash which is extremely reasonable. The only partial trade I would entertain is for a Glock 34 gen3 unmodified in as new condition. I am looking to move this so watch this ad if it has not sold as I will lower the price if enough time passes. I am a police officer so all laws will of course be followed. I will need a copy of either your ID, CHP, or LE credential. I will hand write you a bill of sale with the serial. I am in the area of Dunn. Feel free to text me at (SOLD) or call during normal business hours.SOLD."

I have fired about 100 rounds through it, and I've never had an issue with it.  It comes with a hand made simply rugged holster that is able to be used inside or outside the waistband. I'm asking 1200 OBO.  Thanks for looking.  Trades: I'm not interested in any semi-auto rifles.  I'd consider a sig 1911, an fns compact with cash, or a tikka t3 tactical.  Feel free to offer anything, worst I can say is no."
