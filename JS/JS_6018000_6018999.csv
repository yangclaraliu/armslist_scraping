The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing.

Plus, Vortex offers their VIP warranty, which means they'll repair or replace their products with no questions asked, and it transfers from person to person with no receipt or card to fill out. It's probably the best warranty you can get today.           The lowest price I can find for this optic is $199.99 plus shipping and tax.

It is still very much a Magnum cartridge. .17 HMR, while not as cheap as .22 is a very cheap cartridge to shoot. All while providing a very accurate shot with almost no recoil. 
 
The Mossberg 817 is Mossberg's offering to the blossoming .17 HMR market. It is a small, short, bolt action rifle equipped with weaver style scope mounts pre-attached to the reciever. The bolt it's self is a cock on open, striker pin firing system. 
 
This is Mossberg's wooden stock, blued reciever option. It comes equipped with a BSA Sweet 17 3-12x40 scope. This scope was designed with .17 HMR in mind. In this set up, the rifle is a tack driver. It does have some cracking in the stock, but the rifle is only a year old and is still in warranty. it came from the factory with these cracks and has not had the chance to go back. It comes with one 5 round magazine.

Used by mostly Finnish and Swedish armies, it was also widely exported into Baltic countries, some European and South American countries. Although manufacturing of the Suomi in Finland ceased in 1944, it was widely used throughout the world well into the 1990’s. This Suomi M31 has been converted by TNW Firearms to Semi-Automatic and fires standard 9mm Luger / Parabellum rounds from a 36 round stick magazine or a 71 round drum.   This carbine is discontinued and no more will be made, so it may go up in value.   Accessories and magazines are plentiful.  The barrel is removable.  To convert to SA legal, TNW extended the barrel and converted it from open bolt to closed bolt with a redesigned bolt assembly.  This is the redesigned hammer-fired model that corrects some of the problems with the earlier striker-fired models.  Includes:71rd drum mags:    (qty: 3)  currently selling for $49.99 each.36 round stick mags: (qty: 4)  currently selling for $20 each.Stick magazines shoot more reliably than the drums.  Spring adjustment can make the drums more reliable.Comes with original wood stock and a 2nd original wood stock modified with a reinforced AK47 side scope mount with scope, laser sight, and strap.This carbine is surprisingly heavy but that means recoil is negligible, especially since it's 9mm.  If 5.56 or 7.62x39 is ever banned, taxed, or limited, this carbine will keep on rockin' because of the easy-to-find 9mm caliber."
