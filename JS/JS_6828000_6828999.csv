The primary xenon light provides 70 lumens of smooth light beam maximally-focused by Pentagonlight proprietary textured reflector for achieving the greatest distance and center brightness. The xenon bulb is protected by an anti-scratch tempered glass lens, and is damped against recoil by the internal spring loaded back-plate deflection mechanism against a completely isolated battery compartment. The pre-configured LED side light is available in red navigation light or NVG-compatible light. The LED side light is optically-enhanced to project a low visibility and low signature perfect spot into the distance. This side light module is easily interchangeable between any of these LED's for meeting task-specific needs. Configure a red navigation light for staging and pathfinding while maintaining stealth. Configure an NVG-compatible light for reducing signature and minimizing saturation of night vision devices. The unsual blue-green color of the NVG-compatible side light can also work as a ""good guy"" signaling light for communication with other team members during an assault. The thumbscrew style mount easily engages and disengages the light from the Picantinney rail. Manufactured by high precision CNC machine from aerospace grade aluminum with anti-abrasive, anti-corrosive, and anti-reflective military spec Type III hard anodized exterior finish, MD2 Xenon DuoLight is rugged and durable for illumination in the most critical environments. The anti-reflective finish reduces glare and minimizes signature in ensuring stealth. MD2 Xenon DuoLight is preconfigured with TR3 straight-cord tri-mode remote pressure pad switch. Positioned in momentary mode, the light can be activated by pressing the pad on the back. Turn tail-cap slightly to position in constant-on mode. Constant-on switches light on continuously without pressing, and is also useful in the event of remote pressure pad or cord failure. The pentagonal shape tail-cap facilitates rotation for operating the switch mechanism, including positioning the switch in lockout mode. This tail-cap is compact and light-weight, allowing the system to have better form factor. An independent recessed push ON/OFF tail-cap switch easily activates the side LED light. The pentagonal shape tail-cap facilitates its rotation for placing the remote tail-cap switch in safety lock-out position. Additional tail-caps are available for alternate methods of operation. Optional conversion heads are available for the primary light in meeting your mission-specific needs. The unit can be easily serviced in the field with a Field Service Kit, including the option of replacing the front tempered glass lens if it is damaged during an unexpected frontal impact."

Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps.The pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame. The barrel is high quality stainless steel and uses a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range.

A 33” (838mm) barrel version is available in the single-shot Standard as well as an M1 configuration that includes a 5-round detachable magazine and a 24” (610mm) barrel option.

The chassis of the rifle includes a pistol grip, a newly designed bipod, and a stock that features a screw-adjustable monopod in the butt of the stock with an adjustable spike. The recoil pad can be adjusted vertically as well as for length of pull and an adjustable cheek piece allows for ideal cheek-weld.SCOPE PICTURED IS NOT INCLUDED.   IF INTERESTED IN SCOPE PLEASE CALL REDACTED   Learn more at SteyrArms.com"

Just found it the other day. It could use a little oil and some working. I do not have any CO2 to test it, but if the seals have gone bad it has a new set sitting a bag with it. Also included but not pictured is a cleaning rod and take down tool. I don't think there is anything wrong with it that can't be fixed by a good cleaning and lube but I am selling it as is. I don't have time to play with it anymore. Shoots .177 pellets or BBs (must use lead BB's as the barrel is rifled ) It's a hard to find collectible that they don't import anymore so no crazy low ball offers. Shipping is $19.95 with insurance.
I would consider trades Maybe for black powder pistols or other interesting items but cash is king. Can ship anywhere it's legal."

Front strap checkering in a new 30-lines-per-inch pattern with bordered base ensures a positive grip, and the Carry melt treatment rounds and blends edges so they will not hang up on clothing or holsters. Standard Kimber features like match grade barrel, chamber and trigger, beveled magazine well and bumped and grooved grip safety boost accuracy and speed. Three sizes are offered, covering everything from duty to personal protection and even backup. Carry a Kimber Covert, and don’t be afraid of the dark.

The Savage Weather Warrior features the synthetic Accustock® that beds the receiver against aluminum pillar blocks to eliminate any change in point-of-impact due to wet weather. A free-floated, stainless steel barrel eliminates any pressure on the barrel as it heats up to further enhance consistency. Savage's AccuTrigger® is easily adjustable by user to get a light, crisp release with no creep, while a lever mounted within the trigger body blocks the sear unless the trigger is intentionally pressed in the center, virtually minimizing the risk of accidental discharge. The basic bolt design assures that the locking lugs fully contact the receiver, holding the headspace to a minimum every time the bolt is locked. A 3-position receiver tang safety is easy to reach with the shooter's thumb, and allows the rifle to be loaded and unloaded in the safe position. A detachable magazine provides quick and safe reloading and unloading. The stainless steel receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts.

Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

The ARX100 is completely ambidextrous; each side of the rifle virtually mirrors the other. This not only accommodates right- and left-handed shooters, but also shooters who need to engage targets from either shoulder while making the best use of cover and concealment. A magazine release and selector switch are located on both sides of the receiver as well as an ejection port. The 7-lug bolt head has 2 extractors positioned exactly opposite of one other. By selecting right or left ejection, the unused extractor is fixed in place and serves as the ejector. Shooters can go from shooting with right-hand ejection to left-hand ejection in a matter of seconds—without tools. The cold hammer forged barrel can be removed and replaced with various lengths and calibers in a matter of seconds, without the removal of the fore-end or action disassembly. Each barrel carries a self-contained gas-piston assembly designed for its specific length. The ARX100 semi-automatic rifle operates via a short-stroke gas system, which makes the rifle easier to maintain clean for reliable function, and it also allows the use of a side-folding, 4-position, adjustable buttstock that folds to the right. Operating controls are accessible when the buttstock is folded, and the rifle can be fired in this state. The buttstock is comfortable and quick to adjust; a nonslip rubber buttpad provides a solid weld to the user's shoulder. 4 web sling slots, 1 rotating sling swivel in front of the gas block, and 4 QD swivel sockets provide a multitude of sling carry options. The Beretta ARX action is completely housed in a lightweight, molded technopolymer shell, with a 1-piece, continuous top rail that allows the shooter to use a variety of tactical sights and magnifiers in tandem. Picatinny rails on both sides and under the fore-end offer countless possibilities for attaching lights or other tactical accessories. The Beretta ARX 100 comes equipped with removable, flip-up sights. The rotating-post front sight is adjustable for elevation and windage. The rear sight features a dial aperture that's adjustable for distances out to 600 meters. The Beretta ARX100 Semi-Auto Rifle is extremely simple to fieldstrip without tools, and there are no pins to lose. Comes with one 30-round Beretta magazine, and uses standard AR-15/M-16 magazines.
