The Remington Model 700 is a rifle with no equal, and a superior performer in every way. Its accuracy and dependability have become the standard by which all other centerfire rifles are measured and continually fall short. Still the most accurate rifle out-of-the-box, the Model 700 brings its famous action and renowned consistency to this diverse family of guns—its strong, smooth action, consistent accuracy, classic beauty and unequaled value have made The Model 700 BDL the hunter's favorite for 40 years. The high-gloss American walnut stock is enhanced by a distinctive black fore-end cap, Monte Carlo comb with raised cheek piece, and generous skip line cut checkering.

This rifle has the famous Savage Accutrigger, which is adjustable all the way down to 1.5lbs, if you're so inclined. It really is a great rifle, and the bolt is rather slick. The large bolt handle makes it easy to do quick reloading. I haven't gone hog hunting in many years, though, so I don't really take this rifle out as much as I should. I bought this new in 2013, and as a rough estimate put maybe 200 rounds downrange with it. More pictures available upon request.Asking 450 cash. Not really interested in trades, sorry. Preferred location of transfer would be at local police station parking lot. Texas DL/CHL required."

At one point a Dane County Sheriff asked where I bought the rifle-he was clearly as impressed as I was. A fellow range goer yelled ""You're blowin' my skirt up over here!""The gun comes with the followin;-Troy Industries Battle Rail-Installed Lower Rail-Folding (hardened aluminum) front grip-Tactical/retractable bipod (hardened aluminum)-UTG 3-9X32 BugBuster Scope, AO, RGB Mil-dot, QD Ring-Factory box-Factory manuals,etc.If you're in the market for a customized AR10/LR .308 at an unbelievable price, look no further.

The stock is currently showing some flaking of the clear coat. Apparently this is a common problem and Legacy Sports (parent company of Howa) replaces the stock for FREE.

In addition to the scope, like new, with box, you get:1. A video recording SD card for the digital recording features (may or may not include video of the UT cheerleaders practicing on a topless beach). 2. A removable 3x magnifier (shown attached in photos) that makes this a 9-36x scope. Though the 9x with magnifier is absolutely perfect.3. The original medium ranger illuminator that comes with the unit, but then a great long range 940 nm IR long range, adjustable torch (shown attached in photos). This is a Uniquefire UF-1503 940nm IR Led Flashlight 50mm Lens T50 Torch for Night Vision Hunting. This has a CGG attachment point.4. 3 of the expensive rechargeable batteries for the long range IR Torch.5. A small, grey, high output long lasting, brand new, rechargeable battery pack that can directly plug in bypassing the unit's batteries. 6. The wires and adaptors you need to port out the contents of the scope to your TV or monitor.7. Adaptors to allow you to use common AAA batteries for the IR torch, in case you are taking on hords of zombies and can't find new batteries.This is a great deal at $500, with about 800 dollars worth of great stuff here, all like new. I love this sight, but bought a neat little PVS for way too much, and now I have to pay off that debt before the wife balances the books. I can't keep both.Incidentally, it looks amazing on a HK93 clone, like the C93. Those are hard to come by, but the perfect companion to the X-Sight. You can clamp it on there with the QD attachment I put on the weaver base of the X-sight. Willing to ship, if you pay for the shipping, since I have to beg the love of my life to take it down to the UPS store while I am working; and she will then know I sold something, and thus demand her share (110%) of my fun money, just saying; she better be glad she is so damn cute. Any questions don't hesitate to ask. I am asking $500."

You could take this rifle apart and not be able to tell it was shot.  This rifle would need to be transferred legally so we would have to get this transferred to you at a gun dealer and you will have to pass a background. I'm willing to pay for the transfer.

It has about 200 rounds through it (just enough to get the gas system working, and ensure it functions properly). My ex-marine brother (who was a DM) could hit a 2foot by 2foot target at 200 yards from a standing position every time without shouldering it, with only a cheek weld.
