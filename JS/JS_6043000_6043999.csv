I'm looking to sell or trade my Kokura-Marked Type 44 Cavalry Carbine. The rifle is in it's factory state, without modifications. The Wood furniture is in fair condition, and the metal has lost some bluing but is otherwise intact. The bore is darkened, but the rifling is very sharp. Bolt locks and cycles smoothly, the bayonet folds in and out solidly, and there seems to be no major external or internal damage. The majority of the rifle is matching, as the front assembly, receiver, barrel, tang, trigger, and stock all match. The rear sight does not match the rifle, but all parts match. Other parts, like the magazine plate, bayonet release button, and bolt assembly are non-matching.Interestingly enough, this is the first production model of the Type 44, made in the early 30s, and the bolt is marked as the 22nd manufactured at the Kokura company. More photos can be seen here:http://imgur.com/a/Gp3rCFeel free to give me an offer.
I am willing to ship.If curious, I also have general information about the history of this specific rifle. It has a 1st production run bayonet lug, and with the exception of the bolt and small parts, all matches as number 962. It was manufactured in the Kokura Rifle manufacturing plant, likely in 1933. This rifle is not only very rare, but it is made even more rare by it's extremely low production number, the bolt is actually numbered as #22, the 22nd bolt manufactured for the Type 44. From here, there is no documented history for the rifle, but it is extremely likely that it was then used by Japanese Cavalry in the late invasion of Manchuria and saw extensive service as a cavalry rifle in the Japanese Manchuko Imperial Army, which can be speculated based on the grooving on the right side of the stock which shows that it thoroughly used by cavalry during this period. After the outbreak of WWII in 1940, it is likely that this rifle was re-arsenaled and expected to be repaired, but simply was not based on the lack of resources and left in an arsenal until the end of the war. From here, it was likely captured and brought back to the states, where the chrysanthemum marking was partially defaced (something a Japanese soldier would not do) based on an order from General McArthur. It must have been brought back following WWII, because it also lacks an import stamp. While all of this is purely research-based speculation, I am fairly confident that this is the rich history of the rifle."

Now I am and want to sell quickly, hence the excellent price. The .45 version has a better trigger too.

Only areas that don't look showroom new are on the barell hood at the ejection port (happens first few times you rack one) and slight mark from swiveling the take down lever, which again happens the first time you take one down. Pics make it look like wear on the muzzle, but that is just due to the angles (carry melt?) Sig put on the slide at the muzzle.This gun is an awesome shooter that eats all ammo!!! I love it, but have plenty already and this one just sits. Approx 130 rounds through it. IMPORTANT NOTES:- I'm located in Winter Park and must meet locally. I am busy as a beaver 7 days a week. Can not and will not drive.- You must be a Florida resident. I can't and will not sell to someone not a Florida resident. It's illgal for me to do so, please so don't ask.- You can not be a felon- I will not ship it- No ammo included. What's mentioned above is all thats included. First person with $425 takes it.

It is based on the Bushmaster M17 with some significant updates and modernization – including a more robust bolt, aluminum lower, picatinny rails, and superb trigger. On almost every other model of bullpup you will need to spend a few hundred to bring the trigger pull below 10 or 12 pounds – on this rifle the trigger is 4-5lbs, and breaks beautifully. Barrel length is 18”, overall length just over 27”. The muzzle device is a JP Enterprises Tank Brake, but a Yankee Hill Machine flash hider is also included. Recoil is mild either way, accuracy is excellent. I was regularly pinging plates at 300 yds at Rio Solado. Additions to the rifle include a Leupold Mark AR scope in a Burris PEPR mount. It is a 1.5-4X optic with superb clarity. The forward grip is a Grip-Pod, the aluminum-reinforced military model. Use the foregrip to keep your hands clear of the muzzle, and deploy the bipod when you’re prone or over cover. The light is an Inforce WML – bright, low-profile, and features a lock-out option. The rifle has had 200-300 rounds through it, all brass cased factory ammo. The rifle takes every AR15 mag from PMAGs to Surefire 100rd mags and drums. It features a bolt hold open like an AR, and a non-reciprocating charging handle that can be moved to the right side if you prefer.Overall, a light, accurate, reliable full-power rifle in a SBR-sized package, actively supported by the manufacturer.Located in the East Valley.Price is $1400. Willing to trade for an FN Five Seven, would consider partial trades of Remington Model 8/81 or Winchester 1907.Contact via email or text to REDACTED"

Selling my TGI imported early Chinese SKS with the blade bayonet. According to the serial number, it was made around 1962. These rifles are Chinese made but most likely imported into the US from the Balkans conflicts. All numbers match except for the bolt assembly and top cover. The stock is incredibly worn with a lot of interesting ""trench art"", nice star on the side. Bluing is totally worn out as well but the bore is still beautiful and shiny without rust or pitting! Definitely not a display collection piece but this rifle is a handy shooter and would be good as a deer rifle or truck gun that you won't be afraid to throw around. The sights are dead on and I do about 4"" groups at 100 yards off sandbags as a novice shooter using cheap steel cased ammo. Since I've had it, I have shot around 350 rounds through it with not one single failure. I've kept it cleaned after every shooting session.
I actually love this rifle but am willing to let it go to fund other projects.
 
Comes with freebies:
Chinese SKS bandolier and sling, both in excellent condition. I'll throw in a shotgun style bandolier too (Always fun to load individual rounds from the top out in the field)
30 stripper clips
Brand new cleaning kit located in buttstock
 
$300 firm. Cash only. No trades or shipping. Price is firm. Lower offers will be ignored as I do not need to sell the rifle. I can meet weekdays after 6pm or weekends before noon around Saint Paul (Midway area). Sorry, I am not willing to drive out for this one since it's a cheap rifle. First come first serve. Please communicate.
 
Must show valid PTP/PTC and ID to purchase. No exceptions! Thanks for looking!"

I'm asking a fair price of 50 cents per round, which is fair considering I can meet you half way anywhere in Columbus on a weekend and you won't pay the shipping that makes it more like .60 a round.I can't give a definite round count because I'm not physically near the ammo but can check on it over the weekend."
