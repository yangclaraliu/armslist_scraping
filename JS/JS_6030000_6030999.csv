Restoration was started by the previous owner. He did the floorpans and one side, the other side is cut out for new panels. Several pieces of new sheet metal from Moss Motors are included: front and rear lower fenders, sill panel inner and outer parts. The engine ran when pulled but has sat in a barn a few years (still had oil in it when I brought it home) you can even have the engine stand it came on. It looks like the whole car's present, just in pieces.It does have a clean Indiana title, it rolls, it should all be there. The new sheet metal's worth it, plus the glass and usable bits if you don't want to restore the whole thing. I'm looking to have the space back right now.Price is OBO. First person with cash gets it.

Our gym is www.RefugeAndStrengthFitness.comWe have 4 racks available for sale. 4 tops and 4 bottoms. I would like to sell each as a complete unit but they don't have to be sold that way. these are manufactured by spacesaver and are military grade. usually these are not available to the public. The unit are completely modular to hold long guns and pistols, with shelving for ammunition, optics, etc. These units are very secure as they weigh over 500 pounds but they can be bolted to the ground for extra security. Each unit has two doors that collapse and swing to the sides for easy access but lock top bottom and center for security. the lower portion of the unit is the larger piece with the dimensions of around 62""H x 43""W x 16""D. The upper portion is the smaller unit with dimensions around 35""H x 43""W x 16""D.If both units are purchased from spacesaver they would cost around $2,500- $3000. These were donated to our gym so we are asking $1,250 per unit OBO (1 large bottom and 1 smaller top unit). These units are brand new never used. the only scratches are from moving them one time to our storage area to sell. please text or call if you have questions. the photos that are empty are the ones of the actual units in I'm selling. the other photos are just to show some configurations as I found these photos on the Internet."

Just don't have time or the energy to finish restoring it... The gun does fire... It's only missing the inner ammo tube and some TLC... you can buy an original replacement tube for around 60$ ... This rifle has the potential to be an amazing firearm in the right hands... Asking 250$ but will consider any offer.. email me with any questions and for more photos.

It was developed to compete against Glock and Beretta for a pistol contract for the US Special Forces that congress pulled the funding for half way through testing.

With the right federal license it will fit a front pistol grip on the gun’s rail. This pistol has very low recoil, great for someone looking for that.
Comes with two 17 round mags, and a simple right-handed blackhawk holster. This gun is in spectacular condition, only wear marks are on the typical spots like the barrel.  $625MSRP asking for $300 firm or trade (read below). I can email more pictures of the pistol if requested. I am interested in a decent trunk gun like a 357/38 revolver (2-4 inch barrel), a .22LR revolver, very very very interested if you have a Russian Nagant revolver or even a hybrid cash trade for a Hi-Point pistol. I am interested in other trunk guns too, like an other small 9mm handgun or 12 gauge shotgun. Please no carbines, AR-15 parts or any rifles. My range does not allow them.  Not interested in any other item for trade. Cash or the items I listed only.
