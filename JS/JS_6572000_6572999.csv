 From my private collection, a GP100 Matte Stainless Steel Wiley Clapp TALO Limited Edition 357 Revolver.  Came with Novak sights with front Green Fiber Optic.  From what I have found only 2000 were produced and the stainless is the more coveted finish.  GP100's are built like tanks and this TALO limited edition is no exception.  Accurate and extremely easy to shoot, especially in 357 Magnum.  Of course you can also shoot 38's to save a little on ammunition.  This is one of my favorite revolvers but I have my eye on something else so it is up for sale so that someone else has the opportunity to own this special pistol.  Includes everything exactly as brand new.  Price is $775 with no taxes or government paperwork or FFL Transfer fees.
 I do my research and price considerately.  Low ballers will be simply be ignored. If you are familiar with this pistol, then you already know what a rare find this would be to own.
 Must meet all legal requirements, be over 21 and an Ohio resident for Ohio Private Sale.  I keep records of all my firearm transactions so be prepared to provide a copy of your driver's license or CCW.
 NO Trades Considered at this time."

The exit ports are not threaded completely through to eliminate the possibility of the screw being over turned into the chamber. This feature also allows the screw to “bottom out” increasing tightness and ensuring that it will not work itself out under the pressure of the gasses being released by the weapon.  The Effin-A Compensator MKII weighs in at only 2.5 ozs; which is half the weight of the previous version. Allen Key, crush washer, and set screws are included.Price is $65 including Priority Mail shipping, with payment via PayPal.  You can also pick it up in Martinsville and pay cash.  No Trades."

Original barrel weight is still attached. adjustable stock. These are impossible to find to begin with and this is the only one I know/seen of with a factory Left Hand Stock(these were made with right hand bolt only). These were build as competition rifles and were highly regarded, more so than Anschutz MS rifles. Due to Walther's poor marketing for this platform - it never stole that market share from Anschutz, despite being a better rifle. Yes, I also own Anschutz Super Match - so its easy to compare. Very few in the North America. This one was imported from Sweden.additional images:

529,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6572529,For Sale:  Japanese Type 26 Revolver c. 1921,"Panama City, Panama City, Florida",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, March 11, 2017",Handguns,Taurus                                                                                ,22 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The Imperial Japanese military came late to officially adopted sidearms with adoption in the late 1870s of the Smith & Wesson break action revolver in .44 Russian caliber. A decade later, the Japanese determined that a domestically produced sidearm was needed and in 1888 the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal began research and development into a replacement. The final design was completed in 1893 and adopted in 1894.Ordinarily, Japanese military firearms are typed according to the year of adoption by the military. The new sidearm is an exception, however, because the weapon has been officially referred to as the Type 26, referring to the 26th year of the reign of Japanese Emperor Meiji. Technically, with the adoption of the new revolver on March 29, 1894, the weapon should have been referred to as the Type 27, but the Type 26 became the official name.The new revolver design was based on several existing revolvers designs of the late 19th century. The top-break system is similar to, and undoubtedly based on, the earlier Smith & Wesson design. The simple internal lock mechanism and opening side plate are based on the Austrian Rast & Gasser revolver. And the break-actuated extraction system and trigger design are based on the British Mark I Webley revolver.The Japanese Type 26 Revolver is generally known as having very good fit and finish and is also known for its two principal shortcomings. The first is that the revolver is double-action only, which reduces accuracy for single shots and requires a long, heavy trigger pull. The second shortcoming, which is much more serious for a military firearm, is the cylinder stop design. In the Type 26, the cylinder stop only engages the cylinder notches once the trigger is moved to the rear and the hammer has begun its rearward travel. Once the trigger is released after the weapon has been fired, the cylinder stop recesses into the frame and the cylinder is free to revolve. This is a problem because the cylinder can revolve through rapid movement of the revolver or brushing against something such that the when the trigger is pulled the cylinder can come to rest in the firing position on an empty chamber.Although the shortcomings of the Type 26 were serious in a military sidearm, these were somewhat offset by the ease of disassembly for cleaning and repair. The Trigger Guard is first to the rear and downward. This releases the Side Plate, which opens to the rear. Most Type 26 Revolvers I have observed have scratched and dented finger recesses at the side plate, which occurs when someone unfamiliar with disassembly of this weapon attempt to pry the side plate open while the trigger guard is still attached. This particular Type 26 has a perfect recess.The Type 26 fires a thin-rimmed 9mm x 22mm centerfire cartridge with a lead, unjacketed bullet. The standard military round used a 149-grain bullet firing at a relatively slow 500 feet per second.The Type 26 was only manufactured at one location, the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal at Koishikawa, Tokyo. In terms of military firearms, the total production run of Type 26 Revolvers was very small with only 59,227 being produced from 1893 to 1925. All Type 26 Revolvers can be categorized into five distinct types, based on Harry L. Derby, III’s and James D. Brown’s definitive work, “Japanese Military Cartridge Handguns 1893-1945,” and these are limited early production with no external markings, limited early production with external markings but no serial number, standard production, limited modified final production and arsenal reworks. This particular Type 26 is serial number 55499, which places this in the standard production category.Type 26 production officially ended in 1925 but, for all intents and purposes, Type 26 production stopped on September 1, 1923, when the “Great Kanto Earthquake Disaster” occurred. The earthquake, measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale, devastated Tokyo and killed 144,000 people. As a result, the remaining Type 26 production at the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal was very small with 400 revolvers manufactured in 1923, 60 revolvers in 1925 and 200 in 1925. Although an exact year of production cannot be ascertained because production records no longer exist, the approximate year of production of this Type 26 is 1921 or 1922.Due to the nearly three decades of production of the Type 26, the serialization and marking of these revolvers changed over time. Beginning at approximately serial number 40,000 and continuing through the balance of the standard production category, the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal used both serial numbers and assembly numbers that were not linked to the revolver’s serial number. These assembly numbers were assigned in repeating consecutive series that ran from 0 to 999.The Side Plate retains 99% of its original blue finish. The Side Plate hinge is still tight and swings smoothly. As noted previously, the knurled portion of the finger groove area of the Side Plate is in very fine condition with no marring, which is seldom found on these Revolvers. The Sideplate Hinge Screw has an unmarred single slot, convex head and it retains 100% of its original blue finish.Both the Mainspring and the Rebound Lever (and Rebound Lever Screw) remain in their original bright finish. There is no pitting on these parts. The cylinder advance Hand retains its original bright finish with no pitting noted. The Extractor also retains its original bright finish with no wear or pitting noted. The Trigger retains 95% of its original temper blue finish on the back arch and pivot arm and it retains 90% of its original blue finish on the front arch. The Trigger Guard retains 95% of its original blue finish with wear noted on the sharp, outer edges and on the bottom of the bow from holster wear. The forward, cylinder portion has the assembly number “36” and the top of the latch portion has the assembly number “1.” The crosshatching on the outer rear portion shows wear only to the topmost diamonds with the rest retaining all of its original blue finish.The Barrel retains 80% of its original charcoal blue finish with the balance worn to a pewter or plum patina from holster wear. The Front Sight is present and retains considerable original finish in the protected lee with holster wear noted on the sharp edges and on the edge of the front sight pin. The bore has strong rifling with a mirror finish and no pitting. The Barrel Crown is unmarred and retains original blue finish near the bore entrance. The bottom of the Barrel near the hinge point has the assembly numbers “36” and “47.” The Hinge Pin Screw has a single slot, convex head and is unmarred and it retains traces of the original temper blue finish. The Barrel Hinge Pin has generally worn from holster wear to a pewter patina but is unmarred. The Barrel Latch retains 100% of its original blue finish with no wear noted on the knurled ends. The Barrel Latch Spring Plunger exhibits no wear and retains all of its blue finish.The Extractor Cam retains the majority of its original blue finish with little wear noted. The Extractor Release retains the majority of its original blue finish with wear noted on the sharp corners of the disengage shoulder. The Extractor Release Tension Spring shows no wear and retains all of its original temper blue finish.The Cylinder exhibits holster wear on the outer surfaces but retains the majority of its original blue finish in the cylinder lock recesses and in the cylinder lightening cuts. The forward face of the Cylinder retains the majority of its original blue finish. The rear face of the Cylinder retains virtually all of its original blue finish with assembly numbers “47” and “9” on the face. All six chambers are very clean and exhibit virtually no firing wear.The Hammer retains 99% of its original bright tempered blue finish, to include the exposed head and the lower cam surfaces. Even the Firing Pin itself retains 99% of its original heat tempered blue finish. The Strut retains 100% of its original blue finish and the Strut Screw, which has an unmarred single slot, flat head, retains 100% of its original blue finish. The Hammer Stirrup retains 100% of its original blue finish and exhibits no wear, even where it engages the mainspring.The Frame retains 98% of its original blue finish with wear noted on the sharp edges on the right side. The internal portions of the Frame exhibit no wear and it retains all of its original blued finish. The back strap portion between the two grip panels has generally worn to a pewter patina. The flat portion of the Frame facing the Cylinder retains 99% of its original blue finish with very minor wear near the firing pin hole and the end of the Extractor where it engages the Hand. The right side of the Frame has the crisp Tokyo Artillery Arsenal mark over the kanji indicating “Type 26” over the serial number 55499.The Right Grip Panel is in mint condition with its original oil finish and no wear to the checkering. There are no cracks or chips noted on the panel. The Right Grip Panels screws are both correctly in the white and there is no marring or pitting on either single-slot, flat head screw. The left panel is also in fine condition with its original finish and no wear on the checkering. There are no cracks or chips noted on this panel. The interior portion of the left grip panel has the assembly number “84.” Both Grip Panels fit securely in the frame when assembled."

IF YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DIAGNOSING, CORRECTING AND ENSURING THE SAFE OPERATION OF THIS WEAPON YOU SHOULD NOT BUY IT FROM ME OR LOAD IT OR OPERATE IT.On occasion upon firing, a portion of the brass shell casing will fail as shown in the third picture. I estimate this happens 2 or 3 times out of each 10 rounds fired, and does not seem to be affected by the type or brand of ammunition, whether it is loaded by hand or from the magazine, or any other factor I have examined. Although this condition has not caused any injury or, as far as I can tell, any further damage to the weapon, it is obviously a potentially unsafe condition. At the very least, it is an annoyance since the weapon will not extract or eject the ruptured casing. Therefore, I am offering this for sale only as a complete set of parts, or as a candidate for repair.OK, so that said – this is a complete weapon in very good cosmetic condition. The second picture shows a small scratch on the right side of the stock below the bolt, and while it is barely visible, this is the most noticeable mark on the weapon – in short, it is very presentable. The action is quite smooth, the trigger is crisp and adjustable. It has good adjustable iron sights, and the top of the receiver is grooved to accept scope rings.Here is the manufacturer site about this weapon – http://www.zastava-arms.rs/en/civilianproduct/smallbore-rifle-mp-22The sale includes the weapon as described, one five round magazine, and one ten round magazine. 25 bucks and it's yours – heck just the magazines are worth more than that.Buy it from me and have it today – no sales tax, no dealer fees, etc. I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I'm willing to ship at buyer's expense. I will be offering a few other things, so check out my other listings and let's make a deal!* SALE PENDING *"

The holster another $125-150.  It is a cool piece of history.  It has a 6 digit serial number and all the numbers match. It has the make all in capital letters. There is some bluing still on it, but it definitely shows its age. Has the wood checkered grips that military issue had. All correct for what it is.

This is the classic version of the PTR 91, with black polymer stock and handguard. I am the third owner, and have no complaints about this rifle. It shoots like it is supposed to, which means it's a battle rifle and not marksman's gun. I can do about a 3"" inch group at 100 yds, bench rest on a good day. It operates with a direct blow-back action, so it is not friendly to spent brass. One thing that I think is pretty cool about this particular rifle, is that it's stamped with PTR's original location in Farmington, CT, before they moved to South Carolina in the face of Connecticut's anti-gun legislation. To me, that makes it kind of collectible. It also has an enhanced recoil buffer, and the aftermarket flash hider you see in the pictures. I will sell this gun with the tri-rail front hand guard that came on it from the preceding owner, and a half-dozen box mags, most of which are original HK-made. There is also a clamp-on picatinny rail if you want to mount a scope. I rate this rifle in very good condition, but see for yourself."
