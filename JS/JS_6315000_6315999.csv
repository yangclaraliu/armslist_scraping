Sights and trigger added By PointBlank Range.
 
The Apex Duty/Carry Kit for the s&w M&P Shield was designed to provide the Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent trigger pull that is approximately 2 lbs lighter (based on variations in factory tolerances) with the advantages of shorter over-travel and more detectable trigger reset.
 Results – Reduces trigger pull by approximately 2 lbs. – Smooth uptake and reset– Reduces reset length– Reduces over-travel"

The Kadet adapter features all-steel construction and an adjustable rear sight.Included are (2) 10-round magazines that fit flush with grips of the full size CZ 75 and SP-01 models.  The Kadet conversion kit will work on the CZ 75 full-size and compact models including the 75, 85, SP-01, 75 Compact, P-01, P-06,  and PCR, but note that the full-size magazines will extend out of the bottom of the shorter grips on these models. The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models. Pre-B model 75s may or may not function with the Kadet due to differing magwell dimensions.When used on an aluminum-framed compact model (PCR, P-01 and P-06) as well as the steel-framed Compact .40, a specific slide-stop is required for proper last-round hold-open (part number REDACTED, available at no charge through our parts department). On 85 models, the 85 slide stop must be used but will not enable last-round hold-open.When used in competition-oriented or modified 75 series pistols like the Shadow, a factory-weight 75 mainspring may be required to provide proper primer ignition.The above description is from CZ directly and photos are stock photos."

The Model 642LS is a variation on the Model 42 Centennial Airweight® that integrates the time-tested features of the original with modern advancements.

The Creed offers a reinforced polymer frame with signature ergonomics that shooters have come to expect from Walther. The Creed features a pre-cocked double-action trigger system and a bobbed hammer that ensure a no-snag draw from a concealment. This system provides the shooter with a light and smooth trigger pull, consistent from the first shot to the last.

With an ambidextrous magazine release, low profile steel 3-dot sights, and front and rear cocking serrations on the slide, Walther refused to compromise on the quality or features of the Creed."
