It had no visible hammer; the bolt rotated when operated by the lever, locking up with three lugs just aft of the chamber similar to a bolt action. It fed from a 4-shot detachable box magazine. Its 22"" barrel—a 19"" carbine was available as well—had a featherweight profile leading to the rifle’s 7 1/4-lb. weight. Cartridges ejected from the side, allowing a scope to be mounted center over the bore. To cap it off the one-piece walnut stock with a pistol grip borrowed much of its lines from the bolt-action rifles of the day, sleek and fast-handling. Winchesters marketing guys even called it the “bolt action rifle with a lever.”"

Features an engraved FTW logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).Ergonomically pleasing stock features a soft rubber buttpad with buttpad spacers that allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters or varying levels of outerwear (three 1/2"" spacers included).The Ruger® Muzzle Brake System includes a removable, radial-port muzzle brake that significantly reduces felt recoil. For times when the brake is not preferred, it may be replaced by the included dynamically-matched muzzle weight.

This gun was worked on by Rowland Gunsmith and .460 Rowland conversion was installed by Rowland. This gun has been test fired by Rowland to ensure operation of 460 and 45 ACP .  Both work like a charm.  SHooting 45 ACP out of this gun feels like shooting a .22 .  Very accurate !  No trades, I originally paid 1200 for Kimber 1911 than it cost me another $450 bucks for the 460 Rowland Conversion. I am into this gun for overb $1600 so $750 is pretty fair.  If you are interested please text or call John REDACTED"
