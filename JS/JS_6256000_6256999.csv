These KS-47s are basically an AR platform that is chambered in 7.62x39, and accepts any AK magazine. Way cheaper to shoot than firing 5.56 or 223, plus much more punch! If you're unfamiliar with these rifles, check out the video on youtube (PSA KS47 -vs- CMMG Mutant).The Palmetto State Armory KS47 is based on the AR15, and combines the modular construction, accuracy and precision of the AR platform with the stopping power and the magazine options of the AK. While the current AR47 fires the 7.62x39 AK round, it uses modified AR-style magazines that are not nearly as plentiful as AK-style magazines, that were optimized for reliable feeding of the 7.62x39 round. The KS47 lets the AK shooter capitalize on his inventory of magazines and ammo with an AR-style platform. Unlike the AK, where the barrel is permanently pressed into the receiver, the KS47 features an AR-style modular configuration which consists of a barreled upper receiver, and a lower receiver that houses the fire control group and magazine. The modular configuration allows customers to have several different barrel configurations with one lower receiver, just by releasing two pins. Lower: The 7075-T6 billet lower receiver is hardcoat anodized, and accepts standard AR15 fire control groups. The extended magazine release is outside of the trigger guard for safety, which allows for an AK-style release movement, but also features oversize side paddles for fingertip release by the trigger finger. Fitted with a Ergo grip and M4-style stock, the receiver also features a standard, mil-spec diameter, 6 position, 7075 carbine buffer tube. The KS47 lower has steel reinforcements to accept AK style surplus magazines including drum-style.Upper: The KS47 hybrid upper receiver is precision machined out of billet 7075 T6 aluminum, and then hardcoat anodized for durability. While retaining the look of a standard M4 upper, the KS47 hybrid upper is designed to work with either the KS47 lower, or the standard AR47 lower. The chrome moly vanadium barrel is chambered in 7.62x39 with a 1 in 10 twist, has M4-style feed ramps, is nitride treated for accuracy and durability, and is finished off with a 5/8-24 thread A2-style compensator. The forward, assist, dust cover, charging handle, and safety are all standard AR15, as is the PSA Slim Keymod free-float rail and barrel nut.BCG: The hybrid KS47 Bolt carrier group works with either AK47 magazines or AR47 magazines, and features an extended firing pin. The carrier is made of 8620 steel, chrome lined and phosphate coated, and the chrome lined gas key is attached with grade 8 bolts and properly staked. The Bolt is made of phosphate coated 9310 steel. The KS47 Upper and Hybrid BCG are compatible with standard AR15 lowers for use with AR47-style magazines.I'm asking $900 for the rifle with one steel or PMAG 30 round magazine (buyers choice). *** Drum magazine in pics is not include with this sell.Private Party DetailsRegistered on 12/30/2013Listings by this userLOCATION: Raeford, Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North CarolinaSHIPPING:NoCATEGORYRiflesMANUFACTURER Palmetto State ArmoryCALIBER 7.62x39ACTION Semi-automaticFIREARM TYPE Rifle"

It is in excellent shape and has been gently used. It also has a smooth bore slug barrel that came with the shotgun. I bought the shotgun new and am the original owner. It is an excellent goose hunting gun with long range knock down capabilities. I have never used the slug barrel, but have  used the shotgun barrel  for deer hunting here in New Jersey. There is suprisingly little kick when discharged and the action is very smooth. It really extends the lethal killing range for whitetails. The only problem is I am getting a little on in years (just turned 70) and it is a little much for me to carry anymore in the woods. There is absulutly no rust or pitting. Butt of stock has a few cosmetic cracks, and overall the gun is a solid 9 out of 10, with 10 being brand new just out of the box."

-Original oil bottle, cleaning rod, cleaning kit, and bayonet.

-Tapco operating rods (2)
-Tapco gas pistons (2)The price shown includes everything listed above. If you do not want the spare parts (2 operating rods and 2 gas pistons), deduct $75 from the price shown.If you've tried to find original SKS parts recently, you know how much those add to the price."

Also includes a custom mount I made for the powder measure and bolts with it too. Quality equipment that has been taken care of.Call or text at (FourTwoThree) SixZeroFive-SevenOneSevenZero.

performance at a price anyone can afford. With its 3” chamber, Mobilchoke barrel, and self-cleaning piston, the A300 is there to get the job done with absolute precision and reliability—whether you go after ducks, geese, turkey, deer, upland birds, or sporting clays. Every A300 is made of the proprietary steel blends that have made Beretta shotguns famous for their durability. The Mobilchoke barrel is designed to shrug off the pounding of heavy hunting loads, giving you a long-lasting tool that will work as hard as you need it to. But in spite of its toughness, the A300 is light, feels lively in the hands and easily follows your eyes to the target, thanks to the low-profile action. Its impeccable balance make it feel even lighter than its 7.25 pounds. In addition, the A300 is highly adaptable with a reversible safety for left-handed shooters and a set of stock spacers included for drop and cast customization. Three choke tubes (F/M/IC) are included.
 
The A300 Outlander Turkey has a 24” barrel and a woodland pattern for turkey hunting. The Outlander Turkey also comes with TruGlo fiber-optic sights and the ability to attach an optic.
