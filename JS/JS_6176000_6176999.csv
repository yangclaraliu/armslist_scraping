Gun was found in this condition in the trunk of a 1932 Ford coupe. Wood was crumbled away metal was rusty and pitted gun was disassembled bead blasted and put away for a future project. But now's your chance to own a piece of firearms history. This rifle is John Browning's first gun that started it all in the original cartridge. I like to think Browning most likely had a part in building this rifle or at least inspected it at the Winchester factory. The rifle is disassembled and complete except for the wood and sight elevator. Metal is pitted but serviceable.

Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.1 new 25rd CMI mag,1 new 20rd Springfield Armory mag & 1 used 5rd Springfield Armory mag & 160rd of ammo"

The only detriment (well,to me,anyway) is someone replaced the original rear sight with a Wilson Combat sight. I suppose it provides a better sight picture, I just like the look of the original better. The slide stop and thumb safety have been replaced also, but since there's no writing on those, I can't say if they're Wilson Combat or not."
