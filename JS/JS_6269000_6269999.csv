The upper is a basic pistol length upper with a 7.5 inch barrel and has a gas pig muzzle cone to help with gas pressure and recoil and it has a key mod hand guard that sticks out far enough to cover up the gas pig. It has magpul flip up sites in dark earth the BCG is a BCM and the charging handle is a BCM gunfighter with the large size latch.The lower was bought as a stripped aluminum del ton lower and a standard parts kit was put in it and has a custom trigger that has a very light crisp pull I'm not sure on the actual pounds of trigger pull, and of course it has a pistol buffer so this AR is considered a pistol by law and is legal with the short length barrel, the grip is a ATI grip that is very comfortable. I am asking 950 and I will throw in brand new 30 round magpul pmag. Please text or call me at REDACTED if interested."

It rolls off your thumb unlike those ridiculous extended mag releases that drop your mag if you accidentally grip too hard. Also included are new in box Trijicon night sights. These were purchased from Palmetto State Armory brand new but taken immediately off the slide because of the SJC rail.

All serial numbers match including bolt, barrel, mag plate, and butt plate. The gun is shown in the pictures with a new recoil pad, but I have the original butt plate. The gun has had extensive accuracy work. This includes Mojo Peep Sights front and real. I couldn't see the original blade sight, so I changed it out with no drilling or modifications and still have the original front and rear sights that were originally on the gun. Also, I floated the barrel and bedded it in cork to improve barrel harmonics and accuracy. I have killed many deer with this gun. The 7.62x54r cartridge has 3 mm more powder than a 308 cal cartridge. Also, you get two ammo pouches, bayonet, cleaning rod, cleaning/tool kit, two compartment oil cal, and Russian sling. The barrel gas has slight frosting in the grooves, but the lands are shiny and the barrel crown has not been counterbored. This does not seem to affect accuracy as almost all Mosin's have frosting from shooting corrosive ammo during the war.  This is a fine example of history and an accurate gun that is a lot of fun to shoot."
