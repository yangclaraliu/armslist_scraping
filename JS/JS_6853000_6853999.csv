(1 - 33 round and 1 - 17 round are KCI) .40 / .357 Sig Glock magazines: 3 - 22 round and 4 - 15 round. (82 rounds in these loaded with what I think is Critical Duty) Gen 4 Glock 34 9mm recoil spring assembly. So to recap: ·FDE G35 with all factory items. 480.00 ·ATS sights. 50.00 ·9mm threaded conversion barrel. 70.00 ·.357 Sig conversion barrel. 70.00 ·Factory 9mm recoil spring assembly. 5.00 ·20 magazines @ 15.00 a piece = 300.00 For a trade value of 975.00 or sell out right for 950.00  If you search these items out and total them up they will come to over 1300.00 and that is using average uninflated pricing.I may be willing to separate items if someone wants the majority of items. Obviously the G35 comes in .40 caliber. To shoot .357 Sig all that's needed is a barrel swap. Everything is identical between the two calibers internally. To shoot 9mm one must use 9mm magazines, change the barrel and swap the recoil spring assembly for one that is rated for 9mm. (There is some debate that the ejector should be changed to a 9mm profiled ejector for the utmost reliability but I haven't had an issue) I can trade up or down and add cash where appropriate. Trade interests are: Threaded barrel or CGW modified CZ P-09 or P-07 CZ P-09 Kadet kit CZ Shadow Target Higher end CZ pistols CZ Evo 6.5 Grendel 20 / 12"" barrels 6.5 Grendel bolts 6.5 Grendel ammunition SWFA / Vortex mil/mil FFP scopes Mil spotting scopes Range finders ADM Recon X 30mm mounts Geiselle 30mm mounts Larue SPR-E 30mm mounts Mildot masters Atlas bipods Shooting mats Geiselle SD-Es Griffin Armament taper mount Flash Comps 1/2 and 5/8"" Griffin Armament taper mount Blast shields in 1/2 and 5/8"" Diversified Machine Suppressor parts Teal Blue Bravo PDQ levers Delta Point Pro I also have 1216 rounds of various .40 ammunition and 82 rounds of .357 Sig for local trade fodder in Central PA.

Straight from the factory that produces weapons for the Russian military. This rifle is the genuine artifact and is no longer imported. It is also considered the best AK on the market.
The rifle for sale has been fully converted to meet 922r compliance. Upgrades include a Tapco G2 trigger group (one of the best on the market for AKs) and performance springs, a Rifle Dynamics (possibly the best AK gunsmiths/company in the country) front post sight that is threaded, a Rifle Dynamics stock adapter that allows any AR style stock to be used, an AK-140US muzzle device, a Magpul pistol grip, and a B5 stock adjustable stock. Also has a Texas Weapons Systems Dog Leg 2 dust cover rail system. This is a high quality dust cover with built in rail making optics mounting a breeze. 
Also included are [one Tapco 20 round magazine, two Tapco 30 round magazines, one Magpul 30 round magazine] and a red dot sight with red and green options.
This rifle was taken on trade due to the other party lacking cash. I took it out for a test fire the other day and I have to say…I absolutely love it! It is a fantastic rifle, extremely reliable, and amazingly accurate. It eats anything you put through it. It is 100% complete and ready to enjoy.  If I didn’t have any projects going I would keep it in a heartbeat. But, I do need the cash so it is on the chopping block.
Mostly looking for cash.  Price is relatively firm. Might consider trades.
