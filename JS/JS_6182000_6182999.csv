The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob.
 
BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits.
 
After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant.
 
The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer.
 
Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles."

I have for sale a used Savage Stainless Laminate thumbhole 10ML-II .50 cal smokeless powder muzzleloader. This Savage shows signs of use such as some discoloration on the receiver from surface rust and scratches in the laminate stock. I have fired this Savage 24 times myself through the new breach plug and it shoots great. I also bought some upgrades for this Savage.
I replaced the breach plug with a factory new from Savage, the 3/8-socket version for ease of removal. I also bought 5 extra vent liners for a total of 6 and a new SpinJag loading ramrod and SpinJag bullet starter. I also added an EGW picatinny scope rail. The barrel looks great and this rifle has the Accu-trigger.
I took this Savage Deer hunting in November of this year to New Hampshire so I have everything you need to shoot included in this sale. I have the Accurate Arms 5744 Smokeless powder, Winchester 209 primers, Hornady 250gr. And Barnes 250gr. MZ Expander bullets, Powder vials for fast easy reload, and a ratchet with socket and extender to remove the breach plug. I also have the fiber optic open sights included.

I suspect the locking lug is worn and would need to be reconditioned by welding and reshaping.   2. the ejector does not latch as it should when locked. it always just is being pushed out by its spring.  From wikipedia, Cooey was bought by Winchester in 1961 and this is similar or the same as a Winchester 840.  Comes with the spare parts I have for the action.

Ships from my FFL to yours. I can ship without magazines if you live in a restriced area, however I do not have any 10 rounders to supply you with. Love the gun, sad to see her go, and as you can see I have absolutely babied her. Only reason I'm selling is I'll never have time to get competitive as I'd planned to when I purchased it and my Glock 19 that I carry every day selfishly eats up all my 9mm. Give her a good home.
