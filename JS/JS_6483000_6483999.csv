LWRC M6 IC-A5 simply put is the Lamborghini of AR Piston system. It doesn’t get any better.  The IC-A5 is the latest model in the IC – Individual Carbine series. The M6 IC-A5 offers an adjustable gas block and the longer 12” SPR style rail system on the same rifle. The low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allows the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of our longer modular rail system. That’s the primary difference between the A5 and their IC / SPR brother and sister models. These guns love running silencers! Gun is in very new condition and as usual is priced FAR under market value. LE / Military pricing through Megan (the LWRC senior LE representative) at LWRC come in at $2150. Dealer cost is same $2150.00. This gun is routinely sold for $2300+. We are offering this at a VERY VERY reasonable price point of $1850.00. You show it to me an LWRC M6 IC A5 ANYWHERE on the internet cheaper and we’ll price match as long as it’s a similar condition firearm.

Needless to say the gun is extremely accurate as are all 1911s. Match grade guts and professional highly durable self-lubricating finish. Literally the only thing this gun could have to be better is upgraded sights. I built this in the regards of a perfectly identical match to a WWI or WWII colt combat 1911 so the sights are still military factory grade black out dove tail sights.I flared the ejection port slightly and throated the barrel slightly. The barrel is not original to the gun and the only other thing I've yet to upgrade but low round count still retains flawless operation and rifling. I've never been able to afford a les Baer, Wilson combat, or STI so this is the closest to get to it without getting a small loan. The slide and the frame were almost 500 together with finish and some small detail work for fluidity and control and everything fits PERFECT. As far as everything else I expect the best. I have a large amount of factory high grade HP .45 ACP that can go along with trades or for purchase with extra $$ but don't low ball me I know what I have in it and it's a hell of a deal especially if you had to do all of this yourself. Cash preferred. Trades considered will b anything except 22 or 40. Guns only please. I don't need a trailer or a motorized skateboard or your neighbors alligator. 9mm 45 10mm or .556 is preferred but I like things that go boom. I would also consider AKs.This gun is almost new condition in fact it still looks brand new other than a bit of the finish on the barrel. Freshly polished. I've debated stripping the bluing off the barrel and polish. It would b a quick fix to make it look brand new.REDACTED txt or call."

Often team members in CQB environments experience concussion from muzzle blast that is not only deafeningly loud, but also can cause prolonged headaches that can last for days afterwards. Especially effective on short barrels, the unique design of the QD Blast Shield directs concussive force forward allowing an end user to rapidly reconfigure muzzle device function. Ultra strong 17-4PH stainless steel provides a robust material to withstand intense use and full auto fire without fear of failure. Fluted geometry in the triangular shield lightens the unit while providing internal front supports for the muzzle device. Melonite QPQ surface treatment provides an extremely hard, durable, and attractive finish.The QD mechanism is fast, positive, and free of wear prone geometry commonly found in ratcheting devices. The QD Blast Shield also comes with a shim set and overtravel stop to refit your A2 compensator for optimal use. The Griffin QD Blast Shield is compatible with the line of Griffin Armament SDQD mounts in 7.62 and 5.56mm, Including the Flash Comp, Muzzle Brake, Compensating Flash Hider, and Tactical Compensator. It is also compatible with A2 Compensators that fall within the NATO spec blueprinted dimensions. Although many companies manufacture A2 style compensators not all of them are dimensioned properly. Not Compatible with BCM, BCE or PWS muzzle devices. please let me know if you have any questions thanks for looking!"

It would come with an extra magazine as the pistol only comes with one. Also included are a Laserlyte CK-MS laser –no longer made and almost impossible now to find and to my knowledge the only laser sight made for the Plus model.
In addition a Alien Gear OWB holster molded to fit the Bersa Plus with the Laserlyte laser attached, a leather IWB holster and a NRA cordura shoulder holster that both fit the Bersa with the Laserlyte attached. The shoulder holster has pouches on the opposite side to either carry two extra mag’s or a mag’ and a tactical light. Finally I will also include two boxes of the best rated .380 self-defense rounds; a box of Precision One 90 Grain HP/XTP rounds and a box of Buffalo Bore 90 Grain +P rounds. Buffalo Bore’s non-+P rounds didn’t fare so well in tests but the +P round was a completely different story!   
Make no mistake I really like this whole setup and I’m only selling to help fund another purchase of something else I’ve really been wanting.
This package I’m offering is worth much more than my asking price but due to the fact I’m disabled and can’t travel to meet I’m offering what I feel is a great package at a bargain price.
These Plus models have been selling out quickly in stores and if you’re in the market for one don’t miss out on this.
I have my WI Concealed Carry License and WI I.D. and prefer you have the same. Bill of sale will need to be signed also.
I live in Prairie du Chien in Crawford County.
Thanks."

A few days later, I went to load shells into it to test capacity on the 12 gauge aguila mini-shells and realized it wasn't racking them to fire. I took it to the store that I purchased it at in Wilmington (you have a year warranty for the gun with them, they will pack and send the gun to the Kel-Tec Factory for you, saving on overnight shipping fees for a bullpup shotgun). Kel-Tec took its time inspecting and fully cleaning and test firing it. When I got it back, shells were racked through, of various 12 gauge size and it was smooth. I have the factory report and the finding that nothing was damaged, but some new parts were still installed anyway. On the KSG, I have added a removable Pachmeyer Gel Recoil Pad to the butt of the stock.  To be honest, it has a good feel to it and would probably destroy a car with the 12-14 shots you get from 2 3/4' shells or 3' shells. Or better yet, I have 2 boxes of the mini 12 gauge Aguila Shells, since I never fired the gun, I will include them in the purchas as I am interested in a quick and easy transaction process. I live in Wilmington and don't want to drive more than 20-30 minutes. On the plus side, I'm selling a brand new factory tested and cleaned KSG in an awesome color combo witha free pachmeyer recoil pad and 40 rounds of 1.75' minishells or put it in KSG loadout terms,  2 full barrels, fire them all, aand then another 2 full barrels. You want to protect your home and possibly destroy a car one day? This is the shotgun for you. PRICED TO SELL, COMES WITH ORIGINAL BOX, 2 MANUALs, WARRANTIES, STRAP\NECESSARY RINGS AND 40 x 12 GAUGE AGUILA MINI-SHELLS."

(2.5-6#) It has been converted professionally by Gunsmith to accept Accuracy International magazines using a Pacific Tool & Die conversion bottom. He also put on a folding bipod with picatinny rail base and spring-loaded extendable legs at the same time.  The ptd bottom replaces the plastic trigger housing and flimsy magazine well with a solid one piece fully machined from Billet bottom. It uses an AK style paddle magazine release and ACIS type Magazines.  Sporting a much larger trigger guard area for use with gloves, it also greatly improves the solidness of the dual pillar bedding compared to the factory design.    It comes with one 10 round mag but additional magazines are commonly available in 2,3,5,10 and 15 round capacities in both metal and zytel. Trade for nicer 1911 or 800$  oboCan be transferred through my FFL for only $20."
