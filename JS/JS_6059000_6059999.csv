This pistol for sale was maunfactured 6/15/1999 and is now called a Pre-rail version since in 2000 S&W added a rail to the frame for accessories which most S&W enthusiasts don't care for. The Pre-rail versions are highly sought after and now rare in this near perfect condition. The TSW (Tactical Support Weapon) features thicker full length frame rails for enhanced accuracy, and delayed unlocking to reduce felt recoil. That and a dual recoil spring set-up make this a highly controllable soft shooter for accurate follow up shots and comfortable fun at the range. Considered a compact with it's 3.5"" barrel,  I found it's accuracy every bit as good as my full size pistols at all target distances with the Novak Lo-Mount 3 dot sights.Frame construction is lightweight aluminum alloy with a stainless steel slide weighing only 25.7 ozs. empty so this pistol is perfect if you want a handsome carry gun on steroids.  The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short, crisp, and light trigger pull on subsequent shots. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety. The pistol comes with 2 factory 9 round curved baseplate magazines in like new condition in a new plastic case with the original instuction manual. These pistols will also take an S&W 11 round Hi-capacity magazine with flush fit adapter which came standard at one time with the $1500 Performace Center ""Shorty 40"" version of this pistol. I have one pictured and available at $50 additional cost.Please email  or call / text Bill 813 . 857 . 8287 to make an offer or request more photos."

Well not this guy. It's the original model - a Mark I, with low serial number (and much nicer safety!) - estimated to be early 90's. The gun is in great shape as you can see. I am not the original owner but I have taken great care of this guy. Been fun owning but looking for a new adventure! So looking to sell this or trade it for something I don't have (I'm open to all sorts of gun trades so make an offer).As for how this shoots - very well. it's nothing like a .44 mag pistol, which I don't really enjoy. This gun is heavy, so when you shoot it the recoil is minimal - I have small frame friends that love shooting it. You can shoot this for a while and not get sore hands. It's also one of the most accurate pistols there is - if you don't know, a Desert Eagle .44 is actually more like a gas driven AR than it is your typical blowback pistol. So it's very accurate and a ton of fun. And it's in .44 not .50, which means (1) way cheaper ammo and (2) it's actually a manageable and useable gun, the .50 is really a novelty weapon.

The Arkansas Defense Force is different! If you are a kook, racist, or for any form of government (fascism, communism, socialism, etc.) other than the constitutional republic our nation was founded on, or you think overthrowing the Arkansas or US Government is a good idea, this Defense Force is NOT FOR YOU!! We are Patriots and Oathkeepers. We believe in Freedom, not tyranny. We believe strongly in the Bill of Rights. Thomas Jefferson has said 'Every citizen should be a soldier. This was the case with the Greeks and Romans, and must be that of every free state' and 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure' and 'The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed and that they are entitled to freedom of person, freedom of religion, freedom of property, and freedom of press."" John F. Kennedy also remarked, 'Today we need a nation of Minutemen who are not only prepared to take arms, but are citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic purpose of their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and sacrifice for that freedom.' And Winston Churchill said, 'If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you with only a precarious chance of survival. There may be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is not hope of victory at all, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.' We believe in restoring the Bill of Rights. With the economy failing, the constant threat of Terrorism, unemployment rising, false flag attacks, illegal immigration, etc. the time to band together and get ready is now. The Arkansas Constitution defines our responsibility to enforce the law, repel insurrection, repel invasion and to preserve the public peace. We do not hold these four duties lightly. They are the very foundation that we are working for not just for our families, but our society as a whole. We are not enemies with law enforcement and have good relations with local, county, state and federal officers and strive to work together to the highest standard possible.http://www.arkansasdefenseforce.org"

The rifle was made in the USA by Waffenwerks using PSL parts kits, they were modified to accept standard AK furniture rather than the traditional wooden thumbhole stock and forend. The barrel has been cut down to 16"" and has a standard PSL muzzle brake. Of course, the rifle accepts 10-round PSL magazines (1 included).The rifle is in outstanding condition, I have owned it since the Spring of 2011 and have only fired 100 rounds or so. I have cleaned the rifle after each use. The only sign of wear is a line in the glossy finish caused by the manual safety lever. The finish is beautiful, the dimples above the magwell are very attractive, and the black Arsenal polymer furniture suits the rifle very well!This is an excellent addition or start to any AK collection (not even taking into consideration the rarity of this no longer produced firearm), the powerful cartridge is ideal for hunting or DMR applications, and it is just too much fun to shoot! (This things throws some serious fireballs!)Why am I selling it? Honestly, I don't have as much time to shoot as I'd like (as I said, about 100 rounds in nearly 7 years) and it's a shame to have it sit in its case unused. I love to take it out and admire it from time to time, but it's meant for more than that and I am willing to sell for a fair price.I am asking $900 OBO (no trades) this includes the rifle, 1 magazine, a cushioned hard case, and 100 rounds of 7.62x54r.Thanks for your time, email me if you have any questions!"

The upper is a complete Daniel Defense keymod upper with an 18.5 inch barrel that is heavier walled and daniel defense's A2 flash hider. The rail has Midwest Industries keymod rail covers and a handstop up front as well as a vertical foregrip by BCM that is tooless quick attach/detach. The upper was put together by daniel defense and was ordered directly from them with a picitanny rail running the entire length of the handguard. it uses a rifle length gas tube and came with their bolt and charging handle. It was purchased as a complete upper from them I did not put it together.The lower was bought from primary arms stripped and is made by Seekins Precision. It is their SP223 model and has ambidextrous bolt relsease tabs. One on the right that can be reached by the trigger finger and the classic style on the left. It was milled out by seekins from a billet and has a solid, large finger groove for gloved hands. It has a magpul rifle lenght fixed stock with a rifle length recoil spring and rifle length buffer tube. It also has Troy Flip Up Back UP iron sights on it that are the ""HK"" style/pattern and are not made of polymer. It is marked for 5.56 not .233 so you can shoot both 5.56 and .223 ammo out of it.The trigger is Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced Trigger (SSA-E Model) and is very nice for accurate followup shots. If you purchase this you cannot use KNS pins with this geissele trigger. All the other small parts were bought from Rock River Arms to complete out the lower. Lower grip is by magpul as well and houses and small bottle of lubricant. The magpul stock also opens up and has a small storage space.It has a genuine Trijicon ACOG TA31F 4x32 power fixed scope with the red chevron .223 BAC reticle. I have the scope's original case and manual and lense pen. It is mounted on a quick release by GDI and is the R-Com E-Model and I also have the orginal mount for it as well.The rifle comes with the armory tools pictured, some small extra lower parts I had multiples of, practice dummy rounds by magpul, etc..etc..The paint job is Duracoat. If you want it different I was quoted 300-ish dollars by We plead The Second in Tempe AZ to do it in a solid or two tone faded color.I am open to partial trades for a .22 rifle or .22 magnum rifle that is left hand bolt action or left handed Mathews Halon Compound Bow. I could possibly entertain .410 and 12 gauge shotguns for partial trade as well as fishing eqiupment of all kinds but the reels have to be left handed bait casters if you have bait casters to offer. Call or text 2-2-4 - three - eight - three - 4-0-5-1 for more information my name is Andy.The rifle has seen 500 rounds through it.... so not much. I use frog lube or ballistol to clean all my firearms unless they are really dirty and need something more aggressive. I just don't shoot this thing enough and would really rather have money for more hunting oriented stuff and to buy some more fishing gear.Asking $3,000 or best offer."

R. Shaw custom I installed this winter and a custom machined aluminum thread protector.  I took it to the range once and did some breaking in but found the feeding to be finicky.  Sometimes it would shoot great, and other times it would fail to feed correctly.  I just don't have time to mess with it.Magazine release is an aftermarket polymer version, the stock one is also included.The original stock is long gone, and I have the original barrel but I used it to practice barrel threading so it's not viable unless you really wanted it.  It shoots fine but the muzzle crown integrity can't be guaranteed anymore after the machining.  Prior to the barrel change total rounds fired on this rifle would be well under 1000.The scope is just a cheap variable power Simmons 3-9x40 that served me fine for plinking.Payment will be accepted in cash only, and buyer must provide several forms of ID especially voter registration to prove legal status to purchase/own.  I'm open to reasonable offers."

Nice to be able to slide in and out of your pants without having to worry about belt loops. Bought it to fit an M&P9mm, but it also fits my Glock Pistols as well. Weapon locks in and must be ""released"" with your finger depressing the button on the outside. In perfect condition. I've only used it a few times as a backup when my go-to isn't around. Will ship if you pay exact shipping costs and pay Paypal Friends and Family or Venmo or something. Thanks for looking. Check out my other posts."
