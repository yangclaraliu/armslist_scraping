The barrel is crisp with nice sharp rifling and no corrosion or pitting. Comes with the factory magazine. The bluing is probably at 80-90% or so, with a little wear on the end of the barrel and the sharp edges of the slide. If you are not familiar with the Sport King model, it breaks down VERY easy for cleaning.

This is a K-Frame, .357 combat magnum revolver that also has the capability of shooting .38 speicals as well. Included with this gun is the original box, instruction manual, and VCI paper. This is the twin to the Smith and Wesson model 19; only in satin stainless steel. This is a very sought after model with collectors, especially with having the pinned and recessed features and the durable stainless finish. The gun was shipped from the factory sometime around 1979 with a serial # of 42K94xx. This 66 is unmolested; not all highly polished to make it shine like many you will find are from this era. It is in outstanding overall condition with a very faint turn line and very few handling marks. I would rate it at an easy 98%. Timing and lockup of the cylinder are both spot on; very tight. The forcing cone is in excellent condition with no erosion/cracks; virtually no flame cutting on the top strap. This has a plain blackened rear sight blade with red ramp insert on the front sight. The grips are correct, genuine Smith and Wesson K-Frame targets with speedloader cut-out indicative of the year. The label on the box corresponds with serial number and all features mentioned. This is quite a nice package not seen very often. Price is $850.ABSOLUTELY NO SHIPPING!!!Local Face-to-Face transaction in the area.Looking for a WI resident with a valid WI ID. CCW is a plus.Thanks for looking.Smith and Wesson 66"

It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness.   The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot.   The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments.   The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools.   Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions.

This gun has rich, deep bluing that Smith and Wesson was well known for during this time period. The ship date on this was in 1955, with a serial # of S1358xx. The condition of this gun is very good; I would rate it at about 95%, considering it is 62 years old. The finish is all original with no re-work stampings. It has the pinned barrel with recessed cylinder on a 5-screw frame. This N-Frame Smith features a gorgeous checkered top strap, .500"" target hammer, and the Patridge front sight with ""proud pins."" The stocks are not original to the gun, however it comes with a nice set of smooth presentation grips with nice grain. The barrel and cylinder are numbered to the gun from the factory. Timing and lockup of the cylinder are excellent. The action is simply amazing on this one, like butter in both single/double action. The revolver has a minor turn line, very faint muzzle wear, and a few handling marks throughout. The cylinder also has a slight ""plum"" color to it under certain light, however I've read this was due to the bluing process on these older Smith's. This is gun only, no box.

Zeroed it, shot it a bit, and really am not finding much use for it currently. It is a full Yugo rifle, has the nightsite set up though sites are dead, grenade site, though a slight bit cant to it, not that it really useful, also has a standard AK slant brake, which is effective for what it is without deafening the guys next to you. Accuracy is pretty much AK groupings. Guess I don't find the underfolder to be all that useful. Looking at possibly trading it for something else. Looking at trading with 75 rd romanaian Drum. Have 30 rd mags that can be added as well for right offer. Depending on the trade may be willing to add cash, but only if it is something that is worth it. Otherwise not interested. May look at other AKs with either fixed stocks, or side folding.  May look at ARs, or .308 battle rifles. May consider cash sale, but only if the offer is worth my time. Complaining that you could have bought it for what the hell ever in 1989 will get you laughed at and deleted."
