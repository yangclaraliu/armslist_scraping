Looking for a factory ar 15, Offer. Really looking for a colt ar Will throw in a brand new Shockwave Mossberg for a tavor or Daniel defense ar PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONFinally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck.Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws."

As shown in the picture it is stainless and black and comes with the sling swivels and scope pictured as well as two magazines and the spanner wrench to take it apart. Generally these guns sell for around 300 new, I'm asking 180 OBO.In the spirit of full disclosure the gun is not flawless, I've had some problems with light strikes lately. That's not the reason for which I'm selling it, the main thing is that I have other hobbies I'm trying to pursue. The fix to it is to get a replacement firing pin, they're available off Midway USA for about 8 dollars. Even after doing that my asking price is still well under what you'd pay for it at a store. Its useable as is but the firing pin is simply at the end of its life and will need replacing soon. I havent thought about a trade but I guess I'm open to offers."

It is equipped with YHM rails and flip up front sight gas block. Also from YHM it has a phantom muzzle break and extended charging handle. The scope is included and it is a luepold MK AR 6x18 mill dot it sits on American defense quick detach ring mount. As for magpul it has the PRS stock, bad lever and aluminum trigger guard. The factory trigger has been replaced with a CMC tactical drop in trigger. This gun has been fired 122 times and loves 62gr ammo. It is a sub MOA gun out to 300 yards. I have not shot any 75gr but would image it would be worth trying. The barrel is a 1:9 so the 62gr is the sweet spot I believe. If you have any questions please call REDACTED. I am asking $1950.00 OBO What do you have to trade???"

One of the first AR15's ever made. By looking at the bolt it looks like it was fired very little if at all. The mag release was replaced with one that makes the magazine non-detachable so it is NY Safe Act compliant and can be legally owned in NY.  This doesn't hurt the collector value because the original mag release is included in the sale so if you are law enforcement or an out of state buyer you can return it to its original configuration with ease. I can send detailed pictures upon request. My FFL is going to list this on gunbroker.com. Once there are bids on the auction I will have to take this ad down so if you are reading this the rifle is still available. I'm not interested in trades right now unless it's something that can be readily turned into cash like silver. Everything is negotiable. No, I will not accept your counterfeit cashiers check for more than the purchase price and western union you the difference."
