This example was originally produced in 1945 before being reworked into a National Match rifle. Improved accuracy is achieved through glass bedding of the receiver and by use of selected parts. Barrel straightness and bore diameter are closely controlled and checked in match-grade rifles. Approximately 3600 National Match M1 rifles were produced between 1953 and 1963. The final variant of the M1 National Match Garand was the rifles made in 1963, after which assembly ceased. Circa 1967, the National Match rifle program, such as it was, shifted to Rock Island Arsenal. As might be expected, the 1963 NM rifles were quite similar to the 1962 variety. The chief differences between the two variants were: The previously authorized, but heretofore unused, “F7791035” match barrels were fitted to the 1963 rifles. The only differences between these two types of barrels were minor variations in the dimensions of the bore and groove diameters. Barrels dated between “11-62” and “3-63” have been observed. The “star” code annual marking and “NM” designation were dropped on the 1963 rifles and only the standard T and P markings were present in addition to the standard markings found on all M1 barrels (drawing number, date, “m,” etc.). No “annual code” markings were applied. Rear sight base marked “NM/2A”. The “7790722-R”A drawing number operating rods, marked “NM” on the handle. Otherwise, the 1963 NM rifles were essentially identical to the 1962 variety. This rifle was produced in January of 1963."

This rifle is great for mid-range hunting and shooting because of its high velocity bullet and its very low recoil. The stock is made from a nice natural Philippine wood with a parkerized finish and the barrel is 22.5”. This rifle is chambered exclusively for .22TCM ammo. It includes a 5 rnd mag but it is also interchangeable with the Armscor/ .22TCM 17 rnd pistol mag. OAL: 40.5"" •Wt.: 6 lbs empty  I also have a new Simmons 3x9x32 22magnum scope and rings all set up and boresighted, to go with the rifle for an additional $62.99. Here is more information from the makers of this rifle. Rock Island Armory takes the success and popularity of the 22 TCM cartridge and combines it with the M22 TCM bolt action rifle. This rifle is a small game hunter's dream, capable of delivering a 40gn projectile over 2800 feet per second out of a 22.75"" barrel. For the money, you would be hard pressed to find another rifle that delivers features like a solid wood stock with classic checkering, ebony forearm tip and dark wood grip cap. Includes receiver rail mount for quick scope attachment and easy reach safety with a 5-round magazine. Top it all off with the ability to interchange the Rock Island 22 TCM 1911 17-round magazine and you have a high capacity rifle that makes a great companion to any TCM series pistol. http://armscor.com/firearms/rifle-series/m22-tcm-ba/ This rifle is dealer owned"

This gun functions excellent, bore is clean, and finish is good to very good. At just a little over 14 inches in length, this exceptional firearm is even more difficult to find than its rare 9mm version. Because of its larger caliper, it came originally with a 22 round clip (3 are included). The Spectre is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by one of the designers of the Spectre, Claudio Gritti, until 2001. During the mid 80’s and early 90’s, a limited number made its way to the states via imported by American Arms Inc. The Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian armed forces, and has been exported elsewhere. The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top-folding buttstocks, and were available with or without a forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely polymer Spectre has a stamped-steel receiver. The Spectre is a standard blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt; however it has some unusual features. The barrel shroud completely hides the barrel. The bolt is designed to pump air through the barrel shroud to provide additional cooling. The Spectre is hammer-fired and the trigger group is double action with a decocker. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately. As this eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting no manual safety is provided. Unconventional 22-round capacity, four-column magazine is provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional magazines. I'm willing to ship."

This comes with the HK threaded barrel, stronger recoil spring, Tru Glo Night sights, and three magazines. This is not a standard VP9, it's the actual tactical model which msrp's for $899, and was sold locally for $750. Just in dry firing this particular pistol has the best trigger I've ever felt on a striker fired gun. A little better than my old VP9. Cash only, price is firm. No Lowball offers, so don't ask. This pistol cost me $750 plus tax and background.  No trades other than like new Gen 4 glock 17 or 34 plus cash. We can work out the details. Just became interested in other projects, this will make someone a great gun. Valid TN state I.D. Required, as well as a signed bill of sale which I will provide."

I put the subcomact toger to show size difference. Very simple to do. See bottom desriptionintroducing the P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous."

Hooks to any picatinny rail with set screws.The bad:    Smooth bore so the rounds tend to spawl after launched. It is a black powder charge (you can do smokless but Ive never tried) so range is only about 250-300 feet.                  Its not quiet. If you are used to firing an M203 that ""thoop"" sound when you fire it doesnt happen. This is more like a black powder pistol going off.                  rounds are not cheap. Much better if you load your own which is time consuming.                  I purchased this at the Berea  gun show last February from American Specialty ammo for $350 Nice people but not very informative.                  Im not parting with any of the rounds I have so please dont ask.

Comes with one 30 round Magpul magazine. No case but I do have the manual. I do have the case and manual for the Eotech.
Not looking for trades but might consider a 7 shot .357 & cash or a 5 shot snub nose, concealed hammer revolver & cash. Maybe.  Or possibly a Glock 17 & cash.
