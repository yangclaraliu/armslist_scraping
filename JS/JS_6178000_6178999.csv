First up are seven AGP Arms 10-round mags with metal feedlips, these are considered the best US made mags you can buy unless you want to pay twice as much for CSSpecs 10-rounders. These were inserted in my Saiga-12 once to check for fit, but then not long after that I sold the gun and put these on a shelf. These count for three 922(r) complicance parts, which is a nice bonus. $200 for the lot.Next I've got ten 30-round ETS 9mm Glock magazines, these will fit Glock models 17, 18, 19, 26, and 34 along with many 9mm carbines like Sub-2000s or PSA and QC10 AR-15s. These are new and unfired, since after getting them as part of a package deal I changed my mind and decided to get a CX4 instead of building a 9mm AR. They are transparent with a slight smoke tint. Asking $120 for the lot.Third I've got 10 assorted surplus mags all of which will all fit a G3, HK91, PTR-91, CETME, or C308 rifle. One is a steel HK G3 mag, two are steel CETME mags and the remaining seven are aluminum HK G3 mags. All the steel mags and three of the seven aluminum G3 mags are in very good shape, while the remaining four are either good or fair but all work despite any cosmetic flaws. Asking $30 for the lot.Last up I've got six mags 25-round mags for a Ruger 10/22. Two are smoke-colored Butler Creek Steel Lips, three are clear Steel Lips, and the last is a smoke-colored Black Dog Machine. These are used but in very good condition but to let you know up front they have a number drawn on them so I could keep track of which was which if that bothers you. Asking $60 for the lot. 
I'm looking for cash, trades for specific things, or some combination thereof. Some of these are probably weird long shots but see the attached list of possible trade items. It's not the complete list but you get the idea. Have something similar you think I might be interested in that isn't listed here? Make me an offer. As for face to face sales I live in Lincoln County but work in St. Charles so I can meet you in that area if you're interested. Thanks for checking out what I've got for sale!"

It is a Remo II 16 gauge shotgun, which was made from a WWI era K98 Mauser action. These are rare gems in any milsurp collection! They are not technically military guns, as they were made for civilians, not for military use, but because they are made from old K98 Mauser actions, they would qualify as a milsurp, simply because that's what they were made from... military surplus guns!The armistice that ended WWI prevented Germany from making any more Military rifles, so in order to keep the arsenals in business without having military contracts, they began making these guns. Two companies made these converted Mauser shotguns, Geha and Remo. The Remo's were made with superior quality over the Geha's, and there were fewer of them made, making these guns much harder to come by these days. Remo's came out first, in 1919 (in 12 gauge), which was almost immediately after WWI ended, and then Geha started up, making lower end guns for the more common folk to be able to afford. Remo discontinued their shotguns in 1933. Remo has always stood out as being the finest of the Mauser shotguns. It is hard to find them at all these days, and if you do, they are usually in not that good of shape. This one, however, is in fantastic shape, and it is so beautiful! In fact, the bore of this gun looks like it just came out of the factory yesterday!I've taken this gun apart, and all of the numbers are matching, and there are serial numbers all over the place on this gun! I am not sure of the chamber length, therefore I have not shot it. I only have 2 3/4"" shells, and I read that only a portion of these guns are chambered for 2 3/4"". The rest are chambered in 2 9/16"". If it is indeed a 2 9/16"" chamber, you can either buy 2 1/2"" shells for it or you can have a QUALIFIED gun smith lengthen the chamber to 2 3/4"".This, I believe, is a transitional model Remo (mid 1920's), as it has some of the features of the early guns, and some of the later features as well. These transitional guns are extremely hard to find! The early features on this gun are the welded (instead of screwed on) shell deflector, and a screwed on magazine floorplate (with a thumb screw). The later model features are a blued receiver, and non-filed safety (for sighting purposes). This gun also has the factory sling swivels. I'm not sure if this is an early or later feature. All Remo guns, both early and late, have fully choked barrels.Another difference between the Remo's and Geha's is that the Geha's used K98 stocks, and Remo made their own walnut stocks in a sporter Mauser style, which included beautiful engraved checkering on the wrist of the stock, and a right-handed cheek rest. The checkering on this gun is still very crisp, showing that this gun was not handled and shot very much at all. There is a small hairline crack in the stock. Actually, it looks A LOT worse in the picture I took of it than it does in real life. This crack is very shallow, and the stock is still very solid. You can see in another picture that I have of the gun, where the stock is removed from the gun, that it is indeed a very shallow crack. Apparently it was very common for the stocks on these guns to develop cracks in this same exact spot. That is what I have read, anyway.The barrel is factory stamped ""Nitro,"" specifying that is is designed for smokeless powder. There are also a bunch of other proof marks on the gun, many of which can only be seen if you remove the stock. I took pictures of all the markings and numbers that I can think of that are on the gun. On the receiver ring it is stamped ""Remo II Cal. 16"" with a ""D.R.P.a."" under it. On the shell deflector it is factory stamped RWE. with a previous owner's social security number engraved under that (which was a common practice of firearms owners in the mid-1900's).The bluing on this gun has very little wear, considering that it is about 100 years old. It is in fantastic condition! No rust or pitting anywhere. There is the teeniest tiniest bit of freckling in spots from age, but it is not rusty anywhere. This gun has been very well taken care of over the years, especially considering the journey that it has been on! I feel blessed to be able to enjoy it while I have it.One VERY cool thing about this gun is that it has NO IMPORT MARKS!!! This means that it was likely captured during WWII, as these ""cheap"" guns were some of the first guns surrendered to Ally forces during that war. Most of the time, I have read, these guns have Sarco's import marks on them. I have inspected this gun carefully, and there just are no import marks to be found. VERY special!!!Because these guns were remanufactured into shotguns, the bolt doesn't come out of the receiver without first removing the bolt head, which was factory modified at Remo. You do this simply by removing the screw at the top, front of the bolt, which is pictured in another picyure that I have. This is important: Don't try to yank the bolt out because it seems stuck! It's not stuck. You just have to take that screw out and get the bolt head out first! Easy as pie, and nothing to worry about.Again, this gun is very hard to find, especially in this great of condition. They are out there, but it is a true rarity. Here is your opportunity to own an awesome piece of firearm history. Don't miss out on this golden oldie!Shipping on this gun is $35.00 to the Continental US, or $60.00 to Hawaii or Alaska. I accept USPS money orders for payment.This IS a C&R eligible gun. I will gladly ship it to the home of a legit C&R holder, provided I receive a hard copy of your license with your payment.  If you don't have a C&R license, then I legally have to ship it to an FFL of your choice.  I will also gladly do face-to-face transfers for local purchases.Thanks for checking out my gun.  If you are interested in purchasing this, and would like to see more pictures, just email me, and I have a ton of them that I will gladly send you.  Thanks again."

On the chopping block is a VERY COOL CZ Scorpion carbine. This is the 16"" hammer forged chrome lined barrel model with the [u][b]FAUX[/b] [/u]Suppressor made by SilencerCo. This rifle is BRAND NEW only factory fired. These are very hard to find locally. This will come with 14 GEN 2 Magazines. (12) 30rounders and (2) 20rounders. These are IMPOSSIBLE to get right now. Especially the Gen2. Most of the stores that do have 30 rounders in stock are the older Gen1's. Mine are the newest military mags. This rifle is built using the same Full Auto parts the Military Scorpion uses. It just has a Semi-Auto trigger pack for Civilian use. I've owned two of these, This is the last to go and was my unfired back-up. I also might have the factory Ambi Safety delete as well."

This has approx 300 rounds through it, Flawless and very dependable. This is the latest version with the new Barrel and slanted slide on barrel end as seen in the Pictures. Does show a small amount of holster wear, but not bad for a daily carry. Very Sharp Gun, and a Tac driver. Has 3 Magazines, 1- 6rd, & 2 -7rd
 
This is not the cheap CM9, this one in the premium series from kahr, and has the match grade barrel.
 
I also will include at listed price a R Grizzle Custom Leather pocket Holster, best Holster made, check out the reviews if unfamiliar with his work. This Holster cost me $100 and the PM9 was $600 from a fellow shooter about 3 months ago, So I have $700 plus invested, so I am selling way below its value for a quick sale for the Funds.
 
Please, No Trades, I need the funds, and also, no low ball offers as I don't need the funds that bad.
 
I will keep the pocket Holster and sell the PM9 alone for $400.
 
Best to Text or call, as I don't get to the computer much for PMs
 
I have tried to take the best Pictures i can to show the condition, Perfect flawless shooting, and very accurate.
 
I travel for work the I-94 corridor, lake to lake, so I can meet in that area, also willing to go north to Grand Rapids or Lansing. for the asking price.

The metal piercing pellets and the Crossman 175 pellets are largely empty. You wouldn't have liked these pellets anyway. The rest of the pellet cans are either full, or close to being full.The best pellets are the the JSB Match Diablos. They were certainly the most expensiv ones. You can get information on them at pyramydair.com.I would say the value of these pellets are about $40. Extra Scope Description -You can't put a carbine scope on an airgun. The vibration will destroy the scope, and quickly. However, you can put an airgun scope on a carbine with no problems.The extra scope I am providing is an airgun scope. This scope is really meant to be used at distances over 50 yards, where it is extremely accurate.The scope is a UTG 6-24x50. Full information/specs can be found on pyramidair.com.This scope never left my home and still retains it's original value of $129.This all is being sold ""close to new"".  The new value of the rifle, plus the new value of the scope, plus the cost of the pellets comes to about $459.  I will sacrifice it all for $200, as long as you take it all.  The extra scope is actually a decent carbine scope if you don't want to use it on the airgun."

The bcg has the Adams arms logo on in, and is not the standard black but instead a grayish metal that seems to be self lubricating and requires much less oil than a normal bcg and cycles much smoother.  This bcg is way nicer than any other ar bcg I have used.  If the magazine is not your cup of tea I have a mil spec steel mag I could include with the gun instead of the one pictured.  This gun is a head turner and I am only selling it to fund a build so I am not looking for trades unless it really interests me.  The price is also firm and is $800 without the magpul sights or $850 with them.  This gun is easily worth more with all the extras it has.  If I don't sell this gun I will just save up and wait on my build and keep this gun. I am reluctant to sell it, so I will not sell it for anything below asking price."
