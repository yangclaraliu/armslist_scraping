Available in a choice of the widely used caliber sizes of .308 Winchester or 300 Winchester Magnum, this platform provides high-precision performance and proven reliability.The .308 Winchester magazine holds 10 rounds and is available in either a 23.6-inch Heavy Barrel version or a 20-inch heavy barrel compact version. Both options feature a muzzle brake as well as a durable synthetic stock with an adjustable length-of-pull-- via stackable buttplate inserts-- and an adjustable cheek piece.As in other Steyr high-performance bolt-action rifles, the SSG 04 is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety's release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The receiver is topped with a Picatinny rail for optics mounting.Another feature in the SSG 04 is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage to lock the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated without feeding rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the user with the options of dry-firing or loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. Simply pressing up on the bottom of the magazine seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading.The SSG 04 A1 is also available by special order. The SSG 04 A1 replaces the standard Picatinny rail with a shroud that is attached to the receiver and covers the barrel for the length of the forend. The shroud is topped with a full-length Picatinny rail, and two short rail segments are attached on the side of the shroud for mounting of accessories such as lights and or lasers.

Their B-14 rifles were inspired by the desire to bring the quality that Bergara was known for in the custom rifle world to production rifles made from all hunters. In the B-14 rifle, you will find a level of craftsmanship that surpasses all of the other production hunting rifles on the market. The B-14 HMR rifle features their integrated mini-chassis molded into the stock to give the rifle repeatable bedding and accuracy.

The stock features an adjustable cheekpiece and length of pull spacers. Built in Spain at their highly automated and efficient barrel factory, this rifle delivers a level of quality and performance that is unmatched in its price range. The world-renowned Bergara barrel on this long range precision rifle is complemented by their own super-smooth B-14 Action, which is a two-lug system with a Sako-style extractor and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure a smooth feeding and extraction of the cartridge. It's also outfitted with a Bergara curved trigger they designed to guarantee a crisp, clean pull every time you fire the rifle. The trigger comes set at about three points. It has been factory drilled and tapped to fit Remington 700 style rings and bases. The (#5) Bergara 4140 CrMo steel barrel is finished in matte blue and is available in 20 inches in the .308, which weighs 9.15 lbs and 22 inches in 6.5 Creedmoor, which weighs 9.25 lbs.

Meticulously researched by a foremost authority on firearms, this is an indispensable guide to the opening of the American West. John Walter examines pre-Civil War mass production and technical advances, and the effect of readily available post-war surplus weapons on life in the Midwest. He traces the swift expansion of the West, which led to a perpetual struggle against the Native Americans and brought the United States Army in its wake. John Walter also examines whether law was dispensed at the point of a gun and whether it was the Colt or the Winchester that reigned supreme at the OK Corral. Describing particular Western desperadoes and the most popular Wild West firearms, he goes on to investigate how gun design influenced use and use influenced design. With detailed descriptions and performance evaluations of all the leading firearms, this book is an essential reference guide which cuts away the myth and legend and reveals the truth behind the guns, and the men who used them, in the heyday of the West.Will ship via USPS 1st Class or Media Mail at actual cost.

A key-operated manual safety feature is located next to the break-down lever and 2 keys are provided with each pistol. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action.This gun has never been fired!
