The VTAC-LUSA allows a wide variety of options without changing hardware. For armorers the VTAC-LUSA eliminates the need to stock four different sling attachment brackets. For shooters that use the quick detach sling swivel, it is designed to lock in the swivel and limit rotation to 45 degrees.”

The most abuse this has had would be me dropping chips on it while driving.  I never stored it in a trunk, it has never been exposed to excessive heat / cold and I always layed it flat when not in use.  This vest has also never been soaked in water.The level IIIA should stop anything between .22 short and .44 magnum. (Yes it is rated for .45 too). And will stop any legal round that can be thrown at you from a shotgun.  Which makes this perfect for hunting on state land in southern Michigan as only pistol calibers and shotgun are allowed.  Another benefit is that the Kevlar keeps you nice and and warm in your tree Stand or blind.Under the shirt carriers are cheaply available if you want to pull the body armor and put it in there. Other uses:  security, bouncer ,home defense, court officer / summons server, vehicle repo, or just to look tacticool at the range.This vest should fit anyone between 5'6"" and 6'2.  Between 170 and 230pounds.  If your looking for daily use,  I would recommend it for someone between 5'9"" and 5'11"" between 170 and 220 pounds.WARNING:  Last I knew it is an additional crime to commit a crime while wearing body armor.  This carrier would go over especially well with a prosecutor as it is specifically intended to intimidate. I am selling for $300i may consider trades but really looking to pay it off.Text or call.three one three 690 four zero 22"

The 42 round amber mags are $70 new. The 30s are $50. The 20s are $30. Weaver scope was $180. Switchback charging handle was $75 and leupold scope mounts were $30. Just over 3600 invested. The company ceased production of these guns so get this one while you can. This is a united States made version of a steyr aug. it's made with much higher tolerances and more advanced than the steyr Aug.  And come on who doesn't want a gun that says (MADE IN THE U.S.A)The MSAR 16"" barrel uses 1:8 rifling, which is sufficient to stabilize up to 77gr bullets. The AUG only comes with 1:9 twist, which is marginal for bullets over 70gr.The msar is more than half a pound lighter than the AUG/A3 The msar has quick-detach sling loops on both the receiver and the stock pin.In contrast, the AUG’s front sling loop is held in by a coil pin so it cannot be easily removed when not in use. Its rear loop can be switched from side to side by removing the entire stock pin but cannot be completely removed. The msar stock has two QD sling loop attachment points molded into the stock underneath the pistol grip and under the toe.The MSAR trigger pack actually locks into the stock. You have to press the bolt catch to release it.  (The AUG’s trigger pack just falls out)This guns serial number is 72**MSAR’s fourth generation starts with serial number 6500. MSAR has manufactured at least five thousand Gen4 STG-556 guns.
Earlier STG-556 versions have a Stoner-style Forward Assist (“FA”) and some compatibility problems. Therefore I would avoid serial numbers lower than 6500."

It is a Gen three slide that can be used with 40 cal, and 357 Sig barrels. The slide has front and rear cocking serrations, a bull nose, beveled rail, and lowered ejection port.  This is from the factory, and I have not done any garage gunsmithing to this.    If you want to use this for 9mm YOU WILL NEED A 40-9 CONVERSION BARREL ( I am not interested in meeting with people so they can test this for themselves, yes of course the standard 9mm barrel will fit but it will be too loose of a fit, resulting in an inacurate pistol ) I used this slide to fire less than 200 rounds, and decided to minimize on calibers.  The bare slide alone is $175, and when you add sights, firing pin, and other internals it adds up to well beyond my asking price.  I am only accepting offers of $200 on this, anything less, I will just throw it back into the safe for later."
