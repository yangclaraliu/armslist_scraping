Intended mostly for the US market, this pistol is suitable for concealed carry and as a police backup weapon and now a collectors firearm as they are becoming hard to find! The P245 has traditional Sig-Sauer reliability. It offers very good recoil control and is manufactured in Germany by the J.P. Sauer & Sohn company, which is a part of the international SIGARMS corporation. The P245 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a typical Browning-style cam operated barrel, which locks into the ejection window in the slide. The slide is made from stamped steel and has a separate breechblock held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double action with external hammer and a de-cocking lever on the left side of the frame. There’s no manual safety, but the P245 is provided with a automatic firing pin safety. The compact P245 is the perfect blend of both worlds, slip in the flat magazine and it makes a great single stack concealed carry piece.Specification Comparison of P220 to P245SIG-SAUER P220 P245Caliber .45 ACP .45 ACPLength, overall 7.8” 7.28”Height, overall 5.6” 5.0”Width, overall 1.4” 1.34”Barrel Length 4.4” 3.9”Rifling Twist 1 in 16” 1 in 16”Rifling Grooves 6 6Sight Radius 6.3” 5.7”Weight w/o mag 27.8 oz. 27.5 oz.Weight empty mag 2.6 oz. 2.5 oz.Trigger Pull DA 10 lbs 10 lbsWeight SA 4.5 lbs 4.5 lbs Magazine Capacity: 6 rounds for the P245FeaturesCapacity 6 roundsSights CombatFinish Anodized aluminumAdditional Details The P245 Compact is an ideal personal protection handgun that is also the choice of law enforcementThe SIG Sauer P245 is a Double Action and Single Action pistol that shoots .45 Auto ammunition. With a maximum capacity of 6 rounds, the SIG Sauer P245 holds less than average pistols of the same caliber.

This auction is for a very nice model 12 in 12 gauge. It has a factory vent rib and a Cutts compensator. I believe that it is a factory installed compensator, there is not a choke size marked on the barrel, that along with the vent rib and the production year, 1956, leads me to this conclusion.The shotgun also has four chokes that came with it. They range from full to the hard to find skeet spreader choke. The gun is in solid, crack free, rust free, condition. The blue is worn thin in usual places, that and a few small dents in the stock is the only signs of its age.i am pricing this far below book pricing for a factory Cutts, vent rib model 12. It will probably be a excellent skeet or bird gun, I have read that the compensator helps with fast sight pictures."

Glock 23 Gen 4 Semi-automatic Double Action Only Compact 40 S&W 4.02"" Polymer Matte 13Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Right Hand Fixed Sights PG2350203The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."
