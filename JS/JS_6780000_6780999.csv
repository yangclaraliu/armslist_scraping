A CMP Certificate Of Authenticity is included. This rifle is in a walnut stock from WENIG CUSTOM GUNSTOCKS in Lincoln, Mo. The original stocks also go with the gun. The forward grip on the original set has a crack in it, it hasn’t broke in half yet, but could any time.   A scope has been mounted without making any permanent modifications. It was done by adding a MINI SCOUT MOUNT from CMP. I will include the box and instructions that came with the mount.
The scope is a Simmons Prohunter Handgun scope, 2-6X32, Model 822009. I will include the original box for it. It was bought new for this rifle and hasn’t been used much at all.   I don’t know what else I can say that the pictures won’t answer. If you need to know anything else; let me know.   I mainly interested in trading, and I’m mainly interested in:Smith & Wesson revolvers, S&W Model 39, Ruger Vaquero, Older(70’s) Belgium Browning Hi-Power, Lever Guns in .357Mag.   Micro pistols... maybe if you have something interesting. I’d like to stay away from .380 but haven’t ruled them out totally.   Not interested in Black Powder, Pump shotguns, archery, or anything in rough condition.   Money can go either way.
There is no tax or background check. But this is on my C&R. That means Federal law requires me to record your name, address, phone number, Driver license number (or whatever you use for ID), and get a signed bill of sale. So if you aren’t okay with full disclosure; this isn’t for you.   I'm going to PM those that ask about this, and this will only be listed here until tomorrow evening when I post it to the other sale sites.
I could only post 10 pictures, I have more, let me know if there is something else you need to see."

Basic Information on the IOTV:The Improved Outer Tactical Vest, or IOTV, is an enhanced version of, and a replacement for, the older Outer Tactical Vest variant of the Interceptor body armor, as fielded by the United States Army. The IOTV is compatible with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS) components, E-SAPI (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert), Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI), as well as the OTV's groin protector.The OTV design was considered insufficient and lacking in certain areas, which led to the IOTV's development and fielding. The IOTV first saw action in combat with U.S. Army ground combat units in late 2007/early 2008, and currently remains the standard body armor type used by regular U.S. Army ground combat units overseas.The new vest is more than 3 pounds lighter than its predecessor, but provides an equal level of protection over an increased area by eliminating overlap and changing design features like the vest’s cut in the arm pit area, adding an integrated throat protector instead of an attachable version, and adding integrated side plate carriers. That, plus an overhead instead of a front-opening design, decrease the vest’s profile Overall but extends its coverage by 52 square inches.Other IOTV features include a single-stage quick release added to the front of the vest that removes the vest in 2 pieces. This is very useful to medics, who can also use an opening on the left shoulder if maintaining protection is important. It’s even more useful to soldiers trapped in overturned or submerged vehicles, which has been a consistent issue in Iraq. An internal waistband moves more of the weight from the shoulders to the waist, long variants are now issued (surely a relief to the beanpole types), more MOLLE attachments for pouches etc. in front now that the opening isn’t up front, vertically adjustable pouches for the ceramic plates within the vest, vertically adjustable side plate carriers, mesh lining, and channels/storage for those ubiquitous cables.A size Medium IOTV weighs 3.6 pounds less than a Medium OTV vest, while providing more coverage. However, a fully equipped IOTV, complete with all its components (soft armor panel inserts, four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates), collar, and groin protectors) still weighs 30 pounds, with a Large IOTV weighing about 35 pounds. The functionality of the enhanced side ballistic inserts, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso, is built-in to the IOTV.The IOTV provides the ability to don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, and the second is to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the side protection modules.A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment. The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to the casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor. It also features a grid of PALS webbing on the front, back, and sides for the attachment of modular pouches and accessories.FEATURES:• Modular components• Increased MOLLE pouch locations• Single-handed emergency egress quick-release system• Reinforced drag handle• Full-wrap cummerbund style closure• Removable/adjustable side plates• Provides ability to donn/doff vest in two ways• Designed to reduce weight from the shoulders and move it to the lower torso• Features MOLLE webbing on the front, back and sides for equipment attachment• Flame resistant, durable 500 Denier Cordura outer carrier• Size medium IOTV weighs 3.6 lbs less than the Interceptor’s medium vest while providing more coverage• Removable ESBI/ESAPI – X-small side ballistic protection, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso• Includes a lower back protector designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas• All ballistic panels are approved for combat use by the U.S. Military or can be outfitted with NIJ Level IIIA+ commercial ballistics• Hard armor plates are designed to withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front and rear ESAPI plates as well as the ESBI Side plates"

The Viper gives shooters the simplicity and speed advantage of a dot sight, while co-witnessing with suppressor height iron sights. The trade off? Nothing. The 6 MOA dot diameter gets shooters on target fast. Fully multi-coated, ultra-clear lens offers a wide, unobstructed field of view. The left-side up/down power and illumination controls are easy to access and manipulate. Recessed 1 MOA windage and elevation adjustments are super clean, protected from incidental contact, and always at the ready. It runs on a CR 2032 battery. OPTICAL FEATURES Fully Multi-Coated Multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces increase light transmission. Parallax Free All red dot and holographic sights will exhibit some small amount of parallax. Matching current industry practice, this small amount would be considered “parallax free” and will make a negligible difference in the Viper’s performance. CONSTRUCTION FEATURES Single-Piece Chassis Compact and lightweight. Waterproof O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust and debris from penetrating for reliable performance in all environments. Shockproof Rugged construction withstands recoil and impact. Hard Anodized Finish Highly durable low-glare matte finish. ArmorTek Ultra-hard, scratch-resistant coating protects exterior lenses from scratches, oil and dirt. CONVENIENCE FEATURES Unlimited Eye Relief Non-critical eye relief for rapid target aquisition. Battery Life 14-hour auto-shutdown feature maximizes battery life. Up to 150 hours of use at highest setting. Use at the more common lower settings can allow up to 30,000 hours.

The RRA lower has the glove-contour trigger guard and the gun overall is a tack driver!

Instead of one flat, short 13 round magazine and one long 16 round magazine. it has two 13 round magazines with Peirce pinky extensions.  I have meaty hands and I get a full grip but with a shorter profile making the gun much less likely to ""print"" under a shirt. I have the case, papers and the grip extension to slide over longer magazine in the same color as grip frame. I am asking $400 which I figure is less then you would pay for it used at a gun shop and more then they would give me for a trade-in.Need to see you LTCH, driver's license and have you fill out a bill-of-sale"

This gun has very little use, fewer than 100 rounds through it and is in excellent shape. It is a lightweight, short, handy rifle with many uses. It will serve well as a truck or boat gun, and is excellent for home defense, as it’s easier to shoot accurately than a handgun and uses the powerful .45 ACP round. Makes a great addition along with your 45 acp hand gun takes 1911 magazines.It’s not a hunting rifle but it’s suited to medium sized animals such as coyotes. It would take a deer with proper bullets, distance, and good placement. Listed prices range from $795 - $1,280; Average $1,000.Asking $875.00 cash.Making room in my safe to fund another project.

The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.

Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider. Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. These upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA. Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function.

ATI Lower Omni Complete Hybrid Multi Cal Black

American Tactical Imports brings you the best of both worlds with their new Omni Hybrid Lower. The lightweight polymer is molded around steel inserts for greater strength or extra durability in the most critical areas. The ATI Omni Hybrid is now both lighter and tougher than a standard aluminum receiver. ATI has also reinforces the polymer around the hammer and trigger pins for extra toughness and to prevent unwanted movement during firing. This complete OMNI Hybrid is pre-assembled by the factory, including an M4 style collapsible stock, so all you have to do is attach your mil-spec upper assembly and it's ready to rock. ATI designed this lower to be capable of handling .22 LR, .223 Remington/5.56 NATO and .410 uppers. The magazine well accepts standard AR-15 sized magazines.
