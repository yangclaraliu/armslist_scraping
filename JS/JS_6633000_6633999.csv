Manufacturer: Beretta
Condition: Like New!
The Beretta 92 has been setting the standards for best military, police, and tactical pistol for over a quarter century.
 
This model was made in ITALY. The ones made in Italy are more highly sought after and many feel are better quality and workmanship.
 
Designed to be and remain the most accurate, durable, and reliable semi-auto handgun on the market.
The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
The 92 is a double/single-action pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability.
The pistol's safety system combines de-cocking with a positive thumb safety.
Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning and also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
The reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed operators.
After shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning.Features and Benefits:- Open slide design virtually eliminates jamming!- 4.9"" Black matte Bruniton barrel- 3 Dot sight system:  Single Dot front sight and 2-dot rear sight system- External loaded chamber indicator- Safty system combines de-cocking with a positive thumb safety- Internal firing pin block system only moves when trigger is pulled(No trades.  No silly low offers - those messages will not be returned.)"

$900 firm in cash, no less, or better in trade.  Might trade for a Glock 17 or 19 Gen 4 with bright night sights and $400 cash.  Ones with extra mags, better trigger etc. will get preference.  Not a Glock fan, just want one to go with my AR9.
Prefer cash right now, but might consider trades, depending on the deal.  Please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other??  If you don't mention a cash amount or other item(s) either way, I will assume you want a straight trade and respond accordingly.
Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others, depending on the deal.  Items I could use more of, AR FosTech Echo or Franklin BFS Gen 3 trigger & Law Tactical Gen 3-M folding adapter.  Also, a 9""+/- 5.56 upper, a few side charging uppers, 9mm stripped lowers similar to the Joe Bob's Spartan I have now and maybe an AR pistol in .45ACP or parts.  Could also use several factory Glock 33rd. 9mm mags in new/like new condition.
Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX.  Please, no lowballers, scammers or flakes!

Payment via money order or PayPal.I have a 485 100% positive ebay rating, so you can trust this will be an honest transaction.You can view my profile by searching under the Advanced tab on ebay for 3novaman.DESCRIPTIONMatrix Arms Non-Reciprocating Side Charging Upper Machined from Mil Spec Billet 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy featuring Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny Rail.Hard Coat Black AnodizedFEATURESSafety: The capability to remain on target while performing basic techniques, such as Tap, Rack, Bang (or Immediate Action Drills) as a resultof the Matrix Arms side charging design (Patent Pending) means that you’ll never have to take your eyes off the target when working the weapon’s action.Survival: Time/Speed. Less than a second can mean the difference between life and death. The time it takes to clear a malfunction using theMatrix Arms Non-Reciprocating Side Charged Upper (Patent Pending) vs. a weapon that utilizes a conventional charging handle design is staggering.Once muscle memory is established, the Matrix Arms Non-Reciprocating Side Charging Upper (Patent Pending) can be cleared of a malfunction utilizingthe standard Tap, Rack, Bang technique (Immediate Action Drill) in literally one second, while never taking the weapon, or eyes, off target.Convenience: When firing a weapon that utilizes a charging handle, gases are naturally forced around the charging handle and blown into theshooter/operator’s face, directly into the eyes. With the absence of a charging handle, gone too is the natural escape route that gases take whenshooting, especially in suppressed mode. The Matrix Arms Non-Reciprocating Side Charging Upper (Patent Pending) incorporates a design that preventsgases from escaping by integrating a seal into the bolt cover. Gases that would’ve otherwise been directed into the eyes of the shooter/operator arenow forced out the ejection port, away from the shooter/operator. While shooting goggles are still a required safety precaution, they’re no longer anecessity born of gas discharge."

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system and is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.The KRISS Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the KRISS Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterparts and is civilian legal in most states."

Bluing is 90+%. Round receiver. All original with 140 rounds of ammo and a ton of extras. Bolt, receiver, floorplate, and buttplate all original match (no forced matching). Stock is solid and clean. The best is the barrel. Maybe the brightest barrel I have seen in years. Excellent rifling. Came across this recently. Gentleman was cleaning out his safe. He found it in the early cosmoline crates and was the first North American owner. I needed this rifle for a photoshoot, and now here you go (lot of you guys have bought my firearms & gear after photoshoots, you know I find solid stuff). I did my best to get photos, especially of the barrel, but it looks even better in person. Copy and paste this link for a full set of photos: http://imgur.com/a/EzGOMThis is an early import. The import markings are unobtrusive. The receiver markings could be a little clearer. The hammer and sickle are there, but could be clearer. I have not fired this rifle, so a gunsmith is of course recommended. Overall it is as solid a 91/30 you will find. It is NOT the typical ""Frosted barrel, dark rifling, cracked & repaired stock, and counterbored barrel"" that you see with the $175-225 Mosins. Nothing wrong with those...just want to be clear that this rifle is a step above the discount gun show rifles. Rifle is located in Gray, and with my work schedule it may be best to try and meet in the Gray community. I need to sell outright, so thanks but not going to trade on this one."
