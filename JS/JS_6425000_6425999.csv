But what can you do.  The grip is brand new because the old one had me name on it and I didn't think a prospective buyer would want that so I just replaced it with a new one.You can contact me for extra pics and questions if you would like.I will ship out of state to an FFL.  In that case I will accept a certified check, money order, or Paypal.  Paypal will require 3% more than asking price due to their fees.  Buyer will also pay shipping fees.  I will try to ship it as cheap as possible.  If you want it overnighted it will be roughly $100 for UPS.  Otherwise I will have it shipped ground to lower the cost.In state buyers I can arrange to meet you on the Wasatch Front if you would like."

A Zastava (yugo/serbia) M85NP.  This is a standard yugo ak pistol factory configured to shoot 5.56 NATO ammunition.  The NP stands for ""non proprietary"" meaning this thing takes standard AR15/M16/M4 mags!  Runs USGI, magpul and tapco mags with no issue.  Currently outfitted with the Century Arms brace SB-47.  This is classified as a pistol.  The grip in the pic has been swapped out for a magpul MOE AK grip. Much better look and feel. Will include the yugo grip pictured. Has the ""krinkov"" style muzzle break and likes to throw a cool fireball !  Easy recoil and a very nice trigger. Hinged top cover for SUPER EASY maintainence.   I would estimate this gun has less than 1k round thru it.  If you know AK's, then you know the Yugo is one of the nicer factory models.  There are plenty of aftermarket fore ends and top covers with picatinny rails for optics and accessories available on the market for these.   Specs below. -5.56 NATO chamber (accepts .223 Remington)-10"" Barrel-Matte black finish-Steel receiver-Polymer grip-Accepts AR-15 magazines and drums-6.6LBS-UPGRADED HANDGUARD]-Bolt hold open safety-Ergonomic magazine release-Muzzle brake-30 rounds-Low profile sights $650 OBO or TRADE I594 applies.  Buyer pays transfer fee unless negotiated.  CPL REQUIRED. **LOCAL SALE AT AN AGREED FFL BETWEEN BELLEVUE AND EVERETT UNLESS YOU HAVE A TRADE TOO GOOD TO REFUSE***IF YOU ARE READING THIS, THE GUN IS STILL AVAILABLE.  IF YOU ASK, I WILL IGNORE.  I'LL REMOVE THE AD WHEN THE GUN IS GONE"

At its core is a free-floating, 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, which comes standard with the DD Superior Suppression Device Extended, for reduced muzzle-flash. This top-quality barrel connects directly to the upper receiver through a robust 4-Bolt Connection System with a patent pending barrel extension resulting in increased stability, better accuracy, and reduced weight. Ambidextrous controls make operating the .308 Ambush comfortable and convenient for both right- and left-handed shooters. You can easily drop the magazine, release the bolt, or operate the safety selector from either side of the receiver. The charging handle is ambidextrous as well and also user-configurable—you can set up either side of the charging handle with a larger or smaller handle to accommodate magnified optics or iron sights for a snag-free setup. The water-transfer printing process (also known as hydro-graphics) of this finish makes for a durable, uniform coating that holds up to and resists even the harshest environments. Customers ordering multiple items can request combined/discounted shipping. This request can be met if the items are eligible for combined shipping compliant with DOT/carrier regulations."

All are like new, have hardly any rounds through them, have never been carried/holstered and are therefore in as-new condition yet. They are all in factory original condition with exception to inlaying the stamping on the left side of the slide in white which I like. It removes easily of desired. 6 month old Glock 17 Gen4 (all balck). 50 rounds through it. Includes factory case, paperwork and (3) magazines. Installed is a brand new set of Ameriglo Cap ProGlo night sights; really nice sights! I can take a picture this evening and send it to you if interested. $500 Firm, picked up in Hartford. Must be a Wisconsin resident and hold a valid Wisconsin CCL. I will request a picture of your CCL before agreeing to meet you anywhere to sell you the handgun. I have a CCL as well that I'm happy to show you for your peace of mind. Thanks!"
