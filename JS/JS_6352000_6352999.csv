This example was made in 1944 by Tula in the Soviet Union. Very possibly could have seen action around a Commisar's belt. Wood grips are dark and weathered, finish looks like arsenal refurb post-WW2, markings and proof marks still very much visible. I will throw in a box of 50 rounds of commercial 7.62 nagant ammo as well, as well as the pigskin holster probably made in the 1970s. Imported by Rguns up in Northern Illinois. Never fired by me, and maybe never fired since the war, to be honest; it's in quite good condition for a milsurp handgun. No Cosmoline in the revolver. Asking 260 for the gun + holster + ammo, which is more than fair. These revolvers are becoming rarer every day, and are no longer imported in large numbers.ALL Illinois firearm laws apply."

The paint on the loading gate is partially coming off.Very nice handling gun. Shoots well with the flip-up rear sight. I took the scope off of it, that never shot well.

The rifle has been fired and is in extremely nice condition. Its production year was 1997 which makes it the second year the Model 96 was made.  This rifle was only produced from 1996 to 2007.  This is the reason the value of the Ruger Model 96 has gone up very nicely over the last 10 years.  The only flaws on this rifle are on the underside of the wood stock. I believe this rifle was resting on some sort of wall hanger without any felt between rifle and hanger. This has left a couple tiny nicks in the wood stock. They are very small and they're tough to see unless you're looking for them. But, they are there none the less. This rifle is an extremely desirable lever action and it will make someone a nice firearm!"

I'm selling this pistol because I bought a TRP Operator so this one's not likely to get much attention from me. Details:- WC Trigger set w/trigger job (*see note below)- WC stainless everything else (hammer, full-length guide rod, magwell, ext. slide release, etc.)- WC Stainless Magwell- VZ Grips- Stainless muzzle break (I actually got this locally from a guy who makes them. I put it on there so I could carry it deer hunting because I was going to argue that the muzzle was now far enough from the firing pin to be legal. Not sure if that would've worked or not.)- 2 8-round magsExtras:- All the original parts to put it back to mil-spec- Set of Fusion white-dots ( I never worked up the courage to take a dremel to the inside of the slide for the front tenon)- Original wood grips and those cheap plastic punisher grips, if you even want them*Note*Full disclosure: The gun has a slick trigger job that's just the wrong side of safe. The grip safety works as intended, but the hammer can drop if the grip safety is depressed, even if the lever safety is engaged so, no cocked-and-locked (which never bothered me). The trigger is set to around 5lbs (I don't have a scale) and very crisp. The gun would sell for about $600 at the store, without even considering the extra pieces. The reason for the discount from the market price is the need to properly fit a safety lever, which I think is fair ($25 parts $50 labor at the gunsmith). If nobody here wants it I'll do it myself and put it on consignment somewhere, but I would really just rather see it go. If you take it as-is, I'm going to ask you to sign a simple disclosure that says I told you about the lever safety, and acknowledge the gun should have a safety fitted by a professional gunsmith. I will not be accompanying you to the gunsmith, however. Please let me know if you have any questions. [I will only sell to WI CCW Holders][Cash only, no trades this time please]"

Handguns (revolvers only if they are Colt) but mostly semi-autos.  I prefer Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Kimber and Browning. But I like most of them so feel free to ask on anything.  Calibers - 9mm, .40, .357, 44, and 45 and 22 Mag (no 22LR).  Thanks for looking at my post and if it is still up, it is still for sale."

I normally wear a Small and this is to large for me and I'm guessing it's a Medium, but could be a Large. I'm not sure, the label is cut out. My Jacket was a Gore-tex, with a Zip Out liner and looked very much like this one, so I believe it is a Gore-tex, but again, not marked and not sure.
