This stun gun/defensive flashlight is not only very strong, but durable too! Made of aircraft grade aluminum, this 4 in 1, police, and security quality defensive tool looks like an ordinary flashlight, however this flashlight is a defensive beam light that can disable, and blind any attacker. It has a spiked, clubbed head for striking out, and clubbing someone who means you harm. If that doesn't stop the attack the head of the flashlight has 4 large sharp teeth that can stab into an opponent, and be twisted for tearing apart skin, and last but not least is the 10 million volts of electricity it delivers at the push of a button. It has an on off switch on the bottom that activates the stun gun feature from a position of safety. However all other defense operations are still capable of being used even if the taser isn't turned on. It measure 14 inches in length, and has a wrist strap attached. Comes with charging chord and instructions too. I have 2 of these currently available for purchase that are brand new. $90 each or package deal for both at $160. One demo model out of box lightly used also available for $50."

The Daniel Defense 16” 300 Blackout S2W® barrel is designed with a strength to weight profile (Daniel Defense's Heavy Barrel), a 1:8"" twist rate, and a Carbine-Length gas system.
Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible."

It's basically still brand new.This thing is scary accurate, with numerous ammos, from 40 to 62 gr.A big plus with the CZ .223's is that they are among the very few 223 rifles around that are OK'd by the manufacturer to fire mil-spec 5.56 ammo, which opens your ammo options even further.I tested the iron sights when I first got it, and they were perfectly dialed in straight from the factory, but almost immediately afterwards I mounted a Bushnell Elite 4200 3-9x40.In case you're not familiar with them, Bushnell's ""Elite"" series came about when Bushnell bought out the highly respected Bausch & Lomb company, and continued manufacture under the Elite name. These are not your inexpensive Wal-mart blister-pack Bushnells, they are basically their high-end premium line, kinda like Lexus is to Toyota. The Bushnell Elites are all very good quality scopes, made in Japan, w/ fully multi-coated lenses, lifetime warranty, magnum-recoil rated, yadda,yadda.The scope rings are steel CZ's (very high quality rings that didn't originally come with the rifle, I had to buy them seperately).As you can see, I still have the original box and paperwork, for both rifle and scope.Also included is a load of various .223 ammos: 50-rd box of Fiocchi Extrema polymer-tipped V-Max, a couple boxes of 62-gr Silver Bear, a box of Federal American Eagle, a box of Remingtons, and a loose bag of more Fiocchi Extrema V-max's.That's all the relevant info that comes to mind, feel free to ask any further questions.  Buyer/trader must be legal to own firearms, be a legal Georgia resident over age 18, with valid ID. As always, I'll show my GDL and Georgia carry permit. Please respond with enough detail that I can tell you're a legitimate local buyer rather than another scammer/spammer, or I WILL IGNORE THE MESSAGE !!!Thanks for looking.........edit: No shipping, price is firm!! I'm mostly looking for the cash, but may consider interesting trade,plus cash."

The tubular folding stocks on these rifles come equipped with a spring loaded cheek riser, and lock solid in both the closed and open position. These rifles are built at the Molot Oruzhie Factory in Molot Russia, and are newly imported to the United States Market. They are chambered in the versatile and hard-hitting 7.62x39, and built using 1.5mm RPK Receivers (making them 50% more reinforced than traditional stamped AK Rifles). Additionally, these rifles are built using heavy RPK-Style Chrome-Lined Hammer Forged Barrels, making them exceptionally rigid and extremely accurate (threaded in the traditional 14x1mm left hand pattern). Also, these rifles come with a factory installed mil-spec side rail for mounting optics, and would make excellent AK-Pattern Designated Marksman Rifles. These rifles have Black Polymer RPK Furniture, and will accept any standard mil-spec double stack AK Magazine. These will make great down-range investments given the future uncertainty on Russian Imports. The Molot Vepr FM-47 is a very high quality, well-built rifle and is made to last for generations. Our COMBLOC Package includes the following; (1) Factory New Molot Vepr FM-47 w/ Folding Stock, (2) 30 Round Circle 10 Magazines, (1) Factory 5 Round Magazine, (1) Factory New Arsenal Mil-Spec SM-13 Quick Detach Scope Mount, (1) Factory New Hi-Lux Micro Red Dot w/ 2 MOA Dot, and all original factory supplied material including Russian-to-English translated user manual, cleaning kit, and factory box.
