This firearm is one that was included in a special run by Beretta after 9/11 these were made and the vast majority were given to Beretta employee's so when I noticed one at my lgs like I said I just had to have it. I've enjoyed it for a few years as a show piece to my friends and now the time has come that I am wanting something different. In total its been shot very little by myself pretty much been a safe queen since I've had it. I cannot speak for the owner before me. The original box and paper work were not transferred with the firearm at the time of the previous sale so they are missing. It comes with one mag and could possibly find some kind of case to give it to you in. Does have different ergo grips that were on it when I got it. REDACTED

The LC9 is 0.9 inches (23 mm) wide, and weighs 17.1 ounces (485 g) with an empty magazine. It features a black polyer (glass-filled nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel. The gun ships with one magazine, including two interchangeable base pads—one that fits flush with the frame, and the other (fitted to the magazine from the factory) that provides a grip extension of about 0.5 inches (13 mm). The Ruger LC9 was chosen as the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence's Handgun of the Year in 2011.The LC9 lands between the compact SR9 and the LCP for size, a thin, nearly pocketable 9mm to rival the Kel-TEC PF9, Kahr PM9, and SIG SAUER P290. Pistols in this market segment are small, light, and chambered in “major” calibers – 9mm, .357 Sig, and .40 S&W.First impressions. The LC9, despite its diminutive size, manages to fill one’s hand nicely. The magazine comes with both a flush floor plate and one with a finger rest which are quickly interchanged depending on one’s preference.  The gun has smooth, rounded lines for carry; simple and well-placed controls; and a trigger with minimal creep that smoothed out very nicely after a few hundred dry fires. The light weight allows it to both be carried with ease and also shot extensively – the empty weight of 17.1 ounces makes it only slightly heavier than an Airweight revolver. It’s heavy enough to absorb the recoil of 9mm but light enough to carry all day long.Accuracy was surprisingly good for a lightweight gun with a short sight radius (picture 6). Recoil was very manageable, allowing for rapid shots that stayed on target. Shooting the LC9 offhand at a distance 25 feet, rapid fire, all seven shots stayed well within the confines of a standard NRA B-34 silhouette target. Felt recoil was no worse than a standard S&W J-frame revolver firing light .38 Special rounds. This is a person to person transaction with no backgroun check necessary.  However, if you want it shipped, I'll need the name and information for your FFL.Price is firm - I will not reply to lower offers.  Cash only - Serious inquiries only please.

Buy this pistol online at www.copsgunshop.net.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax. 92A1: Legendary 92 Reliability with Ultra-Modern Tactical Features The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice. Easy Accessorization and Maintenance The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral accessory rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit. Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. Beretta 92A1"
