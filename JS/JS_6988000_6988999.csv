The upper and lower handguards are laminated. Not sure, but I don't think the handguards are Bulgarian, they're probably Romanian.This is a very solid quality,genuine east-bloc stock set, and give the rifle a particularly authentic AK look. They look even better in person, on a rifle, than they do in the pics.Asking $50, firm. If the ad is still up, then I still have the stock set.Thanks for looking.....(the pic with the rifle shows the actual stockset, and is for illustration purposes only. The stocks are no longer on the rifle, and the rifle and other accessories ain't included!)"

Interesting History and link to an Authentic Replica of the most Rare Civil War Pistol.The percussion revolver manufactured in small numbers by a makeshift company, hastily set up in a cotton gin outside of Macon, Georgia in the early part of the Civil War is often confused with the 1860 ""Colt Army"" and ""Navy Colt""revolvers, which were manufactured in the Union North. Once the war broke out, the CSA Army was in need of small arms, and most of the former nation's firearms manufacturers were located in the Northern Union states. Clearly the Union had the advantage in manufacturing capacity and materials. This imbalance of production ability plagued the Confederacy to the very bitter end. Griswold and Gunnison and a handful of slaves turned out these pistols in their makeshift shop in ""Griswoldville"" under a contract from the CSA government.Firearm Type: ""Cap and Ball"" Percussion RevolverNation Of Manufacture: CSA (Confederate States of America)Military Service Dates : 1862-1865Variations: Small Scale production.
