They are a small, high quality, manufacturer.  Guns & Ammo actually visited their factory and had great things to say about Core in this review about their full sized ARs: http://www.gunsandammo.com/rifles/ar-15/core-15-hardcore-ar-review/Also, Tactical-Life chose this gun I'm selling to be 1 of the 12 of the Best 300 Blackout AR Pistols On the Market. See http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/300-blackout-ar-pistols-2016/#twmj16-arpistol-adamsStill not convinced?  Core's warranty is unparalleled in the industry and applies equally to 1st, 2nd . . . 10th owner of their guns. See:http://www.core15.com/about-core-rifle-systems/the-core-warranty/ Not familiar with 300 Blackout?   It is the fastest growing caliber on the market.  Unless your target is 250+ yards away, it is far superior to the 5.56/.223 in many ways.  Think of it as a 7.62 bullet in a 5.56/.223 case (hits MUCH harder) with powder that fully burns in a 10 inch barrel unlike a 7.62 or 5.56/.223 which don't burn completely even in a 16 inch barrel.  If you want to know more about the 300 Blackout, message me and I'll reply with some links.This gun is brand new and has not been fired since it left the factory.  Since the barrel is less than 16"" long and does not have a rifle stock, it is technically classified as a pistol.Specs:Weight:  6 lbs. 7 oz.Caliber: Chambered in 300 AAC BlackoutLower Receiver: CORE15® Mil-Spec Forged 7075-T6 Lower Receiver, Type III Class II Hard-coat anodized finish, beveled Magwell for improved reloading speed, machined chevrons in front of magazine well, bullet pictogram safety markingsUpper Receiver: CORE15™ Mil-Spec Forged 7075-T6 M-4 Upper Receiver, Type III Class II Hard-coat anodized finish, M4 Feed Ramps, (1913 Picatinny rail flat top) w/ dry lube internal finish and laser engraved T-markingsBolt Carrier Group: CORE15® Mil-Spec Carpenter 158 steel bolt, M16 Chrome Lined 8620 Steel Carrier, Mil-Spec Staked Gas Key, Tool Steel Extractor, Shot PeenedBarrel: 10.5” 1:7 Twist 4150 CMV Pistol Length Gas System Black Nitride Finish, Threaded 5/8x24Rail: CORE Keymod 9.5” RailGrip: Ergo Swift GripFlash Hider: Midwest Industries Flash HiderMagazine: 1 Magpul® 30 rd.

The seven-round cylinder is fluted and the sights are exceptional. This Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum is one of their instantly familiar, iconic classics using the standard Magnum revolver frame.The 686-4 is prized as the pinacle of the 686 series.  It has all of the improvements and is the last run before the use of MIM parts that ultimately cheapened the construction.  The trigger action on this revolver is super smooth in double action and the single action is crisp with virtually no uptake, just a clean break.  This is a pre-lock revolver.  Added accessories include MeproLight Night Sights that are fully adjustable and utilize the modern three dot configuration.  The revolver has Ahrends Moradillo wood grips plus a one piece hogue rubber grip.  There are alos (8) speed loaders along with (3) belt clips holders.  I also have a very nice owb Don Hume Black Leather holster. I also will include some replacement hammer springs and rebound springs from Wolff Springs.  The revolver is in excellent shape.  The finish looks great with only a few tiny scratches.  Shoots excellent.  These revolvers continue to go up in value due to their limited availability.  I am not interested in trades, I am trying to sell some safe queens to go towards a down payment on a boat."
