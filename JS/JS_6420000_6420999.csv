The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With its 5 Inch Barrel, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game.  For this price the revolver also comes with a Kydex holster. This pistol is brand new, it has never been shot outside of the chiappa quality control department.  I bought this for a cool gun to mess around with but have not had time to use it or take it to the range yet and probably won’t have time for a while.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

Reciever and trigger group is off of a savage 111 Hog Hunter. Has a 26 Inch Mcgowen Precision Barrel with a PRS 338 Lapua brake on the end (Still works wonders for reducing recoil, gun kicks like a 243 at the most). Stock is a MDT LSS with a Mako Group Adjustable Buttstock. I ended up building this gun myself from the action up and turned out very well. Gun shoots 1 MOA or less, and have fired about 200 rounds without any issues. Note that I am not including the scope in the deal for the listed price, unless somebody wants it. Its a vortex 4-16 FFP scope worth 600-700 so figure add about that to the list price. However, Alot of other extras are included. Comes with 1 Accuracy International mag, and 2 Magpul Mags, all 5 rounders. Have about 80 rounds of factory ammo, about 70 Rounds of HAndloads (Mix of 208gr ELD-m's and 168 gr HPBT's). Also have about 100 pieces of fired Brass which I can turn into loaded ammo given I get a few hours to do it. So Presumably, about 250rds will be included with this. Also has a bipod and will throw in a case for it. If interested, I also have a set of reloading dies for it, as well as a barrel wrench and headspacing kit if You ever want to change out the barrel on it. Barrel should be good for another 1000-1500 rounds or so. Reason I am selling is to get money to put towards a vehicle, and possibly upgrade to a 338 Lapua or something similar. NJ Buyers prefered, must have Matching NJ DL and Firearms ID. Out of state buyers within a reasonable distance must be willing to meet at an FFl to do the transfer. Sorry no shipping, too many scammers on this site to risk it. Also, Any trade offers let me know, but most likely will only consider an upgrade to the platform I am listing here. Asking 1150 Firm, or 1650 with the scope included"

Engineered as a lightweight, ultra-thin platform, the NOXs™ handguard is only 1.5” wide. Each NOXs™ handguard will be available with either the M-Lok or KeyMod mounting system at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions throughout the length of the rail, allowing the user to customize their platform with accessories as needed. Anti-rotation QD sling attachment points are milled directly into the hand guard, as are cooling slots, providing maximum airflow and preventing the barrel from overheating during prolonged periods of shooting. The NOXs™ handguard comes equipped with a Patent Pending Cross-lok™ mounting system. This system ensures that anti-rotation is built into the steel barrel nut as well as the handguard making installation simple and rock solid with just basic hand tools. The NOXs™ handguards are Type III Hardcoat Anodized, matte black and available in 9, 12.8” or 15” lengths. As with all Seekins Precision handguards the NOXs™ ships with all of the needed hardware to mount to a standard upper receiver.-Width 1.50”-Inside diameter 1.350”-Overall length 15.0”-2 ounces-Barrel nut and mounting hardware: 2.6 ounces.Phase 5 FATman Hex Break .223 Rem/5.56 NATO AR-15 Muzzle Break with Crush Washer 1/2x28 TPI Steel FATman-556 $105.66If you want a state of the art muzzle break engineered to address the challenges of today's competitions then you need the Phase 5 FATman Hex Break!
