I love this pistol. If it sells for my asking price, so be it, if it doesn't that works too. I honestly prefer to keep it, but it is up for sale to possibly fund other interests.This is a Tennessee Arms polymer lower with a custom build on top of it. It was built by a professional machinist, not some basement hack.The finish is all hand laid stenciled urban digital camo in stealth grey, light grey, gunmetal grey, and flat deep black. Yes, that is a threeper call sign hidden in the camo too.The paint used was all KG Coatings Gun Kote. The barrel is a stainless 7.5"" with M4 feed ramps.The bolt carrier is M4, with a custom bolt made for 7.62x39 specifically. The handguard is completely custom. The front sight is a TFO both Tritanium night sight and fiber optic.The trigger group is an enhanced Mil Spec unit with a 5 pound pull.The springs are Wolff, with an extra power hammer spring to ensure primer strike on military surplus ammo.The ring at the buffer tube is set up for a quick release single point sling. The push forward on a sling approach is the best way I found to steady and control the AR pistol platform. The sling will come with the pistol too.It will come with 1 stainless 30 round mag and 1 stainless 10 round mag. The mags are C Products. They are hands down the best 7.62x39 AR mags out there.All laws are abided by. This is a pistol, so that means a 72 hour wait after the ISP FOID check.  I am towards O'hare during the week, and Plainfield on certain times on the weekends.

Its a solid one piece design and combined with the double undercut trigger guard it also enhances the grip without adding unnecessary bulk. Comes with four mags. Two have extended capacity tactical extensions. One ZEV TECH and one Taran Tactical and two 15rd Magpull. The ZEV base pad gives you an extra 5 rounds in the magazine making the capacity 20 rather than 15.

These carbines were manufactured shortly after the Russian government sold the plans, material and tooling for the SKS rifle to China.
 
The first manufactured carbines were called Soviet-Sino the serial number contained a Russian Cryllic as the first character of the serial number as well as a Tula star on the left of receiver in line with the serial number.
 
The Ghost was the next batch of carbines manufactured under direct Soviet supervision, before adopting the a Arsenal 26 triangle with the 3 Chinese characters denoting a type 56 military grade carbine in the later part of 1956. 
 
This as with all the Soviet-Sino, and Ghost guns have Soviet parts and Soviet QC/Proof stamps in several locations on the weapon and stock.
 
This SKS carbine is 100% matching including the stock. No cleaning kit or sling.
 
The bore is bright, with sharp rifling, the action is tight, trigger is crisp.
 
Excellent piece of history. Not exactly pretty, but very interesting a great shooter to add to your collection.
 
The SKS is a robust over built weapon for its caliber. Proven in combat in several conflicts, and will outlast most other carbines in its class.
 
A very big bang for the buck.
 
Thanks for looking.
Will trade for:
Pistols no .22's. Rifles must be interesting."

Only 250 rounds fired (200 FMJ, 50 JHP). Excellent shooter (takes about five minutes to fall in love with the triangular sights), very accurate. If you’re a Glock fan, you’ll love this pistol, because it has the exact same grip angle. And that’s the only reason I’m selling it; I love the feel and how it shoots, but that grip angle is different from every other pistol I own, so it has to go. (Willie Bubbits, who designed the Glock, also designed the Steyr pistols.)No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga."
