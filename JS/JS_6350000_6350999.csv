I've seen them on Armslist for as low as $450 new but unfortunately they are all the way across the country. If there are any local offers available for a reliable semi auto 12 gauge please send me a message. I prefer to shoot it before I buy it otherwise I would grab the $450.00 one. Thanks!

Add the taxes in and I paid $740 for this beaut (Too much, I know lol)! *It has been brought to my attention that this firearm is now back in stock at Vance's and actually marked down to $549.99. News to me, so I had to edit this post incase you seen the pryor one. My prices are still pretty firm as I had them in the range of what the, now on sale, prices would still be.I am still asking for a trade Value of $650 and a cash price of $600. If you walk into the store right now, buy this same firearms at $549.99, add the $60 for the night sights, your at $609.99. Add in the awesome %7.5 sales tax and you still walk out the door at $655.75. So it being back in stock and on sale really doesnt effect me as I already had a $650 value on it."

When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public. A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in 9mm and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there. The Specialist ships with two 10-round magazines with bump pads and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear.

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.Specifications:Item #: PI-43502-01UPC_Code: 764503002533Description: GLK 43 9MM PST 6RD FSManufacturer: GlockModel #: 43Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Stainless Steel DuraCoatStock: Hint of Hot Pink DuraCoated PolymerSights: FT: White Dot RR: White OutlineBarrel: 3.39""Overall Length: 6.26""Weight: 16.19 ozCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 6+1Action: Safe Action# of Mags: 2Packaging: Black Plastic CaseReceiver: Hint of Hot Pink DuraCoated PolymerWidth 1.02"

Included with the gun is a hard carry case, two 17rd magazines, cleaning kit, lock and all factory literature. 
Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.
Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.  A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy."

These were originally owned by the Secret Service, obviously for use in the event of an attack. Manufactured in October of 2002, and the average expiration date is April 2013. Essex lists the shelf life at ""10+ years,"" and I can't imagine how they could ""go bad,"" but use at your own risk. WE HAVE TESTED SOME OF THESE HOODS AND THEY WORK PERFECTLY. Official description below. ""Lightweight, self-contained Essex Victim Rescue Unit VRU+ self-contained protective breathing device is on the market. In emergency egress and escape situations, it takes seconds to don, providing 360° visibility while supplying aviator-grade oxygen. This victim rescue unit protects your respiratory system and delivers head and vision from fire, toxic fumes, hazardous chemical spills, plus Sarin or mustard gases - for up to 60 minutes. Supplies oxygen via an Aviator Grade Compressed Oxygen O2 cylinder, with overpressure protection to prevent rupture."" Each comes in a yellow nylon over the shoulder carry case.
