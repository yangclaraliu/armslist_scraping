I will accept USPS Money Orders only. If you're a scammer, please don't bother with the fake cashier's check for a larger amount than the asking price, it's a waste of time. If you absolutely insist on another form of payment (cashier's check, etc.), please be aware it can take up to approximately 3 weeks to fully clear the issuing bank. I will only ship after the bank has confirmed the money order or check has fully cleared. After I receive a copy of your dealer's FFL, shipping would be $75 insured to your FFL (handguns are required by UPS/Fedex to be shipped overnight). Please note: if your FFL will not accept shipments from individuals, there will be an additional fee of $35 to have a local FFL do the shipping.Contact me with any questions you might have.

Here's a list of all of the upgrades and the extra stuff I have with it. It has an extended barrel instead of the one that sits flush with the slide bringing the barrel length to 4"". a solid firing pin retention pin from the CZ custom shop replacing the factory rollpin, fiber optic sights, an upgraded stainless steel guide rod and spring from http://ssguiderods.com replacing the factory plastic guide rod, a new trigger installed that has a flatter curve to it and allows for an easier double action pull and shorter trigger reset. I have 3 magazines for it, and I can include the tlr4 streamlight light laser combo.
 
 
Trades: The only trades I'm looking for are Metal framed 9mm handguns. Including a non railed Jericho 941 (slide mounted safety model), Browning Hi Power, or similar firearms. Cash+Trade combos for other weapons may be considered as well. No Black Powder, subcompact pistols, or non firearm related items please.

But, I haven't had the time to go shooting, so they just sat on the weapon the entire time. Because of this they are essentially brand new, since no rounds were shot through the gun while the optics were installed. There isn't a single scratch on either one, they are essentially brand new. I take very good care of my guns and optics. I am only selling them because I can't justify having them unless I have the time to shoot (often), which I don't. Plus, I could use the money Anyways, each comes in their original packaging. The G33 has the STS mount with shim and screws. The 558 is night vision compatible and comes with a torx wrench and ScopeCoat.I'm selling the G33.STS magnifier for $375 (shipped to your door). The 558.A65 I'm selling for $475(shipped). If you want both, I'll sell them to you for $800. These optics are amazing and I hate to get rid of them, but like I said, I can't justify keeping them, especially since I have a Burris scope for my M4 already.

He did a beautiful job and the sights are spot on.  I have additional new springs and five detonics mags (6 rounds). The original ad I purchased the pistol from is still up - I cannot post the link, but I can send it if you contact me.  I've put another $450-550 into it since then.  It shoots like a champ and is one of the easiest compact semi-autos I've shot.  In case you are not familiar with the pistol it is SAO.  I have not shot it much and it has become a safe queen as I tend to shoot cheaper loads, and do mostly Bullseye shooting these days.  Looking to sell or trade (trade potential is very limited - please don't waste our time with offers that don't hava anything to do with what I'm after.  $1000 OBO.

Has some petina but retains plenty of its original blueing that puts many of today's rifles to shame. The bore does have some browning in the grooves but lands are shiny and sharp. And saving the best detail for last NO IMPORT MARKS! Manufactured by Sauer in 1941. I have lots of pictures to send via text to serious buyers.  I hate to let this beautiful piece of history go but I'm not a Mauser or WWII firearm collector and I'm trying to raise the money for equipment for my start up business. Of course when I first acquired this ride I took the magical history tour to learn as much as I could about it. After talking with most of the local collectors the popular consensus as far as value goes is that in it's current condition but before it was fired to test function and safety was that it's worth at least $800. I have fired a few rounds thru it and it shoots and functions as it should. I'm asking $800 for local pick up/inspection, $850 outside of Danville, $900 with partial trade and a minimum of $500 in cash. Open to partial trades of modern firearms. Hand guns, long guns, possibly a HD 12ga shotgun."

Trades okay as well. I have put exactly 35 rounds through this gun.  Here are the full details on what makes up this gun.The billet receiver set is from Ascend Armory and is by far the nicest one on the market.  Everything on it is or can be fully ambidexterous, with the exception of the direction the casings eject.  The short throw selector is also from Ascend.  The majority of the LPK came preinstalled from Ascend.  The trigger is a Chip McCormick 3.5lb flat.  The buffer tube and end plate are from Battle Arms Development and the model is the Sabertube.  The grip is also aluminum and from Taran Tactical.  I wrapped it with paracord to soften it and also beef it up a bit.  It feels great either way.  The buffer is the JP Captured Silent Buffer and is hands down the best on the market.    The barrel is from Faxon and is 14.5"".  To make this a legal rifle, the Precision Armament M4-72 was pinned and welded in place by Shane at SR Tactical in Nixa.  The adjustable gas block is a low profile model from Superlative Arms and also has a bleed off feature.  It also has its own spring loaded tensioning pin with positive clicks on each turn.  The carbon fiber handguard weighs in at only 5oz with the barrel nut and is from Brigand Arms.  It is the Edge model. Its extremely strong and extremely lightweight.  The port door is from V Seven and is the minimalist design.  Its also titanium to save weight.  The skeletonized Nickel Boron lightweight BCG is from AIM.  The charging handle and extended latch is from Strike.Overall length of the gun is 32.125"" and weighs 4lbs 13.3oz.  The barrel is a 5.56 and can safely shoot .223 Remington as well.All items on this weapon were purchased new specifically for this build.Also included but not pictured is a picatinny rail riser and a Burris FastFire 3 reflex sight. Also purchased new for this job. For more pics, please inquire and I will send a link to view the other photos.Total price of this build, as pictured, was right at $2250."

Less than a 1000 of these were made, and even fewer were the ""longslide"" version. This incredibly little gun has a 4.3 inch barrel but is only a smidge over 5 inches despite its ability to eat a steady diet of +p ammo due to its revolutionary bullpup design. This great pistol has 200 flawless rounds through it. It is also one of the easiest auto pistols to rack, feeling like a 22 instead of a full tilt 9mm defensive gun. I am the original owner, and have the box, 2 mags and a custom made leather IWB holster. You may never see another one of these for sale on the forums, so don't let this one slip away. F2F with VA resident non-felons within about 45 minutes of Charlottesville. I have my eye on a new toy and several guns up for sale. When one of those goes, the rest go back in the safe.
