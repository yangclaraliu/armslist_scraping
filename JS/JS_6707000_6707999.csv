It's a takedown gun that loads and ejects from the bottom, and it doesn't have a trigger disconnector, so it'll slamfire through all 5+1 shells it can hold - all you have to do is hold the trigger down and pump. There's a reason why they used them as trench guns in the first World War!It's an uncommon and distinctive old shotgun with a lot of character. The previous owner(s?) cut the barrel back to 23 inches and nickeled it, but the work was done well - the barrel is nicely crowned and the bead is centered. The finish has held up remarkably well for a gun this old, with just a couple spots where it's wearing through. The serial puts the date of manufacture at 1924. While it has a little bit of wear and tear, the action is reasonbly smooth and the gun is mechanically fine. It's certainly a shooter. You don't see these very often and this is an exceptionally unique one, it definitely has that prohibition era style to it. I'm not really looking for a trade but I'm open to offers.Feel free to email me for more pictures or any questions."

Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface.   The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability. The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed. The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting. The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.

He is claiming to be out of state in Louisiana (with a California number) and that he will ship the guns via usps to you once he receives payment through wall mart. First of all, it is illegal to ship handguns from an unlicensed (non-ffl) to another non-licensed person unless they are in the same state. Being that he is claiming to ship a handgun from one state to another, person to person, is a federal violation. Furthermore, he is offering to ship via USPS, which isn't allowed to take handguns unless you are an ffl. (Ups and fed-ex can still). Be on on the lookout for ads with the number REDACTED. His name he claims in James Lafitte, claiming to live in Slidell, Louisiana. I have also seen similar posts on other sites with guns for ridiculously low prices, most likely so he can get people to forget the laws and send money without thinking that he might just take the money and run."
