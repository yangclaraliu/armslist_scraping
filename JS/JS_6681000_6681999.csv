Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.Available at two convienient locations-Forsyth-15262 US HWY 160Forsyth, Mo 65653REDACTEDREDACTED-Ozark-737 N 20th StOzark, Mo 65721REDACTEDREDACTED"

It has been broken in, so the action is silky smooth when properly lubricated. Included with this purchase is a detatchable aftermarket rail which was purchased for ~$60. This is extremely useful for mounting scopes and ensuring clearance from the bolt handle. This rifle is very light, perfect for shooters who do not wish to deal with arm fatigue. My reason for selling is simply that I have recently purchased other firearms and do not shoot this one often enough to keep it. Years ago I purchased this rifle for ~$720 new. On their website, CZ currently lists the new value as $733. I am asking 59% the combined new values of the rifle and rail ($439), considering these are used.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions"

That is General Luscious Pile commander of the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg. It was designed for one purpose only killing jihads or your mother in law if you get all liquored up one night. Lets examine this beauty shall we. The GEN started with just your basic Glock. He also had help from the Glock armoers. First feature is the SFs only night scope. It has a range up to 10 miles and allows for great target acquisition at these distances. The only one in the world like it. Next lets take a look at the Phase Plasma flashlight in the one million watt range. Thie is the only flashlight in the world the world that lets you bounce signals off the moon and come back to earth to see your target. Or if you don't want to go that route just torch everything within a 5 mile radius and rectify the problem forever. Next lets take a look at that awesome dagger shall we. It was also a concept of the GEN and  James Bond. It is made out of chromium a metal know only to the smartest metalurgest in the wold. Its designed to go right thru the armour on a M1 Abrams Tank with just a slight thrusting motion. I have also been asked if it comes with a bipod for those 2K  yard shots unfortunately NASA asked for the bipod back before sale to the public. It was so lite the whole unit would defy gravity and float off into space if you  arent holding on tite! So as you can see this isn't your average glock. There is no other one anywhere in the world like it. This one belonged to the most elite team of GBs at Fort Bragg. I was just lucky enough to get my hands on it.

Not heavily used. Post factory finished in Magpul FDE cerakote and graphite black cerakote for the controls. I have included a link to the Taurus page of the same model, only difference is the one I'm selling has a aluminum alloy frame. I am selling because I use my other guns far more often, and this one doesn't get out much. It will come in the original plastic case. With paddle holster, and 4 magazines. Front sight screw was stripped so it was drilled out and tapped -the metal was thin on the sides of the sight. Accuracy, strength and sight picture is not affected. There is a small mark near the muzzle on the slide. I am asking $415.00 - or $500 for the gun plus 300 rounds. 50 of blazer and 250 of UMC Remington. http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=60&category=Pistol&toggle=tp&breadcrumbseries=19"
