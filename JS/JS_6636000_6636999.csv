I bought this in 1992 when I was 18 as my primary deer rifle & it has been great. I have taken a lot of deer & hogs over the years but my hunting days are over & it's time to pass it on. It is topped with a Bushnell 6x18-50 scope that is sighted in at 100 yards. I come with a Reminton sling that was used in my last hunting trip, safari leather bullet holder, & 2 boxes of ammunition. I'm asking $650 and I'm pretty firm on the price as I feel it's a fair price for the condition & that this was made back when Reminton made really high quaility firearms.

This shotgun is unfired, I literally took it home after buying, cleaned it, and it has been in the safe since. I originally purchased this shotgun to get into clay shooting but it never really happened and i am now looking for funds to purchase a pistol. The shotgun comes in a nice soft case as pictured and 240 rounds of 12 gauge ammo that is all new in the box. This ammo includes 100 x winchester target loads, 125 rounds of other brand target loads, 10 x rounds of buckshot and 5 x rounds of 1 oz rifled slugs. Basically bought a bit of everything to go with the shotgun.

The rifle comes with the original hard case, one 30rd PMAG and the Magpul Front and Rear Flip-Up sight. I've added a Magpul vertical grip for the fore-end and Blackhawk Ladder Covers on the left and right rail. Included with the rifle is a Leupold Mark 2 30mm IMS mount with a Leupold VX-R Patrol 1.25-4x20. I also have a Magpul D60, 60 round drum magazine for sale if you are interested.If you are interested in the accuracy... with a Mark 4 4.5-14 mounted on it and with factory 55gr HPR V-Max (the barrel is a 1-9 twist), I was able to shoot just over one MOA from 100-300 yards.All in all, I have enjoyed shooting this rifle but I just don't shoot it as much as I thought I would. The reason I am selling it is because I would like to fund a long range hunting rifle build once I have this rifle sold. For reference, I have cleaned this rifle after every use (not much to clean, due to the piston operation) and it has been a safe queen for approximately 18 months.For the rifle and original accessories ( including rail covers and vertical grip), I am asking $1300. If you would like the VXR and the Mark 2 Mount, plus the 60 round PMag I am asking $1700.Buyer must pay for background check, and I will only sell in Oregon (sorry no shipping). Armslist won't let me add pictures from my phone but if you are interested, send me a message and I'll send a few your way. If you have any questions, please ask.-E"

One of the most accurate compact 45 autos I’ve had.
 
Inspired by the famous 1911 Design: This is a beauty of a gun and “Classic” all the way: Solidly built with Star’s weapons grade steel slide, parts and barrel. Forged steel parts as it precedes the age of MIM. This gun represents the classic style of handguns with forged steel manufacturing, instead of stamped steel, alloy frames, plastic and polymer so common today. 
Mid-size gun is compact and great for concealed carry as it's extremely flat.  Similar to the classic 1911 Colt Commander.
Performance and Handling: Like so many other Star pistols, it is a very stable, tame shooter in your hand. Recoil is light and still very controllable even with hot loads. Love the accuracy and reliability shooting all kinds of ammo, JHP, etc. 
Colt 1911 Commonalities:   The many similarities to the 1911 ACP make this pistol a favorite. First, the look and feel are squarely 1911. That very classic and natural pick up.
Action & Trigger: single-action with locked breech. Single action trigger break is excellent – very clean! Serrated finger pad for a sure grip.
 PREMIUM FEATURES:
Safeties: Thumb safety on left side like the Colt 1911. You can carry cocked and locked. Gun also has a Magazine Disconnect for additional safety.
Sights: notched rear blade and serrated front ramp. Easy to pick up at speed. The sight picture is easy to obtain in both slow and rapid-fire drills. The rear sight is drift adjustable for windage and elevation!
Full-length guide rod with captive recoil spring.
Removable barrel bushing.
  
As a testament to their quality, Star BM is still used by police, security and military agencies in Spain. The PD stands for Police Department as these were designed for the police in Spain.  It reflects the reliability, durability and the quality of Spanish pistols and to the skill and workmanship of the workers of Star Firearms Bonifacio.
Conclusion:  The easy handling and resemblances to the classic Colt 1911 make this pistol a favorite among collectors, recreational shooters, or carry owners.
 
 
OTHER INFORMATION:
History & Origins: After the First World War started, Star designers fell in love with the Colt 1911 and focused on cloning it (instead of other European designs). After the war, many US soldiers liked the similar to their 1911 and brought back Star pistols to the US. Many others bought them when offered commercially, don’t want to part with them and still carry them.* This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.(No trades.  No silly low offers - those messages will not be returned.)"

This rifle is loaded, as it should be. 3 mags and a tactical soft case. I am only looking to get my money back in parts and have very little wiggle roon. Can add more mags for 11$ each and can add a tactical red dot with quick release mount for 60$. This gun is definitely worth it. Can meet in phoenix. Give me a call or text.
