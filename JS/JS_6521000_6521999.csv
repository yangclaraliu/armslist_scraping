I had to open the barrel channel to fully float the heavier than standard barrel & it's not offered in a bull-barrel configuration. I'm proud to say that it looks like a factory job though! It took hours! I've pillar bedded the stock with stainless pillars, but I have yet to compound bed the action. As it sits, the action doesn't touch the wood in the channel. It's cleared by about 0.015"" to leave room for the compound. It's absolutely fine to shoot as is, but solid bedding should tighten the groups up a little more.

This modern sporting rifle will easily become the centerpiece of any collection and will be the one handed down from generation to generation.The quality comes from the original hot hammer forged and milled receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and trigger, the cold hammer forged and chrome lined barrel, and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience. All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes.""Must have a VA CWP and sign a simple BOS.looking for a nice factory ar15 or cz evo scorpion pistol, tavor, Daniel defense"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  The only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same stock configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade, not going to straight trade on something I can buy for hundreds less.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and another 9mm stripped lower and cash or??  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and another 9mm lower, stripped.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and $250-$300 cash, depending if new or used, since I can buy those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.  
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
