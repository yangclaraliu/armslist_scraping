It is chambered for 3 inch shells. The old checkering on the walnut stock is beautiful. The only real complaint is that at some point the ejector rivet was replaced. To make that job look finished, you have to polish and reblue the receiver. Whoever did this just polished the rivet and cold-blued it. You can see it in the picture, but it actually looks better then the picture shows. The gun appears to be fully functional, but I have not fired it."

The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush to the bottom of the pistol. At 14 oz (400 g) unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines.[2] An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12-round magazines will also work, with a matching short adapter sleeve, as well. Accessories such as trigger shoes, finger-rests, belt clips, steel guide rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray- and OD green-colored polymer grip housings, night sights, and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer."

And it didn't even need it I decided to have it done also the pistol has not one single flaw I purchased separately brand new stainless steel pins and a stainless steel takedown lever that you can install if you buy it before I send it to rockyourglock.com if I end up sending it in I will be asking upwards of $1,000 for the pistol it comes in the original tupperware box with 2 original 10 RD magazines Plus a 13 round magazine and a 26 round magazine the extra modifications I wanted to do to finish the pistol can all be done at rockyourglock.com I was going to put diamond plate stippling on the grip replace the magazine release button for an upgraded one and install a brand new Glock trigger essentially making the pistol 100% brand new and Custom since every single part has been replaced. This is the Glock 21c 2.5 to the collectors out there and is one of the top 10 rarest Glock pistols to find I will accept the first cash offerthat is fair or if it does not sthatby xmas I will send it and have the work done then it will be $1,000 I have went over pricing and with the trigger job and everything included that's where I am at on the pistol and it will be worth every penny because you just cannot find these w-the-box anymore had Glock refinish the slide and put on brand new steel sights it is unfired since the work every part inside the slide was replaced at my request. this is a great opportunity to grab a superior collectors item at a decent price the last one I seen sold for $1,000 Plus on GunBroker.

Just couldn't resist.  I ordered it to beat the CA deadline and it's one SWEET rifle!  It's actually an SBR with a fake suppressor threaded on and spot welded to be 'permanent' (which you can remove if you move out of this crazy state and SBR)... It's the 10"" barrel krink which is known for maintaining pretty good accuracy and only losing a couple hundred fps compared to 5.56 that loses about twice as much...  This thing is BRAND NEW, and I just brought it home from the shop a day ago...  Like I said, if I can sell it before the 21st (last day to transfer to someone to make the 2016 deadline) it'll put some funds back in the bank account.  If not, SWEET!  I'll still have this friggin beauty of a rifle...So asking $1700 to try and recoup costs and make the pain of selling it a little more bearable...  You can NO LONGER get these things here in CA because of the stupid new BS laws, so this is a last chance kind of deal.  Whoever gets this thing will be one happy friggin shooter!Any questions and of course serious inquiries only CALL REDACTED... (have sold quite a bit on armslist so I can pick out the look-loos pretty easy, so don't waste your time, email/text will just be deleted)... Calls preferred.I am located just outside of Chico, so about 1 1/2hrs from Sacramento... Willing to drive down to Chico to do the transfer (bout 30min drive for me)... Buyer pays $35 transfer fee at the FFL and I'll say it in advance, I won't be willing to drive to timbuktu to do this deal, Chico only.  Like mentioned, whoever gets this thing will be friggin stoked, once you see it in person you might have to change ur shorts!!!  It's well worth the drive.  I honestly should be posting it for something crazy like $2k but I'm not a dick... I'm also not in a big hurry to sell this thing and am very firm on the $1700 price.  K, nuff blabbin, Happy Holidays folks!!"

It will change someday when men and women of strength and honor come.Thanks for reading.  Now go and learn!  I believe that a part of responsible gun ownership is education.  Education of the role weapons have played in history and the role they will play - under the rule of the men and women of our governments who come and go on this earth.  Never take your Freedom for granted my friends.  It could be taken away tomorrow by men and women who declare it so with the stroke of a pen.You are responsible for legality of ownership.    I am not registered on Armslist but you will find to be completely legitimate.  Spammers and scammers look elsewhere, so if you don't provide a telephone number you may not be contacted.

I had the remington pump 06 that i used instead.   Its a good gun, older than any 06 I have, but shoots very well for the optic i have on it. This gun is ready to hunt with the current scope.

These are not imported anymore, you can see where the old ban had it way with this rifle by the sawn off bayonette lug and the tackwelded nut on the barrel threads making it a legal sporting rifle. Chinese ak's have a thicker receiver than other ak's. This is an interesting piece of history. Very accurate for an AK because of the longer barrel.

I know I am loosing value on it as there are polish, hungarian, bulgy, and romy stocks abound for less, but this is the parts correct variant for the build and worth noting. Willing to look at trades, but not looking for much in particular. As a side note, I have 10- surplus polish & 1- 40 rd Circle 10 magazine repair kits and >2,900 rounds available if your wanting to take hte whole package all or nothing. toying with getting out of the round all together as this is the only thing I have left in it and I guess I am not going to finish the project. looking for $1,400. feel free to ask questions"

From a distance it just looks like a cool splotchy/smokey dark gray and black camo pattern, but when you get closer you see that it's actually covered in dozens of little skulls. It has a great trigger, excellent pistol grip (especially if you have larger hands like I do), a rail on the top, and really nice adjustable military-style sights (front post has a green glowing insert).18.5"" barrel has a tactical choke with a built in flash suppressor. And it has a REALLY thick rubber buttpad (you need it). Fires 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells, and also included are two different gas ""valves"" that you switch out (takes 2 minutes) for heavier or lighter loads to make sure the semi auto action cycles properly.I got this gun new earlier this year, and put EXACTLY 55 rounds through it--2 boxes of regular target loads and 5 slugs. After the fun factor wore off (this thing can cause a lot of mayhem), I realized that aside from home defense I was probably not going to ever take it out shooting again because it really beats the hell out of you, even with the buttpad.But if you want a high quality tactical shotgun that looks like it belongs in Modern Warfare, this gun is for you.Absolutely NO TRADES. I have tons of guns, ammo, accessories, and gear.
