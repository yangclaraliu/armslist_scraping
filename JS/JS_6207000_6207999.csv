Norinco is a Chinese engineering and manufacturing company.   Specifications    SKS   Caliber: 7.62x39mm   Capacity: 10   Sights: Tangent rear sight with hooded front sight   Features: Available with a detachable box magazine<br />Gas-piston operating system with tilting bolt; bayonet stud; and fixed magazine   Action: Semi-auto   Stock: Wood   Material/Finish: Stamped steel   Weight: 8.5 pounds   Barrel Length: 20.5""   Overall Length: 40.2""   MSRP $400.00       During the years prior to the infamous Clinton Assault Weapons ban, a gun buyer could pick up a Norinco SKS for under $70.00. At the time, many American gun owners were leery of the inexpensive guns because the quality was unknown.   Years later, however, the Nornico SKS has a reputation for being drop dead reliable and has passable accuracy.     At one time, you could also buy a thousand rounds of 7.62x39mm, which is the most common SKS caliber, for well below $100. Even today, it is an economical choice when compared to other calibers and makes a great mid-range choice for plinking or even self-defense.  Shooting the SKS is easy because the weight and large bolt absorb much of the felt recoil, although for many, the crude sights hinder accurate shooting.  SKS rifles generally have a 10 round fixed magazine that can be loaded via stripper clips. Larger capacity fixed magazines with questionable reliability are available as well.   Some SKS aficionadas can load the gun with stripper clips with the same speed as loading a detachable magazine into an AR-15 or AK-47.  It does take practice, however.   There is no question that the SKS, in any form, lacks the refinement of the AR-15 or many other western designed combat rifles. What it lacks in refinement is more than made up for in ease of use, reliability and by the fact that it is so much fun to shoot.  Because the SKS has a short barrel and stock they are easy to maneuver in a house and make a great home defense rifle in rural areas. However, the risk of over-penetration due to the velocity of the 7.62x39mm round makes the gun a risky home defense choice in a heavily populated area.   For those accustomed to high-end rifles, the SKS might seem a little crude, and truthfully, it is. But, an informal plinking session with the SKS is too much fun to put into words. Try it and you are likely to immediately run out and get one for yourself.    It is the kind of rifle you can put in the safe without cleaning after a shooting session and know it will fire the next time you make a trip to the range. The inexpensive price tag also means an errant fingerprint or rust spot won’t ruin your day.   SKS rifles aren’t fussy, ammunition sensitive or particularly nice to look at. Yet, they are perfectly suited to their role in the gun world as a simple utilitarian tool.   These days, you can’t get one for less than $70.00 anymore and ammunition prices have climbed as well. But, it still remains a great gun for a great price.  Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy it onliine at www.copsgunshop.net."

The LEF-T Entry Operator-L addresses the AR’s features that are most vexing to left-handed shooters—the ejection port and the lack of a left-hand safety/selector lever—and has a unique ambidextrous release lever on the charging handle. Additionally, the bolt stop is reversed to the right side of the lower receiver, and although the magazine-release button is still in its original position, it has been supplemented by a second release on the left-side of the gun. This allows a left-handed operator to release the magazine and bolt stop in the same manner as a right-handed operator. Of course, the gun is fitted out with all the bells and whistles that shooters have come to expect. Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy it online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Honestly, this is the nicest Chilean Mauser I have ever seen.  The only reason I am selling/trading it because I am trying to consolidate calibres.Feel free to text me at REDACTED.  Thanks :)
BILL OF SALE IS REQUIRED:This rifle requires a bill of sale.  I use the ATF form 4473.  However, I do not require that you provide your social security number or drivers license number on the form, but I do insist that you provide the rest of the information on the form along with filling out the questions on the form.  The form 4473 is the same form you fill out when you purchase a gun from a gun store.  I will be comparing the completed form to your drivers license.OPEN TO TRADES:Swiss K31Swiss K11Swedish Mauser M38Swedish Mauser M94Persian MauserOther Mausers in 8MMAR-15Rifles in 6.5 Swedish Mauser CaliberOther Rifles? Pistols I would be interested in:Glock 19*Obviously I would be willing to include cash in some of these trades :)

Let me know what you have.  I also have a 16 gauge that's virtually identical to the 12 gauge if you'd prefer something smaller than 12 gauge."

I bought it for $170 at Cabelas (who spends that on a holster?!). I thought that it would work for me but my loss is your gain. I am looking to at least get $100 for it as it is like new. I left the tag ends so that it is still fully adjustable. It is made for a full size 1911 but would work well for any size really.Please either email or text - easier for me that way!
