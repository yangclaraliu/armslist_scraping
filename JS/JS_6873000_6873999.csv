The Firing Pin Safety catch acts as a main drop safety catch which is disengaged only when the trigger is fully depressed. The hammer can be lowered safely by a dual-purpose lever located on the left side of the frame in front of the ambidextrous manual safety catch. The safety catch can be engaged with the hammer in either a cocked or decocked position. When put on “safe” it disconnects the trigger bar from the sear. The safety catch can be intuitively disengaged with the thumb in a down-sweeping motion. A loaded chamber indicator both visually and tactilely declares the presence of a round in the chamber. Operation REX zero 1 semi-automatic pistol operates on the modified Browning short recoil principle with the enlarged back portion of the barrel locking into the slide’s ejection port (the 7.65 mm model is blowback operated). Pushing down on the dual-purpose slide stop/decocker will first release the slide (if locked to the back) and then safely lower the hammer. The firing mechanism with exposed hammer operates is classical single and double action modes with the hammer remaining cocked after each cycling of the slide. The single action trigger breaks crisply at 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs) and resets with a short travel of 3 mm. the smooth and long double action 6 kg (13 lbs) trigger pull is engineered with safety in mind. The magazine is released with an ambidextrous button at the base of the trigger guard. Material All key components: the slide, the frame as well as the barrel are made from solid bar stock. The slide is machined from chromolly steel and light but though 7075 aircraft aluminum alloy is used for the frame. The heart of the pistol is a precision machined barrel, cold hammer-forged from one piece of chromolly steel. The slide and barrel undergo a proprietary nitro carburizing surface protection process that provides high surface hardness and extreme corrosion resistance for extended use or storage in hostile environments. Hard anodizing is used on the aluminum frame for its abrasion resistance. The barrel unlocking block with an angular ramp is also a solid steel piece inserted in the frame. Design The entire design process was performance driven and oriented towards long-term durability. The materials and technologically advanced manufacturing process will ensure cost effectiveness and an extremely long life cycle. An internal extractor was chosen since it allows for a closed slide design and renders the same or better reliability with fewer parts. The long dustcover adds to the rigidity of construction and incorporates full-length slide guides and an extended accessory interface (MIL-STD-1913). The large trigger guard was conceived for use with various gloves. The iron sights with contrasting white dots enable quick target acquisition. The pistol can be safety disassembled without any tools – the slide must be fully retracted and no trigger pull is necessary."

Notice it doesn't have the goofy looking shovel handle sticking out the back like an AR ""pistol"" does. Much easier to get around a corner with this one! Once I bought the pistol I then added the following:- Vortex Strikefire halo site. Not a cheap Chinese deal. Was over $200 back when I bought it. Closer to $300 if memory serves me. You can choose Green or Red reticle. Still has the original battery and shines bright, so that tells you I've used it very little.- Laser/illuminator combo (green laser) - paid $90- The sling and custom attachements (not KelTec junk). Fox sling, forget who made the attachements, but it was a guy who made them specific for PLR16's. Paid $50 for the mounts, sling, etc.- Red Lion Forend - $150- Two 30 round Pmags. $24- The gun was $550So....just over $1k in it. I've shot exactly 100 rounds through it.

It was mounted on a rifle for display purposes only. Item was removed when rifle sold and owner wanted a different BUIS setup installed. MATECH sights are notorious for having a weak rail recoil screw that can snap of over tightened. This one was replaced with the stronger uupgraded Recoil screw from LWRC. Below are all of the specs listed by the manufacturer. (It's a lot of language that I can sum up for you: this sight has faithfully served the US Army for a long time because it works very well at various engagement ranges and is extremely durable). U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

One I got on my MPX (in photo below) and the other is still brand new in box. Price is $270, which is what I paid tax included. I bought both because it took forever for the dealer to get them in, so I thought what the heck. What is this brace you ask...well, per the ATF, the Sig Sauer MPX cannot have a stock. Doing so will then it into an SBR, thus, you will need a tax stamp before you can use that. Tax stamp is $200 and will require almost a year wait before you're approved. This is the alternative way, to make it a pistol, and a pistol cannot have a stock, but can have a supportive brace. The ATF recently overturned the forbidden shouldering of this brace. What this meant was that as long as you have an SB Tactical brace , you CAN shoulder the MPX to shoot. Please text me me with questions; (28l) 773 - 82 SlX NlNE"

Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer.

It will NOT come with the 21-round extended magazine as I purchased that separately after I got the pistol. It's the only photo I have of the pistol with the Apex installed already.

Price: I am selling all of my guns below “street” value! - $400 cash (firm)
Factory Description: A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire and easy to shoot accurately. With Walther, performance comes in small packages.
Description: This carry gun is mint to near mint in every way. Only 100 or so rounds have been fired through her. This gun comes from a large private collection that is getting sized down. This 40 S&W is perfect for home protection, target practice, or conceal carry. It shoots great and has perfect fit and finish, pictures do not do it justice. I am an avid shooter and gun collector, I am not a dealer or “gun flipper”. I shoot everything that I own and have a deep love and passion for all firearms. I try to shoot at least a few times a week, year round. I am only selling this gun to buy and build different projects. There is nothing wrong with this firearm, I am going to be putting up around 20 guns on this site in the next few weeks. I am willing to meet you at any local gun shop, police station, or public building in my area. Comes with factory case, 2 magazines, some target ammo, some carry ammo, and two high end holsters.

Price: I am selling all of my guns below “street” value! - $900 cash (firm)
Description: It doesn’t get much better this this! The Belgium made A5 is one of the finest shotguns ever made! Great for gun for hunting, shooting, trap, and skeet! I’ve had this gun in my collection for a long time but I don’t shoot her anymore, she needs to go to a new home. This gun comes from a large private collection that is getting sized down. This 12 gauge is perfect for the investor too! It shoots great and has near perfect fit and finish, pictures do not do it justice. I am an avid shooter and gun collector, I am not a dealer or “gun flipper”. I shoot everything that I own and have a deep love and passion for all firearms. I try to shoot at least a few times a week, year round. I am only selling this gun to buy and build different projects. There is nothing wrong with this firearm, I am going to be putting up around 20 guns on this site in the next few weeks. I am willing to meet you at any local gun shop, police station, or public building in my area. I would prefer to sell to CCW/CPL carriers. I am going to ask for ID and will not sell to anyone underage or in bad standing. Please feel free to call or text me if you have questions. I’ve had it appraised a few times (insurance reasons) and the lowest number I got was $1,200, don’t miss this one!
