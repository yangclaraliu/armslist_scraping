It has an even brown patina on the metal, but very little pitting or actual crusty rust. All of the metal has been meticulously cleaned with flitz polish, and well oiled. The finish is actually nice looking, and in no way impacts the function of the firearm.
Speaking of the action, these M11's are the American-Made equivalent of the Browning A5. This means it is a long-recoil action. The barrel cycles backwards with the bolt for the full length of the cartridge before releasing. This makes for a very unique recoil impulse, and a quite reliable autoloading shotgun! The mechanism can be adjusted for different loads, and will cycle nearly anything if set up properly.If you are looking for a very unique shotgun with a mechanism that is different from anything else, look no further!

This is the same bullet that is in the LeveRevolution. Not only are they safe they also deliver the flattest trajectories ever from these firearms. Another benefit of Flex Tip technology is devastating terminal performance. Upon impact the flexible tip deforms back into the bullet initiating violent controlled expansion that transfers a great deal of energy to the vitals. At the same time the heavy jacket over the shank of the bullet and famous InterLock feature keep the core and jacket physically locked together to ensure high weight retention.
