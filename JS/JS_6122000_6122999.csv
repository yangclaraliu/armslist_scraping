It is a pre-Model 36 version J-frame built in 1956. That's right...this classic snubnose revolver is sixty years old but you couldn't tell it by looking at or shooting it. Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this pre-Model 36 Flat Latch J-frame Chiefs Special has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder and can be fired in single or double action. This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a blued finish and has the original diamond-type wood grips with serial numbers that match the round butt frame.This classic S&W revolver is in great condition for its age. There is some honest holster wear on the bottom front of the frame and muzzle and a small chip in the bottom of the upper portion of the right wood grip. This gun was carried some but only occasionally fired. Very clean and shiny bore and cylinders with no rust or damage on this gun. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.I have fired 50 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is one that is of the age it could be put away in a collection to fondle and admire, but is also dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails from folks who did not meet or were not able to verify the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now.
