The thing that really makes this rifle special is the adjustable gas piston and the trigger system is like none other. It's in excellent condition  the only markings  on it is from shell injection. Once you fire this Model Sig you will automatically get injection markings. 
 
Your and my detailed specification knowledge of this rifle may differ a little but nevertheless this rifle is somewhat rare and hard to find. Please do your research, I don't feel like answering 20 different questions. Well maybe 10 LOL."

Leupold will give you one free customized dial when you contact them with your specific rifle cartridge information. They'll send you a custom made elevation turret dial that is marked in yardage that will allow you to very accurately dial in for bullet drop compensation of your specific bullet trajectory drop.  This is a much more accurate method than using BDC style reticles and has a much less cluttered \ confusing view through the scope as well.  BDC reticles are built using an averaging method of various rifle bullet velocities and ballistic coefficients so they may get you close to target out at range but are far from ideal to really depend on for bullet drop corrections. I have played with these VX-6 scopes enough to fully trust their adjustments. I have all my VX-6 scoped rifles zeroed in at 100 yards and have played with them out to 530 yards so far and every time the adjustments are right on at various ranges out to 530 yards. They all return my point of impact back to 100 yards when dialing the turret back to its zero mark. 530 yards just happens to be the max distance I have available to me to shoot but I sure wish I had access to a longer range.   More dials can be ordered through Leupold for this scope at any time in case you wanted to use different loadings for your rifle later on or even use the scope on a totally different rifle and caliber.  The Firedot on these scopes is awesome in low light or during day time use. When the scope is set to 2X magnification it can be used as a red dot optic for quick target acquisition. On 2X it has enough field of view I can see the last couple inches of my 22” rifle barrel that it’s mounted on.  I have a 1-6x24mm VX-6 mounted on a 16” AR and I can see the whole flash suppressor when it’s set on 1X.
I bought my first VX-6 Firedot a year ago and liked it so much I ended up buying 4 more recently to re-scope all my rifles with but after thinking about it I've decided to not re-scope one of my rifles that I rarely shoot so I'm offering this brand new scope up for sell at a discount to someone wanting a top end optic for their favorite hunting, target or AR rifle.  Look around, check prices and reviews of these scopes and you'll see this is a very fair deal for this top end optic.
I have been swamped with trade offers for this scope so unless you have SPECIFICALLY one of the firearms that I've listed below as being interested in then don’t make trade offers. If you still feel so inclined to make a trade offer with something other than what’s listed then be willing to part with your item at a bargain price and include what that price is so I can consider; otherwise I will not waist time with responding.

I have the original reciept from Charlies Sporting Goods (4-16-2012) in Albuquerque for $629.00. I have fired only a few shells through it just to see if all functioned as intended. I put 8 FIOCCHI Game  & Target shells though it then went about heating up my 9mm with a few hundred rounds at Calipers.The shot gun was bought for my daughter and son-in-law's home protection but my grandson was born in October 2012 and back the gun came. It's been in a rifle case in my closet ever since. I mention all this because this is ALL the history the gun has.I'm selling the gun for less than what a new one can be had for this time of year (holidays) without 7% sales tax added in. As a bonus I'm throwing in the remainder of the box of Fiocchi shells I used the 8 test rounds out of...$42.00 for a full box when I bought it with the Browning.Actuall Total - $629.00 + 7% sales tax ($44.00) + 1 box of FIOCCHI shells (minus 8 rounds) ($42.00) = $715.00Thanks for looking.

These rounds will certainly work on our local whitetale deer but there certainly isn't a need to use such a premium round on our smaller whitetales in this area.  These rounds would be ideal for someone planning to take an elk or mule deer hunt out west, especially for longer range shots.  They would probably be great for black bear or hogs here or great for some larger northern whitetales."

I have been swamped with trade offers for this pistol so unless you have SPECIFICALLY one of the firearms that I've listed below as being interested in then don’t make trade offers. If you still feel so inclined to make a trade offer with something other than what’s listed then be willing to part with your item at a bargain price and include what that price is so I can consider; otherwise I will not waist time with responding.

I believe I have all the kinks worked out, but the only way to know for sure is to run some traffic through it and see what happens. To do this, I need beta testers, which will give me a random sampling of internet providers, web browsers, etc. This will ensure that the site is tweaked to work with most users.Anyone can participate. You don't have to have any experience with computers, or even with forums for that matter. All you have to do is use the site and report any problems you encounter and make suggestions if you think something should be changed.There's no pay involved, but here's what you would be getting in return. You will have very early join dates, meaning that when the site gets big enough to start picking moderators you will be in the running. And while I obviously can't promise moderator positions to everyone who participates, I can promise you that you will have the satisfaction of getting in on the ground floor and shaping the development of a new forum from the very beginning. It should be a really fun process for all involved, especially if you're a creative person who enjoys building things.If you're interested, send me an email through Armslist and I will send you a password for a beta tester's account. Thanks for your help!"

Pistol has had 43 rounds of Red Army Standard through it (cut it short of the 60 as it is a rude little sucker for those shooting near me). Fully functional pistol as it comes, some milling by a gunsmith or machinist on the rear trunnion and the appropriate ATF filing and tax stamp and you can build what is about as near a factory M92 from Zastava as you are going to get. While the factory muzzle boosters where brought in en masse by Century Arms (~$20), finding a new production Zastava underfolder was not easy or cheap. This came off of an imported NPAP DF that was parted out, these stocks as surplus tend to go for over 3 digits. I know I am loosing value on it as there are polish, hungarian, bulgy, and romy stocks abound for less, but this is the parts correct variant for the build and worth noting.

Bought new about 18 months ago. I only put around 125-150 rounds through it. It cycled subs (RWS&Eley subsonic) with the can very well. It cycled with standard velocity when I tried it without a can (maybe 10 rounds) just playing.  You can find the ammo it likes or use CCI and I don't think you can go wrong with mini-mags or standard velocity.  Being a .22 it is going to get dirty, keeping the bolt oiled and wiped down really makes all the difference. It has the Taccom ULW, carbon fiber tension wrapped, steel 7"" barrel. The bolt is an atchisson ($100 value) .22lr bolt with a Taccom collar.  Standard mil-spec charging handle also included.  The upper is an Anderson with dust cover and forward assist installed (Forward assist is only for looks, doesn't function with this bolt).  It has a 7"" picatinny rail forearm. I used this rail to allow my can to be shrouded partially, extended roughly 3"" with this rail.  Will include (1) 25 round Blackdog X-Form mag. If you want more mags I have a couple and will sell for $20 each. They are new and $25 each is normal cost.  Price is firm. Thanks for taking a look.  Will ship first class with tracking."

I bought this shotgun (my first gun) new in July of 2014 for $189. Due to a change in careers I am selling off my gun collection, and this gun is the last to go.The barrel is 18.5 inches long, cylinder bore, no bead sight (though there is an untapped hole for a sight). The bluing is in good condition. The barrel was sawed off shortly after purchase; the cut end has been filed and heat-blued and is not warped or cut crookedly. The barrel securement is tight, though not overly so; if the release lever is depressed, a flick of the arm will cause the barrel to break downward. Closing it with two hands is recommended. There is no looseness when the gun is broken open, and the manufacturer describes the lockup as ""tight as a bank vault door"". After thousands of rounds, this still holds true. The single-action hammer must be cocked before each shot. A transfer bar prevents a discharge if the trigger is not pulled. The trigger cleanly breaks at 9 ounces. The firing pin hits hard; I have never had a misfire with this gun when using modern shotgun ammunition. An ejector will throw the spent shell a few feet back over the shooter's shoulder when the barrel is opened. Some brands of ammunition don't eject as well as others; I have never had a problem with Federal or Remington ammo, but Winchester White Box or Suprema 00 buckshot sometimes refuses to eject. If the chamber is clean and lubricated, all shells should eject properly.The stock has a couple holes drilled in it, and it is chipped near the butt. The length of pull is around 13 inches, good for all sizes. The forend is wood. A small hole has been drilled in it for a sling lug. There are a few scratches in it. Otherwise it is unchanged.Recoil: Recoil is manageable by anyone when using light birdshot rounds. The buttstock is equipped with an aftermarket recoil pad not fitted for the gun, but it works. Shooting 3'' loads out of this five pound gun is not for the first time shooter, however. The pad prevents bruising, but the kick is still fierce.Spread: Rule of thumb, one inch of spread for every yard of distance. The type of ammo you choose will affect the spread significantly. With clay pigeons, if you aim right, this shotgun can hit it. I am including a few other accessories: A 3 inch unrifled steel adapter that allows this shotgun to shoot 9mm Luger rounds. It is reasonably accurate with some practice, 3 inch groups at 25 yards without a rest.
