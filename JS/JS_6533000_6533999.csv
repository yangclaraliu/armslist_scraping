The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.
The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.
The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.
An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces affecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.
The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical.Sales to Kentucky Residence Only with Valid Drivers License"

I'm looking for a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower and side charging uppers.  I'll even consider PSA(or similar brands) pistol uppers and cash since I can get those new complete from PSA for around $300 shipped.

$1,300 firm in cash or better in trade.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's still new.  Not going to be interested in trades unless the value is there, Thanks.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56, another 9mm stripped lower, side charging uppers and cash or??  Factory Glock 33rd. 9mm mags in new to like new condition.
If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.  If you don't mention cash or other either way, I will assume you want a straight trade.  
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.

It also shoots: .32 S&W, .32 S&WLong, and .32 H&R Magnum. It should shoot .32acp as well, but I have NEVER tested that in this gun, since you might get a cylinder lock if the firing pin punctures the thin rimmed primer on a .32acp. Fires FLAWLESSLY with the aforementioned four other calibers however. I have put less than 250 rounds through this gun, it is clean and in excellent condition. This gun is one of the MOST versitle out there. The smallest calibers are close to .22lr or .22wmr, the middle ones range from .380 to 9mm, .327 in regular loads are between 9mm+P and .357 magnum. Ammo for this gun runs from about .30 cents to 1.30 a piece depending on the caliber and type/brand. It weighs about 27 ounces, and could be a CCW on a medium to large framed individual. As an outdoor gun it is the MOST remarkable. The recoil is approximately about 30% less than .357 magnum while staying close to its regular load power.Also comes with: 4 HKS speed loaders, Outbags drop leg hunting holster with ammo loops, Ace soft padded case, extra Hogue rubber grips, Harwell Leather/Kydex Tuckable CCW holster, Fobus OWB Holster, 6 Speed Strips (2x6, 4x8), over 730 rounds of ammo (about 1/3 32s&wl, 2/3 .327, plus some misc .32 types), a Rings Blue Gun of a Ruger Sp101 (for holster draw training), all of my .32 H&R & .327 brass shot out of it, a heavy duty ammo case (ex-gulf war grenade case), a couple of 50rd ammo boxes, and the original box/papers/lock, etcMost of the extra stuff is like new and again the gun is clean, excellent condition and lighlty used. New all of this would cost you $1100.00 at the lowest prices available online so I am asking for just $800.00 . Sorry, I am NOT looking for ANY trades right now. Alternatively we can do an FFL transfer on YOUR dime. I will entertain reasonalbe offers but please do not waste your time lowballing me, I do not NEED to sell it.

This kit also does not require any permanent modifications to your rifle to install it (something that was important to me). Pictures do show stock already installed on my SKS with a red dot scope, these items are not included in this listing.
