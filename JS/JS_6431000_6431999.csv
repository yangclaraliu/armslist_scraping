The systems main purpose is to reduce felt recoil by 30%. There are two functions that happen when the system engages, the primary impulse begins to travel the brass piece rearwards and the secondary impulse begins to travel the follower rearward and the two meet and cancel each other out. Another added feature with this system is the captured spring which allows for a quieter platform as the BCG travels through the buffer tube."

Superformance ammunition is 100 to 200 fps FASTER than any conventional ammunition on the market today, and achieves this performance in EVERY gun, WITHOUT increases in felt recoil, muzzle blast, temperature sensitivity, fouling or loss of accuracy. Innovative Superformance is a cutting edge technological advancement in ammunition design that transcends convention and achieves the highest performance of any ammunition on the market today. Specialized Superformance uses ultra progressive propellants that take your favorite SST or GMX bullets to levels of performance that are simply unattainable with conventional propellants. In order to get more velocity in the past – shooters have used a brute force approach – large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case. Ultimately this leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution is an elegant approach that utilizes specialized powders…at NORMAL charge weights, that impart ALL useable energy to the bullet reducing the ROCKET NOZZLE EFFECT at the muzzle while still increasing velocity! Versatile Superformance provides increased performance, and is safe to use in ALL firearms, including semi-autos*, lever gun and pump actions. Increases in rifle performance, no increases in barrel wear and felt recoil, along with superior temperature stability are all realized with Superformance ammunition.PayPal: For PayPal transactions please send us your PayPal email address and we will send you an invoice for the products you would like to purchase.

Serial number is 66782. This revolver has the early wrap around grips. The box is in fair condition. I am not the first owner of the revolver, however I have known the person who owned it before me for over 35 years and if he tells me he never fired it once, he never fired it once. I also took it to a 25 year long gunsmith for evaluation and the gun is in its original condition and not one bullet was chambered in it. When you see it, you will know exactly what we are talking about. The grips are just as perfect with absolutely no damage, scratches, nicks, etc. This style of grip was only used for a very short time before switching to the slab sided ones. The blue finish would rate 99%+ condition. This is as nice as it gets for a first series Colt match revolver. In this early model, the .22 LR Caliber model is fairly rare. This is a HIGHLY collectable model and would be a top billed addition to anyone’s boxed Colt collection.Now I was at the Tulsa Gun Show this past weekend and there were a few of this model of Colt, but they were 3rd and two 4th issue ones.  They were going for between 1100 and 1800 dollars.  Since mine is a 1st issue and in new condition, I will only accept offers that reflect the quality and value of this Colt, regarding a cash price.  I am interested in a possible trade, but only for a FN 5.7, Colt Python, Colt Diamondback (only the stainless models) or a Springfield 1911 EMP.  Also might be interested in something I may not be thinking about, as long as it is in the price range.  Let me know if you have any questions."

So I can meet any time as long as we plan a few days ahead. This gun is not the CA version so the side folder can be activated if you move out of the state (just pinned). It has a grip fin and muzzle brake also to make it featureless. Gun has less than 400 rounds through it and the red dot is dialed in at 100 yards. It is the most accurate AK I've ever owned."
