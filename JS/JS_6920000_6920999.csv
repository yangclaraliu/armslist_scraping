This gun is worth around $600, so I'd take cash, or trade. I'm kind of picky, but would entertain handguns in 9mm, no other caliber, no 1911, no Taurus, no Ruger, no S&W. would entertain CZ, H&K, Glock (maybe), or a Sig P320. I would also trade for an AK with wood furniture. Can add boot for the right deal. The pic shows wear on the front... that is not holster wear, it's superficial and is only there in that pic.

Today, we here at Anonymous Person On Armslist Arms are proud to offer the greatest (squirrel) battle implement ever devised by man: The Ruger 10/22 Takedown!  This fine rifle features Tactical Operator Takedown Technology(tm), ideal for concealment in your mother's purse. Or your purse. We don't judge. We believe all Americans deserve the right to defend themselves from unprovoked attacks by squirrels.   As you can tell from the attached photo, this is no ordinary 10/22. This particular rifle is finished in the revolutionary Mossy Oak camouflage, which provides the operator with a +5 to all stealth rolls versus standard woodland fauna. Additionally, when loaded with subsonic ammunition, the operator gains advantage on all initiative rolls. The operator will also hear the faint sound of a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race whenever the rifle is shouldered.   The package includes one Ruger 10-round magazine and two Butler Creek 10-round single stack magazines. All seem to feed adequately. No BX-25s, sorry. If you feel you need 25 rounds, go back to Appleseed and learn to rifleman. Those redcoats won't shoot themselves. Also included is a factory Weaver rail and a UTG picatinny rail.   You may have noticed the M1 Carbine buttstock pouch. Do not feel obligated to keep it. I'm willing to remove it in the event that you hate America and want to make a bald eagle cry.  I have not monkeyed with the internals. This is the only 100% stock Ruger 10/22 known to exist. I have performed no internal modifications. Absolutely nothing. It's all stock in there...okay, you got me, I did the auto bolt release. But the trigger is stock, and nicely broken in. Overall round count is under 1,000. It's difficult to count when you're in a life-or-death fight to keep the squirrels from overrunning the FOB.  I have installed Williams Fire Sights, but the original Ruger sights will be included. The rifle comes with the original coyote brown carrying case. RAWR. Coyote!   Willing to entertain trade offers for a SMLE or 91/30. I guess if you wanted to trade me a US Rifle Caliber .30 M1, that would also be acceptable."

In 1835, a notable gun maker and inventor patented one of the first self-contained firearms cartridges. This very early design included a case with ball, powder and primer, but what made it different from what was to come later in cartridge development was the “firing pin” that projected out of the side of the case. It was this pin that was struck and detonated the primer inside. His son, Eugene, would build on Casimir’s invention, designing a pistol to take advantage of it. The hammer would be flat and smash down on the side of the cylinder, from which the pin of the cartridge would project."

So here's what I have currently on the block:Gen 4 G26 - has seen roughly 400rds, has warren tactical night sights (u shaped, blacked out rear with tritium dot on front sight) and will come with 3 10rd mags and original box.What I may be interested in:-M&P 2.0 9mm/FNS 509/Walther PPQ M2 9mm that doesn't rattle/Sig P320 compact or carry in 9mm/CZ p10c/HK VP9-Gen 4 Glock 19 MOS- only interested in an MOS modelThat's a pretty good list I think for now, you can try me for something else, but don't be offended if you don't get a response. Some of the trades above would require extra cash from you, so I'll put a trade value of $500. If you want to buy the g26, you'll pay $440. No need to haggle there, $440 is the cash price you'll pay if you'd like to purchase it.I have gotten some interesting offers, but nothing that has made we want to pull the trigger (bad pun) just yet. Please try to stick to the above list of interests. I have gotten some pretty oddball offers...To trade for or purchase the g26 you'll need a valid NCDL and CCW or an original permit(s) for me to keep. I also will require whoever wants the rifle to show valid NCDL and a CCW or an original permit to verify you are legally able to own a firearm. ftf in the Indian Trail/Matthews area"
