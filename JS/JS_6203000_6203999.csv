The only thing that looks like a defect in the pictures is from light glare on the barrel end.
Serial number is T92XXX. I am sure the condition will not be a disappointment to anyone. I have loved having this but it just sits in the safe and it’s time for someone else to enjoy owning it. No original box or papers, there are two grips including a rubber Colt pair but I don’t know if they are the original.  Also includes a blue plastic Colt box that fits the Python perfectly.

Sorry but we cannot take pre-orders or backorders on these products.Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM®Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.M4 Feed Ramp Barrel ExtensionM4 Feed Ramp Flat Top ReceiverIn developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.T-Marked Upper ReceiverThe contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.Mil-Spec SS410 Barrel Steelthis 16"" BCM barrel is machined from SS410 stainless steel. Featuring hand lapped 1/8 twist rate button rifling and M4 feed ramps barrel extensions, the 410 stainless barrel gives the shooter the best balance of weight and accuracy. 410 stainless is also harder and more corrosion resistant than conventional 416 stainless found in other precision barrels5.56 NATO ChambersThe USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.Government Barrel ProfilesDuty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.HPT / MP Inspected BarrelsMilitary specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.Copyright © 2010-2014 Bravo Company MFG, Inc.FeaturesM4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top ReceiverT-Marked Upper Receivers1/8 Twist Rates5.56 NATO Chamber (USMC SAM-R)410 Stainless SteelHPT (High Pressure Test) BarrelsMPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) Barrels"

The Model 770 shares many of the hallmark features of the Model 700, including rugged dependability, a crisp, single-stage trigger, ultra-fast lock time, and the same ""three-rings-of-steel"" design for superior action strength. Some of the upgrades the Model 770 received are: an advanced stock with a more ergonomic shape, an ultra-smooth, easier-to-cam bolt, a durable new magazine latch, and a solid steel receiver for smooth bolt operation and long-term reliability. Three locking lugs lock the bolt directly into the barrel for unprecedented action strength."

This one is a DPMS LR-308 16” Carbine. Never fired. It has a quad rail, Magpul grip and stock, and ALG ACT trigger. Included in the deal are 4 Pmags, 3 Steel DPMS mags and a custom CNC machined foam insert for a Pelican IM3200 Storm case. Case NOT included just the foam. The foam insert is 4 lb. cross linked polyethylene machined just for this rifle on a CNC router. You couldn’t have a set of foam like this made for less than $2,000. Material and machine time alone is $250, and that doesn’t include time spent 3D modeling the parts, machine setup, or the $250 prototype that was made before we machined this one. The top foam insert is a standard Pelican IM3200 solid (not egg shell) insert. The case holds the rifle, 7 magazines, sling, Otis cleaning kit and a Sig P250/320 compact with 3 magazines. The sling, cleaning kit, pistol and pistol magazines are NOT included. The scope/mount and BUIS are optional.
About $1,400 invested in the rifle and foam without the optic or BUIS. Asking $1150.
I’ll replace the ALG ACT trigger with a Geissele SD-C or SS-A trigger (your choice of $200 plus triggers) for another $150. Total $1,300.
Also available is the Leupold Mark 4 2.5-8x36 MR/T illuminated reticle scope and the BUIS that are shown in the pictures. $2,800 total invested with the Rifle, mags, foam, SD-C, Scope and BUIS. Asking $2,250 for the package.
I’m not selling my IM3200 case because I have other setups I use it for. But if you want the gun shipped (FFL to FFL only for out of state) I can include a new one at my cost if you want. Probably around $200-$250 additional.
I’m listing two 308 rifles. This one and a Remington 700. I’m only looking to sell one of them though so when the first one sells I’ll be pulling the other listing."

This one is a Remington 700 SPS Tactical in .308 with upgrades. It’s got a Bell & Carson Tactical Medalist stock, Wyatt’s DetMag with 3 five round and 2 ten round magazines, and a Timney trigger. The scope is a SWFA SS 10x40 in Burris Extreme tactical rings on an EGW 20 MOA one piece base. Also included is a custom CNC machined foam insert for a Pelican IM3200 Storm case. Case NOT included just the foam. The foam insert is 4 lb. cross linked polyethylene machined top and bottom just for this rifle on a CNC router. You couldn’t have a set of foam like this made for less than $2,000. Material and machine time alone is $250, and that doesn’t include time spent 3D modeling the parts, machine setup, or the $250 prototype that was made before we machined this one. The insert will hold the scoped rifle, bipod, 6 boxes of ammo, sling, three five round mags and four 10 round mags. It will hold the bolt installed in the rifle or in its own slot as shown. The case, ammo, sling and bipod in the picture are NOT included.
Almost $2,200 invested. Asking $1,750.
I’m not selling my IM3200 case because I have other setups I use it for. But if you want the gun shipped (FFL to FFL only for out of state) I can include a new one at my cost if you want. Probably around $200-$250 additional.
I’m listing 2 308 rifles. This one and a DPMS LR-308. I’m only looking to sell one of them though so when the first one sells I’ll be pulling the other listing."
