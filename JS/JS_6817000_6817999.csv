When looked at side by side, they are the same weapon. Playing off of the wildly popular gas piston system made famous by the AK-47, The Bushmaster ACR is the most advanced weapon platform in the world. Companies like H&K jumped on the platform with the H&K 416, which was then copied by the American company POF. All of these wonderful platforms have asked a premium for the gas piston system, but finally there is a reasonable priced option that offers the same quality and stability that we demand. Not surprisingly MAGPUL were the ones that brought it to us, and they farmed out the manufacturing to one of the most reputable American manufacturers for production.Direct impingement allows the fowling of the explosion to push hot gasses and dirty carbon back into the operating group, creating the perfect environment for failure. Gas piston operated automatic's run cool and clean with no fowling being pushed into the bolt and carrier group. Have you ever shot a full 30 round magazine of .556/223 and then popped open the upper, pulled out the bolt and carrier group and pressed it against your cheek?!? With a direct impingement system you would burn yourself so severely just trying to remove the bolt and carrier group from the upper. With the short stroke pistons of today, you are removing the cold metal and placing it against your cheek with no fear of harm. This obviously means that the most delicate parts of your gun will run flawlessly for years to come, with less cleaning and even an unbelievable capability of firing while wet, muddy or sandy with no fear of malfunction."

This is a brand new striker-fired offering from CZ that includes two 15rd magazines and an excellent trigger! E-mail us today for purchasing information! $599.99 plus shipping.From CZ-USA:
Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

It has been shot only 40 times when I first got it back in October. After the initial cleaning before firing I was getting 2 Moa with the gun on sandbags, which is great for a bullpup. I was worried with reviews on its accuracy, but have experienced 0 problems.
