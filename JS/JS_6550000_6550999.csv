The Konjo I (tanto) blade has minor scratches caused by removing it from the leather sheath (as seen in the photos). Please ask any questions before bidding, additional photos are available. Both are precision ground out of VG-1 San Mai III steel and vacuum heat-treated and sub zero quenched for maximum strength, toughness, and edge retention. They are ground to a thin edge before being honed to razor sharpness, and they have an attractive mirror polish and come with a traditional ridge shaped Mune (spine of the blade) and double fullers.Here are some additional features: Tapered Tang: Both knives include a perforated tapered tang. This feature improves the knife's balance and reduces its overall weight without sacrificing strength. Bolster: The Konjo's are equipped with highly polished nickel silver bolsters designed to emulate the Habaki (blade collar) on a Japanese sword. Handle: The grip scales are made of highly polished black linen micarta. These have been hand fitted and permanently attached to the tang by custom ""star"" bolts. Sheath: The Konjo's come complete with a sturdy, rich looking sheath that includes a distinctive, decorative inlay of black same (ray skin).Specifications:Blade: 5""Overall: 9 1/4""Thick: 4mmVG-1 San Mai III steelWeight: 6.6oz.Unfortunately only one factory box is available (Konjo I) as shown."

This scaled-down model of everyone's favorite combo gun, the Taurus Judge, still gives you the ability to fire your choice of ammunition in a size that fits in most pockets. In addition, the lighter, polymer body frame has new updates for improved handling and accuracy. The internal transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear, an important safety feature. The exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions. An extended ejector rod allows for positive extraction of fired cases. Like all standard Judge revolvers, the Public Defender Polymer fires .45 Long Colt rounds and 2-2/"" .410 Bore shotgun shells interchangeably.    Fires .45 LC & .410 Bore Interchangeably    Lightweight Polymer Frame    Extended Ejector Rod    Ribbed Rubber Grip    Red Fiber-Optic Front Sight"

It's a great gun, but I just don't do enough shotgunning to warrant the space in my safe anymore. It is in mechanically flawless condition, with a barrel that looks like it's never been used. It locks tight and the trigger is tight and crisp, just like you'd expect from a Citori. There is one pea sized area on the receiver and an even smaller one on the rear end of the barrel where the bluing has been rubbed away, but not scratched. The wood on this beautiful English stock is also flawless. Have a look."

Gun has over 500 rounds through it and has been well cleaned after every shooting. I had troubles with it once before not correctly firing rounds which caused me to strip the weapon and clean every part really well. The issue happened to be, not with the gun itself, but with the ammo I was using. I bought new ammo and shot 100 rounds through it without a single misfire. The gun shoots as fast as you can pull the trigger, making it a fun gun to take to the range. I had the original books it came with until this past week when I lost some paperwork in a flood.

The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Check out this short video I put together re: this firearm:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85hY9BIr-Os Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAAMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAAMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

This can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw a fair amount of usage from the previous owner. The wood stock on this shotgun comes in overall good shape, though it does have a handful of small, shallow scrapes, chips, and dings. It does not have any serious scratches, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, staining, gouging, or discoloration. The receiver and barrel do show some heavier signs of usage, including some light rusting, and pitting on both the receiver, and the barrel. This shotgun does boast a 28""-long vented and ribbed barrel that ends in a bead sight. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection."

These rations are unique among the rest of the world in that they have a very special surprise inside the menu B (see table below). I've been fortunate enough to secure this extremely rare ration. They are impossible to get in the USA. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to enjoy this rare MRE. You can see a video review of this ration here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GowFRT19yokThe Italian Armed Forces (Forze Armate) use a ration called the ""Special Combat Food Ration"" (Razione Viveri Speciale da Combattimento). Each individual ration is enough food for one soldier for one day. A single ration is approximately 30 cm x 23 cm x 10.5 cm with a weight of 2.3 kg.Each meal bag contains three boxes -- one for breakfast, one for lunch, and one for supper/dinner.Italian combat rations come in seven different menus, called ""Modules"", which are labeled A through G. Each Module is also assigned a color, which is indicated on the meal bag by a sticker of that color. See the menu listing below for a list of the modules and colors. The official NATO code for these rations is 8905-15-147-6202."

Serial numbers on all parts match stock. Bayonet, Cleaning Canister, and Cleaning Rod are all there and never used. Also comes with Oil/Solvent  Can, 10 Pouch Bandolier (Holds 22 X 10rd stripper Clips = 220 rds or 18 stripper clips + 2 boxes ammo = 260 rds), 40 rd Leather Ammo Pouch (Holds 4 X 10 rd stripper clips),  22 stripper clips included,  Original Instruction Manual, Ammo not included. Email or text if you have questions or want to see higher resolution pictures. I will not ship and cash only.
This is a beautiful collectors piece. I owned a Chineese SKS and  Russion. I put thousands of rds through the Chineese SKS a lot and it was amazing, never once jammed. The Chineese made was not allowed to be sold with bayonet and they are known to use inferior metals than the Russian made SKS. That's why I kept this and never fired it. This will continjue to go up in value so it could be a great investment or you can enjoy shooting an amazing rifle while waiting for your investment to go up. Fires as fast as you can pull the trigger. If you've never heard of ""bumpfire"" google it. You'll be amazed. It basically mocks a fully automatic rifle.
Ammo is fairly cheap compared to other high-powered rifle rds. About $4.50 for 40rd box."
