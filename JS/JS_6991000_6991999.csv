This is their sister company, and yes they're both produced in the phillipines. However, the Citadel is considered the slightly nicer version of the RIA models, with their sights cut out for NOVAK and Dovetailed so that they fit regular stock 1911 sights. This gun was my EDC, so it comes with a couple extra accessories that I'll be throwing in for no extra charge. The TFO night sights are still new (about a year old), so the tritium is still good at night, and the fiber optics pull light during the day and you really grab a fast sight picture because of it. I had the entire gun cerakoted a nice matte black, because I felt that it helps make the gun easier to clean, and it blends in a lot better with the holster. I've done my research on the value and cost of the gun, and I assure you that I'm losing out on this deal. The reason I'm selling the gun is because the GF doesnt want guns in the house, go figure. The gun specs:3.5"" barrel9mmModel CIT9MMCSPWill come with (at no extra charge):1791 IWB holster - $40Four 8rd magazines (2 blued steel, 2 stainless steel) - $40TFO Night Sights - $120 (these are the ones that have tritium and fiber optics, so they're day/night sights)Pachmyr Grip - $2025rds of Hornady Critical Defense - $25Cerakoted matte black - $200So for the price of a used 1911, you're essentially getting about $150 worth of accessories excluding the cerakote pricing."

A dedicated turret enables the shooter to select the illumination setting suited to their ambient lighting conditions, allowing the Kapsa Dark Earth Tactical scope's aiming point to remain visible in twilight or daylight.This scope shows very little to no signs of wear. Unfortunately, I do not have the original box. You will not be disappointed in the quality of this scope, as it definitely gives you the most ""bang for your buck""! The illuminated reticle is extremely visible in the brightest of days, and the turrets have very postive adjustment ""clicks"", allowing for quick zeroing, or windage/elevation adjustments.  $180 Firm. NO TRADES PLEASE."

There's also a chip off the top of the stock next to the bolt handle (also pictured) Would make a nice project, basically needs refinished and a stock repair (or new stock)Bore is dark, would probably benefit from a good cleaningI have another sporterized stock available that is a little longer than this one (still not full length), but not cracked and in decent shape that I'll include for another $40. Would probably require some minor fitting. let me know if you want pics of it.Prefer to meet at Field & Stream Easton or somewhere near thereAsking $160 cash or best offer."

It's in fantastic shape, and I have only put ~250 rounds down the pipe, and it's fun to shoot and very accurate. I'm only selling it because it normally gets left behind in favor of my other 9mm pistols. I'm the only owner and the only wear is what is indicated in the pictures - normal wear marks near the end of the barrel and at the front of the barrel near the chamber. Kept in a dehumidified gun safe of most of it's life.
Let me know what questions you have, I'm willing to ship it anywhere provided you provide me with a valid FFL. Thanks guys, happy shooting!More Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/JQ9w6"

I bought the fixed stock after getting the gun, so it is a slightly darker brown than the hand guards and the metal on it is the dark gray that real vz58 guns were. The only wear that I can see on the rifle is that some finish is coming off of the trigger, but there is no rust or scratches anywhere else. All but one of the magazines came as new old stock in the plastic wrap, 4 of them still are in the wrap and 4 have been taken out and used maybe once or twice. One mag does show some finish wear on the feed lips, but is also in great shape. All mags fit in the magwell snug without much if any wobble.

Originally produced by U.S. manufacturers as the Pattern 1914 Enfield rifle in .303 caliber for the British military, after the U.S. entered WWI many of these rifles were produced instead in the U.S. .30-06 caliber and used by the U.S. Army to speed arming the rapidly growing military. This is why the internal magazine holds an odd 6 rounds instead of the usual 5 (the British .303 round is rimmed, while the .30-06 round is not, taking up less space hence 1 more round). By the end of the war most of the American Expeditionary Force carried the M1917 rifle than the M1903 Springfield. As stated, this was made by Winchester making an even MORE desirable rifle. Great finish, beautiful wood, strong rifling, Winchester barrel dated 9-18. Remington bolt. Plenty of strong cartouches and proof marks.  I will also include a Remington made M1913 bayonet dated 4-17 with British proof marks."
