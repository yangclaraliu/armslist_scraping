I shoot handgun and .223. Not looking for anything fancy, just a spot I can bring my paper/steel targets and shoot for a couple hours every other week or so. I'm hopeful to find someone willing to let me shoot on their property for about what it would cost to join a gun club ($100-200/year). I am a law enforcement officer in the Milwaukee area, responsible shooter and would clean up my range equipment, brass, etc. Just looking for a place to shoot on my own, run some advanced drills most gun clubs can't accomodate/don't allow. Shoot me an email through Armslist if you have some space to shoot on. I am looking for an area within 30-45 minutes of the Waukesha/Milwaukee county border. Thank you!"
