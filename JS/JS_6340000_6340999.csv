Stock has never been cut - has original Remington buttplate.  Bluing is very good with thin spots on the barrel from where it rested in the cabinet. Scope is in great condition with clear glass and a very sharp image.The 788 was Remington's economy model (you'll notice there is no checkering on the stock). However, it became so popular due to its accuracy that it threatened the sales of the Model 700, Remington's flagship rifle...so it was discontinued.  Over the years there has been a cult following of the 788 among shooters who value accuracy and function over beauty.The action is exceptionally strong, with 9 locking lugs on the bolt.  The compact length with a relatively short barrel makes it great for use in a blind or for younger shooters. The stock has been glass bedded and the trigger has been adjusted for a crisp break.You won't find many 788's in this condition, especially at this price. It won't last long!Contact me for more pictures. Unfortunately, Armslist only allows one."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, manual safety, hammer with safety stop  and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.Click here to view on our website$20.00 shipping to your local FFL dealer"

You are looking at a 1998 Smith & Wesson Model 64-6 no-lock .38 Special six-shot revolver. The gun is made of corrosion-resistant stainless steel built on a S&W K-frame. It is double action only (DAO) with a factory-bobbed hammer. It has a notched rear sight, ramped front sight, and 4"" heavy barrel with a bright shiny bore and cylinder chambers.This classic S&W revolver is in excellent operating and used aesthetic condition. It was a law enforcement trade-in and was hand-selected from the available inventory. It was carried but not often fired. There are some cosmetic marks such as small scuffs, scratches, and dings from carry and storage. The Uncle Mike's grips that came on the gun are functional, but show wear and tear with some nicks and scratches and some dimpling at the lower backside of the grips. I have replaced them with a pair of better condition Pachmayr Gripper grips and will give both pair of grips to the buyer.I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to its shooting accuracy. I have fired 100 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. This revolver is dependable and durable enough to carry or use as a personal protection carry, house, garage, vehicle, fishing, or camping gun at a great price. It is a very accurate and really comfortable shooter with little felt recoil due to its stainless steel frame and shock absorbing grips.  Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.I have received many inquiries, some offers, and a couple of ""I'll take it"" emails from folks who did not meet or were not able to verify the following criteria or weren't able to buy right now. This has prevented sales to legitimate would-be purchasers.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID.

They are in multicam color pattern, and are very lightly used (mounted and took to range once, then removed). No issues mounting to molle, or with product function, I just don't want the double pouches anymore... great product. Like the original Taco®, the X2R will handle any type of rifle magazines (AR-15, AR-10, AK-47, AK-74, etc), but the double decker design allows the user to carry 2 mags in a single pouch that takes up only 3” of horizontal space on your platform."

- Kimber Montana 280AI rifle with box/papers and the following smith work done by John Gallagher: full glass bed, re-crowned and feed ramp polished
- Redding deluxe dies (3 die set)
- 85 rounds of loaded ammo in 140gr Sierra game kings.  This rifle likes this round a lot and will shoot 5 round sub MOA groups
- 20 rounds of TSX and TTSX loaded test rounds.  I recently found another round the rifle likes a lot and picture is attached
- 16 rounds of once shot brass <<ALL brass including 105 rounds of loaded ammo is once fired and all is correct headstamped 280AI Nosler brass)
- Two partial jugs of this rifles preferred powders

$1300 and the only trade I may be interested in is a 6.5 Creedmoor (Rem 700 Custom preferred or Sako, Cooper, etc...).  May also trade for a Leupold Mark 4 or Night Force scope.
 
Rifle does not include sling or Swaro scope but I will include Talley rings if I can find them.  I took the scope and rings off and not sure where I put the rings but I can probably track them down."

These were released by Winchester during the late 1960's as a budget variant of the famous Model 70, which provided the same legendary action but with a less expensive birch stock and blind magazine. This rifle was well-loved by it's previous owner, as shown by the signs of use, namely the small scratches and dings on stock and barrel. Very slick action and would make an excellent deer rifle. Comes with 48 rounds of Federal 150 gr. Powr-shok.Must meet in Fayetteville and sign bill of sale.$300 cash or best offer.
