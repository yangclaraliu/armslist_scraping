The last 2 experiences have been pretty shady.  To be clear, I will not sell to a non SC resident without doing it the right way through an FFL. I will not drive 3-4 hours to meet.  I will not entertain a lesser offer or renegotiate after a deal is made.  It comes with box and mag that came with it. Cash Price $1525"

This is the nicest one I have ever seen in person. The 2017 blue book puts this at $2,900 in 100% and $2,300 in 90%. And I know blue book is low on true Colt market value. That being said I would rather under value the condition of a firearm rather than over value. I have many friends who are gun collectors. And more specifically Colt collectors. And we have all agreed it is between 90% and 95%. I would only go above 95% if it was NIB with original box and papers. Which I don't have.  The rifles exterior and interior look like it may have 0-200 rounds through it. It was manufactured in 1980 and I have the original sling and 20 round Colt mag. I assume anyone spending this kind of money knows as much or more about this amazing rifle as I do. But feel free to ask me anything else via email. Or if you want more pictures. I have checked all proof marks and it is 100% original. I am going to post this for about a week. If I don't get any good offers I'll just keep the rifle. Or I'll list it again in a few months. I will only consider CASH OFFERS. PLEASE DO NOT ASK ABOUT TRADES!! Don't waste your time with any offers that are not very close to(I'm expecting over) $2,000. I will not ship. So if you are not willing to meet face to face in Dublin or Worthington I won't be interested. Buyer must be over 18 and have a valid Ohio ID. Thank you for your interest in my rifle."

I called a shop looking for a PMR 30 and was told they have none but they do have a CMR 30 in, so there was no way I was gonna miss a chance to get one... I really want a PMR 30 though but to only one Id trade this for is the Titanium one, and it would have to be in very good condition and all that. I would consider the possibility of trading it for the ""green"" PMR 30 which is the darker green one, with atleast $100 cash but thats not what im really after. I dont want to sell my CMR 30 and have no problem keeping it, I just really want a titanium PMR 30 which is the silver and black one. If interested please lmk. 9712090137 or email me if you prefer.

This was not built in someone's garage. Do not spend $800 on someone else's project. I've taken it to the range twice and it has probably seen about 200 rounds total. Quality brass case ammo only. This is a ST-15, Carbine Length Gas system with Carbine Length handguard. This is a mil-spec rifle - it's built to a much higher standard than something like a Smith and Wesson Sport II or Ruger AR 15. If you look online, people talk about Colt and Spike's Tactical in the same breath. Some key advantages to this carbine over others:-16"" Barrel with 1 in 7 Twist (Great for 62 gr and heavier bullets)-Barrel has Chrome Lined Bore (Like the Military - extremely resisitant to corrosion and wear)-HPT/MPI testing on bolt carrier group and barrel-All parts built and assembled to high tolerances - no tool marks as this was professionally built - Everything that can be staked is staked and staked well-Spike's Tactical trigger group-Magpul rear flip up sight-Spike's Tactical Grip-Heavy Duty Phosphate coating-Spike's Tactical Adjustable Stock - high quality with no slopMSRP on this is $975 - websites have it for $875 or so plus shipping and FFL fee - check out primaryarms.com for more detailed pictures of this modelAlso includes a hard case. I'll throw in 1 PMAG to get the sale going. It must be legal for you to buy and own a rifle in the state of Tennessee. HCP preferred. Must sign bill of sale.
