The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Includes two 13 round mazazines."

Slight dings and dents, as to be expected on a gal of her age, but you won't feel guilty taking her inna woods to put a stop to those pesky critters that dig up your cabbage garden. She still shoots straight as an cis-gender white male. Will function with 22lr, 22 long, and 22 short. Magazine is a tube feed from the rear buttstock, old school charm at it's finest. Crisp single action trigger makes the gun safe, yet accurate. Mechanically functioning as designed. The gun was inherited from my grandpa when he passed, God rest his soul, and it's just too emotional for me to keep it in my collection, so I'm looking to trade for something to call my own.    I apologize for labeling it as a Winchester, there wasn't an option for Sears nor Roebuck."

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the most difficult multi-gun stages. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK® rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnifed optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

I bought the gun, replaced the frame with a new exact replacement. So long story short, the package is a glock 17 MOS, includes one original mag, one pmag, box and backstraps.  Oh wait there is more, I have a brand new never opened vortex venom optic that is going with the gun. I won the optic and I pick it up tomorrow. If interested please email me for pics, info and anything else. This is a ftf deal in the Raleigh/Cary  area. I will not be getting the optic till tomorrow afternoon so if you can't wait till maybe the weekend then please do not contact me  Valid ID, valid permit, low ball offers will be ignored. Cash only unless you have a glock 19 gen 4 stock black and cash. This is a package deal, gun and optic and I will not separate. Thanks! Also $800"

It's a fantastic shotgun and features the Kryptek Banshee camouflage pattern with soft touch finish on buttstock and forearm that is very grippy and aids a sure grip when cold and or wet.  The buttstock is adjustable with included shims.  It has removable sling swivels that are a nice feature and a choke wrench.  Additionally it comes with 4 factory Hyperbolic Inner HP choke tubes: Medium 5/10, Long 7/10, Xtreme 9/10 and an extended Inner HP Xtreme 9/10 with Banshee camo finish.  It breaks clay birds with authority.  The barrel is a Tribore HP with an extra long forcing cone, a long overbored section and finally a conical section that creates a venturi effect before entering the Hypbolic choke tube increasing velocity somewhat. I shot my Remington Versa Max side by side with this gun utilizing similar chokes and same shells, the Fabarm read 75-100 fps higher than the Remington Versa Max all shells fired, maybe this is more than just marketing propaganda.It is in excellent condition other than a small horizontal mar in the camo finish on the left side of the receiver and a few tiny mars in the same vicinity visible in one of the photographs. Someone knocked it over as it was sitting on a stand and put those few mars in the finish. On the right rear of the receiver, where the buttstock attaches there is a small black mark that was present in the finish at time of purchase, it's visible in one of the photos as well.

Comes with the factory manual and lock. The only thing missing is the original box. I bought this gun a few years ago and never shot it.
This is a 6 shot tactical version- model number 53690. These were based off the NYPD shotguns back in 2008. The A1 models are Mil-Spec and come with heavy wall barrels, parkerized finish, metal trigger guard and safety. This particular version was offered from Mossberg direct with a pistol grip, 6 position collapsible stock, synthetic foregrip, and 3 dot rifle sights. I also have a brand new set of Ameriglo night sight replacements that will be included in the sale. Ameriglo is the only company to offer the night sight replacement for the 3 dot system. There is a small blemish on the front sight but nothing concerning- it came like that from the dealer. This a high quality pump action shotgun with a great reputation and will make a great home defense gun or range gun. Only willing to sell to CT residents with a valid pistol permit or long gun permit- or to active military members. Thanks for viewing."

If I can buy the rifle new and you don't have any extras then your price is too high. It's simple, do your research before you post your gun and find out what it's worth! You may have paid 2,000, but that doesn't mean it's worth that now! Also, if someone asked for a detailed list of what you have in your gun to get that price, then give it to them. It's ok to make a mistake, be being pompous because you ""think"" your rifle is worth more used than new means you're a nut job. Sincerely,A Avid Gun Buyer and Trader"

So much so, it’d be a design marvel with a fraction of the capacity, but with 18+1 rounds at your absolute command, it equips you for the most demanding personal defense scenarios.   REMINGTON RP9 FEATURES Smooth, light and crisp single-action trigger – consistent and smooth, with short tactile reset Ergonomic polymer frame fits 95% of all shooters Ambidextrous slide lock “Fighting surface” on rear sight – for one-hand slide operation Optimized grip angle – reduces felt recoil and increases shootability Trigger guard undercut – allows higher hand hold for increased control Drift adjustable sights – easily adjusts sights to user preference Easy loading, double-stack magazines – industry’s highest magazine capacity per caliber PVD finish on slide and barrel for maximum durability   Item #: 96466 UPC: REDACTED2 Description: REM RP9 9MM 18RD 4.5B FS Brand: Remington Model: RP9 Type: Pistol: Semi-Auto Caliber: 9MM Finish: Matte Black PVD Slide Action: Double Action Only (Striker Fired Action) Stock: Black Polymer Frame Sight: Ft: Drift Adjustable Rr: Drift Adjustable Barrel Length: 4.5 Capacity: 18+1 # of Mags: 2 Safety: Striker Block Safety Receiver: Polymer with Picatinny-Style Rail Features: Ambidextrous Slide Release; No Magazine Safety   MSRP: $489.00 Dealer transaction, background check and AL sales tax as applicable  Price listed is cash, +4% card transaction  Shipping to your FFL $25"
