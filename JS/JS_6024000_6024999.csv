Rear, Beaded FrontGrips/Stock: American WalnutOverall Length: 38.5”Weight: 6 lb.The Henry Pump Action Octagon .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom’s apple pie, a restored ’57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue octagonal barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. The Henry Pump Octagon, available in calibers .22LR or .22 Magnum, is one gun that is built for fun. It also sports a grooved receiver for mounting a scope, and Marbles semi-buckhorn fully adjustable rear sights with standard 3/8? dovetail slots enabling you to change sights if you choose to do so. Beautifully finished American walnut is used for the stock. The .22LR version can hold 15 rounds of .22LR and as much as 21 rounds of .22Short. The capacity of the .22 Magnum is 12 rounds. If you must extract an unfired cartridge from the chamber, we have included a grooved release button at the right front of the trigger guard. When pressed back, the lever unlocks the forend allowing it to be retracted to eject the unfired round. Shooting the Henry Pump Action rifle may be more fun than most people deserve to have. But we won’t tell."

Manufactured in Gardner, Massachusetts, USA.  Gun features hardwood stock and forend, recoil pad, case colored receiver, and 22"" barrel with 3"" chamber, choked Full.This gun is a few years old and it is in excellent (like new) condition.  I only put one small box of shells through it.   Finish on the walnut stock and forend is in great shape.  Bluing is also in very nice condition.  Break open action functions smoothly and flawlessly.  This shotgun has seen very little use.  It has always been well cared for, cleaned, oiled, and kept in climate controlled storage when not in use.  This would be a perfect first shotgun for a beginning hunter or a great addition to any collection.  Great starter gun!
**I'm asking $110 OBO.  Price is negotiable, so if you are interested make me an offer.  All reasonable offers will be considered!**
Please contact me with any questions.  Many more pictures are available...just ask. Thanks for looking."

These craddle your gun nicely, and the center of gravity makes it lean back into its craddle.There are 2 styles, this one is for display, or hanging inside a wall, if thats your need. The other style attaches like a regular hanger. Now your AK sits in line just like a shirt or coat would. The picture shows what this AK looks like when a simple coat is hung around it. Not many robbers are going to go through your work jacket/coveralls, hunting for an AK-47. They also hang wonderfully from a door knob too. But you know where she hangs, in time of need. In the closet, behind the locked door, or if you move a wood panel, you might see her waiting in between the wall studs. $15"

This gun has served me well for small game hunting and trap shooting. It works perfectly, with one quirk: it prefers heavy loads (steel shot) to light-weight game loads. It fires both, of course, but some cheaper ammo doesn't cycle well. That said, it's a super fun shotgun in good condition that's been lovingly cared for. 30"" barrel with some scrollwork on the receiver and a glossy wood stock. I'm including the case (as seen in the picture) and a gun sock."

I purchased this pistol new from a local FFL Dealer here in Ohio roughly a week ago and have decided to get back into a 45 ACP pistol. The Glock is still in an unfired condition and has only been carried a few days over the last week. The pistol will come with all of the factory items as well as a full box of Hornady Critical Duty 9mm +P ammo, a factory Glock extended slide release, and an IWB holster from Reign Tactical. The holster is a right hand, fixed 30 degree cant, in the waist holster in Reign's Battledrab Carbon Fiber. For those unfamiliar with Reign, they produce a very high quality kydex product which requires roughly up to a 3 month wait to receive your order. New I paid $75 for the holster plus shipping and tax. Total in all of the above I have $725 including tax and shipping fees and no I will not separate the above items. I will listen to all quality DA/SA pistol trades such as SIg or H&K and I do have plenty of cash to add to the right high quality trade.

If you are interested please contact me through this ad and we can further discuss a trade or text me only at REDACTED.

I know because I did it myself. I have been doing gunsmithing/framework for about 6 years now. though 1911's and AR platforms are my original area of expertise, i have branched out to extensive glock work. About the Glock:17, less than 500 rounds down the pipe. Bought bone stock. Ameriglo night sights installed (less than a year old, very bright). every ounce of grit has been removed from the trigger through extensive trigger group polishing. feels better than any factory trigger you have ever experienced. Feed ramp, barrel, extractor, and slide lock have all been polished. once again, professional work. trigger bar, connector, and firing pin safety have also been finely polished for a very smooth action. trigger guard has an aggressive undercut, along with weak-side index and thumb reference points. weak-side reference points have been stippled with an agressive outline and a modest snake skin texture. comes with two mags, original glock case, and factory sights. light not included. will humor trades for pistols in the $400-$500 range plus cash. I buy pistols, add my touch, and sell them for a very slight profit. this work is well done, and for a fraction of the price you would normally pay. if you are interested in simply getting work done, i am available for that as well. you will not find anywhere that will beat my rates.
