I am the third owner; among the three owners it has had, it has had approximately 600-700 rounds through it. The owner prior to me told me he had put around 50 rounds through it, though he did not know how many the previous owner had put through it. Judging by the wear (or lack thereof) internally, I estimated the owner prior to him hadn't put more than 100 rounds through it, and I've only put around 500 through. I carried it for a while, so it has a little holster wear, but very little; the finish is in excellent condition.Along with the firearm and stock magazine, I have two leather holsters, two Kimber Kimtac Pro magazines, 300 rounds of Blazer Brass 230-grain ball ammunition, and one 25-round box of 185-grain Hornady Critical Defense hollow points for sale. The list price is for the gun, original box, and stock magazine only. I will sell the other items separately or in some combination with the firearm. My two holsters are a Galco Combat Master leather OWB pancake holster and a Bianchi Professional Model 100 leather IWB holster. Since both have seen some use, the Galco holster (MSRP $89.99) I will sell for $60, and the Bianchi (MSRP $59.99) I will sell for $40. The Kimber magazines are available for $30. Feel free to text me with offers, questions, or trades: REDACTED. The only trades I'm interested in are Remington 870 Tactical short-barreled shotguns or possibly AR-15 rifles or pistols. Not all that interested in other handguns, as I don't have the resources to be a collector and have the handguns I want for daily carry. I'm willing to haggle, but be reasonable with monetary offers. I live in Mt. Juliet and work in Franklin, so I can be somewhat flexible on where to meet up for a sale or trade."

This gun is amazing for Varmints and Coyotes. I'm only selling it because I have two .204 caliber rifles and would like to get a 22-250. Would be interested in a trade for the right gun. 22-250 only.  If you want a tack driver this is your gun.
