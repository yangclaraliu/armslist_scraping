It features a high-performance LED whose light output is shaped by a special multifaceted reflector into a wide, smooth 200-lumen MaxVision Beam™ perfect for maintaining situational awareness and identifying threats at close range. The XC1’s evenly distributed beam pattern—with no bright center—was optimized for human vision.The XC1’s robust, compact body is constructed of lightweight but strong aerospace aluminum that’s hard anodized with a tough Mil-Spec finish, making the XC1 rugged enough for everyday carry. And measuring less than 2.5 inches long and weighing under two ounces, the AAA-powered XC1 won’t weigh down your handgun.The XC1 also features ambidextrous switching that provides both momentary- and constant-on activation options:Momentary-on activation is achieved by placing your support hand thumb on top of either of the two rear downward-activated switches and pushing down. Or you can position your support thumb against the same switch and push forward until the switch toggles down. Simply remove pressure and the light will turn off. NOTE: To avoid unintended activation, the light will not activate when the rear switches are pushed up or side-to-side.Constant-on activation is achieved by using your support hand to push the center crossbar switch from left to right. To turn the light off, simply press the switch right to left. The crossbar switch is countersunk to prevent inadvertent activation. The XC1’s incomparable beam pattern, military-grade quality, intuitive switching, and highly concealable size put it in a class all by itself. There is nothing else like it. Accept no substitutes.FeaturesLightweight and ultra-compact; ideal for concealed-carry useHigh-performance LED generates 200 lumens of tactical-level lightMultifaceted reflector creates broad, smooth MaxVision Beam™ for close-quarter applications; beam pattern optimized for the human eyeIntegrated ambidextrous momentary- and constant-on switchingHigh-strength aerospace aluminum body is hard anodized with a Mil-Spec finish for extreme durabilityEasily and securely attaches to most Universal-rail-equipped handgunsAAA lithium battery (included); accessed from front-facing battery compartmentGasket sealed; weatherproofBacked by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee"

We have pictures of him with John Gotti well Gotti was an inmate in Marion. Rumor had it that guy he liked his cooking and requested that he be one of their personal chefs. For this apparently my grandfather received a old Colt pocket pistol from an associate of mr. Gotti's as a gift. This is handed down to me whether there's truth to the story or not I really don't know but it does make for a good story I really didn't want to sell this piece but I've went through a divorce your recently and could really use the money. I wouldn't even begin to know where to set the value of this piece however I know what I need to secure my lawyer in the fight for my kids so I'm going to start asking at 1800.

I am selling the gun because I dont have time to get to the range and havent for a while, this gun deserves to be enjoyed. Practically brand new, I do not beleive that the value has gone down what so ever from the $1200.00 that I payed for it. However, since I am trying to sell soon I am only asking $800.00. Perfect condition, this weapon has been very well taken care of. This is a steal of a deal for anyone in the market for a quality hand gun for any reason, this gun looks and feels great and is incredibly accurate, the only gun I actually enjoyed shooting more than my Browning Hi-Power. If in the years to come I get a chance to enjoy shooting again than I will certainly revisit this firearm."

Barrell is the original 28 inches and has not been modified.Like the browning A5, these guns are recoil operated (so the entire barrell moves) reducing recoil and making them fun to shoot. Since this one has some historical value I decided to see if it can find a better home since I'm not really a collector. Everything appears to be original with no pitting or restoration attempted. I have not fired it. Happy to provide more pictures. Located in Carollton, we can set up a time to meet if you want to look at it in person. Cash is king, but I will consider trades."

You might want to go to their site and see what these parts are all about. They WILL improve your Ruger .22. Includes the tool to make that takedown easier, the steel hammer bushing to dump the disconnect, two magazine extension bumpers, the insert to eliminate that loaded chamber indicator and the jams it causes, and two ""Eagle's Talon"" steel extractor claws.  All are easy to install.  I paid seven cents short of $80 for the parts.  First $50 takes them all home to breathe new life into a Mk III or 22/45.  You can respond to the ad directly or call or text during reasonable hours to 864-363-49 fifty."
