Wt: 7 lbs 8 oz
Barrel length: 22 in, stamped 375 WLN, maybe rechambered?
Serial #619XXX
This is a very nice custom rifle in an ultra rare caliber.
Springfield action, Bishop? Fejen stock?. Has a Beuhler safety installed.
Custom engraved bolt handle with a very nice sweep to it.
Does not have magazine follower adaption to close after last round
Drilled and tapped for a one piece mount. No open sights.
I have the Beuhler mount and rings and an old Bushnell Banner Scope that is a throw in!
Packmeyer custom fit recoil pad.
Light pitting on the floorplate – could be original?
I have not disassembled the rifle but must have a custom trigger, as there is no slop and it breaks cleanly at 2 lbs on the nose.
Incredibly light for this caliber, but may have some adjustment available.
Because of the rarity of the caliber, the following comes with it.
RCBS F.L. Dies set – These are from the custom shop and reteil at $150- $200 a set new.
2 Boxes of 20 ea, 375 Hawk commercial brass – IF you could find these, the go for $60 to $80 a box.
16 loaded rounds with very nice lead bullets, the tag inside says they were loaded with 52 gr 4320
27 loaded rounds in a bag, no information but they appear to have the same lead bullets
4 Taped up boxes of bullets, we can open and look but came with rifle, believe from writing on boxes to be about 150 Lead cast bullets 350 gr, I assume this is what is loaded in cartridges
Email me for more pictures, this is one cool old gun!!!

This Arisaka has been assessed by 2 different WW11 collectors.  The first collector said nice piece and in great condition, he gave an assessment price of $2700.00 and the last collector said phenomenal condition and his assessment price was $2750.00. They both told me what they thought it was worth, $50 difference between them on their value of it. I think they were only around 21000 of the takedowns made. Very collectible and one of the ""Holy Grail"" of the WW11 Jap (nip) trophies. Great GI bring back! No import marks! Standard issue to World War II Jap (nip) jumpers - has a turn-bolt mid-section that twists and allows the gun to take down to half its length for insertion into a jump kit. Very desirable! This specimen is very nice with 94% finish, excellent bore and just a few war hits on the wood. Bolt matches to receiver serial number. ""860"" is on the barrel and that matches with the takedown piece closest to the breach and the outer takedown piece is serial the same as the receiver.cleaning rod. Good tight action. Dust cover is serialized ""037"". Bayonet Lug. Mum is ground - usually the case. Ladder type flip-up rear military sights with aircraft sighting ""wings"". Sling Swivels. The bayonet and steel scabbard was also captured - very good condition - mfg. Kokura Arsenal and so marked. A dandy! I do have more pictures. I've owned 2 of these and handle a few more.

Enfield action
This was actually a common build back in the day. I have an almost identical rifle in 300 H&H that I am keeping.
Wt: 9 lbs 13 oz with period correct Weaver K-3 60B, very cool scope with post and horizontal crosshair
Don't think you would want this caliber in a light rifle!
Barrel length: 24 in, Stamped 375 beside proof marks, no identification of manufacturer
Has CHL stamped on side of receiver, gunsmith maybe?
Top of barrel has stamping, can read Lunken … remainder goes under scope mount
Buehler one piece mount
Magazine follower has been adapted so it will not hold open when empty
Side safety
Trigger has very little creep and breaks cleanly at a very heavy 4 ½ pounds. Probably about right for a heavy caliber such as this.
Very nice Marbles rear sight and front ramp sight
Incredibly old White Line recoil pad that is hard as a rock!
I have fired this rifle and is surprisingly accurate.
Not included with price but available:
Box of Remington Express Rifle 270 Grain SP, 16 Loaded, 4 once fired
Bag of 100 once fired Winchester Brass
Box of 50 Hornady .375 Spire Point 270 Gr
Box of 50 Nosler .375 Fail Safe 270 gr Supreme Hunting Bullets (yeah I know, maybe Elephant or Rhino)
Will sell all for $150 extra with rifle

Disclaimer:
ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!
I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!
I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""
Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!
I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales
Prefer local face to face buyer, have office in central Billings location to meet at.
I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.
Cash only – no checks, charges, credit cards, payments, cashier’s checks, or promises of riches from a Nigerian prince, nor will I ""hold-it"" so you can run home and get ""permission"". If you don’t have ""permission"" and cash, don’t waste my time.

This belt wears like a dream, and one of the most comfortable battle belts I've ever worked in.If interested, please feel free to text me at: REDACTEDThe High Speed Gear SureGrip Padded Military Belt is designed to provide the comfortable, no-slip stability necessary for reducing back strain and general discomfort so frequently caused by loose-fitting, drooping and weighted-down belts. Featuring a brand-new modular system, the SureGrip has a slim profile that is just 0.75 inches thick and only 4.5 inches tall. The SureGrip's updated design features Neoprene as the belt's padding. This material gives the belt a cushiony gel-like feel for greater comfort and exceptional gripping power. It also features a removable HDPE stiffener sheet throughout the entire main portion where the three continuous rows of PALS/MOLLE are located. This feature is for those times when added stability is required. With this proprietary ability to remove the stiffener sheet, the SureGrip is one of the most flexible military belts of its kind, making it the ultimate support system whether at the range or in the field. With three conveniently-positioned access ports, the SureGrip allows you to seamlessly attach subloads to the belt's interior, while the belt's four suspender attachments allow for easy expansion. NOTE: An inner Rigger or Duty belt is required for use with the outer SureGrip belt. Proudly made in the USA and covered by a manufacturer's Lifetime Warranty.

The cartridge for this caliber was simultanousely designed together with this pistol. Even if it was named sometimes as ""Baby-Browning"" in the early years, this was the official designation for model following later, and this type was officially named as Model 1906. As counterpart Colt produced the similar Model 1908 .25 for the American market at that time. This pistol had been frequently copied by a lot of European manufacturers more or less in detail, and the cartridge 6.35mm Browning (.25ACP) got the standard-caliber for vestpocket-pistols in Europe. Not only civil people liked the Model 1906, but also officers did like to carry it as backup gun. Still it was not officially adopted in any army. Up to the start of World War I in 1914 503.434 pcs. were produced, where numbering started with No.1. After the war the production continued until shortly before the start of World War II. Up to then more than a million pcs. have been made, until it was replaced by the real ""Browning Baby"" Model. Within the production period there came up several modifications, where the 3 main modifications were done in the number of safeties. Modell with 3 safeties: Shortly after the introduction of the manual safety lever the pistol got equipped with an additional magazine-safety. This blocked the movement of the palm-safety lever, when no magazine was inside the pistol. In this variation the pistol was produced for the rest of the production time. This third, late variation can be recognized from outside by the slightly bigger safety lever as well as by the broader front of the trigger in relation to the second variation. It was produced from about no. 180.000 to about 1.200.000, until the production was stopped in the 1930ies. Technical Data: SYSTEM: self-cocking pistol with mass system and firing pin CARTRIDGES : 6 CALIBRE : .25 ACP BARREL LENGTH : 53.4 mm , 6 grooves right hand twisting WEIGHT EMPTY : 380 g TOTAL LENGTH : 114 mm TOTAL HEIGHT : 78.5 mm TOTAL WIDTH : 24 mm TRIGGER : single action SIGHT : fix groove SAFETY : safety-lever, grip- and magazine-safety FINISH : blued GRIPS : hard rubber"

Superformance ammunition is loaded with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings up to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. From sub-zero arctic temperatures to almost unbearable desert heat, Superformance ammunition can withstand any hunting habitat.
 
Hard-hitting and deep-penetrating, the GMX bullet combines monolithic construction with pioneering ballistic design to meet the need for a premium, non-traditional bullet. The mono-metal design of the GMX bullet is crafted from a copper alloy. Harder than solid copper, the copper/zinc alloy has been proven to shoot cleaner, foul less, and deliver consistent, even pressure curves. The tough alloy material routinely retains 95% or more of its original weight and expands up to 1.5 times its original diameter. Featuring a long, sleek profile with cannelures, the design reduces the bullet’s overall bearing surface and drag, while achieving some of the highest ballistic coefficients from monolithic, non-traditional bullets. Initiating expansion upon impact, the hard polymer tip drives into the hollow cavity at the front of the bullet, creating a mushroom-style projectile as it travels through the animal. Fully California compatible and appropriate for use in other areas requiring the use of non-traditional bullets, GMX is ideal for any sized game, from antelope to moose. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

18 pounds 9 oz!!
Not a misprint 18 ½ pounds!!!!
Mauser Action mated to a massive 28"" barrel, 1 1/8 diameter at muzzle
Looks to be most of a maple tree for a stock. Kind of neat figure in the stock but obviously was designed and built for accuracy not looks.
Thumbhole cut if you want to put thumb through stock and also inleted to place thumb alongside stock on right side
This seems odd but many precision shooters prefer this as it gives more feel to the trigger as you are not actually ""gripping"" the stock
The trigger breaks cleanly at 1 lb and has a screw &bolt to adjust overtravel
Cock on opening conversion
Magazine follower adaption to allow closing of bolt when empty
One piece mount, rings and an okay 6-24 Varmint scope
Surprisingly there are no provisions for mounting a sling, so if you intend to hike after gophers you are on your own!!

ALL EMAILS ASKING IF ITEM IS STILL AVAILABLE WILL BE IGNORED!!! I am meticulous about taking items off the website when they are sold. SO, if it is on here, it is either for sale or it is on its way out the door!
I do not have to sell these guns and accessories! This is not a fire sale. I just have too many guns and equipment sitting unused in gun safes and I want to downsize. No low ball offers will be accepted, nor even replied to!
I get my prices by shopping local stores and websites. So, I have priced my items fairly and you will get a good deal. You will NOT get a great deal! Refer to ""not a fire sale!""
Do not bother to email me and tell me you can buy it cheaper elsewhere, save us both some time and just go buy it then. I don’t care that your brother, uncle, cousin, girlfriend’s – sister’s- cousin twice removed bought the same thing last year at half the price. If that is so, they got a great deal – you will not!
I do not have an FFL, so all transactions are private party sales

I will ship, buyer pays ALL costs. All applicable laws will be followed to the letter.

It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included).

I installed new Magpul fruniture and did a custom stipple job on due to it being so slick. I love this shotgun but to be honest I don't have a need for a long gun. I am primarily looking for handguns in any caliber. Would really like a stainless .357 revolver but would entertain any trades. Also open to multiple trades. If you don't want to trade I would like what I have into it which is $500 I can sent more pics if you want. Feel free to email me as I check it often
