A shot in the dark. Covert pistols have Tactical Wedge night sights and Crimson Trace Lasergrips. If you can see, you can aim. Lightweight aluminum frames make them easy to carry, and Kimber quality ensures absolute dependability–even when the lights go out.
 
Built in the Kimber Custom Shop, Covert pistols are a perfect blend of light weight and tactical features. Front strap checkering in a new 30-lines-per-inch pattern with bordered base ensures a positive grip, and the Carry melt treatment rounds and blends edges so they will not hang up on clothing or holsters. Standard Kimber features like match grade barrel, chamber and trigger, beveled magazine well and bumped and grooved grip safety boost accuracy and speed. Three sizes are offered, covering everything from duty to personal protection and even backup. Carry a Kimber Covert, and don’t be afraid of the dark.

This is a Heckler and Koch UMP 45. This pistol was fused together from UMP parts. I purchased this pistol years ago from a local person at a gun show, I have not seen another one sense.*** It is considered a home-made pistol by the ATF standards and has a serial number but only needs to be registered if you turn it into an SBR. I never submitted a form 1 for an SBR and only shot it without the stock. The gun is completely 100% German HK, this is a pistol so it does not need to be 922r compliant in the current form. ***This sale will include the UMP pistol chambered in .45 acp. I have seven magazines that go with the .45. I also have the parts to convert this pistol to .40 S&W, includes bolt group, barrel and one magazine. I also have the original HK multi-tool and a mix of extra parts like extractor, ejector, recoil springs, barrel pin, rear sight...etc. It is all sitting in a hard Pelican case.Obviously this pistol is semi-automatic only. Also this is for a local GA sale only. Yes this is a cool pistol, but please SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY.*** I am not a legal counselor and this information is from my independent research."

This is a heavy duty, built from the ground up sniper rifle (it is literally in the name). I picked this rifle up to get into long range shooting. It is fully configured to make it as easy as possible to be as accurate as possible. When you miss it won't be because of the gun. The stock is adjustable for both length of pull and to make sure your check weld is exactly in the right place. The grip has an adjustable plate to insure consistent hand position and trigger pull no matter what angle of shot you are making. The fluted, free floated barrel is guaranteed to 1 MOA and I was consistently getting less then 0.75"" with handloads, sometimes much lower. Even with surplus 308 1 MOA was quite easy. It also comes with a harris bipod locked onto the huge quad rail. This thing is heavy, which makes it very pleasant to shoot for prolonged amounts of time as the recoil in minimal. I don't have an exact round count, but less then 400 rounds of brass surplus and handloads. Selling to recoup some of my expenses from my current set up. Comes with 1 DPMS aluminum 19-rd mag, plus 2 magpul 20-rd Gen 3 mags.Selling for $1600**Scope and mounts not included at this price**"

Comes with 50 rounds of hollow points. The picture with the guy holding it isn't of my gun. I put it up to show the size of this beast. The picture of the revolver with the box of shells is my gun.  I am a CCW holder.  Prefer to sell to other CCW holders.

That had bugged me in the past as it could affect zero. Has detachable handle 6/3 mark, as well as 400, 500 meters settings. Only selling this as it's an extra.  Taking a loss on it so that is your gain!$50 FTF San Marcos, CA Civic Center area.$54 shipped, PP discreet (Family & friends).$56 shipped PP goods and services (to PP confirmed address only).UTG PRO version, you won't be disappointed!
