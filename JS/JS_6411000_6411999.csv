THIS IS A NO RESERVE PENNY AUCTION! ABOUT NEW CONDITION WINCHESTER MODEL 94 CANADIAN CENTENNIAL 1867 - 1967 COMMEMORATIVE LEVER ACTION RIFLE. CALIBER .30-30 WINCHESTER WITH 26 INCH OCTAGON BARREL. SERIAL NUMBER 46431. C&R OK! This commemorative was manufactured by Winchester in 1967 to honor Canada’s 100th anniversary as a separate country from Great Britain. It is a beautiful piece with a 26 inch octagon barrel. It features engraved maple leaves on both side of the receiver. The metal finish on the barrel, magazine tube, receiver and lever looks nearly perfect to me with just one tiny scratch on the top of the barrel and a couple of miniscule nicks on the edge of one octagon. The blue is particularly dark and glossy. I’d call it 99.5%. The stock and forend are in 98% condition with just a little bit of finish wear on the bottom of the stock. The bore is mint and I am quite sure that the rifle was fired very little. I particularly like this commemorative because it is not all gussied up with gold plated parts and has no medallion in the stock. It just has “Canadian Centennial ‘67” on the top tang and “Canadian Centennial 1867 – 1976” both in gold filled letters on the side of the barrel. Cool looking old-time metal crescent buttplate with 100% blue. A really nice commemorative Winchester rifle that is sure to go up in value as time goes by!"

The bore is just like new, the bolt and magazine tube look like they have been used very little. The bluing on this gun is close to 95%, the only parts that have some signs of wear are the muzzle and the trigger guard. I am not an expert on this subject, but I have disassembled the gun and cannot find any indication that it has been reblued, as I would assume they would include the trigger guard and the muzzle. The butt plate quite frankly looks almost new and is I'm sure original. This firearm of course will have to go through an FFL to transfer."

SxS 12 Gauge double barreled shotgun. This is a great double barrel shotgun to use for home defense, or as a back-up/truck gun. I have also used it for shooting clays and it is surprisingly accurate. The barrels are 18-1/2"" long so if you wanted to you could get an aftermarket stock and cut it down to a pistol grip ""mares leg"" or ""bird head"" grip and still be legal. I wouldn't suggest doing that to the existing stock because it is in great condition as is. This was made somewhere in or before the 1950's because it has no serial number on it. This model was produced as a coach gun and it was not cut down at any point after manufacture. The gun shoots great and has very clean bores, the metal has developed a very nice patina as well. This is actually one of my favorite guns but I am currently trying to fund another project so if I can't sell it for close to the price listed I will keep it and wait to save the money.

I have the tool pouch somewhere, but I cannot locate it at the moment and cannot promise that it will come with the adjustment tools. I also have 300+ rounds of 1970's production 7.62.54r ammunition. 280 of the rounds are still in sealed 20-round cardboard boxes, with another 30-50 rounds in opened boxes. $275 for the gun, $60 for the ammo, or $300 for both. Please note, this is on my C&R log book, so I will need the buyer's name, address, and driver's license number for my ""disposessed"" log."

Includes two factory 8 rd magazines and a soft case. Wrap around Hogue rubber grips provide a great feel. $649 Reduced Price The Smith & Wesson Model 4506 is a third-generation semi-automatic pistol from Smith & Wesson’s 4500 series of handguns. The 4506 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge and, with the purchase of special springs, the stronger .45 Super. It is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions. The 4506 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol. The first shot is fired in double-action mode. Each subsequent shot is fired single-action mode. It features one-piece Xenoy wrap-around grips with either a curved or straight back strap. The 4506 was produced from 1988 to 1999. Like most 3rd generation Smith & Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and decocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor. Smith & Wesson Model 4506-1: Later, modified version of the 4506. Change to the slide manufacturing process. Trigger guard changed from square to round. Much later, the hammer and trigger were changed to being blued instead of receiving a flash chrome finish, and the S&W roll marks were dropped in favor of laser etching.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part.  PIC-MOD Technology:  The Mod.2 handguard has been equipped with the new PIC-MOD Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyModTM attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PIC-MOD feature is present. This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyModTM mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.  Adjustable Gas Block:  Position 1: Position 1 is recommended for all types of ammunition and conditions when not using a suppressor. Position 2: Position 2 is for use with low powered ammunition when using a suppressor. Position 3: Position 3 is recommended for normal suppressor use with normal and high powered ammunition.  Superior Fit:  Everything about the Mod.2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.  Enhanced Trigger:  The Mod.2 comes with an enhanced trigger, set from the factory at a crisp 5.5 pounds. Each Trigger is custom adjusted at the factory, to ensure perfect performance, every time you squeeze.  The New Buffer Tube:  The new PWS EBT is impact extruded from 7075 to enhance strength and rigidity, and anodized in mil spec type 3 to exceed standard in hardness and corrosion protection. PWS added a new Ratchet-Lock Design to eliminate the need to stake the castle nut, and gives a rock solid lock up while being able to be removed easily if need in the future.  Ambidextrous:  PWS added ambidextrous controls for the safety selector, bolt release, and mag release to enhance the ease of use.  Furniture & Magazine:  Every Mod.2 rifle comes complete with a Bravo Company Grip and stock, as well as a lancer magazine.

The features in the Renegade go far beyond the low entry barrier that many manufacturers obtain but don’t care to surpass. This barrier of entry is known as MILSPEC. As you'll see, it is anything but basic. In fact, the only parts that can be considered basic are the forged lower receiver and flat-top upper receiver. The heat sink barrel nut dissipates heat quicker than any system on the market. Our patented E2 technology brings a new definition to extraction reliability. The Dictator 9-position adjustable gas block, with straight gas tube, let’s you tune this rifle to be as smooth and flat shooting as possible, no matter the ammo load out. At this price, and even well beyond it, you simply will not find features like this on any other rifle. The 15"" Renegade rail with M-LOK compatibility and 4 integrated QD slots provides maximum comfort, hand placement, and accessory mounting options. Topped off with a 16.5"" nitride heat treated barrel, you have a 1 MOA guaranteed rifle suited for any patriot.

The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  These barrels, some of the most accurate and durable barrels available, are bead blasted and chemically passivated to resist corrosion.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ allowing for your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.   The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  This precision rifle comes finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™ and is furnished with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip. Features  CHF: Cold Hammer Forging is a barel making process that produces the strongest, longest lasting, and most accurate barrels. Daniel Defense takes this process one step further by simultaneously forging the chamber and bore, resulting in perfect alignment and barrels that are smoother and free of defects. Flash Suppressor: Daniel Defense's Flash Suppressor is designed to virtually eliminate muzzle flash, featuring compact size and lifetime durability. Manufactured from aerospace 17-4 stainless steel and salt bath nitride finished. Available in standard or extended length and 1/2""x28 TPI or 5/8""x24 TPI. Freefloat Rail: A freefloat rail mounts to the rifle via the barrel nut, eliminating any contact with the barrel. This ensures the harmonics of the barrel are not influenced by the weight of mounted accessories or the pressure from slings or shooting positions. This provides the M4/AR15 platform huge improvements in terms of repeatable accuracy and reduction in ""wandering: point of impact. Flared Magwell: Daniel Defense widened and beveled magwell funnels magazines into palce for the fastest, most secure reloads possible. Buttstock: DD's custom designed buttstock is precision-molded from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. It features soft-touch rubber overmolding for comfort, and ambidextrous limited-rotation QD attachment points. It comes complete with two buttpads to customzie fit any shooter. QD Points: Integrated Quick Disconnect Points for the attachement of slings. MPI BCG: Magnetic Particle Inspection is a process that uses electrical current and magnetic particles to detect invisible defects within the surface of metals. Each and every bolt and carrier they manufacture undergoes this Military-required test, ensuring only the best, defect-free, components find their way into Daniel Defense rifles. Pistol Grip: Daniel Defense grip is made from a proprietary blend of glass-infused polymers for unsurpassed strength and durability. Comfort is assured by the soft-touch  rubber overmolding combined with a more natural angle. The integrated flared trigger guard covers the gab between grip and lower receiver and easily accommodates a gloved hand. Cut and Polished Feedramps: Daniel Defense M4-profile feed ramps are recisely cut and polished for smooth, snag-free feeding of cartridges, ensuring reliability in both semi-automatic and fully-automatic fire.    Materials and Construction  Lower Receiver: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.
