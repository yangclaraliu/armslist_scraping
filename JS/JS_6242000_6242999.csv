This is the official state course for obtaining your MO CCW permit but I encourage anyone who owns a firearm for self-defense to take this course to learn some defensive pistol fundamentals and the laws regarding deadly force and weapons charges. Classes are from 9-5:30 from an NRA Instructor/Mo CCW STATE approved instructor. If you are looking for a 2 hour ""class"" from a fly-by-night instructor this is not for you.

At the start of WWII there was a shortage of fighting knives so the US government did everything they could to fill the void. They purchased massive stocks of hunting knives from civilian markets and they also convert old stock to make fighting knives. That was the case with this knife. It was originally a M1913 Patton sabre, made in 1914 by Springfield Armory. They took these swords and gave them to contractors to make into fighting knives. Many times they would cut the sword into three pieces and make three separate knives. This particular knife was made using the lower marked section of the blade and grip assembly. The guard was removed just leaving the original grip assembly."""""""

They were designed by Harry Sanford, the same guy that invented the original .44 Auto Mag. They were said to be the most lightweight of all the semi auto pistols that fire the .50AE (stronger than the .44 Magnum). They weigh in at 2.88 lbs. as opposed to the Desert Eagle's 4.4 lbs.

Comes with case and all the paperwork. I will also throw in some HP/FMJ ammo as well. I am starting a project and need the money but please do be aware that I do NOT need to sell it, so therefore I will not consider lowball offers. Must have valid TN id and sign a bill of sale.

I've had this rifle for a year and it has a lot of cool and useful upgrades. First is the stock: This has a Krebs Custom adapter plate and a DPH Arms billet aluminum skeleton stock w/an ace buttpad. This is a MASSIVE upgrade over the standard wood stock, very comfortable and the straight profile helps to keep the muzzle down.Second is the Midwest Industries quad rail. It has the Aimpoint top cover and a Primary Arms Advanced Micro Dot on top. This is a very high quality handguard and a great red dot. This red dot will stay on for 50,000 hours straight! Amazing battery life! On the bottom of the quad rail is a Magpul handstop kit.There's also a Surefire G2X Tactical flashlight and Magpul offset mount up front, which makes this rifle great for night shooting or home protection.Last but not least, there's a Magpul MS3 sling in FDE, a wolf grey Magpul grip and a standard slant muzzle brake.This gun will comes with two like-new 30 round Magpul magazines. I have easily over 1000 dollars into this rifle. People will pay over 1500 dollars to get a custom AK that still doesn't come with an optic or flashlight like this one. Plus, this is a quality Combloc cold hammer forged barrel. Eastern European goodness!This rifle has around 900 rounds through it and has a long life ahead of it. The only reason I'm selling it is to find other projects! Shoot me an email to set up a time to meet. We will do the transfer at SafeFire Shooting Range in East Vancouver.If you don't want the Primary Arms Red Dot, I will take it off and reduce the price by 100 dollars."

Springfield Operator in 9mm with all original equipment and a lot of extras. Professionaly Cerakoted, Ambi thumb safety, custom G10 grips and originals, Bladetech convertible IWB/OWB holster and dual mag carrier. This is a fantastic IDPA or carry rig. 
 
Rock Island Armory 1911A1 ms tac ultra in 9mm. Has Wilson Combat Flat Trigger, Dawson Precision Tritium Novak rear sight with Dawson tritium front sight. FDE Hogue laser grips, Fusion Firearms mainspring housing/Magwell. Excellent practice and home defense firearm. Comes with original trigger and G10 grips as well.
 
The Springfield needs nothing and is ridiculously accurate. The Rock Island has a slightly heavier trigger pull and would probably need a good cerakote job. I was planning to do just that but for what I use the gun for it's really not necessary.
 
The tlr-1s are NOT included, they are just for reference. I do have some blade tech mag holders as well.
 
Looking to switch platforms. I may split the package for the right deal. Do your homework on these before making an offer.Springfield with the holster and 10 mags = $1100 cash, $1300 TradeRock Island with laser grips and 4 mags = $750 Cash, $950 Trade**Just to be clear the difference in cash vs trade value reflects me taking a hit for a cash sale. Trade value is more in line with actual value.(I do not consider taxes or BNIB cost of items when pricing these weapons so I believe my asking price to be more than fair, just price the upgrades and extra mags for yourself and you'll see)
 
NO ammo included (that will be shot: by me.)
 
I will consider any trade offers or trades plus cash.

It has been treated with Frog Lube since day one and all the internals look brand new. I purchased the rifle new back in April 2015 and has pretty much been a safe queen since I've owned it, only a handful of trips to the range. The only very minor cosmetic imperfections are a couple very small marks around one of the rear sling loops where I tested out a sling, and a couple areas on the top rail where I had my Elcan Specterdr mounted - other than that, it's perfect. Comes with the following: -7 Genuine SCAR 17 mags (5 FDE, 2 black) 3 of them are brand new in packaging. -Shooting Sight adjustable 2 stage trigger - Amazing trigger, just as good as the Geissele if not better. -Gripod GPS 2 FDE VFG/Bipod (genuine) -Striker Enterprises E.A.C.H charging handle -FDE Ergo Grip -Tactical Link Convertible 1-2 point QD bungee sling -Blue Force Gear Tactical Sling Mount Comes with original box, manual, stock trigger, and stock grip. This is an amazing firearm and I hate to sell it, but I'm purchasing a .308 conversion kit for my HK23e Machine Gun and need the funds. Shipping. No trades."
