The first true subpact in Sig Sauer's classic all-metal firearms line, the P224 is ideal for concealed or off-duty carry featuring all of the features that you would expect from Sig Sauer.
 
Based on the 229, the P224 takes advantage of the hammer-fire reliability and lightweight all-metal frame and puts them in a subcompact package with all of Sig Sauer's familiar controls and functions.
 
In spite of its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a higher capacity of 9mm than those in firearms of its size, at 12+1 rounds of 9mm the P224 has a distinct advantage over most of its subcompact competitors. With that advantage, the new model P229 magazines can also be used to give the P224 an even greater round count.
 
The P224 is an excellent choice for those who are familiar with the P229 manual of arms, with all the controls and operation of the P226 and P229 being the same in the P224.
 
The SIG Anti-Snag (P224 SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, with the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip. The P224 SAS comes standard with SIGLITE Night Sights in the Nitron coated slide model.

Stainless frame and slide. This model was only made for a couple years and on the short list for becoming an investment Colt.  All original, all that came with it new. This was Colt's answer to the fancy Kimbers, Sigs and other high end 1911's that were hittng the market in the early 1990s with factory enhanced upgraded internal parts. Colt decided to jump into that market and introduced the ""Enhanced"" series 80 1911. This was the predecessor to the later Gold Cup series, and other upgraded 1911 series when they started marketing them with fancy names. It has the ""E"" marked serial # which indicates that this was their ""Enhanced"" model. I don't Believe I want to sell this 1911, but will entertain interesting trades. I am not sure for what yet, but will know when I see it. I do tend to lean towards vintage Milsurp, Henrys, pre 64 Winchesters. Maybe other high end 1911s. This has been a safe queen due to its investment possibilities.  Trade value will be north of $1000. You will need to provide a CPL/PP with driver's license before I surrender this firearm.

The MRF-CX is designed to install on a standard factory M4 barrel, the mounting system reinforces the factory barrel nut and the anti-rotational tabs keep everything tight. The top rail aligns with the upper receiver to form a continuous, uninterrupted rail with a cut-out for the front sight post. The MRF-CX rail will give you more room to mount foregrips, lights and accessories than the standard drop-in carbine rails and does not require specialized tools to disassemble the upper or upgraded gas blocks to gain the extra rail space. There are 4 attachment points for push button quick detach sling swivels, on both the left and right side. This rail is extremely light weight and only adds an additional 9 ounces over the standard two piece M4 handguard. Installation of this rail requires the removal of the delta ring, weld spring and snap ring; this can be done with a rotary tool or by completely disassembling the upper receiver.Designed to operate with the carbine-length gas system, as found on the M4 style rifle.Price is firm; not looking for trades.

Purchased new in 1961 and it was stored for a long time. In my opinion, it is unfired as the bore is bright enough to comb your hair in and the bluing inside the receiver does not have wear marks.  The action is good and tight. The wood is almost new with minor handling marks. There is a minor storage issue on part of the bluing. It is 12 gauge, 28 inch barrel, modified choke and it is the field grade model. It is also a takedown model. Unfired is my opinion but ????I would like a slug gun and I know I can cut down the barrel but I do not have the heart to modify a classic.If you are interested in a trade, send me your name and telephone number and I will call you. No name and phone number, no contact as you are most likely not truly interested."

This is the newest ""crossover target"" model from Browning. It does not have ported barrels. It shoots about 60/40 POI. I've run roughly 3000 rounds through it and it is been 100% reliable and a great shooter. I've decided to get a more trap oriented O/U, I recently purchased an unsingle combo.The gun is not a safe queen, it's been used but I would say the overall condition of this gun is 90-95%. The wood has some small wear marks, and the bluing on the forearm latch is wearing off. This does not impede operation, just a visual imperfection. Other than that theres not much to say about it, it's a great gun, shoots well and has been 100% reliable.The gun comes with-Choke Tube Wrench-Browning Midas Grade Choke Tubes that came with the gun in IC, Mod, and Full- Additinal Midas Grade Choke Tubes I purchased, which are 2x Skeet, IC, Light Mod- 1 Briley Extended Choke Tube in Improved ModifiedLooking for $900 shipped/insured from me to your FFL.$1050 if I need to ship through my FFL to yours."

You can use a TASER at close range or up to fifteen feet away from your opponent.  Air TASER guns work like modern-day slingshots. Compressed air cartridges are activated when you fire the weapon, shooting two probes on thin electrical wires into your opponent's skin or clothing. The probes deliver a stunning charge—enough electricity to cause a human being to lose control of his muscles as information from the brain is scrambled before reaching the muscles. The attacker cannot react effectively or even stand: the muscles convulse, and the probes continue to deliver bursts of energy which keep the attacker where he belongs—writhing on the ground.  Because the TASER's wires are 15 feet long, you can fire long before the attacker reaches you. Aiming a TASER is much easier than aiming a gun, and because there are two probes, you have double the chance of hitting your target.     Best of all, many states do not require a weapons permit for the TASER, and some models fit easily into your handbag or pocket   Willing to ship if you pay for shipping costs  Message me with any questions or to see in person  Located in Spearfish but I get to Rapid weekly"

Oh and just in case you voted for Hillary, please do not contact me. I wouldn't sell you this rifle if your life depended on it."

The Geissele Automatics Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced trigger is a precision tuned, semi-automatic only trigger designed after the Geissele 2-stage combat trigger presently being used by US Special Operations Community. The SSA-E has an enhanced trigger pull improving accuracy with your firearm while still retaining the rugged durability of the combat-tested triggers. The trigger components are constructed of tool steel durability and the engagement surfaces are wire EDM cut for smooth operation. The hammer and trigger pins are constructed of 4140 chrome moly tool steel and are hardened for durability. The hardened pins will not embed debris that will lead to damage of the lower like softer, aftermarket pins. The SSA-E is smooth and light with a first stage of 2.3 pounds; the second stage is 1.2 pounds and breaks crisp and clean. The enhanced trigger is perfect for a Squad Designated Marksman or an SPR type rifle where a match type trigger is desirable without the variability of internal adjustments. The hammer is lighter than a standard AR-15 and combined with the full power spring reduces the lock-time from 8.5 milliseconds to 5.1 milliseconds. The full power spring ensures reliability with hard military primers in some ammunition. The trigger includes installations instructions, a slave pin for installation, and lubricant for the trigger.This is for the small pin receiver, with a diameter of .154"". Price is firm.

Has a Falcon Menace 4-14x44 bullet drop/Mill reticle scope, side parallax adjust with incredible clarity @ 4 to 14 power. Scope made in the UK and comes mounted with Burris rings. Two 20 round DPMS magazines included. Will include metal-break down case with sale. Free float tube has a few rubs from storage & barrel has a scratch from when I fumble fingered and dropped a mag on it, only cosmetic, internals are great & true.When I first purchased the rifle new the trigger was about 10lbs, I sent off the trigger to Bill Springfield and it now breaks cleanly at 5lbs.The scope is zeroed at 225 yards, the max distance I can get out to at Brown's camp. This set is made for greater distance, but at the 225yds, I had 1-2"" groupings using PMC Bronze 147gr FMJBT. Field stripped and cleaned after both uses.I don't have the time to get out shooting as I once did and have only been able to get out twice since I've owned this set-up so it just sits in a climate controlled safe, so... up for sale it goes.Bipod on rifle is simply for picture use only as I shoot on a bag or sled only and buyer can have it, but I'd put a heavier one on if I were planning on using at the range.All transfer laws apply and I will go halves with buyer (about $15 each).No trades, cash only.$1100. Price bottomed out for quick sale today or tomorrow...More pictures available upon request.Will meet potential buyers in Beaverton/Hillsboro area only.Thank you for looking!"

A 3 MOA dot promotes rapid target acquisition, while providing a precise point of aim—getting shots down range and on target fast. The durable, machined aluminum housing ensures the unit will stand up to whatever you throw at it. High-quality, fully multi-coated lens offers a clean, wide field of view. Our top-load system makes changing the CR 1632 battery a snap and alleviates the need to remove the sight when switching the power source. The power and dot intensity controls are conveniently located on the left side of the unit. Flush 1 MOA windage and elevation adjustments are super sleek and make sighting in a breeze.  The Venom comes with a Picatinny mount—weighs 1.6 ounces with mount.     Optical Features    Fully Multi-Coated Multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces increase light transmission.   Premium Wide-Field Lens Exceptional edge-to-edge resolution.   Brightness Settings Choose between 10 levels of brightness in manual mode or switch to auto mode.   Parallax Free All red dot and holographic sights will exhibit some small amount of parallax.

It is a Browning-manufactured Mark III pistol that was sent to a professional gunsmith for a very slight blending of corners and sharp edges (aka street bevel) which makes holstering easier and less damaging. After that, it was sent out for Birdsong’s famous Black-T coating (this one has NATO Green-T with Black-T accents). This is the coating that Birdsong put on HK MP5s for the US Navy. It is very corrosion-resistant and naturally lubricious; it does not require an oily lubricant that attracts debris. I do use a bit of Frog Lube anyway, and any appearance of stains in a picture are due to lubricant. I probably haven’t shot 100 rounds through this pistol, and it never had a malfunction. It shoots straight and looks great. It is about 25 years old and has just been sitting in my safe for the last 20 years. Time to go to someone who will use it. Included are 4 magazines: two Green-T MecGar mags, one Black-T MecGar, and one Black-T original Browning mag. All hold 13 rounds. Hogue grips. Sell F2F to AL CCP holder."

I feel it should be done. My M600 TrackingPoint rifle has become a safe queen and that does her a disservice. She is meant to be fired and I just don't have the time anymore with the new job. She is in immaculate condition. I take care of my weapons. The only mark on her is where the spent casings eject.The TrackingPoint rifles are built on Daniel Defense weapon system with the Precision Guided Firing system installed. This baby has put 6 shots within sub-MOA accuracy standard easily. I have set her to .1 MOA and handed her to my wife, who had never shot a rifle before, gave her 5 minutes explanation on the controls and she put 5 shots under a quarter at 100 yards. She is advertised to be that accurate up to 550 yards but I have only been able to test it at 450yards so far. I can not emphasize enough that this weapon absolutely delivers as advertised. The Rifle allows you to connect your smartphone and or/tablet in order to see the scope view as well. Everytime you tag a target the scope records the shot and downloads to your smart device. Pretty cool when showing people what you are doing or a cool shot you made when telling friends later.The rifle will come with the weapon itself, 4 batteries and charger (holds two at a time), 2 20 rd mags, 70 rounds of TrackingPoint ammo (5.56 69gr open tipped match grade), and 340rds of Gorilla Ammo (223REM 69gr Open tipped match grade) and the coup de grace....Recon Jet Shooting glasses. The Recon Glasses have the ShotGlass app installed and allows you to view through the TrackingPoint scope in the viewer on the glasses. I JUST received the glasses and have done nothing more than charge them and turn them on and look through it. Haven't even gotten them to the range yet lol. Standard price for the rifle is $9995.00 and the glasses are $995.00.I will let the entire thing go for 7k but I am negotiable. I primarily want cash but I am open to trades. Only trades I am interested in are pistols for defense. Glock, M&P, H&K VP9. I took a lot of pictures but it is only letting me load a couple. Email me for more pics if needed."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 models now feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck. https://youtu.be/8XAYsYwZGxI The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol.

I feel it should be done. My M600 TrackingPoint rifle has become a safe queen and that does her a disservice. She is meant to be fired and I just don't have the time anymore with the new job. She is in immaculate condition. I take care of my weapons. The only mark on her is where the spent casings eject.The TrackingPoint rifles are built on Daniel Defense weapon system with the Precision Guided Firing system installed. This baby has put 6 shots within sub-MOA accuracy standard easily. I have set her to .1 MOA and handed her to my wife, who had never shot a rifle before, gave her 5 minutes explanation on the controls and she put 5 shots under a quarter at 100 yards. She is advertised to be that accurate up to 550 yards but I have only been able to test it at 450yards so far. I can not emphasize enough that this weapon absolutely delivers as advertised. The Rifle allows you to connect your smartphone and or/tablet in order to see the scope view as well. Everytime you tag a target the scope records the shot and downloads to your smart device. Pretty cool when showing people what you are doing or a cool shot you made when telling friends later.The rifle will come with the weapon itself, 4 batteries and charger (holds two at a time), 2 20 rd mags, 70 rounds of TrackingPoint ammo (5.56 69gr open tipped match grade), and 340rds of Gorilla Ammo (223REM 69gr Open tipped match grade) and the coup de grace....Recon Jet Shooting glasses. The Recon Glasses have the ShotGlass app installed and allows you to view through the TrackingPoint scope in the viewer on the glasses. I JUST received the glasses and have done nothing more than charge them and turn them on and look through it. Haven't even gotten them to the range yet lol. Standard price for the rifle is $9995.00 and the glasses are $995.00.I will let the entire thing go for 7k but I am negotiable. I primarily want cash but I am open to trades. Only trades I am interested in are pistols for defense. Glock, M&P, H&K VP9. I took a lot of pictures but it is only letting me load a couple. Email me for more pics if needed."

I have not attempted to restore or clean this up, since I know the aged patina can add to collector's value. I believe it could be brought to shooting condition by a careful restorer. I'm not sure what things have been done to it before, it does look like someone tried to re-solder the cleaning rod holder that sits under the barrel. Brass patch box. Octagonal barrel.Double set triggers.Plains style half-stock.Appears to be about .50 caliber (not sure).

Great BCG that I run in ALL of my AR Rifles. Upper has ran flawlessly and has approximately 1000 rounds through it. Have shot a little bit overything through it and I can average 1.5"" groups at 100 yards. A better shoot could easily see better groups. When paired with a regular lower, the rifle weighs in just under 6.5 pounds. Super light for a 20"" rifle. Has zero recoil with the muzzle brake. Bolt carrier group and upper do show very minor wear consistant with the amount of rounds fired. Has BCM's 13"" KMR Alpha rail installed with adjustable Keymod sections for pic rails and to add a sling.

According to my research, the 7 1/2"" barrel was a very low production model. Overall the gun looks very nice, it does not appear to have been fired much or handled much. The blueing is intact and I cannot see any wear (it looks as new). Though there is one very tiny little mark on the butt plate. To me, the revolver looks great considering it was manufactured in 1994. This is on consignment as part of large collection we are helping to liquidate. It is used and I'm no good at rating guns so please let the photos guide your buying decision and ask any questions. Sold as is. Its just the gun, no box or paperwork.
