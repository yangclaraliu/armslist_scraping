Chambered in 7.62x39 it is one of the most popular AK pattern rifles. The Wassenaar Arrangement Semiautomatic Rifle WASR-10/63 were rebuilt from de-milled AK-47 receivers by Cugir Factory and Imported and modified by Century International Arms to conform with 922(r). This one has a original build date of 1989 on the trunnion. These can take regular double stacked mags. The parkerized finish shows somelight wear as expected. The forend stock appears un-varnished and un-oiled. The chrome lined bore looks shiny with crisp rifling. It has a very smooth action and crisp trigger pull with no issues.Currently, I am cage-style flash hider, but the slant brake style is also included.This gun takes 30 round mags without issue, and without the dreaded magazine wobble.The gun most likely was a pre-1994 import, as it shows no signs ofbeing modified to take narrow 10 round mags, and hence not being re-modified to again take a 30 round mag. Each magazine seems quite content to stay in place andnot cause any reason for alarm. While I have owned the gun, it has had about 200 rounds put through it, and it functions as you would expect from a Kalishnikov...flawlessly.I have added the Zhukov Folding stock from Magpul. It features an adjustable length of pull andthe excellent build quality Magpul is known for. Also included is the Magpul storage-style grip. The Magpul folding stock has provisions for QD style sling loops, making it easy to use a Magpul MS4single or dual point sling (not included}.Included is the sale are (10) 30 round steel magazines, a Russian cleaning kit, slant style muzzle brake and an Uncle Mike's black nylon rifle case.Shipping and TransferFirearms will only be shipped to federally licensed firearms dealers Seller is not an FFL dealer.

It does operate, no parts missing. The stock and forearm are old replacements and their is a repair to the tang. Please see pictures for description. It is a solid gun but not a $2000 gem mint gun.  Displays very nicely in office or man cave.

The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod GEN 2 handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes polymer magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle.This gun is an exact replica of the military rifle. Comes equipped with a folding super sturdy Sig brace."

This is the best surplus 7.62 ammo you can get today. It does not attract a magnet and is mildly corrosive so clean your gun after shooting! Comes packed in 40 round boxes on 4 stripper clips. At .29 a round you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. Great cartridge to save for a rainy day.

For those unfamiliar with this model, it's the same frame as the Model 29 from Dirty Harry but chambered in .357 mag instead of .44 (so same amount of steel, but smaller holes).  That means it's the perfect candidate for those looking to reload, or for something that can handle some snot.  To date it's been my camp gun, bedside gun, and classic range conversation piece.
If you're looking to pinch pennies, load it up with .38spcl and it'll recoil like a friggin cap gun.
Some finish wear from age, nothing major.  Not interested in trades (sorry, moving and cant take the guns).  Would like to keep it pretty local to Tacoma.  I know a shop in Puyallup that does FFL transfers for $25 (FFL is the buyers responsibility).  Can take better/closer pictures of anything you'd like to see.
 
knocked the price down to $620 for a quick sale
