Includes original box and one magazine. This is the later P9M model with the S&W style lockup, extended controls, and improved sights, but normal Hi-Power trigger and general operation. It's compatible with all Hi-Power parts except for the barrel, slide and frame. I've installed a full set of Wolff standard weight springs (Service Pak Type 1) and a Browning extractor and roll pin. Includes all the original springs, the extractor, and the extractor roll pin.THIS PISTOL IS IN NEED OF MINOR REPAIR. I'm selling because I believe it's having a problem with the sear. I was a sucker and bought this from the last owner without much inspection.When I got the P9M it was in rough shape, so I cleaned it up and replaced all the springs and the extractor. I've put ~300 rounds through it and it feeds and cycles fine, but in the last 150 rounds I got three ""bursts"" of two rounds. From reading up it sounds like the sear is either worn or the last owner messed with it.It's possible that the ""bursts"" were not the sear slipping but bump fires, as the trigger lever has been shortened to shorten the reset (at the cost of added takeup). Reset is currently very short, similar to a 1911. That's an $8 part to replace and takes 30 seconds to change. I just don't want to deal with it anymore so I'm selling the pistol cheap with full disclosure. With an $8 trigger lever and $30 sear and (maybe) some minor fitting, this pistol will be returned to factory spec and should work 100%. There are no other functional issues apart from what I describe.Asking $300 OBO. Would also consider a trade for other 9mm handguns. Can add a little cash for a more expensive trade.If you have any questions at all, or want more pictures, please call or text me at 248-679-6602."

This firearm came to me in working condition but was in need of replacement parts, and I intended it to be a project gun. Barrel is in good shape, shoots well, and has original sights. The left and right extractors are bad, and the firing pin sometimes leaves light strikes on harder ammo, but is consistent with CCI typically. It is missing the original 7 round magazine, although there are original magazines available online and 10 round replacement magazines available. This is being sold as is with the buyer acknowledging that it requires some work to function correctly. Both extractors are available through Numrich Gun Parts, along with aftermarket 10 round magazines. Replacing the extractors can be done at home with standard tools, and does not require gunsmithing."

Here is a rare one for the shotgun collector. The Model 200 was manufactured from 1911 to 1914, with only 20,000 produced.  Serial no. 189XX.

The last patent date is 1912. I purchased this gun from a Stevens collector years ago.  Shot trap with it once, using Winchester Super Target 2 3/4"" 7/8oz. #8 Shot, and the gun performed flawlessly.  Then cleaned the gun and stored it in my safe ever since.  Gun comes with a file of information including patent drawings, a component parts list, and a 1968 ""Guns & Ammo"" magazine with an article about the Model 200.  This gun also includes the spanner, which is a part often missing from Model 200s these days. 

The Stevens Model 200, 20 gauge pump shotgun was the first manufactured 20 Gauge Pump Shotgun. It was the brainchild of the famous trap shooter, Charles (Sparrow) Young. Sparrow Young is in the trapshooting hall of fame and was the first shooter to break 100 straight from back yardage. In 1910 he patented the original idea which became the Model 200.  The gun was meant to be a combination of a light ""field"" type gun for upland game with a heavy duck gun (when firing 3"" shells).

 

The Stevens Model 200 was considered the King of The Turkey Shoot Circuit in the 1920's. This is a 5-shot gun that weighs about 6.5 lbs.  Note that the stock's drop was well-modified by a previous owner (see pics). Additional pics available upon request.

 

For FTF sale in VA, buyer must be 18+ years of age and have a VA driver’s license.  For an out-of-state sale, will arrange shipment to buyer’s FFL, at buyer’s cost.

Asking $600.  Open to reasonable offers / trades.

Transaction will include bill of sale. Still available if posted.  Thanks for looking!"

The gun itself is in great condition, and was used strictly as a range toy, was not a carry weapon. It has been fired enough to wear the trigger has smoothed out, which is common on the M&Ps (they start out gritty when you get them from the factory.) It has been well cared for, cleaned after use, but probably saw 2000 or so rounds through it. Great gun, served me well. I bought the threaded barrel version hoping to buy a silencer, but never decided to jump through the hoops to get one. (Maybe soon we wont have to worry about that.)Please let me know if you have any questions. I can send you more pictures in higher quality if you need them. Not looking to trade for anything.I will have a bill of sale to fill out at time of purchase, prefer a CCDW, but not necessarily required."

The new Silver Hunter Micro Midas gas-operated autoloader is trim, lightweight, easy to shoulder and swing and ideal for the smaller shooter. Here is the opportunity to purchase a deluxe autoloader with all the features you need to have a reliable, successful day in the field. Its semi-humpback design, which refers to the pistol grip and rear of the receiver area, allows a sure grip for smaller hands. Additionally, the lightweight profile barrel helps pick up the ivory front sight bead very quickly. Shouldering, the grip, sight plane and weight are all critical factors when selecting any shotgun, either for youth and ladies or for adults. The Silver Hunter Micro Midas becomes the only real choice because of its compact and lightweight handling. The finely cut checkering on the grip and forearm also help to better control the gun. The length of pull, measured from the middle of the recoil pad to the trigger is shorter than normal, so smaller shooters can comfortably shoulder the gun. Nothing is more awkward than trying to bring down a pheasant with a bulky, heavy shotgun that is too large and heavy for the hunter. The Silver Hunter is available in 12 or 20 gauge and with a 24"" or 26"" barrel."

The rifle has been well taken care of, properly broken in, and cleaned regularly. Round count, 544. It has some cosmetic wear from taking this thing on elk hunts and anyone who elk hunts knows where elk live. The rifle is proven as it has taken numerous elk at ranges from 270-1130 yards. It has never let me down. Scope has NP-R1 reticle, Nightforce Ultralight rings. RCBS Die set, 8 loaded rounds, 83 Fireformed Hornady Brass. Total package $3000Not looking for trades, unfortunately as I am only selling to fund a full custom new rifle. Txt me if interested or for more info. Thanks. Four0six four6one four4two4Colter"

(2 SIG M400s) which are sold seperate as they are tacti-cooled up. My M1A and 1911 build is going to be very expensive so this will help cut the cost.

It uses AA batteries, has a built in QD mounting system, and has an auto-on that turns the sight on with the slightest movement of the firearm. The sight works very well. It has a simple interface. Just a twist knob on the side that selects the four different brightness settings. The lowest setting is compatible with night vision if you have it. The other three are low, medium, and high settings. I have yet to see the dot get washed out on high. It is a 1.8 MOA dot so if you adjust your brightness settings accordingly, you can be very accurate with it.The auto-on feature is awesome and works very well. In the two years I have had this sight, it has never been off by the time that I looked through the optic. The motion sensor is very sensitive so just tapping the table with the firearm resting on it will activate the sight.Battery life is around 20,000 hours on full brightness, but the motion sensor extends that lifetime. That is on a single lithium AA battery which you can find everywhere.If you want more information or pictures of specific things let me know."

Nothing copied. No trades at this time.

Built on the same standard as the military RPK, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK barrel.

Vepr in .308 Win. caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.
