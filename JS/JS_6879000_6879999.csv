The exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions. An extended ejector rod allows for positive extraction of fired cases. Like all standard Judge revolvers, the Public Defender Polymer fires .45 Long Colt rounds and 2-2/"" .410 Bore shotgun shells interchangeably.    Fires .45 LC & .410 Bore Interchangeably    Lightweight Polymer Frame    Extended Ejector Rod    Ribbed Rubber Grip    Red Fiber-Optic Front Sight"

A REASONABLE OFFER WILL BE ACCEPTED. Im looking to discuss the sale or trade off my Roland Special Glock 19. This started as a all factory Gray Frame Gen 4 19. I sent the slide to ATEI and had the slide work done along with installing the RMR (RM06) and a ATEI rear slide plate. The barrel and comp are from KKM (low round count). I've also added suppressor height irons, a Raven Concealment FREYA Magwell, Surefire X300U (600 lumen light), Overwatch Precision TAC trigger, and extended controls (Vickers and OEM). A CNC Kermoman v2 holster, and numerous mags (not sure how many I have at this point, 10+ easy). This is a beautiful handgun and a very nice shooter. This pistol is fully decked out, only thing it's missing is framework. The ""Roland special"" setup from ATEI is roughly $2,000 not including the actual pistol. This is a super accurate gun that's setup for a defensive role. It's 100% reliable as it sits and groups incredibly well at 25 yards with the red dot. My priority is selling the gun as is with holster and mags for $1800. I'd like to sell ASAP to fund a new rifle build. If inrerested, please text me because I don't check emails often. REDACTED."

The standard PT1911 is hand-fit in the Taurus factory and includes popular combat and competition custom features such as a ""Beavertail"" grip safety with memory groove, extended ambidextrous thumb safety and slide stop controls, lowered and flared ejection port, frame checkering, and other niceties unusual for a pistol of its price range."

H&K GERMAN Factory original HK 9mm 30 round magazine for the MP5 SP89 HK94 and other 9mm clones.
This is ORIGINAL H&K Factory German made Magazine  30rd.  These are not the Korean Made under License by H&K you see advertised on others auction listings.  These are NOT the Turkish made which are marked MKE. These are NOT the Pakistani Ordnance Factory marked POF. And these are NOT the British Aerospace mags are marked EN.   This magazine is ORIGIANL GEMAAN H&K FACTORY MADE.  Whether you buy ours or not Please be careful  I have read through a lot of auctions and they state Factory or H&K OEM and they are NOT GERMAN made.   If you are looking for the Great German Craftsmanship, you want these mags.  
Just for your information when purchasing H&K MP% HK 94 magazines  here is a brief list of things you should know, Some of the H&K listed mags are made in Pakistan, POF, Pakistani Ordnance Factory mags were not marked other than being stamped 9 x 19. Later Paki mags were stamped POF and 9x19 on the body.    Turkish H&K mags are maked MKE and 9x 19 and British Aerospace H&K mags are marked EN if I remember correctly. Korean, made in Korea by a military NATO approved manufacturer, sometimes marked ATI or KC or they have a numerical date code on them.  HK NEVER produced any 40rd straight or curved mags for the MP5
 
Note the picture with the “Made in Germany” imprinted
These mags were made in 1996 based on the date code and therefore have the L/E Govt makings. They are LEGAL to buy and posses by ANYONE since the expiration of the Federal Hi cap mag ban in 2004.  Blue Steel and Stainless Steel Follower. These are the best H&K mags on the market. Not only do they function flawlessly, they have a Collector value with the L/E Govt imprint on them.  there were only a finite / limited number of these produced and they are no longer in production (1994-2004). They have not been produced with the inscription since 2004.  I have not seen another one of these for sale anywhere.

Just that it works.I dont really want to separate them.  But since i know someones going to ask about the yugo mag ... ill say $25 for it.  I dont usually see them going for much below that price plus its got a box and a half of ammo in it. Amd i dont want to separate them.To buy this seperately would be in the neighborhood of $30-40. IF you could find one and IF you wanted to pay and wait for it to be shipped.But again... i really dont want to split these up.For all 3 with the ammo i can let them go for $60The ammo by itself is worth $30.  So thats around $10 a magazine. Youre not finding a better deal than this.  So my price is firm.

It produces an exceptionally clear image with virtually no spots or blemishes, meaning it was probably hand selected for tube quality (it is within specs for even a new $3600 unit to have a few black spots around the edge of the image, which this one doesn't have). This unit appears to be autogated -- it dims when pointed at a bright light, which prevents tube damage. This unit comes with a dual battery housing, which gives it a longer battery life than the single battery units (65 hours continual use as opposed to 40 hours). It takes AA batteries.I was told by the previous owner that this unit has only been used for a few hours... the condition of the unit and quality of the image is definitely consistent with that. I have used it less than an hour myself, so it has the vast majority of its service life left, and will provide many good years of service.I was also told by the previous owner that this unit has an Omni tube, meaning it is mil spec and that unlike the ITT/Pinnacle tubes, it is rated for .308 recoil.It comes with the attached lens cover/pinhole lens (for testing the unit in regular lighting), a J-arm mount (used for mounting to a helmet or ""skull crusher"" headgear), as well as a weapon mount, for mounting the unit on a Picatinny rail either behind or in front of AR-height optics. It works great behind my Aimpoint PRO or Comp M4. It also works great in front of a scope that can adjust down to 1x.Get this very clean Gen 3 night vision unit in great condition for over $1,000 less than a new one would cost, or for the same as you would pay for a Gen 2 unit, if you want to think of it that way. If you have never used Gen 3 night vision, let's just say it blows Gen 1 and Gen 2 out of the water in every possible way... it's not even close. A unit like this gives you a massively unfair advantage in any low light situation.I would take $2200 OBO.I am willing to ship, with the buyer paying.Also, not interested in trading."
