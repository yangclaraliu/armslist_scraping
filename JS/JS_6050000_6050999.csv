 This M1 Carbine was purchased from the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP).  It is very serviceable with a shiny bore and a muzzle reading of 2.  The barrel is original to the receiver and is stamped “IBM Corp 11-43.”  There are no observed cracks in the stock.  The stock has several markings such as the US Ordnance Wheel (Crossed Cannons), a couple of proof “P” stamps, and “AAA” due to rebuild at Anniston, AL Arsenal.  It is also stamped “FAT” to indicate it was used in Italy at one time in its history.

Don't expect any jams with this bad boy. Double action/single action with decocker just like the P226 and P228. This is a huge advantage over the now market dominating striker fire polymer handguns (i.e. Glock, Springfield XD, etc). Manufacturers use striker fire simply because it's cheaper and simpler. Absolute point and shoot accuracy (no need to look down the sights if you don't have time, essential for self-defense), and fits my hand like a glove. The SP2022 has interchangable grips, and this one comes with a size medium and a size large. There is no better handgun for under $500."

The upper is an Aero Precision 7075-T6 aluminum forging made specifically for the 458 Socom cartridge.  The upper features a factory oversized ejection port, factory installed dust cover, forward assist, and white “T” marks.  The lower is a matching Aero Precision 7075-T6 aluminum forging marked Multi Caliber.  The lower contains a tensioning screw that can be used to remove all clearance between the upper and lower creating a wobble free assembly.  The adjustable carbine stock, trigger guard, and grip are Magpul MOE in flat dark earth.  The Magpul stock can be adjusted to 6 different positions. The Magpul MOE grip has a storage compartment.  The lower parts kit is Anderson Mfg. milspec.  The aluminum free float hand guard is a 12” long key mod rail system in flat dark earth. The top of the rail is full length picatinny with 2 additional 3” long FDE key mod rails that can be attached anywhere along the sides or bottom of the hand guard.  The ported barrel is manufactured by custom barrel manufacturer Deadshot Barrels.  This 16” barrel is of the heavy contour style and is manufactured from 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a non-reflective black Cerakote coating.  The barrel is ported and therefore does not require a flash hider or muzzle brake.  The ports act as a muzzle brake which keeps the recoil down and since it is integrated into the barrel the overall length is kept to a minimum.  The barrel features a center feed ramp for proper feeding of the 458 SOCOM cartridge.  The barrel is manufactured for a carbine length gas system with a .875” diameter gas block seat.  The underside of the barrel is dimpled for proper gas block alignment.  Rifle comes with one Wilson Combat/Lancer 7 shot magazine specifically made for the 458 Socom cartridge.  Awesome looking and handling rifle.  Nothing to do but mount some optics and start shooting.   Payment:If local cash only.  Must have a CWP or drivers license and sign a bill of sale.  If shipment is required I will only ship to a licensed FFL holder.  Payment can be by USPS money order or certified check.  Shipping within the continental US is $40 and includes insurance.GregREDACTED"

I bought the gun and scope new a couple years ago for my son; however, I cannot seem to get him interested in hunitng or shooting, so I am just going to sell it. WhenI bought this rifle it had a very heavy trigger pull, so I called H&R and they told me I could send it back to them and they would do a trigger job on it.  I was very skeptical about how good of a trigger job they would actually do, but amazingly, they did a great job.  It now breaks at just over 3.5 pounds and has zero creep. The scope that is on it is an Alpen 3-9x32 (lifetime warranty) and it is a very nice little scope for this rifle.  I have saved both the boxes for the rifle and the scope.  This pacakge also comes with Weaver scope rings that mount the scope as close to the bore as you can get, while still being able to operate the hammer w/side extension.  This will insure a consistent cheek weld on the stock for the best accuracy.  I also have an older but good Uncle Mike's sling with shell holder.  H&R is now out-of-business, so this is a rare find.  I am not going to price gauge anyone on it, but I am not going to accept low-ball offers.  Also, NO TRADES."
