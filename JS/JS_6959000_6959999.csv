Retail $754.99!! asking only $430.00Featuring extra-low dispersion glass, their proprietary Xtended Twilight (XT) Lens System, and phase corrected BAK4 prisms, Leupold's Kryptek Highlander 8x42 BX-3 Mojave Pro Guide HD Binocular delivers images with breath-taking color, clarity, and contrast. The lenses are made of lead-free high-transmittance calcium fluoride glass, which by their nature, limit reflection and increase color fidelity and contrast. The XT system complements the glass through the use of index-matched lens coatings that were specifically engineered for the calcium-fluoride lenses to raise the already high transmittance across the entire visible spectrum -- with special emphasis on the blue and violet wavelengths that are most prevalent in low-light, such as at dawn and dusk and under heavily-canopied forests. Designed for a life lived outdoors the optical tubes are nitrogen-filled and O-ring sealed to make them water and fogproof, even when moving through extreme temperature variations. The chassis is made from an aluminum alloy to make it lightweight and corrosion-resistant. To further cut weight, and to give users more gripping area, Leupold employs an open bridge configuration with a dual-hinge. Its oversized and knurled center focusing wheel allows for sharp focusing even while wearing gloves."

Product Description The PCR name stands for ‘Police Czech Republic,’ the group for whom the model was originally designed. Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

Bought this Mossberg 590A1 new in December 2016 from Keith’s for $470 and have put no rounds through it.  I removed the protective oil and put it in the safe.  It is in “new” condition.  This is a serious shotgun and is what our military carries.  It is all metal unlike the Mossberg 500 or 590.  The barrel is a water pipe!  Holds 6+1.  You can read all about it on Mossberg’s website.  Need to make room in the safe!
I will split the transfer cost up to $20.  This excludes the Oregon State Police background check of $10.  I know of several places that will do transfers for $25-$30.  Will drive to Vancouver, WA to sell it.  Contact me via the site or text me at 971- two one nine - 1015"

There are some tools so basic, you can’t imagine being without them. But even essential tools can be refined and improved. That’s the principle behind the new XD-E™: the best elements of the world-renowned XD® Series, condensed into a weapon so intuitive, comfortable and accurate, you can’t imagine being without it. The XD-E™ sculpts unmatched Point And Shoot Ergonomics™ into a sleek frame just an inch wide, for hand and holster fit so satisfying you’ll take it everywhere. The low-effort slide practically racks itself, so handling’s a pleasure. The exposed hammer clearly shows gun mode, and the single/double action trigger shows respect for your shooting style, unlike other compacts. Then there’s the grip: GripZone® provides active texture that matches your grasp like a handshake, improves stability, and feels incredible. Three magazine options let you personalize concealability and capacity. Impeccable feel, weight and balance launch the XD-E™ from invisible to impactful in an instant, for go-anywhere confidence unlike any you’ve felt. New shooter or skilled gunner, wrap your mitt around the new XD-E™ and you’ll know. This is more than a hammer. It redefines what your hammer should be. The hammer – the most important tool in the toolbox.         Specs   Caliber 9mm Recoil System Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod Sights Fiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat Rear Weight (with Empty Magazine) 25 oz   Height 5"" w/ Flush Magazine, 6"" w/ Magazine X-Tension™ Slide Forged Steel, Melonite® Barrel 3.3"" Hammer Forged Steel, Melonite® Length 6.75""   Grip Width 1"" Frame Black Polymer Magazines 1 - 8 Round w/ Grip X-Tension™, 1 - 9 Round w/ Mag X-Tension™     Springfield XDE 9mm"

Bought this PRP Ultimate Easy Fit Trigger Kit for my XD45 new.  Wow is all I can say comparing this trigger kit to the factory.  I have already sanded down the trigger, so for you it will be a drop it.  Selling my XD45, so the trigger must go.  There is a good Youtube video on how to install this.  Takes about 30 minutes.  Contact me via the site or text me at 971- two one nine – 1015.  Here is the description from PRP:
http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=36&categoryId=30
[From Powder River Precision]This kit includes our famous striker safety lever, to remove the long trigger pre-travel on the XD trigger. Reduced power trigger and sear springs, to lower the pull weight and our new trigger. The trigger is made of tough light weight polymer that helps speed up the reset. It also has an integral over travel stop on the back of the trigger. Using this method of over travel stop removes added stress on the trigger bar that are present with any of the other over travel stop method. When installed correctly, the kit will give you a short crisp trigger pull (about 4-4.5lbs) with a fast reset and cut the total trigger pull length by about 1/2. The kit requires minor fitting and includes gunsmith installation instructions. Fits all XD 45 caliber models except the XD 45 with the thumb safety.  It does not work with the 9mm/40S&W.  The trigger is a Springfield Armory OEM part available on production XD and XDM pistols from the factor."

Will sell without drum for $600 but will not sell drum alone. Bill of sale required. Would like this sold in the next couple of days but I am not giving it away. If it does not sell I will just keep it. FTF in Crestview please. No felons, no shipping etc. 21yrs and older please and show valid FL driver license or CCW for bill of sale. Gun runs fantastic. Only reason I am selling is to get into an AK 74 platform. Rather have cash but trade interests include milsurp firearms, C&R, AK74, AK101s. No hunting, mosins, western style guns please. If the add is up then it is still for sale. Will include original wood handguard and pistol grip for full asking price. Thanks."

Browning designedM1911. The Remington R1 is a blend of modern steel machined to ultra-tight tolerances, and an iconic design, proven in combat for over a century. The R1 Enhanced comes with many features normally only found on custom guns. A beavertail grip safety with a checkered memory bump, a flat, checkered mainspring housing, and front strap serrations provide a solid, non-slip hold, and enhance accuracy when the hand remembers where the perfect grip is for consistent shooting. The memory bump also aids in activating the grip safety for the shooter with thin hands. The skeletonized combat hammer fits snuggly into the beavertail safety for carrying the pistol cocked and locked. Custom checkered, laminate wood grips compliment the shooter's secure hold, and the left panel is relieved for easier access to the magazine release. The slide and frame are finished with a durable satin black oxide coating. Front and rear slide serrations provide a secure hold when raking the slide. A low profile black rear sight and a red fiber-optic front sight are quick to pick-up in any lighting. To maximize accuracy potential, the Remington R1 Enhanced comes with an anodized aluminum match trigger, and a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. A lowered and flared ejection port enhances reliable ejection of spent cases, and a wide thumb safety is easy to reach. The Remington Model 1911 R1 Enhanced Semi-Auto Pistol comes with two 8-round magazines with an extended bumper pad base plate."
