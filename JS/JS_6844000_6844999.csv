The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself. The Henry Lever Carbine .22 rifle features a large loop lever that is perfect for individuals with larger hands or when wearing gloves in cold weather. It has a compact overall length of 34″ and a 16 1/8″ barrel. The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a 3/8″ grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

The barrel to slide lockup is the tightest I've ever felt in a striker fired pistol. Would prefer not to sell, just doesn't fit me as well as I had hoped and cannot justify keeping.

Payment by USPS Money order or cash at face to face transaction. Shipping will be USPS flat rate unless you request otherwise. Here is a description from Treeman Knives: ""This is the original Combat Dagger. It has a 6"" O1 tool steel .250 thick blade that will outperform any stainless steel knife made. Its sharp top and bottom with a hollow grind and a full tang. The blade has a bake-on Cerakote finish that will last a life time and never rust. The handles are available in checkered G10 or Canvas Micarta with black or gray screws and a lanyard. This knife is badass and ready to go to combat. It has a great solid feel and an excellent grip in either hand. The skull crusher is bad news for those on the receiving end, and the thong loop will keep the knife in your hand, where it belongs. It comes in either a Handmade TREEMAN leather or C4 made Kydex sheath. Overall length is 11 3/4"". This is the very best Combat Dagger made.  Find one with a better grind, weight and balance and I will buy it! Thank You, Treeman Knives."""

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family."

Its a safe queen and doesn't get any action, as I have lots of other guns. The serial number dates to the early 90's, confirmed by Mossberg. It had a complete service from a gunsmith 6 months ago and he has it working in excellent order. Very smooth action.

While 7.5"" this piston driven system will cycle suppressed and unsupressed, not one FTE/FTF/etc ever for me. Much more reliable than a DI 7.5"" upper. There are plenty of youtube videos showing this cycle suppressed full auto with no issue. It does require an easy modification to the BCG if you plan on installing the new Fostech Echo binary trigger. I do not have more than 20 mags or so through this thing, it's been a safe queen. Keep in mind this will need to be added to a pistol lower receiver, otherwise you need the NFA tax stamp. Will include the rail covers, AFG, and MBUS if wanted. Google/Youtube for more specs/videos/reviews…throw it on a lower and you’ll have a nice weapon. I just have no need for it and haven’t really used it. If you have questions/trade requests shoot me a text at REDACTED. Cost me $800ish new just for the upper with no accessories just to put things in perspective, not looking for that.

Hungarian FEG AK63D AK47- AKM type under folder rifles, 7.62 x 39 parts kit. Relatively rare kit not regularly seen in the US and a great addition to any AK collection . Manufactured by FEG ( Fegyver- és Gépgyár) in Hungary and shows some finish wear from military service. The AK-63 was used by Iraqi forces again during the Gulf War in 1990-91, and later turned up in Kurdish and Shi'ite hands during the insurrections in Iraq throughout the 1990s. The AK-63 was also exported to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, which used them to fight the Contras in the 1980s. Significant numbers of AK-63s were also sent to the FMLN in nearby El Salvador starting in late 1984 or 1985. One estimate suggested that about 11,000 AK-63 rifles may have been sent to the region over a five-year period. Since the end of the Cold War, the AK-63 has also turned up regularly in the hands of militants in Somalia and Zambia, and was also purchased by Croatian forces for use during the Croatian War of Independence. Photographic evidence shows that the AK-63 is one the primary rifles in use by the Kurdish YPG/YPJ and PKK forces in Syria and Iraq. The AK63 series were never produced in large numbers, the last export of guns were sold for use in the war in the Balkans."

He often hides behind the guise that he hasn't shot the gun and you have the liability, but he fails to mention that he hasn't shot it because the barrel was machined wrong or the pin was broken. I've had 3 friends buy from this guy, and all the guns they bought had to be sent back to the manufacturer to be fixed or just had to be trashed because they were defective. They tried to get back into contact with the ""Randy Boyd,"" but each time, he just said it was their mistake for not properly inspecting it before buying from him. Don't trust this guy. It is a shame we can't trust our own community."

I believe that both of the drums are original, unmarked German WWII, as both have the directional arrow stamped in the bottom, all German drums had arrows stenciled or stamped . Drums work perfectly and recommended for use in semi automatic and fully automatic MG34 and M42 machineguns.
