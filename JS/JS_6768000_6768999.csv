Both of mine are in 9mm. The Beretta has had 4 mags of ammo through it and has never been holstered or carried. Mags hold 15 rounds. Has decocker and rotating barrel. Looks new without a mark on it. The Springfield has about 150 rounds through it, but has a couple small spots of holster wear on the slide from when I tried carrying it for a little while. I put a pierce pinky extension on the compact mag so it fit my hands better.The guns I'm interested in are a Stainless Springfield 1911 or other good stainless 1911. A stainless ruger scout rifle with 16"" barrel. A stainless ruger mini14, but only if it's the newer heavy barrel models. No interest in the old pencil barrels"

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.  SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

Rifle has a 4x24X50 alluminated mil-dot reticle scope. 24"" barrel. This rifle has been taken hunting and whatnot so it has seen a couple paint jobs and it gets handled, however this is hands down the most accurate rifle I have owned. I have had non expierenced shooters hitting 2"" groups at 150yards.  Rifle has never mis-fired or been dry fired. It has a Harris bi pod and a cheek pad with ammo storage along with a sling, and a tactical bolt handle. Comes with the case shown underneath. Adjustable trigger down to I think 2 pounds. Set at about 4.5 lbs now. Rifle carries 13 rounds on board. Comes with roughly 60 rounds. The rifle has around 300 rounds through it so it's still a brand new barrel lots of life.  Great starter weapon for anyone looking to start long range shooting.

The metal has quite a bit of surface rust, but should be able to removed. Minor cracks by the butt plate and forward of the trigger guard. Original sights, it seems. I have not fired the gun, but it seems functional. Still, a trip to the gunsmith for a headspace check and bolt set back check is advised. Comes with 20 rounds of 7.57mm Sellier and Bellot FMJs.

XCR-L incorporates heavy duty components such as a sturdy oprod, a beefy three-lug bolt, a locking extractor, and a fixed ejector.  These elements and others ensure reliable performance with minimal. Many rifles claim to be modular weapon systems just because they  have a 1913 standard rail system used to attach accessories. The  XCR-L is truly modular.  With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light  weight carbine, or a longer marksman's rifle.  The XCR-L's quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability. Barrel and caliber changes can  be made in less than 5 minutes.

At one point I had the rear sight removed and a red dot was mounted in the rear dovetail, the original rear sight has been placed back on but I haven't shot it since to check accuracy (unlikely, but the rear sight may need to be drifted a millimeter or two). It shoots flawlessly and it comes with an extra set of real-wood target competition grips, 3 mags, all original packaging and accessories, and a replacement bushing that if I recall correctly is supposed to allow the empty mags to drop-free. Fired round count is under 400 and that's being very generous.

Less than 40 rounds down range. It's a great gun but I just don't get to use it. Comes with Vortex Viper 6-24x50 and Harris bipod. All trades are welcome, worst I can say is no. I paid 1700 for this setup and it's still not even broken in.  This rifle is NOT affected by the Remington recall. REDACTED"

The Calico’s are extremely abnormal in appearance and operation, mostly due to the helical-fed magazine system implemented. The cylinder atop the weapon is capable of carrying an astounding 100-9mm rounds. While boasting so much firepower, the weapon possessed a slim profile to the extent that some Calico models were able to be wielded as very small SMGs. The Calico designs were ambidextrous, semi-automatic or full-auto, and spent shells were ejected from below the firearm. While initially intended for the Law Enforcement and Military markets, the Calico design has not been formally adopted by any agencies however Calico LWS is still producing models for sale in the civilian marketplaces.
