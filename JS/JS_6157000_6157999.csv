Silver nitride finish steel receiver with high-relief engraving, polished blued barrels, and oil finish grade II/III walnut, standard Invector choke tubes. What makes White Lightning? The term ""left in the white"", or simply ""white"" has been used for decades describing the color of shotgun and rifle parts. ""In the white"" means that firearm parts were not blued or color case-hardened or colored in any way, but left in the natural, polished color of the metal, such as steel. Often times, the bolt, top lever, slide, ejectors and other parts are left in the natural color of the metal, providing a luxurious contrast to the rest of the shotgun. In this way, the Browning's Citori White Lightning receiver and action offer a fine choice as opposed to ""blued"" over-unders. But don't be afraid that the steel receiver is unprotected: the natural color steel receiver and trigger guard are protected from corrosion by a durable coating process called a ""nitrided"" finish, offering similar protection to bluing. Just with a uniquely elegant and attractive look. A well-rounded pistol grip for performance. The Citori White Lightning's round knob or pistol grip allows the shooter to position his hand at the same, solid place for each shot, thus offering better control for fast-flying waterfowl upland game, sporting clays or trap and skeet. Matching the rounded pistol grip is the forearm. It is nicely rounded and together, they give the name to this over under gun as ""Lightning Style,"" or the Citori White Lightning, a classic style indeed, a timeless style. Specifications: 12 Ga, 28” Barrel Length, 8lbs 2 OZ, 3” Chamber, Chokes Included Full, Modified, Improved Cylinder."

It is caliber 38 WCF (38-40). This is a Second Model having the dust cover rail attached to the receiver by screws and the external trigger pin. Special order rifle with 28"" full octagon barrel (4"" longer than standard), full magazine, and set trigger. Typical of the early 38 caliber rifles, this has a shotgun butt with smooth steel buttplate with widow's peak top toe - the early 38 cal 1873s had shotgun butts as standard issue and do not show in the factory records. There are matching assembly numbers on the lower tang, upper inletting of buttstock, and toe of buttplate so the stock is original to the rifle. The other special order features will letter, see pic of factory letter that will be included with the rifle. Fine aged barrel, mag and receiver blue has turned a mix of plum and patina with some hints of bright original blue throughout. Stocks show normal use, especially the forearm, but do not have any splits or cracks, are void of any extra holes, never have been sanded or refinished, and are still very tight and even with the metal. Sights include a Rocky Mountain front sight and the early, short rear sight with the serrated edges common to the First and Second Model 1873s. Action is crisp and tight; hammer spring is strong but needs adjustment as the set trigger is not functioning and the hammer will come back up if cycled with the throw of the lever - hammer does stay back if cocked first, before cycling lever. Bore is good with very pronounced rifling, typical light scattered black powder fouling, very minor frost, about a 7 of 10 and may clean better. Not warranted as safe to shoot so have it checked by a competent gunsmith if you intend to fire it. All parts and markings are correct and rifle is 100% original."

The gun is used, having fired 410 rounds through it. It runs decently but is a little ammunition choosy. I have had the best performance with Winchester Super X, CCI Mini Mags, and Remington Golden Bullets. Included is a 4-Magazine Pouch, four 25 round Magazines, and two 10 round Magazines. It has an angled foregrip currently installed. Please contact me with any questions you may have. Price is $250 but is not set in stone. If you would like to include other accessories, such as a vertical foregrip, single or two point sling, hard plastic case, or ammunition let me know. It is a straight-shooting 22LR but I haven't used it in a few years and want to make some space in my safe.

My son has outgrown this so time for another to learn to shoot. This gun is about 5 years old. I have about 250.00 invested and I am looking to get $150.00 for it. Price is firm, any less I will keep it for the grand kids. FTF deal is preferred but I will ship it from my FFL to Your FFL at the buyer's expense."

Mags are Tan/FDE aluminum bodies and blue anti-tilt followers. These are the 4th generation of USGI Aluminum 30 round magazines and were specifically designed to reliably feed the new M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) in the M4/M4A1 carbine without damaging the feed ramps. The new Enhanced Performance magazines have redesigned feed lips that alter the angle that the M855A1 round hits the feed ramps so that the exposed steel penetrator on the tip doesn't gouge or scratch the aluminum portion of the feed ramps on M4 and M4A1 carbines. Not using an M4 or green tip - no problem - The new magazine can also be used with standard 5.56mm rounds, the M855, or any standard 5.56mm ammunition WITH MORE EFFECTIVE FEEDING AND DECREASED WEAR AND IMPACT on the weapon or ammunition. Shipped for 50$. Multiple payment options besides cash with a FTF transaction. Additional quantities may be available!  QUESTIONS - Please contact me. I have personally shot 2000 rounds through 5 mags right now and they have worked without flaw."

I'm selling only because I'm rolling the money over into something else I've been wanting.  I'm asking $450 cash, which is a good price for this shotgun, especially considering that I replaced the aforementioned springs, and I'm taking a small loss on what I have into it for a quick sale."

The 7.62x39 platform rifle being offered in trade has had zero FTF or FTE during the limited number of rounds that I have put through it. I have only used brass cased Yugo M67 ammo, so I cannot vouch for how it may handle steel cased ammo. Rifle is in very good cosmetic and functional condition. Only looking to trade as I am hoping to add an A2 rifle to my collection.Rifle being offered in trade was originally purchased from Sooner Guns and Gold in Norman, OK. They received it from an individual that stated that he had nearly $1100.00 in the build and SG&G's asking price in May 2014 was $949.99 according to the hang tag that I saved. I don't have 100% of the details on the parts used, but I can confirm that the rifle was built using a Model 1 complete upper (with their dedicated 7.62x39 bolt and enhanced firing pin), Smith & Wesson M&P lower, Magpul CTR stock, MOE+ grip, and MOE handguard. After purchasing, I added the Magpul MBUS rear sight, RVG grip, Magpul enhanced triggerguard. I also added the Vortex red dot and the Streamlight in the rail light mount, but these two items would not be included with the rifle. Rifle will include your pick of the Magpul MBUS or a stand alone A2 rear sight. Rifle also did not include a magazine when originally purchased, but I will include two 20 round ASC magazines that have both been tested and function correctly."
