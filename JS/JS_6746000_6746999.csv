Wingman, MERARE BUSHMASTER, AND GOOD LUCK FINDING ONEYou are buying on a very nice Bushmaster AR-15! I have never seen a Bushmaster listed here on here that w Pre-2006 (made in Windham, Maine) - when they were the best damn AR-15 platform on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.This is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version that others are trying to sell you for $1500. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable! (Read ""HISTORY"" below).It also reads 5.56mm-.223 on the lower, indicating you can shoot 5.56mm rounds out of this gun, unlike some of the newer uppers. There has been less than 300 rounds through this gun. It performs amazing. It's comes with 3 mags. 2 original metal, 1 plastic. $900.00 obo or trade"

Arrives on your doorstep ready to fire, no license needed for black powder firearms.I sell 00 buckshot as well, 100 pieces for $6. I have roughly 400,000 pieces of buck available. The photos are a bit old, my shotguns now have basic checkering on the stocks. That is the only difference. I also put the shotgun back into factory grease to keep it safe, it will need cleaning prior to firing."

He has a very good reputation for for building quality firearms. This gun is a beauty! The threaded barrel and Apex trigger have been Titanium Nitride (TiN) coated & the slide has been ported. Has the SigLite supressor night sights, Apex trigger. Comes with everything from the factory, including the original trigger and 4 21rd magazines & 5 17rd mags. I got this with the intention of using it in IDPA but found out that the very things that make it special are alsao the same things that make it ineligible to use in IDPA. Less than two hundred rounds through the gun, it shoots amazing by the way. Would love to hold on to it but I'm not a safe queen gun kinda guy.Sale price is $1100Trade value at $1200 Only trades interested in are other high end 9mm's with other P320's & 9mm 1911's at the top of the list.REDACTED"
