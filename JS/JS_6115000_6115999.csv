This is a well-built Rifle and it is in excellent condition. I bought this Rifle about 10 years ago and it was new old stock in its original box. I have sense fired it putting maybe 20 or so rounds through it. Every time I fired the Rifle I used good ammunition either Remington or Federal and have always cleaned/oiled the barrel and whipped the Rifle down. The walnut stock is nearly perfect with only a couple minor imperfections and it is fit beautifully to the Rifle.  I rate the stock 99% or better. The bluing on the Rifle is excellent as well with the only imperfection being under the rear sight. There is a small amount of rust under the sight shown in the picture. This existed when I purchased the Rifle 10 years ago. The sight could be removed and the rust cleaned up but I want to leave the Rifle in its original condition for the buyer. Because of this imperfection I have to rate the bluing at 95% however if this were not there it would easily be 99%. The action is nice and smooth and operates flawlessly. This is one of the good old Marlin’s not one of the new Remlin’s. The Weaver Scope is virtually new and is a perfect set up for this Rifle. *Please note that I will only sell through a reputable FFL with a license number that I can verify. I prefer to sell Face to Face however I will ship Firearms and sell outside of the State of Washington. This will cost an additional $80 and that covers Shipping, paper work done by my FFL and the Sales Tax Washington State charges.

It works, but will need tuned to any rifle it's put on for obvious reasons. They are backordered a month on the website and these are going to outsell every other brand of kit out there for its ease of installation, compatibility, and simple parts scheme. They are coated for longevity and are made from better material in almost every way."

They are significantly heavier than a standard (stainless & alloy) Sig P220. That's why I bought them. I really like the extra weight.  Both come with two 8-round magazines. I am liquidating most of my firearms and ammo. I will not bypass the required laws.
