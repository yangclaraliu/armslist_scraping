It comes with two mags along with the factory hardcase and manual. I am mainly only looking to trade for a Kimber Warrior. Of course if I get a full cash offer that will enable me to buy the Warrior model I'll do that as well. I might entertain other trades that I'll list below but the Warrior is what I really want. Face to face transaction with an NC resident willing to show ID and CWP/PPP. I have my CWP for trades.

I decided to just post the rifle and optic separately in addition to the whole package Ad. I used the scope for .308 primarily and it has never let me down. I've also used it on one of my 5.56 rifle and as always, it's dead on. Vortex makes incredible and reliable products. I am actually sad to see it go but since it was my .308 scope i have replaced it with a new one that has x30 magnification because I've broken into serious long range shooting. The Viper can definitely acheive those shots but in adition to the greater magnification, i also wanted to try a different reticle. Everything is in immaculate condition as I always have my gear in cases and i don't just throw my high end equipment around. I like for my weapons and accessories to look nice and it also helps retain resell value. Some people don't understand that concept. ""Oh, man i paid $2000 for this optic and $8million in shipping. Even though i beat the crap out of it and the finish is messed up and there are dents in the side of it, i should still get at least what i paid for it!""

I have only fired about 100 rounds since I bought it used and have not had a single issue. This one is missing the box and only comes with one 7-round magazine. $1603. Taurus model 85 .38 Special +P. Stainless steel. Basically new, seriously, I bought it new ~2 weeks ago and have fired it less than 50 times. I paid $329+tax ($350 OtD), still have the reciept.  We bought this one so my girlfriend would have a gun she could control. She had difficulty reloading magazines, racking and recoil with the 9mm. The .38 needs no strength to rack or reload and, to her surprise, has a softer recoil than the 9mm... $260 Will give a deal for the whole lot.Thanks!"

Comes with Les Baer adjustable rear sight and dovetail front sight. The trigger is classic 1911, which is to say its light and crisp (I'd guess a bit less than 4lbs).Included with the pistol is everything else than came with it...box, 2 Les Baer magazines, factory cert and more. Additionally I'll throw in one unopened 8 round magazine (Chip McCormick, I believe).I got this a couple months ago and its just sat in the safe. Unfortunately, I need to finance some home projects, so sadly this will have to go. This gun is a work of art. If you appreciate 1911s then you need to add this to your collection!"

A little bit about the ar15.......The barrel is free floating with a radical arms moe round rail, the moe round rail will fit the magpul moe adapters, picatinny rail sections, and magpul moe attachments. The bolt carrier group was MPI Inspected and the bolt carrier group and barrel both were melonite treated. The barrel is also chambered as true 5.56 but will still fire 223 and has an m4 profile with m4 feed ramps. The lower is a low walled anderson and is mil-spec and it has a mil spec trigger group. The buffer tube is also mil spec. The rifle cycles well and the melonite treated parts will last a lifetime.
