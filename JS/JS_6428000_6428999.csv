Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Complete with Low-Mass TS Arms BCG, nickel boron coated gas key, round nickel boron cam pin, overpowered extractor spring, enhanced gas ring, tactical ambidextrous sling attachment end-plate, nickel boron coated trigger with overpowered hammer spring, oversized and polished feed ramps. The gas port has been drilled to 1/8"" and has an Anderson adjustable gas block underneath the 16"" keymod handrail. The heavy (accurate) barrel has a precision brake (very loud concussive blast with almost no felt recoil). It does come with the pictured optic and magazines. The extended charging handle makes charging a breeze. This gun has been run enough to get it cycling without hick-ups, which ultimately led to drilling out the gas port. Runs with standard carbine buffer and spring to cycle steel cased rounds, as well as brass. I probably have 120 rounds through this. The last 60 being a test of steel cased ammo. The greatest thing about this rifle is it has a Dolos system attached for rapid breakdown and reassembly. It fits easily inside of a backpack and much more efficient that the Law Tactical Folding Stock Adapter that doesn't give near the amount of length savings. If you're interested in 6.5 Grendel as well, I do have a 20"" Grendel barrel that I have been using with this same upper to double my effective range. I'd be willing to sell it for the right price. It is also Dolos-equiped for rapid breakdown and caliber change. This I will only offer as an option to the person that buys my 7.62. Just getting rid of my 7.62 because I have two 300 blackouts and reload my own ammo now."

We face uncertain days with new challenges thrust upon us like never before in the history of this country and the world. Not all challenges come from abroad. Civil unrest can cause a flash point where the only line between armed chaos and the average citizen is law enforcement. When this happens the individuals called upon need weapons that are reliable and effective. That's exactly what we had in mind when we introduced the GRP.
The GRP comes ready for duty and built to stand up to rigorous use that is required to keep professionals proficient in their skills. Tough and aggressive green Micarta grip panels are standard, as well as, a lanyard loop integrated into the mainspring housing. The forged slide stop axle is cut flush with the frame, and the frame is chamfered around it for easy removal. Heinie Tritium night sights are standard features.
The Global Response Pistol is a fighting gun, plain and simple, and is ready for duty wherever it is called upon to perform. If you are looking for a home or country defense weapon that meets your requirements, then the GRP is the ultimate solution."

The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With its 5 Inch Barrel, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game.  For this price the revolver also comes with a Kydex holster. This pistol is brand new, it has never been shot outside of the chiappa quality control department.I bought this for a cool gun to mess around with but have not had time to use it or take it to the range yet and probably won’t have time for a while. I only do Face to face transfers i will not ship this.

The coupling device itself consists of multiple ball bearings arrayed in a circular pattern which fit into sockets specifically machined into various muzzle devices to accept the QDC. The bearings are aligned with the sockets by way of a V-shaped notch that seats the device into an index pin. Once aligned, a simple twist of the outer retaining ring locks the device securely into place. This system was developed tp provide fast and easy operation and interoperability between weapons and suppressors. Knight's QDC line of sound suppressors all feature the QDC Fash Suppressors and the MAMS muzzle break, also feature the QDC pockets to accept sound suppressors equipped with this coupling device. Secure interoperability and intelligent, efficient design are the intended goals of this quick and easy technology."
