Fantastic builder, and has built thousands of fine rifles for people.As for the rifle- it is a metric pattern and takes metric mags, built on a century receiver. It is an STG clone sans the bipod- however, it does have grenade launcher mount and carry handle. The barrel is new, US made as per import rules and has a very low round count. My only reason for getting rid of this gun is the weight- it weighs 12 pounds unloaded. It will also come with one mag and a dummy grenade for grenade launching fun.As of right now I'm most interested in trades but would sell outright for the right price. As for trades- I'll take anything of equal or greater value, really. handguns, rifles, etc etc. Worst I can say is no! shoot me a text at 480-710-seven7zero7, or reply to this add to get in touch. Will not answer phone calls; thanks a ton!"

The 16"" barrel is FN made, Cold Hammer Forged, double chorme lined, 1/7 twist with the front M4 cutout, but unlike a standard Government M4 profile barrel, this on is thick under the handguards for better accuracy and to handle the heat better. The upper receiver is also FN made and Palmetto branded with the dry film lube inside and the M4 stamp on the front of the receiver above the gas tube like Colt and FN military contract M4's have. It has a bayonet lug and A2 flash hider. The bolt Carrier group is brand new Palmetto State Armory. The lower is an unfired Anderson build with CMMG milspec parts and a dual sling loop on the back. The handguard and buttstock are magpul. This will come with one 30 round PMag.

I just upgraded to new stones and want to provide an affordable sharpening service for most knives. I can comfortably sharpen most any knife up to about 12 inches blade length due to the size of my stones. Email me or text me with pictures and I will let you know what the cost will be. Generally I charge $10 for up to 4 inches $15 for 5-8 inches and $20 for blades from 9-12 inches but if the blade is severely damaged I will charge more because it takes an extra amount of time for me to get the bevel back to normal because I do all my work by hand. I don't use grinders or Sanders as it can ruin the heat treat on knives. If you have any questions feel free to ask.  REDACTED

The VP9 was developed by Heckler & Koch to meet the need for a safe, robust, ergonomically enhanced, striker fired handgun.
Easily identify whether the firing pin is in the cocked or uncocked mode. Quickly view the amount of ammunition present. With slide releases present on both sides of the frame and a magazine release on the rear, bottom portion of the trigger guard, VP9 controls are completely ambidextrous.
The VP9’s high strength polymer frame includes a unique ergonomic handgun grip design consisting of interchangeable grip panels and backstraps, as well as a dustcover with a standard Picatinny rail interface. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The barrel — made from canon grade steel — ensures long service life.  The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into the VP9’s polymer frame can mount a wide variety of lights, laser aimers, and other accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9 is well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products"

MOLLE/PALS webbing all along the front for attaching extra mag pouches, a 1L bottle carrier, admin pouches, or job-specific pouches (EOD/ Engineer/ TSE-CSO/ zipcuffs, whatever). The Side Pouches can accomodate a 6x8 hard plate each, or can be used for IFAKs, General Purpose items, lickes and chewies, etc. You can insert a 10x12 SAPI plate behind the chest rig to use the Rig as a Plate carrier. It was good for our platoon because when we weren't playing hide-n-seek, we were vehicle mounted and didn't need to move a whole heck of a lot so front-loading all of our weight wasn't a huge issue for only a couple of hours.However, when you need to downgrade weight, you can take the plate out, flip the upper half down into the kangaroo pocket, use the carrier as a rack, and only carry essentials (radio, 6x30rd mags, IFAK, GP items) and it worked very well for that purpose.Back Panel:The Back panel replaces the H-Harness for times when you need a back plate as well so you don't end up as a sad scene in Black Hawk Down II. It can carry a single 10x12 plate (I'd recommend a square plate if you have the option) or a 2L hydration system with a hook-and-loop fastener to hold the hydration bladder (not included- don't share bladders.) up and an ""eye hole"" to run your hose through.Price for the rig without plates is $150, and for the pair of Ar500 LvIII Curved ASC Plates is $300 total (rig and plates).I'll throw in the multicam Hydration carrier, (so you can run both a 3L bladder and your plates), a Multicam Tasmanian Tiger admin pouch, and a MOLLE/PALS ""skeletonized"" radio pouch.I used the Admin pouch for a month in the sticks, it worked really well for keeping my battery pack for my NODS, my Garmin eTrex 20, several MRE ""toilet tissues"" and wet wipes, and some chap stick (cracked lips suck.. plus Raspberry Lemonade is great).The radio pouch was never used, our platoon downsized right before the aforementioned exercise so I went from a Team Leader role to Ratelo. The pouch was a little too small for our HF radios but it can easily fit an MBITR or Harris PRC-152. It adjusts height, width, and depth for operators preference.Magazines are not included. (besides, you probably have some cool Pmags anyways) I've got some other stuff if you're interested (Kneepads, ""Battle Belt"", triple-stack mag pouches in black, combat shirts, and fore grips)Contact me at 21O tree52 O9tree9Or email me with ""Tasmanian Tiger"" in the subject line.Willing to ship for actual cost. Will consider trades for other plate carriers including Mayflower, Shellback Tactical, JPC, and LBT or a Haley D3CR Heavy in Multicam."

We don't have another .357, so that's why the ammo is on the cheap. If you want to mix-and-match the ammo, that's fine too. All ammo is in the original boxes.  But, you don't have to buy the ammo if you just want to buy the gun."

The gun has ameriglo fiber optic sights with red fiber optic front and black rear. Don't really want to sell but for $500 cash I will sell it that's what I paid for it not including the price of the sights so you would be saving money. Text or call me REDACTED
