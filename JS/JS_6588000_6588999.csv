It has a brand new engine put in back in December 2015 New engine and tranny have about 70 k miles on it. The body has 212 k miles.No rust and no deformation of any kind. The car hasn't been driven since January, it will need a wash, just heads up :)Posted are some neat pics of the car. The tint has been taken off due to bubbles. Tires are semi new and have 10k miles on them.New battery (November 2016) still under autoZone warranty Engine runs perfect. Smooth, no revving or misfiring, Check engine light was on since 2008.Code reads o2 sensor, not really worried about that as it doesn't effect the vehicles driving or running capabilities. Wheel alignment done. No shakes and no wheel pulling to any side. Lots of service performed on this car in the last 2 y. New radiator. Breaks have less than 5 k miles on them. Pretty much standard stuff that goes bad with age. Hoses, cables, spark plugs all got replaced when the new engine was put in. Now the bad; back bumper has a tiny crack in it circa 4 inches. Someone backed up into me at my apartment complex... ""The heat doesn't work as my friend broke the heater core connection when his shop replaced my engine (didn't charge for labor but refused to fix the core as it's time consuming by their standard) about a 300 dollar fix, easy to replace if you have the time and are handy, it is time CONSUMING. The vehicle is in great mechanical condition, no leaks nor whistles shakes or strange noises. Oil change performed 3/3/2017 and 2 back tires mounted. (At firestone) I have purchase a new vehicle and the Milage won't go up. I am an honest person and wouldn't want to say that this vehicle is perfect, it would be if the heat worked, this car runs perfect and has lots of life left in it. It got me trough college and a couple of jobs. It does not make any noises, or shakes, it starts at first crank. If interested make an offer via text. The vehicle is available for viewing on appointment. I am located near campus on southern parkway/3rd street... I am a medical student and don't have much time for showings so please let me know ahead of time. Thanks please don't call with offers to help to sell the vehicle. Also I am not interested in taking partial payments or payment arrangement as well. I just don't have time for that as I'm way too busy. Sorry if that offended anyone.I have added the pic of the crack in the bumper. You are more than welcome to have a mechanic check the car out. God bless.Text 502430288 ONe,   no calls.

I’ve read up on it extensively and it fires both subsonic and supersonic rounds with or without a suppressor without cycling issues.  I shoot left-handed and had no trouble with the direction of brass ejection. This rifle was designed to shoot both 300 AAC Blackout and 300 Whisper loads.Includes everything that came with the rifle:2 magazines; Picatinny rail; scope rings, manual, original box, locking device, etc.And also:1 Brand New TAPCO Mini-14 Gen II 30 Round Magazine Model # MAG4830B.  I have not used this mag or one like it in this rifle and since not all 3rd party mags feed well with all guns they fit, I can't guarantee this mag will feed well.Not familiar with 300 Blackout caliber? It is the fastest growing caliber on the market. Unless your target is 250+ yards away, it is far superior to the 5.56/.223 in many ways. Think of it as a 7.62/.308 bullet in a 5.56/.223 case (hits MUCH harder) with powder that fully burns in a 16 inch barrel unlike a 7.62/.308 or 5.56/.223.  If you want to know more about the 300 Blackout, message me and I'll reply with some links or just google it yourself.Optional:ATI Strikeforce Adjustable Side-Folding TactLite Stock for Mini14/30, Destroyer Gray, 6 position stock, Side-folds, lots of rails, etc., Like New Condition - $80.

I bought the set with the Bad-Ass 50 degree short throw ambi safety selector installed, milspec dust cover, milspec forward assist, and the Bad EPS pin set that is higher tolerances than milspec and more user friendly. The lower is full ambi and has a wide flared magwell that measures 1 3/8"" for quick mag changes. The lower has ridges milled into front of magwell for grip and the full lower is one of the most ergonomic on the market. The upper fits to the lower like a glove and has no wiggle or play and is by fair one of the highest quality upper/lower sets on the market though SanTan Tactical isn't a common name though it is for those looking for a full ambi billet lower and upper. I have built a mactched SanTan upper/lower and it shoots 1/2"" moa easily built with milspec parts and a Faxon barrel. Google San Tan Tactical for info and be shocked at the American made quality in AZ. It is very high quality set for a precision ar build. My number is REDACTED. Email me for more pictures of the set and thanks for looking, below is SanTan description of the set.The STT-15 is not just another AR-15 \ M4, it is your final answer. As south paw shooters ourselves, we understand the struggle you face. The STT-15 has been born out of necessity for a truly 100% ambidextrous rifle.Prior to the development of the STT-15 the only option for left-handed (South Paw) shooters was to either adapt to a right handed platform or purchase costly add-on accessories. It has always been difficult and frustrating to try and find the right combination of accessories to allow the weapon to be manipulated accurately, quickly, and correctly. Even with hundreds of dollars in additions the fit and feel of the rifle was never quite right. When STT designed this receiver we wanted it to not only accommodate left handed shooters, but to accommodate right handed operators equally as well.The answer was obvious; we needed an AR platform that would meld its operation to every shooter no matter the situation or demands and without the addition of hundreds of dollars in additional accessories. This firearm had to be 100% out of the box. No shortcomings or additional equipment would be acceptable. STT put countless hours into combining a set of features that not only achieved those requirements, but worked with the plethora of magazines, upper receivers, Mil-Spec components and, aftermarket parts available today.San Tan Tactical will never compromise on the goal of 100% ambidextrous operation for less features or faster production, cheaper materials. The STT-15 takes over twice as long to manufacture as a standard mil-spec receiver. We only use the strongest American raw material to create your new rifle!The STT-15 begins as a billet of 7075-T651 aerospace grade aluminum. This gave us the blank canvas we needed to create the ultimate lower receiver. Thru the use of modern 3D CAD systems we were able to model in all of the features that had to be incorporated into this lower. This was quite the undertaking as to modify or change a rifle that is proven reliable thru years of service and has the support that this rifle has. We had to be very careful not to interfere with the current platforms design.With the STT-15 you can attach a Single point sling on either side of the receiver thanks to the dual integral QD sling attachment points. No more knotted up slings here. There are anti-rotation stops every 45 degrees so you choose where you want your sling, not gravity.We incorporated both an ambidextrous magazine release and an ambidextrous bolt release. These two features allow you to change magazines or malfunction clearing with either hand. The parts required to make this operation possible are some of the most critical in your rifle. Staying true to STT’s no compromise style, thebolt batch and release arm as well as the magazine catch and release arm are made from A-2 Tool Steel. The same material your bolt carrier is made from!The next item on the list to be enhanced was the texture of the grip surfaces on the controls. Since the small parts would be CNC machined directly from one piece of A-2 tool steel the standard texture would not be sufficient. For shooters wearing gloves it is often difficult to retain dexterity and non-slip grip on the controls. We designed a beehive honeycomb texture that will allow you to accurately operate your rifle in all conditions with positive control. On top of greatly improving the operators control it also looks great!On the right side of the lower you will notice a shooter ready finger rest. With the ambidextrous magazine release it provides the southpaw shooters a great place to safely rest their finger. We couldn’t leave out the right handed operators, so we made a rest for them as well. No matter how you hold this rifle you will find there is a place for everything and ergonomics were not forgotten regardless of your style!To top it off, STT created the platforms widest magazine well flare. This flare is over 1.38 inches wide! We took the flair out as far as we could while still being able to accommodate all magazines including the large drum magazines & Surefire high capacity magazines. The huge width of the flare allows high speed and high stress mag changes with ease!San Tan Tactical developed this no compromise, lower to accommodate any situation, handing, or shooting style. All while staying true to the original Stoner platform. The STT-15 is the 21st century version of America’s perfect weapons system!"

This unit was stationed in an armory at FT Bragg, NC. The US ARMY used this unit for securing Rifles, Pistols, NVGs, Optics, and Ammunition Cans. It comes with a rifle rack with supports that can be moved around for different firearms heights as shown in the pictures below.All SpaceSaver Corp UWR units meet both OPNAVINST 5530.13C and AR190-11 security requirements. I have versions of this unit in my very own gun room. This unit is fully welded and measures 45""x42""x16"". Cabinet can be ganged from the top, bottom, sides, or rear of other cabinets. It has bi-fold retractable doors that prevent blocking aisles or neighboring racks and maximizes efficiency of the issuance of weapons and gear. The secure construction incorporates perforated doors sides and cabinet back to ensure visibility of items inside at all times. Great for doing inventory checks. Retractable locking bars exceed military requirements for arms security of conventional arms, ammunitions and explosives. All accessories that come into contact with the weapons are either powder-coated, vinyl dipped, rubber or thermoplastic-coated, or made from polymers to ensure that weapons are safe from damage in transportation.This unit was part of a auction that I drove down to FT Bragg to pick up. I had a few of these last year and they were very popular. I have 7 similar UWRs as well as a 61"" tall unit with a shelving combo listed on this very website as well as armslist and craigslist. There are minor scratches from being moved around in an armory but as you can tell from the pictures below they aren't noticeable and the units are in excellent shape. No dents, dings or broken parts. Completely operational. The US Army manifest states that this cabinet was over 1 thousand dollars brand new, I will include manifest in sale. If you are interested in adding support racks or shelving units SpaceSaver Corp can sell those items directly to you. I am listing this UWR for $150. This cabinet is also going to come with another cabinet for free. The free cabinet only has one door which is why you aren't being charged for it. As you can see from the pictures below I used the second cabinet as storage for my ammo cans. I travel quite often so I will include free delivery 50 miles within 23462.
