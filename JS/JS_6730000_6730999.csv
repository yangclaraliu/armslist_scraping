Why trade the mustang for the exact same gun? Well in my eyes it's more of a collectors item, more of a conversation piece. I want something else for my CCW, and I don't have the money to spend on another gun, so that's why I'm trading this.List of parts I added:C&S trigger, C&S extended safety, C&S stainless sear, stainless guide rod, wolff springs, and some english walnut grips from grips4u.net.Gun also comes with an extra government 380 slide. I added a full length guide rod and replaced the guide rod spring with a wolff spring.Gun works perfect with both slides. I've shot about 100 rounds with each slide after the upgrades. I'm not sure of the round count before me. I don't have the hard case only a soft carry case. Comes with the original Colt 5 round magazine, another stainless Colt 5 round magazine, and a Colt 7 round magazine. I have all the original parts including the grips. The trigger was broken so that's why it was replaced.So here's how I want to do the trade.If you want to trade for a p938, I'll do an even trade with everything mentioned, each of us pays our fees.If you want to trade for a sig p238 hd (offroster model only) then I won't include the government 380 slide and each of us pays our own fees.Please no negative comments.

Believe it or not with a hand load I worked up, with some 140 grain Nosler ballistic tips, I was able to achieve .440 of an inch average 3 shot groups at 100 yards. Your results may vary, depending on what Ammo you use. I have a ton of 270 ammo I can include for some extra cash. $350 for this gun is a steal, especially when the original Axis goes for that price without the trigger. Comes with manual, paperwork, etc as I am the original owner. If interested call or text me at 9 three 7 four 7 zero 9 two 4 five. Only reason I am selling is I am moving next month and selling some rifles to fund the move."

I don't know the history of this gun but the gun shop claims that this pistol is new but I don't know for sure although it looks in excellent condition. It is a solid pistol with some weight to it and feels great in the hand. It seems that at one point the sights were removed because the rear sight appears to have a ding on it and they are finished in stainless. Comes with one magazine and some paperwork, and the case.

The only reason I'm selling it is because my wife bought me an identical rig in Gray and I don't need two of them! This rig is 100% setup ready for use. Read the reviews below the list of included items!Contents of this sale are below: - Spiritus Systems MK 2 Chest Rig ($69.95) - Fat Strap ($39.95) - Back Strap ($9.95) - Sub-Abdominal Carrying Kit (detachable if you don't want to use it for whatever reason) ($49.95) - 3 Loop Pouch Insert in S.A.C.K.

Period.Through my business in the firearms industry I get to handle a lot of nylon gear (Chest rigs, belts, pouches, plate carriers, etc.) and the Micro Fight is one of the best nylon products to spend your hard earned money on. The Micro Fight Rig is just such a simple well thought out design. The endless modularity and load out options are really quite incredible for how small it is. The craftsmanship takes the design into the hall of fame in my opinion. If your a serious shooter, LEO, and/or Mil I would highly recommend this piece of kit. -Ben Wise Men CompanyReview of Micro Chest RigI'll just review the whole rig. Considering I bought all of the Spiritus. I love the simplicity and ease of the system. Great rig and amazingly versatile.Quality Product That Offers Lots of FlexibilityI wanted a chestrig that I could reconfigure depending on what I'm doing and what I want to carry. The short answer is this does exactly what I wanted it to, and I'm very impressed. I bought the Micro fight with the straps and a few of the inserts. This chest rig allows me to carry 3 AR mags, 2 Glock mags, and still has room for my Glock 19, or my rangefinder, or whatever else I decide to carry. I like that I can easily switch things around and carry everything I need for my coyote hunts in a quiet and convenient way too, even though the rig wasn't necessarily designed for that. But that's why I love this rig so much. It allows me control to add or take away from my loadout, and reconfigure it as I please. I was a little uncertain of how well the mags would be retained, but after I've used it, I am not worried about mags accidentally coming loose. My initial impressions of the quality are good. It seems durable and it's very lightweight. As for comfort, carrying weight around is never comfortable, but I don't see any way this rig can be improved in that area. It's as comfortable as I can imagine a chest rig can be. I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants the flexibility to configure their loadout in an assortment of diffferent ways, or anyone looking for a simple and effective way to carry your gear. Also worth noting, my experience with their customer service has been very good. my questions were answered very promptly through direct message on Instagram, and my order was processed and shipped within an hour or two of when I submitted payment."

(About 70 hrs of work) Ive swapped all springs for Wilson Springs, polished the FCG, Polished the rails, Polished the barrel, Polished the feed ramp, Polished the sear and disconnector, and polished the trigger bars. Custom Cocobolo grips, Wilson 47D mag, Stock ACT mag,  a Full size guide rod, a GI style guide rod, and all kinds of extra parts and grips to go with it. This is a very well built, well functioning weapon. No rattles, and an excellent frame to slide fit. This is basically a brand new gun, so no low ball offers please. Ive tested this gun with every type of .45 acp ammo i can get my hands on, and it will run every type of ammo i can feed it, except for some hollow point reloads i bought at a gun show. Comes with hard case, extra mag, and extra bag of miscellaneous 1911 stuff. Has the 18lb Wilson recoil spring in it now, but have the stock 12 lb spring also, with a blue shok-buff on the guide rod, and comes with extras as well.I have all of the stock parts, grips, and springs that go with it also. Alot of people seem to bash Metro Arms, but the truth is that they use 1 gunsmith per pistol. This process allows for accountability, and attention to detail while focusing on only that one pistol until it is complete. Metros customer service is probably the best customer service out of any gun manufacturer that ive ever dealt with.Better than glock, springfield, sig, colt, without a doubt. Ive had them send me replacement parts just because, and ive got a brand new front sight in the mail, just because they dont have any replacement fiberoptic rods available. I wanted to have extra for when the time came to change the rod in the front sight. They reply to email inquiries in less than an hour, and have the parts in transit the same day. The lifetime warranty is transferrable as well and they pay all shipping costs to and from their facilities."
