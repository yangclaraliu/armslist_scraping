In 1985, Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois first offered newly manufactured 1911s to the gun buying public. The next 28 years firmly established Springfield Armory® as the leading manufacturer of 1911s – and the standard by which all other 1911s are judged today. 102 years and untold billions of rounds of .45ACP after its introduction, American shooters, law enforcement and elite military units the world over still rely on the immortal 1911 to get the job done. Whether you’re a prospective first-time 1911 owner or a discriminating collector, you’ve come to the right place. Features, quality and proven performance are all reasons to check out a Springfield 1911 today. Forged frames and slides, lightweight titanium firing pins and lowered and flared ejection ports are standard on all our 1911s. Match grade barrels, target tuned triggers, ambidextrous extended thumb safeties, beavertail grip safeties and Lightweight Delta™ hammers are just a few of the other options available. Whatever you need in a 1911, Springfield Armory® offers it. If you’re in the market for the most revered and time-honored semi-auto handgun ever designed, go with the industry standard and pick up a 1911 made by Springfield Armory® The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

The stock is a CMP-stamped repro.The sights have been replaced with Lyman aperture sights. The sights were installed with a slight cant. Because of the cant, it's necessary to flip the factory rear sight up and into the ladder position or down and rearward to get it out of the way, or else it blocks your sight picture. That said, the Lyman sights are perfectly aligned with each other, and the only real use this rifle has seen after being surplused was taking a mule deer in Colorado at 230 yards.

A hard hitting .17 caliber rim far cartridge that has been necked down from .22 WMR, .17 HMR is the perfect varmint cartridge. Fast, and very flat shooting.
This rifle is about 2 years old. I’ve put a lot of ammo through it, but I cannot say for sure how much. Maybe 500 rounds total.
It does have a crack in the stock. It came from the factory like this and I never got around to sending it back. The action it’s self is great. Solid even. Mossberg should be able to replace the stock, like I said, I just never got around to it. I have photos from when it was first new with that crack as well.
It comes equipped with a BSA Sweet .17 3-12×40 adjustable power scope. I have it zeroed at 50 yards.
I also have a spare 5 round magazine for it as well."

663,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6751663,For Sale:  Night vision Rifle Scope with AR upper,"White Sulphur Springs, Montana, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, April 24, 2017",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here is a hardly used Sightmark Photon XT night vision scope with its dedicated AR Upper. The SightMark Photon XT 6.5x50L Digital Night Vision Riflescope has a camera resolution of 656x492 pixels and features a CMOS sensor, giving you an enhanced view of your target. This riflescope offers a 6.5x magnification coupled with a 50 mm objective lens that provides a detailed and vivid view, at a distance of up to 200 yards. Using its video output jack, you can attach an external recording device to it and capture your adventures for the day. It offers six digital reticle options in green, white and red, so you can use this riflescope for long-distance targets. For added convenience, it lets you adjust the windage and elevation levels.  I have the original box, case and manual for it. As I said this is barely used and when I checked it still works fine. The AR upper is made by DTI and is a 1/9 ratio. Has the BCG included. I included a pull loop that attaches to the charging handle. This makes it a ton easier to charge the rifle while this scope on it. Will also include the scope mounts by NC Star. Scope is already mounted, unfortunately I lost the little hex tool used to mount the scope so if you wish to remove the scope or tighten/loosen from the scope rings  you will have to get one, but they are easy to find. My idea was to have an AR upper with a regular scope for day time, and then at night swap the upper out with this configuration on the same Lower. Although this scope does have daytime capability. I have never used this scope in actual hunting. I installed it and fired maybe a handful of rounds through it to sight but its been sitting in my closet for 2 years and ultimately I really do not think I will ever use it. But great for coyotes or other night critters especially with the .223/5.56 upper. I live in White sulphur springs. Its possible, especially if you are seriously interested, I can meet in Helena or Bozeman or halfway. I only get out of town abut twice a month but let me know, maybe we can arrange something. $700 cash, silver, or gold bullion for the whole package that includes the scope and the AR upper and BCG."

I took it to a local gunbroker he gave it a 8 out of ten for conditioning, but there super picky. There are a few small nics on the handle hardly noticable, and then a few scraps on the metal portion of the butt of the gun, and under the trigger. The broker offered 750 I need to get more.

For sale I have a Ruger 10/22 that has an aftermarket tapco stock installed. Several years ago Ruger had a deal where they were selling their 10/22 rifles with an aftermarket Tapco Stock. It's got an AR styled adjustable stock, flip up iron sights, a base for adding a red dot/scope etc., a picatinny rail section underneath for adding a laser, light, foregrip or whatever, and a pistol grip. It's the 3rd firearm from the top in the picture I can send more also as needed. THIS IS FOR SALE ONLY FACE TO FACE IN WISCONSIN, NO SHIPPING OUT OF STATE
 
This is a nice little rifle for someone who wants to try to teach their younger children how to shoot since the adjustable stock can be moved in pretty dang close to the actual rifle. Also, it could be a cheaper way to practice marksmanship lessons etc. 
 
I bought it around 5 years ago on a closeout sale in case I had children but that never happened and I have a couple of other .22 rifles now. Asking for $300 even for the rifle, 25 round magazine, and a soft case that came with it. Phone # (2six2) 95one-8one78"

Superformance uses ultra progressive propellants that take your favorite SST or GMX bullets to levels of performance simply unattainable with conventional propellants. In order to get more velocity in the past shooters have used a brute force approach with large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case which ultimately leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution utilizes specialized powders at normal charge weights that impart all usable energy to the bullet reducing the rocket nozzle effect at the muzzle while still increasing velocity. Superformance is safe to use in all firearms including semi-autos lever gun and pump actions. Increases in rifle performance no increases in barrel wear and felt recoil along with superior temperature stability are all realized with Superformance ammunition.
