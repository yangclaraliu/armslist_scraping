The 17 HMR barrel has less then 20 rounds through it and the 22 mag barrel has never on the gun (brand new) 3 clips come with the rifle along with cleaning snake and paperwork. The scope on the rifle is a Kahles 3x9 power and I think the rings are either Vortex or Burris. Three screws on each side of each ring. Price is $1750. as pictured or $1550 for the rifle with both barrels and accessories. I prefer FTF with a MT resident that can prove residency (drivers lic) or will ship for shipping cost plus $50. for my FFL dealer. Volquartsen was not on mfgr. list on here so I just used the first one as you have to fill something in the blank so just ignore that. Also you can only put one caliber. Look at Volquartsens web site to see complete description of the rifle and their price to see this is a great buy. I am selling it to get funds for a custom I am going to have built.

These are not made anymore, and are hard to come by. Factory plastic stock has been replaced by a wood Savage factory short action stock and has had the action pillar bedded and glassed, including the popular 3rd pillar conversion. This conversion is desired by many who seriously shoot a Savage Smokeless Muzzleloader because it allows removal of the breech plug without losing zero. The wooden stock was not modified to have the ramrod held in it, preferring to keep the forend stiffer, and carry the ramrod separately like many of the long-range shooters of smokeless muzzleloaders. The breech plug removal tools are included, and I will also provide the original factory plastic stock and the ramrod thimble in the event you want to return it to the factory setup. The wooden stock is in really good condition, with only a few minor dings. The metal is in terrific condition with little to no wear on the bluing. To increase accuracy, the original QLA (quick-load assist) was removed from the end of the barrel, and the barrel re-crowned. Two index marks were also added on the crown so that the sabots could be indexed to the rifling. The muzzleloader consistently shot 1"" groups, at 2250 fps, with a Hornady 250SST, using a Savage recommended load. I am also including a ramrod carrying pouch. If you want to learn more about the Savage Smokeless Muzzleloader, look up ""Doug's Message Boards"" and find the Savage/Smokeless Muzzleloading section. Will ship. Will consider trades, especially for S&W 629 44 mag with 4"" bbl."

I simply have it listed as Auto Ord. because there is no other applicable option.***The rifle is a reassembled WWII Inland receiver with a 1945 IBM barrel assembly. I have restored it to WWII configuration by replacing the selector switch, rear sight, barrel band, and front sight to early war styles. The rifle appears to be an original WWII which was re-arsenaled. Additionally, I have also swapped the stocks for a Sarco Inc M1A1 Paratrooper stock. I have only used the rifle for WWII reenacting, so there are minor dents in the wood as well as regular wear on the metal itself, all visible in here:http://imgur.com/gallery/zxwbcThe bore is slightly worn, and almost entirely devoid of pitting (there is a very, very small amount just inside the muzzle). The rest of the rifle is in very good condition with no other rust or pitting to speak of. I have found the rifle can be tempermental with certain ammunition, especially steel cased ammo.
