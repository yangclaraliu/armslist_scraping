On the first magazine out of the box I loaded a random assortment of 6 different 55 to 62 grain 5.56 and .223.  I never doubted that every round would cycle perfectly and of course I was not disappointed.  Every round since has cyled perfectly and with basic care and maintainence the same can be true when your child passes it to your grandchild.  Would be sad to sell it except that it's for a worthy cause.  I hope you will love her like I do :)"

I will consider trades but its not my main motivation. This gun has been owned by me for 7 years and I am the original owner. I took it out a half dozen times for the kids to shoot and now they are all grown up. I would like to get some of my money back and put it towards something I would be happier using.

NP3 finish alone was $200.  **NO TRADES**  More info on the finish:  ""NP3 is an Electroless Nickel/PTFE coating that combines sub-micron particles of Teflon with Electroless Nickel. Skipping all of the technical jargon, the simplest explanation is that it is a dry lubricated, low friction surface that is extremely hard and resistant to wear. The plating is used in a wide variety of industries including cryogenic atmospheres to high temperature applications. NP3 has been accredited for aerospace use which is the ultimate testament to its usefulness and durability.  Robar boasts that NP3 increases firearm reliability because it requires little to no oil for lubrication. Its high lubricity and low friction coefficient reduces wear and increases life expectancy of plated parts. NP3 is very corrosion resistant, exceeding a 250-hour salt spray test. Robar backs up its claims with a lifetime guarantee against corrosion and peeling.""Read more: http://www.handgunsmag.com/gunsmithing/robar-np3-plating-review/#ixzz4NsfrcOAE"

I purchased it brand new a few months ago and have only taken it to the range 3 times. It has only 270-300 rounds through it, ie, I put maybe 9 or 10 mags through it, and that's all. The gun functions flawlessly, it looks brand new with barely a single scratch or smudge, and it shot anything I put through it without a single jam or FTF or FTE. It produces average 5 shot groups around 1.0 - 1.5 inches at 100 yards when scoped, and could probably do a bit better with a proper load work-up, as I was just using factory ammo. I have the Geissele SuperSCAR 2-stage trigger already installed, which breaks very nicely at around 4 pounds. I'm selling this gem simply because as cool as it is, and as flawless as it is for what it is, this is just not my type of thing... In terms of rifle shooting I'm really just an old school benchrest guy, but had thought I would try my hand at AR style shooting for the first time ever. And so I picked this up a few months ago to give it a whirl. But once a precision shooter, always a precision shooter...it just kinda hurts my eyes to look at paper groups bigger than 1/4 inch at 100 yards. I guess you gotta know who you are in life and stick with it: So when the zombie apocalypse comes, I'll be best utilized by my tribe standing off at distance, methodically taking out targets with my high-precision rigs :) ... others will be better utilized for the CQB spray and pray type of work. :) We gotta be who we are :) The gun will come with the Geissele trigger already installed, and the attached UTG bipod I'll just throw in."

The sight is the only thing in this package that is used.Perhaps i might be interested in a multi-gun trade or a firearm plus cash. PLEASE NO: shotguns, 22 rifles, OR bolt-action rifles.Mainly looking for cash though. Again my price is $3,100 no low-balling.
