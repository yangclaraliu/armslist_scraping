In 1947 only 120,000 rifles were made, and all production by Izhvesk stopped after 1948. All numbers are matching. The stock is a transitional stock which is why it's light in color.

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. Features:  Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Extended slide release Patented Lock-Out Safety device  Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax."

This was originally marketed as the ""Tactical Rapid Deployment"" version. It does have some weight saving because the handguard is cut shorter. A great rifle, zero problems with it. Chews through every ammo I've ever thrown at it.
With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light weight carbine, or a longer marksman’s rifle.
The XCR-L’s quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability.  Barrel and caliber changes can be made in less than 5 minutes.
XCR-L incorporates heavy duty components such as a sturdy oprod, a beefy three-lug bolt, a locking extractor, and a fixed ejector. These elements and others ensure reliable performance with minimal maintenance.Approximately 500 rounds down the pipeBattleComp 2.0 InstalledMagpul K Grip"

It comes with an 18.5 inch security barrel (rarely used) and 28 inch vent rib field barrel (shooting clays etc.) with a modified choke. Always cleaned after range visits and left with a light coat of oil on the firearm to prevent any rusting at all. It is in great condition. Never had one jam or hangup. Works flawless... Mossberg. There is some loss of bluing on the magazine tube from the forend moving on it (something normal that you cannot prevent) and a little loss of bluing near the ejection port form shells flying out (can be fixed with a bluing pen). Great for home defense or simply some range fun. Any questions just shoot me a message. I respond quickly. I will only sell with a legal FFL transaction at either Turners of Reseda or The Target Range of Van Nuys. Buyer Pays transfer fees etc.

If you have a rifle, I'm primarily looking for semi autos, but will consider bolt guns for the right price.Prices: standard dpms/low end ar15 with no extras: $400 since new ones are $450.Ak platforms: $500 for a wasr, not really interested in other variants unless it is priced well.10/22s: since I can buy a base model for $157 currently (look it up on slickguns.com) I will buy base model 10/22s for $140. With a threaded barrel, $200 with a threaded takedown, $300.

Would like to trade for firearms i would use more often.... I'm open to trade plus cash or even multiple firearms.  I have roughly $1700 in this rifle, plus ammo.  I know I wont get close to that back out of it but please be realistic with trades.  Thanks"

Never fired. Comes with rail on top for scope or red dot sight and Hogue grips. Threaded barrel for suppressor if you think you might want to go that route. Comes with original grips also. Also comes with original box and everything from the factory. Thanks.
