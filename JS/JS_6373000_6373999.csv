Please contract me via text/phone at REDACTED if you like any more photos or if you have questions.Description from Springfield: The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 3.8” Full-Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package.The XD(M)® 3.8″ Full-Size mates a 3.8″ barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision."

I have not shot it since I bought it 5 years ago, I bought it purely as a collector. There are no import marks whatsoever. I'm suspicious that this gun may have been an American capture because the matching bolt and the matching gun are characteristic of the the surrender process in the American front.

The Daniel Defense 16” 300 Blackout S2W® barrel is designed with a strength to weight profile (Daniel Defense's Heavy Barrel), a 1:8"" twist rate, and a Carbine-Length gas system.
Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible.
The Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 is a 12"" CNC Machined Modular Free Float Handguard. It is specifically designed to adequately cover a low profile gas block on a carbine or mid-length gas system barrel. The MFR 12.0 has been engineered to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run ""slick"" with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don't. The slim profile of the MFR 12.0 keeps the shooter's support hand close to the bore which aids in firearm manipulation, and the design and construction allow for the attachment of Picatinny Rail Sections at standard 90 degree or offset angles."

The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it.
Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance.
Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory®’s SAINT™ represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT™.

The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it.
Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance.
Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory®’s SAINT™ represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT™.

This is a brand new, unfired Zastava M-85 ""Mini Mauser"" carbine, in 7.62 x 39. Has very decent iron sights, and a nicely figured, oil finished walnut stock. The carbine is equipped with a Nikon Prostaff, 2-7 x 32 matte finished scope with a duplex reticle. I emphasized brand new and unfired because it is - I bought i several years ago but have never been able to take her out to the range. As a bonus, the rifle will come with 60 rounds of Lapua, brass cased, boxer primed ammunition, with 123 grain fmj bullets. The rifle cost me $436, the scope $149, and the ammo is $44.95 from Midway for a 30 round box, or $1.50 per round. This totals out to $675, which doesn't include scope bases, mounts or tax. Well over $700, when all is done. This is a very hard to find little rifle, and is a real bargain compared to its competitors from Cz and Howa. Wikipedia has a good article on Zastava Arms, tracing its history back over a hundred years. Not well known here by its own name, in the past companies like Charles Daly and Remington have imported its products under their own brand names. Well made, attractive, priced to sell. Asking $475.00, sale only, please, no trades. Thanks for looking........"

Shoots great and definitely has some trigger work done to it. I got it this way so I don't know what has been done to it. It just feels great, that I can tell you.  Please contact me with any questions. Transaction will be cash and in person only. And buyer needs a valid CWP.

I assumed we would meet in person after I left work, then suddenly, (even tho we lived 10 mins or less apart), he suggested I go to ""my"" FFL (btw, don't have a personal FFL) and then ""my"" FFL, was to phone ""his""FFL #2, and FFL#2 would relay to this buyer the description. Now, in my ad, I asked ONLY for PTC/PTP, and infact I sold my old off duty S&W649 the night before, using these terms, took 10 mins. Totally painless, and to a legit buyer. This guy threatened to flag my ad, even as I tried to understand why he doesn't just meet me, look at the revolver, and then buy or not, I couldn't care less. Why would I seek some unknown FFL to speak with his FFL, then to him, when we are both local and minutes apart. Crazy set of emails. Anyway, this is a legit ad, and if anyone reasonable would like to see it, meet me at my local Police Department or anywhere reasonable, let me know. I'm all ears.

$595 or BEST OFFER!!!
As you can see, I have the Recover grips installed (so I could mount the laser) but the pistol also comes with the factory VZ grips for a more traditional look.  The slide has been polished and has a brushed finish. NICE fiber optic sights! Polished and super slick adjustable trigger (also come with spare Wilson Combat trigger) 3 magazines, and the factory and extended flash compensator (shown)
Also comes with a rigid holster and double mag holder.
I bought this specifically for IDPA competition but never have time to go... 9mm in a 1911 frame shoots unbelievably soft and super fast!!!
I've shot this less than 200 rounds... had a couple of feed issues early on with cheap (Perfecta) ammo but it runs like a champ on everything else I've tried.
Stunning gun for not much money... you won't be sorry"
