The entire gun is in mint condition, and would rate a solid 95%. I would rate it 100%, but I've shot about 100 rounds in it, and there is a small chip in the wood's paint, about 1/4” long by 1/8” wide, on the edge of the stock immediately below the stock, which I touched up with stain. I am the original owner and the gun has been a safe queen since I bought it. The rifle has a folding style blade bayonet and has a cleaning kit in the stock. The gun has matching numbers on all metal components and on the stock. The magazine holds 10 rounds. The gun shoots great, and is ready to take to the range. See the pictures as they are part of this sale's description. More detailed photos can be taken on request. Shipping is $35.00 to the lower 48 United States via FEDEX, except California and New York. Absolutely no sales to those states. It must ship to an FFL. If your FFL requires that it be sent from an FFL, this is not a BATF requirement, so add another $35 to the shipping cost.

The PX4 Compact was a natural choice as the base of this project because of its rotary barrel design, ammo capacity and smooth trigger pull. Incorporating the stealth levers, night sights, and a lightened trigger pull makes this flat shooting pistol an ideal concealed carry gun. Though it is completely concealable, the Compact offers a full grip for most shooters. The Compact offers full 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm), an accessory rail, low-profile slide stop, new integral and retractable lanyard loop, and a cold hammer forged barrel for ultimate precision.*****SHIPPING $25*****

Some of the premium parts installed in this gun are a Kaw Valley Precision heavy pistol buffer, enhanced recoil spring, and Linear Compensator; a PSA enhanced nickel coated trigger, and full Magpul furniture. This gun is set up for home defense with a mounted weapon light, red dot sight, and back-up iron sights. I'm also including a standard two point sling and a Troy single point sling with quick detach mount attachement depending on your preference. This gun is perfect for anyone who already owns a Glock pistol since the magazines work across both platforms. Shoots extremely smooth/soft and is essentially brand new with less than 100 rounds down the barrel. Great shooting PDW, and with a similar recoil to a .223/5.56 AR it makes for cheap training. Total cost of all the parts to put this gun together came to $849.Asking $700 . I can also take a combination of cash and ammo, 223/556, to help supplement.For an example of what this gun can do, albeit with different furniture, take a look at this YouTube review. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkpBAvzPnmE"

Serial #732 of 1915 Guns made.   In Metal Ammo can box with every bit of paperwork. The slide has been racked once by me to assure clear when I got it new.   This fine pistol is unfired and unmolested!   This single-action-only steel 92 has a frame-mounted safety and has the years 1915 and 2015 engraved in Roman numerals on either side of the Brigadier-style slide. The same numerals are featured around the medallion logo in the center of the premium-wood grip panels. The pistol, magazines, cleaning rod, and safety lock are contained in an ammo-can-style Beretta box, which also sports the anniversary dates. The Original Beretta 1915 Only a month after Italy entered the First World War on the side of the allies, Beretta patented the Model 1915, which was immediately adopted by the Italian military.     Chambered in 9mm Glisenti, a rather mild counterpart of the 9mm Parabellum on which it was actually based, the Model 1915 single-action semiauto featured a cutaway on the slide and a minimally-protruding barrel—two features that would become a hallmark of Beretta pistols in years to come. Curiously, it also had two safety devices: one frame-mounted in the rear (similar to the one we have “copied” for the 92 Centennial), the other located above the trigger. The 92 Centennial tastefully imitates some of these features while also showcasing the very best of what Beretta has achieved in the intervening century.   Must Ship to an FFL, I am not an FFL, so they must take shipments from Non-FFLs or buyer must pay the extra $30 for my FFL to ship Thanks for looking!

Buy It Now!!   The Beretta 87 Target is a practical-shooting competition pistol that is ready to go out of the box. All a competitor would have to do (if desired) is to mount the optics of his choice, which can be done quickly and easily thanks to the built-in Weaver-style rail. The 87 Target can be also used as a great training pistol, since its controls are quite similar in locatio and feel to those of Beretta’s famed 92 Series.   As Beretta’s flagship target pistol, the 87 Target has to satisfy some very stringent accuracy requirements. It is capable of producing cloverleafs at distances of 30 yards and more, while the trigger, breaking at a crisp 3lbs, greatly helps minimize muscular interference while shooting it. The grips are ergonomically sized for the hand of the average shooter, but they are easily replaceable with something beefier or slimmer to fit other sizes.   The 6” (150 mm) gives you a long, 7.5” sight radius to optimize alignment and therefore accuracy when shooting without optics. Also, the sights are user-adjustable for both windage and elevation, so that different target loads may be confidently tried while always staying on target. The front sight may be easily replaced with a thinner blade. Magazine change is designed to be quick and intuitive and to cut down on time. The magazine well is beveled for easy no-see insertion, while magazines have a sturdy rubber pad so that they can be safely dropped during competition without any damage.   At 41 ounces, the 87 Target is designed to feel steady in your hand while shooting. Also, the bottom corners of the pistol are squared; it remains upright when when set down on a flat surface, ready to be quickly gripped, magazine loaded an raised to the target (.22LR Practical Shooting). Overall, the Beretta 87 Target is an ideal rimfire competition pistol giving shooters serious about their improvement a great value out of the box.

Buy It Now!!   They called for superior weather resistance, three magazines (one 9-round flush and two 10-round extended), dark earth frame, extended barrel for threading, tactical case and additional accessories. Beretta answered the call successfuly, not just by merely rechambering the PX4 Storm to .45 ACP--but rather by redesigning its internal components to meet and exceed all these requirements. The result is a pistol that satisfies not only SOCOM's requirements, but the most demanding shooter looking for the absolute best and most reliable for personal defense, competition or carry.   The “SD” denomination of this handgun stands for “Special Duty.” That means a pistol that will be reliable in the toughest and most demanding conditions. Military trials for the PX4 Storm SD have proven that it will keep performing in spite of salt, mud, water, rain, snow, sand or anything else you can throw at it. This is because every internal component was engineered, produced and treated to function in such extreme environments.   The PX4 Storm SD features a rotating barrel system. This means that under recoil, the barrel rotates, thereby dissipating momentum radially, which translates in much lower felt recoil and muzzle jump, even with hotter .45 ACP rounds. Furthermore, the extended cold-hammer forged barrel is 4.5” long and allows the power of the .45 to fully develop before exiting the muzzle. And the out-of-the-box accuracy of this handgun is as good as it gets in a tactical pistol.   The reversible mag-release, ambidextrous safety, drop-free magazine, commander-style hammer and easy-on-target 3-dot sights are only some of the tactical features of this Beretta .45. An integral Picatinny rail forward of the trigger guard enables easy mounting of tactical lights, laser aiming devices or other accessories. And like all best-quality military arms the PX4 Storm SD takes mere seconds to disassemble without any tools. When the impossible is expected, the PX4 Storm SD is the absolute best companion to have at hand.

Serial number dates this one to about 2007 so right in the middle and it's marked with the Smith and Wesson markings also so it was during the period when Smith was assembling and distributing some of Walther's product. The parts though were made in Germany.  These little pistols have gotten a bad rap from some and I guess in some ways deservedly so as they tend to be finicky with ammo and need to be kept clean and oiled. When they are they shoot just great! I've owned threee and have enjoyed shooting every one, this one likes remington Thunderbolt and CCI mini-mags.THe better the ammo, better it's going to shoot but it is pretty accurate for me anyway. The muzzle brake pictured looks a little goofy but when I got it the thread protector was missing so I stuck it on just to protect the threads. I'll leave it in the box for anyone that wants to do similar. This was 429.00 new from Vances in '07 but of course they are cheaper now, similar gun is still in the 350 range most places and this one shows very little wear so 300 is a pretty firm price as it's what I have in it, plus I replaced the batteries in the laser which was another 8 bucks. Trades welcome if it's something I need. No bows or black powder guns, thanks."

For those who emphasize extra-discreet concealed carry, we’re proud to introduce the new Springfield Armory® EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour.   Back in 2007, the original Springfield Armory® EMP® set a new bar for quality, performance, and style. Combining the near-perfect ergonomics of the time-tested 1911 design with a new patented short-action, the original EMP® redefined what a carry 1911 could be. Among the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever. The all new EMP® 4” Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour model improves on the original by combining a longer barrel with a frame trimmed for ultimate concealment. The new bevel cut on the mainspring housing does a lot more than one might think. The rounded contour molds to the shape of the shooters hand, preventing “palm bite” during fire. For carry, the contoured shape helps to prevent snags during the draw and virtually eliminates the telltale bulge under a cover garment. Now, the EMP® is easier than ever to conceal. The new Concealed Carry Contour model features a four-inch, stainless steel, Match-Grade bull barrel with a fully supported feed ramp. The barrel is housed in a forged stainless steel slide with an exquisite satin finish. The slide assembly is complemented by a black hard coat anodized forged aluminum alloy frame. The front fiber optic sight facilities instant sight acquisition while the low-profile combat-style rear sight ensures a smooth draw from concealment. The EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour handles even better than it looks. Checkered black G-10 grip panels combine a slip-free hold with incomparable durability. Both front and rear strap frame surfaces feature our smooth, but effective, Posi-Lock texturing pattern.

Sometimes it’s a brand new idea – like the XD®. Other times innovation is the fine-tuning of a classic – like the EMP®. How could the enduring design that is the 1911 be improved? Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be. The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.
