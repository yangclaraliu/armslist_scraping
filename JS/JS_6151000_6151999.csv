Its a rock river arms LAR8. 7.62×51 or your .308 round... Very awesome rifle. Do your own looking around and research but I'm seeing these go for 1600-2300. This one has a bunch of goodies with it. My friend did a lot of the add ons and I purchased the rifle from him, so technically were both into the rifle a lot lol. But it's got the magpul prs stock, upgrades trigger assembly( not sure what brand, but very very light trigger squeeze.) rock river arms scope/rail mount, Burris laser range finder scope, bipod... And have over to 200 rounds that would go with. I'm looking for 2200 OBO plz txt at REDACTED"

It retains most of it's german markings and is marked TRZ-5 on the left side. The TRZ stands for Tehnick Remontni Zavod(basically technical refurbishment facility), the numeral 5 represents the individual facility in Hadicizi in present day Bosnia(just outside Sarajevo). TRZ-5 had a small output of rifles and I have read that the stamped TRZ-5 is much rarer than the script version having been done early in 1946. Most of the numbers on the parts are mixed, but some numbers match and there is an Century Arms import mark on the barrel. It also comes with a new production sling. Bore and finish are in great condition and it is a great shooter. I am asking $400. FTF cash only, no trades, and buyer must sign a bill of sale. If the ad is still up then it is still for sale.

475,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6151475,For Sale:  Beretta M9A3 9mm 15 round Pistol FDE,"Bend, Bend, Oregon","$ 1,049","Listed On: Saturday, January 14, 2017",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"With the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design convertible from safety-decocker to decocker-only, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition.  Style Thin Grip for Instinctive Pointability The Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.  Versatility and easy Accessorization One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more.  Easy to Use and Maintain The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over."

Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.
The only thing I am really looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $500 with std. sights or + $450 with night sights, going by Bud's pricing.  This will be a gift, so having the box and ppwk etc. would be nice to have.  Also, a Gen 3 Glock 19.Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles & pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.  
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.

$960 firm in cash or little better in trade.  At a couple places I found this one still in stock it was selling for $1,050 before any other fees.  Lots of trade offers so far, but nothing I'd rather have over this one yet. 
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.
The only thing I am really looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $500 with std. sights or + $450 with night sights, going by Bud's pricing.  This will be a gift, so having the box and ppwk etc. would be nice to have.  Also, a Gen 3 Glock 19.Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles & pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.  
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.

$800 in cash or better in trade, no hurry to sell, just trying to get cash for another purchase.  I've seen other bright polished 686 models selling for a lot higher, so price is firm.
Prefer cash, but may consider trades.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and want to do up front, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? this makes it a lot easier when considering.
The only thing I am really looking for right now is a Sig P320 Compact or Carry model in 9mm + $350 with std. sights or + $300 with night sights, going by Bud's pricing.  This will be a gift, so having the box and ppwk etc. would be nice to have.Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR & AK rifles & pistols), but will consider others firearms, depending, stripped AR lowers, nice triggers, maybe other parts.  FosTech Echo trigger or the Franklin BFS, Gen 3 only.  
Springfield M1A SOCOM 16 or Scout 18"".
1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles.  Value needs to equal cash price, let me know the details.
