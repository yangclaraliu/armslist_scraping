I found the scabbard in the same house, but seperate from the sword. It fits like a glove so i can only assume its the original. The blade is of excellent quality. Its not in the best condition, but its a very scarce 100% Authentic Confederate sword. I have a good consensus the sword is correct, you do not have to just take my word for it.

This rifle comes in OK, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have an average amount of wear/tear, as well as obvious signs of usage. This can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and regularly used. This rifle features a beautiful wood stock with a thumhole, as well as fantastic carvings/etchings throughout the entire thing. There are a handful of small light scratches, as well as a couple of dings, and minor chips throughout the firearm as well. The top of the receiver has a pair of parallel scratches running along the receiver, most likely from where a rail WAS, before it was removed. There are a couple of severe cracks directly behind the receiver, however, they do NOT prevent the rifle from firing. This rifle also comes with the original Winchester brand magazine. This is a nice unique gun that would be a great addition to any collection.

I have a neat little case and leather IWB holster that comes with it too, along with the original box with locking keys.Not for sale, just looking for a even trade.Open to all offers (except for a Hi-point or any ""Saturday night special's"", sorry)Email with offers and then I'll send you my cell phone number for ease of communication.Thanks for looking!"

It was originally built for Dave Stanford the old president of IPSC and USPSA and has a custom serial number to reflect as much. This pistol appears in many magazine articles over the years.I have swapped the barrel to a gorgeous Lissner which are no longer available. The gun has approx 500rds fired since rebuild. The optic is a c-more 8moa dot on a custom drilled mount. This was necessary as The gun initially had a Tasco Pro point on a 6 hole mount so the extra hole is plugged by a set screw currently. This gun is super accurate, runs like a top and stays on target due to the compensator.Includes:custom kydex drop holster2 10 rd magazines2 21 rd magazines2 27 rd magazines100rds Sig 125gr JHP25rds Sig 125gr FMJ130 pieces of 1x sig brass"

This is a Lew Horton special edition of 500 guns. A Colt Archive letter is included to authenticate it. Also included is the original box numbered to the gun with allof the paperwork shown. The finish has a deep black mirror finish to it that these are so well known for. There is a trace of holster wear at the very front right of the barrel. You will notice a very fine secondary line on the cylinder. This is caused by the cylinder being rotated when the sideplate screw is backed out slightly. The sideplate screw is fully turned in currently and is not touching the cylinder. Besides these two issues there is just very slight handling and the finish rates a solid 97%. The action is crisp, the lock up is tight, and the bore is bright and shiny. The grips are a little long where they meet at the butt so they have been replaced. Overall a very solid example of a highly sought after Python. cash deposit is welcome"

After years of using ACOGs in my line of work, I switched all my 4x out to these BROWE Combat optics they really are the next evolution of an ACOG Optic. This one has custom duracoat camouflage in tan, flat Dark Earth, sage green, and forest green to blend with most environments seen in the continental US. This optic was coated and then installed on a rifle with the same camouflage job for display purposes. The optic never saw any use on a firing weapon and is in like new condition. It comes with all the original packaging and accessories amd lens pen and it came from the factory with a Larue throw lever mount, anti reflective device, and Tenebraex flip caps.This one has the 5.56 BDC glass etched Reticle with a BLUE Illuminated center crosshair which includes acts as a ""dot"" for rapid target acquisition in any lighting conditions. The blue illumination eliminates blooming and fuzziness seen by people with astigmatism as is common with rod dot illumination. Please read the description from the manufacturer below for all the specs. These optics are very technologically advanced well belong what the tried and true ACOGs offer. Including: auto on-off, auto illumination control with light sensors that read light levels at the target, not the shooter so you can always see your crosshairs even when shooting from dark to light or light to dark. MANUFACTURER DESCRIPT4x32 BROWE Combat OpticThe 4x32 BROWE Combat Optic (BCO) is a state-of-the-art optic that delivers highest quality optical glass, high precision machining, with a rugged military design.  The BCO is a purpose designed and built optic ideally suited for tactical scenarios and well suited for military, police and sportsmen. Its titanium housing is compact and light weight, yet nearly three times stronger than its aluminum counterparts, enhancing its ability to survive the rigors of field abuse under the most severe environmental conditions. The BCO’s list of evolutionary technology is long and includes such features as:  Target Light Sensor Technology The BCO has a cadmium-sulfide photocell located in the optical path providing great sensitivity and accuracy of the target light that is being transmitted through the optic, not ambient lighting. In tactical environments lighting levels are very liquid and constantly changing. When nanoseconds count there is no time to make manual illumination adjustments or search for a poorly illuminated reticle. The Target Light Sensor Technology simplifies the operation and allows the operator to focus on the job at hand.   Single Intuitive Control (SIC) Gives the operator a simple button designed to control the illumination systems and simulate muscle memory. With a single press of the SIC button the BCO will enter Automatic Mode; this will utilize the Target Light Sensor Teechnology by measuring the light transmission and automatically set the reticle illumination to the proper brightness. The second press of the SIC button the BCO enters into Manual Mode. This gives the operator complete control of the reticle illuination with the choice of 10 day settings and 3 night vision settings.  BCO Utility Port The BCO utility port is a sealed port on the backside of the battery housing. This port can be used to update the operating firmware or customize the existing program. It can also be used to plug in a remote pressure pad switch, so the SIC button controls can be placed at a secondary location on the weapon. This port can also be used to import or export power. This means that accessories such as lasers or mini red dots could be powered from the BCO battery. Alternatively, the BCO utility port is capable of importing power, to run on an external power source such as a central power system.  Vibration Motion Sensor Designed to conserve battery life by placing the BCO in SLEEP mode if motion is not detected after two hours. The BCO has an average battery usage life of over 2000 hours with a minimum of 775 hours on max brightness. In sleep mode the battey current is less than 1uA, which will give the BCO a shelf life of over 10 years. Optical Design The BCO optical design is based on an internally adjustable roof prism optical system with an etched glass reticle. This design was incorporated to maintain a short overall length, a platform that has proven itself successful with currently deployed products. All lenses are precision ground of the finest quality optical glass available and are broad band anti-reflective coated possessing excellent light gathering capabilities even under low light conditions. The glass etched reticle incorporates an LED coupled with microprocessor technology and a cadmium-sufide photocell to measure target light levels, automatically adjusting the reticle to match target lighting conditions.  4x32BCO-Optical_light_path_cropped.jpg"

The stock shows carry wear, and what they ""beaver chew"", basically the Swiss would bang the rifle on the side of their snow boots to clear it of snow. The bluing is in amazing condition, basically looks like it's fresh out of the factory. The rifle, other than the stock shows very little wear and the rifling is mint. I'm only selling this because it's a bit heavy for me, because of an old injury it's hard to life these rifles and keep them shouldered, figured I'd trade it for something a bit smaller.I'm looking to mainly trade for an AR-15, since the crazy prices have gone away and you can buy a solid one for less than $800 these days, I figured why not. IF you are going to offer one you built yourself, I expect a full parts list of the rifle so I can make sure I'm not getting something that's going to blow up in my face or jam on me. Something like a factory S&W M&P15 is more than fine, I don't need anything special since I'll probably modify it to fit my needs.I'll also take other carbines/rifles like a CZ Scorpion Evo, or stuff like that. I'm not really interested in handgun trades right now, but if you really want the rifle and can only trade, shoot me an offer and I'll see if I'm interested.For a cash price, I'm asking $600 for this, but I'd mainly like to trade it. If I have to take cash and build my own rifle, I'm cool with that also.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike. **I can only add 3 pictures on here, feel free to text me if you'd like to see more."

Kept well and cleaned after every outing. 800 match rounds put through it which were all personally polished casings and quality bullets. If you're going into competition, I also have additional stuff you can add to it which will cost a bit more. For starters, I have a really nice leather shooters sling, shooting mat, stand, hand loaded match rounds. For an additional 300, I'll replace the bolt group and recoil with the custom setup I was using which smoothened out the recoil and suppressed the spring noise. Makes it handle very well. That custom group is a Spikes Tactical Lightweight NiB Bolt Carrier Group and a JP Silent Buffer Spring System which I had tuned to the bolt group. I handle all my gear with care, there are no spots or exaggerated scratches, it is near-new condition. It's a Wylde chamber so it'll take both 5.56 as well as 223."
