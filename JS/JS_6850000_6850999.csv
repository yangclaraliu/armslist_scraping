Kimber builds the world's finest 1911 pistols right here in America—something that makes sense, as few things are as American as a 1911 .45 ACP. Virtually every critical component of every pistol is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. The finest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards. America's best shooters keep choosing Kimber. Legendary LAPD™ SWAT tested five major 1911 brands and chose Kimber. United States Marines assigned to Special Operations Command chose Kimber. The U.S.A. Shooting Rapid Fire Pistol Team trains for Olympic competition with a Kimber. Most recently, LAPD™ SIS transitioned to Kimber. They all chose Kimber for the same reason: quality, dependability and accuracy. So should you. Quality is the true measure of value. On the strength of quality, Kimber has become the world's largest producer of 1911 pistols. Compare a Kimber with any other brand of 1911—or any other type of semi-automatic pistol—and see for yourself why Kimber is what all guns should be.  Kimber Tactical Ultra II .45 ACP USED"

It comes with the original Tupperware Glock box, cleaning rod, original paper tag and two mags. Not in a hurry to move, and looking more for a tradethat interests me. please realize this is a fully functional weapon and howmyou chose to use it is your choice. The issue is that this is just not a used weapon, it is also a collectors model being a gen 2 with not much more than factory rounds through it. I personally have never fired it as it has been a collection piece for me. I can guarantee it will fire flawlessly with factory anno as I have enough Glocks to know that as well as anyone familiar with Glocks will verify. I will not give this weapon away and will not add cash for a lower grade weapon just because it is newer. As far as price is concerned, it's firm. For trades please do not expect me to trade this for a brand new priced 4 or 500 dollar weaponn that is used. Sorry, just tired of the ""well, it is older than my $400 dollar new weapon"". Don't care, mine will only go up in value compared to your cheap copy of something. Must be legal to own a firearm, all laws apply. Must have valid driver's license and/or CWP."
