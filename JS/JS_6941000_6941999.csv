This is perfect for hunting varmints and hogs, off of an ATV, or even at night from the rear passenger window of a pickup truck (I'm kidding local game warden, who would admit to that). Great as a truck and ranch gun, which is what its been. Or you can use it for all your tactical building clearing needs, home defense if you want to shoot through your neighbors wall too, or maybe getting ready for The Walking Dead to come through the television. It's loud, makes a big fireball, it's been fun. Very reliable, ate every cheap dirty round I could put trough it, never had a problem."

Don't waste your time with any offers that are not very close to my asking price. It's a very far price for a rifle that will keep going up in value. I will not ship. So if you are not willing to meet face to face in Dublin or Worthington I won't be interested. Buyer must be over 18 and have a valid Ohio ID. Thank you for your interest in my rifle."

Not looking for modern, commercially available ammo like Tula, PPU, Wolf, Hornday, S&B, or Fiocchi: pretty much if it's something a major online retailer is selling, I won't be interested. I would also be interested in individual rounds if they are especially uncommon, e.g. modern russian loadings like SP-7, SP-8, RG028 rounds. You can either approach me with an offer or ask for one. I'm not going to try and twist your arm to get the absolute, best deal possible on my end, so if you throw out a reasonable number I'll definately entertain it.*Just a heads up, I'm a Massachustts resident, so if need be i can provide a copy of my LTC (firearm license). Shipping only, unless you are a MA or NH resident in which case i would be open to, but not committed to, an in person exchange.Feel free to send any questions you may have.Thanks!"
