No modifications. All original all stock. I decided to build my own rifle after the purchase and do not have a need for two ar15's. No other reason for selling. I have previously owned a PWS 308 and they are the best piston driven rifles I have ever fired. The Mod 1 in my opinion is better than the new Mod 2 PWS rifles because they are made from billet and not forged. Also they are loaded with features to include adjustable gas block (more options than the Mod 2), muzzle brake, and nickel boron bolt. For these reasons I like the Mod 1 rifle better than the Mod 2. Anyway, this comes with original case (cracked at one of the hinges but functional), warranty card, and one unopened Pmag. I am also including an unopened FNH lock for the rifle as it didn't come with one. Brand new these rifles go for over $1500. I am selling for $1,100. This is the lowest price you will find anywhere. No shipping and no taxes and no transfer fee. I am not interested in any trades at this time. I will meet in person and will need to complete a bill of sale with the buyer.

I finished the build and i'm having gassing issues. The superslim handguard had to be put on first then the flash can by a local gun store and I don't have the tools to easily remove the parts to figure out the issue myself. The pistol fires but won't eject the round. I was told to realign the gas block, purchase an adjustable gas block or drill out the gas hole on the barrel. This is all above my head and by the time I buy the vise, clamps, tools or pay a gunsmith ill already of spent the money I would of used for the 5.56 7"" upper from PSA that I wanted in the first place.The upper is all Anderson. The flash can is a Krinkov and the super slim handguard is no name brand. It was 12"" but since it wouldn't slide over the flash can I had it cut down to 10 3/4"" to butt right up to the flash can. It looks amazing but I may just stick with 5.56I have 200.00 wrapped up into it.No BCG or charging handle. Those can be added for 120.00. The BCG and charging handle I got for it was a Alpha Premium Nitride.If you have all the tools you need to fiddle with an AR this can be a fun project for you but I don't plan to invest in all the tools and time right now.

No Way. No more collecting unless you get a great deal."" If a zombie apocalypse comes she'll be glad I have rifles purchased at a deal or not (that's probably not going to happen, so I'll stick to just looking for the 'great deal').

A rifle that has not taken a deer, or has seen the light of day in the last decade?
