It includes 5 mags, (2 metal,3 poly), total of three different recoil springs to tune the gun, case and tools.I'm switching to USPSA and don't shoot this any longer. Its in excellent condition and shoots as new. The 5- shot test group is included with a group of an amazing .932"" @ 50 yds. New cost for everything would be over $650,Selling for $425. FIRM.Below is the Marvel info from their website:Convert any 1911 Semi-Auto pistol into one of the most accurate .22 pistols available. Tests from a machine rest have delivered groups around 1.8"" at 50 yards ... for 100 shots with inexpensive ammo, Compare that to extremely expensive European target pistols that boast 1-1/2"" groups (measured center-to-center, which gives you a smaller than edge-to-edge) at 50 yards for 10 shots. The secret to Marvel Conversion Unit's astonishing accuracy is the same as for any breakthrough product: an innovative and unique design executed by experts with top-quality production techniques and components. Take the design, for instance, of the barrel locking system. The barrel underlug cutout is machined to precision specifications so when the recoil rod is tightened on to the slide stop, the barrel is drawn down tightly. The barrel is solidly locked to the frame (only the slide moves). Everyone knows minimal tolerances are a necessity for competitive target pistol. Here, there are no tolerances because the barrel does not move or pivot, and the barrel does not depend on support at the muzzle from a moving slide. Notice also that the barrel is directly connected to the sight rib or scope mount, again with no tolerances or play. With a solid barrel-to-frame lockup, accuracy from a machine rest, with the frame locked down, is guaranteed (this is mechanical accuracy). Also, with the sights solidly connected to the barrel, accuracy of the shot via the sights is also guaranteed (this is handheld accuracy). As we mentioned, precision components are also part of the formula. No more needs to be said about the quality of the barrels. We also utilize aircraft-grade billet aluminum and high-carbon steel. All machining - barrel, slide and smaller parts - is done by CNC for incredible precision. The slide is made from 7075 aluminum and contains a hardened-steel breech insert(thus a steel-to-steel breech-to-barrel contact and no aluminum battering problems). Aluminum parts are anodized and steel parts are blued, both for corrosion resistance and a rich appearance. Total weight is just over 16 ounces. The Marvel .22 Conversion Unit converts any caliber 1911 Semi-Auto with no fitting required. Installation time is under a minute, even if you're taking your time. It fits Government, Commander and Officer Model 1911 Frames. Magazine fits all those models also, but will extend below the bottom of the grip on the Officer Model."

I am selling my go bag that has it all. Handguns are nice but the threat has to be close to be effective. A rifle keeps the threat away or eliminates it much easier. My bag has an AR15-223 that breaks down and fits in the backpack. It has a 16"" barrel, collapsable stock & pistol grip plus a quick release Dolos barrel/handguard system. The go bag has a Sechelle filter water bottle that filters 99.95% of all contaminates. The Go bag comes with several days of survival food/ power bars. It also comes with a first-aid kit to take care of any minor first-aid problems. For fire you can use the bic lighter, waterproof storm matches or the flint& steel, There are knives,big and small, flashlight, hand chainsaw and a few other things to help. Don't be caught unprepared. I've seen go bags that don't hold a candle to this for much more money."

But it shoots well and I have put the idea a building a rifle on hold for a while. So I put a Nikon buck master scope on it. The scope is a 3x9 40mm. It's a nice little combo to get you hunting. It has brand new vortex scope rings. The rifle does have the accu-trigger. Can meet pretty much much anywhere on the front range at an FFL/gun shop. Buyer pays the fees. I prefer cash but open to trades let me know what you have. Thanks for looking.

To be found meeting in secret was punishable by death. In response, each of the thirteen colonies selected a special tree, called a liberty tree, and designated it as their secret meeting place. Under the haven of Liberty Trees, leading colonists devised plans of rebellion against British control. The 9"" blade of this special knife is hand-forged steel with brass bolsters and two brass stars set in the 5"" long handle. It is engraved with ""The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America,"" and has a certificate of authenticity. Only 1,776 — to honor the year of America's declaration of liberty — have been produced. ￼ • Knife Overall Length: 14"" • Blade Length: 9"" • Steel: 420 HC • Handle turned from Last Liberty Tree • Limited Edition: only 1776 made • Commemorative Blade Engraving • Glass Top Wooden Display Case • Includes Certificate of Authenticity ￼The wood handles of the Liberty Tree knife were carved from the last surviving Liberty Tree. This 400-year old tulip poplar stood on the grounds of St. Johns College in Annapolis, Maryland. Having outlived its species by 100 years, the tree witnessed the most significant moments leading to the development of the United States. ￼Browning’s Living History knives received the Shooting Industry’s “Knife of the Year” award and are rare and highly prized collectibles.￼￼ ￼• Alamo Knife model 002￼• Robert E. Lee Knife model 003￼• Eisenhower Knife model 004 ￼• Crazy Horse Knife model 005￼• Vietnam Knife model 006 If you were given a chunk of America's past, a piece so rare its likes will never be seen again, and you wanted to make a lasting memorial that paid homage to the past, was beautiful and reverent, you would make the Liberty Tree Knife. The nation's last remaining Liberty Tree, a towering tulip poplar, stood in Annapolis, Maryland on the grounds of St. John's College. The tree was about 400 years old, had withstood time, lightning strikes, bug infestations and student pranks, but disease and old age, combined with Hurricane Floyd in 1999, finally took its toll. The tulip poplar was 100 years older than a typical tree of this kind is expected to live. A Maryland landscaper salvaged the wood and sought organizations who would utilize it with reverence.   In 2001, The Providence Forum, a Philadelphia based non-profit educational organization, purchased the remaining Liberty Tree wood and began a preservation and educational program through the development of gifts honoring American history and American heroes. World renowned artisan, Eugene Landon, was commissioned to craft a series of historic items to be presented to American citizens and organizations that best represent duty to country and honor to God. The Providence Forum incorporated the Liberty Tree wood into Liberty Tree Bible Boxes that were presented to President George W. Bush, President James Earl Carter, and the United States Naval Academy. A large piece was chosen to make the yoke for the Spirit of Liberty Bell, a full-sized traveling replica of the historic Liberty Bell, cast to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the original Bell, which had been commissioned in 1751 to celebrate religious liberty in America. A substantial portion of the remaining Liberty Tree wood was given to American Forests to be used in products like the Liberty Tree Knife. ￼￼￼ BROWNING MODEL 002 Living History Series  THE ALAMO KNIFE  ￼ ￼ If you know a knife collector, the classic Living History Series would make an excellent, much appreciated gift. This unique Limited Edition series features handles made from trees taken from historic grounds.   ￼￼￼￼Model 002 by Browning: Gen. D. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's men outnumbered Col. William Travis' troops 6,000 to 200. Before noon on March 6th, 1836, Travis, Jim Bowie, David Crockett and the remaining defenders fell, making the ultimate sacrifice for their families and the future of the Republic of Texas. The handle of the Alamo Living History Knife is made from a large limb of a live oak that grows on the Alamo grounds.￼￼The Alamo Bowie celebrates the Alamo, Travis and Jim Bowie. The hand-turned handle is taken from a large limb of a live oak that grows on the Alamo grounds. The familiar blade is 14"" long and is crafted from high-carbon steel, hand-forged over a 10-day period. Hand forging adds strength to the knife and was a common manufacturing practice during that time period, although it is rarely practiced today. The blade is engraved on both sides with historical tributes to the men who fought and died at the Alamo. On each side is a single gold star for the fabled Lone Star of Texas. The blade is engraved with William Travis' poignant words ""Give me help, oh my country"" and has a certificate of authenticity. Only 1,836 will be made, representing the year of the Battle of the Alamo.￼Overall Length: 15""Blade Length: 10""Blade Steel: 420 HC Bolster: BrassBlade Engraving: ""Give Me Help, OhMy Country""￼￼￼Before making this knife, designer Jerry Fisk visited the Alamo. He wanted to get a first hand feel for the history of the place and the rare live oak wood that would be part of his creation. With each carving he said “It was an unbelievable feeling to be able to touch and feel the history in his hands.” The Alamo knife defines both his passion for history and a turning point in the American Story. The wood used in the handle of the Alamo knife was a large limb on a live oak tree that grows on the grounds of the Alamo. In the years following the Battle of the Alamo, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas planted several live oaks at the shrine to refurbish the battle stricken historic site. Only the wood of a dead limb was used, as the live oak continues to stand in silent testimony to the courage and bravery of every man who fought in the Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. In 2003, American Forests in conjunction with the Alamo site harvested wood from a dead limb for use in this project. The live oak continues to stand at the Alamo in observance of lives lost in prolific times.In 1822, Stephen Austin led the first American settlers to Mexican Texas. The settlers had little in common with the Mexicans – language, religion, or customs – and they lived in fear of one culture dominating the other. By Fall 1835, Austin wrote, “War is our only resource,” referring to the new dictatorship of General Lopez de Santa Anna and his brother-in-law, General Perfecto de Cos. A confrontation was inevitable when garrison forces left less than a hundred men to protect San Antonio against Mexican cavalry. Those who came to protect the town were legendary Jim Bowie with nineteen men; Col. William Travis with twenty five men; and frontiersmen Davy Crockett and twelve Tennesseans. In total, 180 men entrenched at The Alamo, a mission established in 1718, and faced 5,000 of Santa Anna's troops. From February 24 until March 6, 1836, The Alamo was under siege and attack, ending with the Texans firing one remaining cannon and wiped out in hand-to-hand combat. “I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch…. VICTORY OR DEATH”, said William Barrett Travis as he desperately called for reinforcements to protect the fortified mission, just days before the arrival of General D. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's Mexican forces on February 23, 1836. The Alamo, originally named the Mission San Antonio de Valero, was established in 1718 as a Spanish mission intended to teach native Indians about the Christian faith. In 1836, Lt. Col. William Travis and James Bowie shared command of the army of Texas volunteers, as they occupied the Alamo in a desperate attempt to stop enemy forces from advancing into Anglo settlements.BROWNING MODEL 004  w/DISPLAY  Collector Price: $1,295.90 Model 004 by Browning: ""There is a small window of relatively good weather."" Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower received these words from his chief meteorologist, advising him of weather conditions during the largest accumulation of force the Germans would encounter during World War II. Nearly 3 million men awaited is order. On Monday, June 6th, 1944, at 0415 hrs. Ike said, ""Let's go,"" and the Battle of Normandy, ""D-Day"", became one of the most memorable days in world history.The Dwight D. Eisenhower knife is patterned after the timeless and famed model of the GI M3, issued to many GI's who fought on D-Day. The wood handle is taken from a green ash tree descendent that shaded Dwight D. Eisenhower's home in Denison, TX. The blade is hand-forged 420 high carbon steel with brass bolsters. The engraving will read, ""Normandy, 1944. 'Let's go'."" Certificate of authenticity. 1,944 knives will be made to honor the year of the D-Day invasion.“Now this is special, not only is there culture in the design of this knife but there is culture in the wood” said Jim Crowell, designer of the Eisenhower Knife prototype. The wood used in the handle of the Eisenhower knife came from a direct-descendent of the historic Green Ash Tree that shades Dwight David Eisenhower's boy hood home in Denison, Texas. The seeds were collected from the original in 1990 and replanted to honor all the men and women who served in World War II. ""Operation Silent Witness"" a Pearl Harbor remembrance ceremony took place in Washington D.C on June 7, 2000. A large crane held the 20 foot Eisenhower green ash tree in the air and lowered it down to a giant hole.Overall Length: 14""Blade Length: 8 1/2""Blade: 420 HC BluedBolster: 5 Stars Handle: Eisenhower Green Ash Engraving: Normandy 1944 ""Let's Go""Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th president of the United States, was born in a small frame house at 208 East Day Street in Denison, Texas on October 14, 1890. The “Eisenhower Green Ash” tree stood witness to the first few years of Eisenhower's life. His father, David, worked for the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railroad which was headquartered in Denison. The family resided in Denison for three years, leaving when the future president was less than 2 years old. Today Ike's birthplace is preserved as part of a 10-acre park operated by the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. The park's visitor center showcases memorabilia of the former president and five-star general. A 10-foot statue of General Eisenhower stands near his birthplace and an education center has recently been completed in a 1900s grocery store building.As the largest armada of military strength of World War II waited in limbo on June 5, 1944, one man struggled with the decision to launch a planned invasion on Europe's mainland. Known as D-Day, the Battle of Normandy exercised the largest accumulation of force the Germans encountered during World War II. 6,000 vessels, 130 warships, 12,000 aircraft, 5,000 tons of bombs, and the involvement of nearly 3 million men awaited the orders of that one man, the only person with the power to launch the assault force – the Allied Expedition Force's Supreme Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Planning for a successful launch relied on several critical factors – weather, tides, and of course, maintaining secrecy. Group Captain J. M. Stagg, the chief meteorologist, advised Eisenhower of a small window of relatively good weather on the 5th, lasting from 24 to 48 hours. With tides not favorable for another month, Eisenhower realized this was his best chance. After agonizing over the decision, at 04:15 on Monday, June 5, 1944, Supreme Commander Eisenhower said, “Let's go”."
