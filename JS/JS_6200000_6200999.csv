I'm no good at rating guns so please let the photos guide your buying decision.Overall the gun looks very nice, but it does have some holster wear on the left side of the barrel at the muzzle, some dings on the bottom of the pistol grip and some other slight wear. To me the revolver looks great considering it was manufactured in 1970.Sold as is.This is on consignment as part of large collection we are helping to liquidate.

Prefer Oak Grove Guns in Eugene, Oregon.This SKS was imported from China via Inter Ordnance, but it has a Russian Tula receiver marking (arrow inside of a star). It also had a red hammer/sickle star, not a carving, but the actual metal officer's emblem that they used to wear on their hats, on the right side of the stock, near the safety. It has seen some type of training or action (possibly training in Russia or China and might have been in Korean or Vietnam war), as is evident in some scaring of the stock, but it's been totally refinished/refurbished at the Tula arsenal in Russia. This thing has some major beauty and character! I did some investigating online and determined that it is a very rare form of a Sino-Soviet called a ""ghost gun SKS"". These SKS's were given to China by Russia in the early 50's. Mostly, they were parts made in Russia and assembled in China, not whole numbers matching rifles like mine. Mine is all #'s matching. As far as I can find, no other ""ghost gun"" SKS has the Tula arsenal markings (arrow inside star) trench art like mine does. The stock is Russian arctic birch (from Russia, not the crappy cheap lighter blonde wood from China), and it has a blade bayonet, not the typical spike as seen on most China imports. The hammer/sickle, it turns out, is a form of trench art. Some Russian officers used to take it off their caps and add it to their rifles. The rifle is stamped TULA 1952. Tula SKS's are the most desireable of the Russian SKS's, and typically go for a premium. I have kept it all original, except for adding a sling (a modern 3 pointer) and adding a 9 round ammo carrier sleeve for the butt stock. The original sling was missing in action. The ammo carrier sleeve is easily removed. It also has the original trapdoor cleaning kit in the butt stock. The 10 round box mag is original. I had the internals professionally de-cosmolined by my local gunsmith. I have shot only 10 rounds through it to test it after it came back from the smith and it worked smooth as butter. The stock is a ""pot-bellied"" stock, meaning it bows under the bayonet, and is not straight, like most SKS stocks. It took a lot of research, but I am 99.9% certain this is an all #'s matching, Sino-Soviet ""ghost gun"" SKS with Russian officers trench art on the stock. The SKS's are no longer being imported and prices are steadily increasing. My sale price is VERY fair and I will not sell for less. If it does not sell for the asking price, I will just keep it. I would love to sell to someone who will use it, as I originally bought it for deer hunting but no longer have the time for that.Many more pictures available upon request. Thanks!"

Each of these firearms are single-owner, and most have not been fired in quite some time.Up today is my 1956 Winchester Model 70 Featherweight (Pre 64) .30-06 Bolt Action Rifle. Considered to be a top 10 rifle ever built, and the rifles Pre 1964 production date (specifically pre 1960) make it a fairly rare find. It is my understanding that the rifles pre-WWII are the most collectible, the rifles post-WWII and Pre-1960 are the most sought because after WWII they added a rail for mounting a scope, the 1960-1964 are still good but quality dropped. Anything after 1964 is generally considered less desirable because of some issues with manufacturering and quality, so that is where the ""Pre 64"" comes from. The Pre 64 Model 70s are still considered today one of the finest rifles ever built. This rifle was purchased new in 1956, and is a single owner. It is very clean as you can see in the pics, but not perfect. Included with the rifle is a Urnertl Power 4x Scope which has great glass and still very nice, sling, and carry bag. Overall condition is very good. While I do have a list price listed here, I am not completely sure on the value, so I am willing to take offers and/or information about the rifle.Asking $1500 obo.

This Remington 700 is in excellent shape and comes with a muzzle brake professionally installed which helps tame the felt recoil to that of about a .30-06 or a .270
If you know anything about the .300 RUM, you know that the ballistics are hard to beat. This caliber is based off of the beltless .404 Jeffrey cartridge.
Power is not a problem with this setup having taken several elk and deer with clean one shot devastating kills.
This was my personal hunting rifle until I had a custom 300 RUM built by Cutting Edge Arms of OKC and that is the only reason I am parting with this one.
The scope is a Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50mm and has an adjustable side focus objective and retails for $470 at Midway USA and is covered by a full lifetime warranty. It has a 30mm main tube and a mil-dot reticle. Model # VPR-M-06MD26 inch barrel will help realize full ballistic potential. 
The scope is nestled in silver Leupold rings and is resting on a silver Burris one piece base."

They are very simply installed in place of the plastic handguards with simple tools. Also the lower rail assembly is easily removed for cleaning without tools.P/N: 98065NSN 1005-01-452-6771Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM™Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.As a note: BCM™ barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top ReceiverIn developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.T-Marked Upper ReceiverThe contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.USGI 1/7 Twist RateThe USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel SteelBCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.Chrome Bore and ChamberOne of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.Manganese Phosphate Barrel FinishBarrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.5.56 NATO ChambersThe USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight BasesMil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.Government Barrel ProfilesDuty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.HPT / MP Inspected BarrelsMilitary specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi.

(3-Gun Combo)I built this kit to be a do it all settup for hunting and 3-Gun. It was a great settup when I had time to shoot 3-gun, but I don't anymore and this is just taking up space in the safe. If your a hunter and like to shoot 3-Gun or have other ""tactical"" requirements for a shotgun, this is a great setup for you.The shotgun comes with a 26"" barrel and stock spring, plug, etc. for a hunting settup.It also has a 21"" barrel with a Nordic Components extended mag tube for 3-Gun competition.I have beveled the Magwell for ease of competitive reloading and re-finished the gun (Micro-Slick on the internals, CeraKote on the externals).You can see in the pictures, the cerakote has chipped away a bit in some areas. This is from bumping barricades in comps and sliding around in the duck boat. The gun is in great shape but is used. Full disclosure: I have had a couple of failure to fires on the first round when using 3"" waterfowl loads. Immediateactions fix it and get the gun working, and it has not been an issue with lighter game / comp loads. It is probably about time to replace a few springs including the buffer spring to get it running perfectly though.Will consider splitting the combo and selling the Nordic tube and 21"" barrel seperately."

Thanks for taking a look! I have a like-new Springfield Armory XD-S, chambered in 9mm, with a 3.3"" barrel length. There have been approximately 100 rounds through the firearm, and I have had no failures within that time. The only reason I'm selling this firearm is because it doesn't fit in my hand as well as I thought it did when I bought it.
I am the first owner. The firearm has been cleaned once per month (or once after each range trip) during my ownership of it to ensure it stays in good working order.
I've put a few extra accessories into this bundle to get you started. Along with the firearm itself, you will receive:
-All factory packaging, paperwork, and box.
-Factory accessories (spare magazine, replacement night sight inserts, backstraps, gun lock, barrel cleaning rod)
-Left-handed IWB Krypton Kydex holster, with tuckable belt attachment.
-Snagmag Spare Magazine Carrier
 
Please contact me with any questions you may have. Everything is in working order and cosmetic blemishes are minimal. I'm willing to entertain OBO offers, so don't hesitate to shoot me a negotiation or a possible trade.
Thank you!
