Built around a cold hammer forged, 16"" lightweight profile barrel, the V7 has a DD improved flash suppressor to reduce flash signature.

With the M-LOK attachment points that run along 7 positions and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V7 LW has plenty of room for sights, optics and accessories the user my require. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and pistol grip. It also has a forward grip. The price is negotiable."

I built this over the last few weeks and drove every pin and hand fit every part together. Rifle is zeroed at 50yds and is a true tack driver. This rifle is solid with great parts from trusted manufacturers. Will cycle both subsonic and supersonic rounds (both unsuppressed) with only a few feeding malfunctions with the gas block wide open so I'm sure you can tune it perfectly to cycle both loads harmoniously. I haven't had the time to tune the gas block so it's sitting wide open right now with very little muzzle flip. The comp is not very loud at all, no noticeable compression wave, no gas blowback. Felt recoil is on par with a .223/5.56 and would be improved after tuning gas block. This would be a great hog gun or other medium sized game.I'm asking $1650 w/o optic, $2000 as is. I'm not interested in trades unless it's a really good one. I'm not particularly eager to sell either so please don't send me low ball offers. Serious buyers only please. This rifle is stout.

Its island comp BBL is machined from a single piece of stainless steel, which eliminates timing issues and the potential to come loose. The front sight is attached to the compensated BBL—making this the first ever barrel with a compensator in front of an island sight. The technology further reduces muzzle jump and enables you to keep eyes on the front sight rather than the blast of the comp. The comp reduces recoil by 63%. The STI RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system further reduces recoil, effectively making this the flattest, smoothest shooting pistol on the market."

Markings are well-struck, and the carbine appears all matching, with the bolt handle properly hollowed and lightning cuts on the receiver. Matching serial numbers are present on the receiver, barrel, bolt handle and furniture, with the magazine being unnumbered but of Fazakerley make and presumably original to the gun. Of note-there are additional numbers(possibly a SSN) electro-penciled on the receiver. BNP/Tonnage proofing is present on the barrel, and no post-1968 import mark was found. Walnut furniture is in very good plus condition, with handling marks, dings and gouges, but no cracks or chips. The wood shows fine figuring, and the lower handguard is numbered matching to the rifle. Mechanically flawless, with expedtedly smooth action, the bore is excellent-bright and clean with strong, sharp rifling."

Comes with original box, 2 magazines, and interchangeable backstraps.  This is a license-built Walther P99 clone, with full magazine compatibility, and because this is the 4"" version it is compatible with P99 holsters.  I personally think this is the most ergonomic double-stack polymer grip you can find except for maybe the HKs.  I will only sell or trade through an FFL transfer."

I've had it about 2 weeks and have made the following modifications:Replaced front hand guard with Magpal mil-spec hand guard.Replaced the from A-frame gas block/sight with low profile gas block. Deleted the forward assist. Removed the carry handle and replaced with a nice Braska sniper scope.Replaced stock with a mil-spec CA padded stock.Installed a BAD leverAnd finally installed a Strike Industries cookie cutter muzzle break.The rifle is zeroed at 250 yards and is very very accurate.The barrel is the heavy duty barrel that accepts .75 gas blocks. I have run 100 rounds through it just to check and recheck the zero. This rifle has been put away as I have a S&W M&P AR that I love. This rifle would be great for doggin or any other long range shooting. Would possibly be interested in trades. I am looking for a 9mm AR14 or other unique weapons.I live big bore handguns. Please contact via 918-504-533eightMy email does not work well with armslist.Thanks for looking
