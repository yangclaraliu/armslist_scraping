Sold the AR I had it on.There is an old saying: ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" The magazine is one of the primary sources of malfunctions. When  you are using a Redi-Mag you have two loaded magazines on the weapon instead of just one. Each magazine has its own separate catch, one in the carbine, and one in the Redi-Mag. If you have a failure to feed or the weapon magazine is accidentally released, there is another waiting right beside it. And it takes about two seconds to put it in use, even when prone or behind cover.If any questions, please let me know. The only trades I'll do will be below.Trades: ACOG TA31H (green), dbal i2, or dbal a3 *id obvioulsly add cash as needed*"

The .218 was first introduced in 1938 for the Model 65 lever action rifle. The ballistic performance based off the 35, 40, 46, and 50 grain are 3,205 ft/s (35 gr), 3,130 ft/s (40 gr), 2,708 ft/s (46 gr), and 2,654 ft/s (50 gr). The bullet was designed for lever actions rifles by lowering the neck of the .25-20 Winchester to accept the .224 bullet shell.The .218 Bee bullet was designed for varmint hunting back in 1938, but lacked popularity when it entered the market during 1939, and never gained any traction compared to others such as the .22 Hornet. It was originally made for the Model 65 lever action rifles that were based off the 1892 versions. The .218 Bee is compared to the .22 Hornet, and has a higher velocity along with a higher maximum effective range. The .218 Bee is considered accurate up to 200 yards for varmints and 150 yards for small game such as coyote."

They use the Savage Barrel Nut system, so barrel changes are pretty easy.
 
I was able to get MDT to special make me an FDE version of their Tac 21 Chassis (they don't offer FDE in Left hand), and had my gunsmith do some mill work to get it to set within the chassis (Shilen uses a bolt release on the side of the action housing instead of in front of the trigger guard).
 
I haven't even taken off the newspaper that Shilen wrapped the barrel in for shipping, and of course haven't even fired a shot through it (so barrel break in still has to be done).  Should be a 1/2 MOA or better rifle once a load is tuned
I also have:
5 MDT Long Action magazines (3.715 Length) still in wrapping to match the chassis/action.
6 boxes of (50) 300 WM Nosler brass - brand new, but I may have cut the tape on a box or two to look at the brass but they are all there.
Redding Die Set (NIB) - Competition - Bushing Neck Size Die for 300 WM- Set 58153
Only selling it because I don't foresee having time to develop a load for over a year; I haven't even begun the barrel break in processes on my DTA SRS A1 in 6.5 Creedmoor...  Need to downsize my collection since I already have 7 other precision rifles, and I figured that I should find this rifle a good home since it's a great setup and I just, well, don't have time to use it... 
The barreled action through Shilen was around $1800, and the MDT Tac21 was $800, plus the gunsmithing, etc.  I've got somewhere around $3000 into it.  
I'd like:
$2,500 for rifle ($3,000, and a 3-month wait if new from Shilen today)
$300 for the 5 magazines ($70 each from MDT plus shipping)
$420 for the brass ($76 each + shipping online)
$210 for the Redding Dies (Midway has them on sale right now for $215 +shipping, which is much less than I paid)
OR, $3300 for everything. Buyer pays shipping (shouldn't be too ridiculous)
I'd like to not break up the rifle/magazines, but otherwise I'm open to selling things separate."

658,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6874658,For Sale:  Rare 1893 BSA Lee-Metford Rifle Boer War Unit-IDed,"Dallas, Dallas, Texas","$ 1,650","Listed On: Thursday, May 25, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"the rifle features all original components, with all-matching serial numbers and truly excellent condition. Evidenced by the crispness of the markings on the metal, along with the original feathering of the wood grain and perfectly preserved BSA cartouche(rondelle) on the buttstock, the rifle shows no sign of refinish or restoration. A desirable find given the rifle's condition, its traceable history makes this rifle particularly rare. The upper tang of the buttstock is clearly marked with ""V/2.WK"", with the buttstock dated 1897. This identifies the rifle as having been issued to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, with the ""V"" signifying either ""Volunteers"" or ""Vth Division"". This is significant as the 2nd Warwickshire Volunteers were assigned to the Vth(5th) Division under General Sir Charles Warren in 1899. Serving with distinction in the Boer War, the 2nd Warwickshires were involved in actions at the Cape Colony, Diamond Hill, and took heavy casualties in the advance on Koomati Poort(August, 1900). Prior to the Boer War, the 2nd Warwickshires were instrumental in the Sudan Campaign of 1896-1898, and they would go on to fame in the battlefields of France and Belgium during WWI."

Patton, Jr. According to page 1511 of Fjestad’s “The Blue Book of Gun Values”, 26th Edition, Springfield Armory began limited production of the modern M1 Garand in 2002. The new receivers use original USGI parts that have been refinished.When loaded with a bullet that expands, tumbles, or fragments in tissue, this cartridge is capable of high terminal performance… Although very similar to the military 7.62×51mm NATO specifications, the .308 cartridge is not identical, and there are special considerations that may apply when mixing these cartridges with 7.62×51mm NATO.  This one has a relined .308 Winchester barrel that is in great shape. The rifle sits in a Nice hardwood stock and has a great metal finish. So now you can get one of the greatest military rifles ever made chambered in a great military cartridge. Here are some basics on the .308 from Wikipedia: “The .308 Winchester is a rimless, bottlenecked, rifle cartridge and is the commercial cartridge from which the 7.62×51mm NATO round was derived. The .308 Winchester was introduced in 1952, two years prior to the NATO adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO T65."

It's basically a Clone of the Remington 870, but this is a Limited Edition Model Sold As a Turkey/Deer Hunting Model but I bought it because it has many of the features I was looking for in a Home Defense Shotgun. •Fully Cerakoted from Factory with Real Tree HD Camouflage Finish. •7 Shot Capacity- 6+1 (2 3/4"" & 3"")•Compact But Very Accurate 22"" Barrel•Uncle Mikes QD Sling Mounts/Swivels & New 2-Point QD Sling•Heavy Duty Rubber Recoil Pad Already Installed •Weaver Mount & Reflex Sight with 4 Reticles to Choose From & All Are Available in Red or Green •3 Screw-In Choke Tubes (F,M,IC)•Looks like New & Will Always look Great thanks to the Cerakoted Finish.•A good Cerakoted Finish Costs $150-$250 depending on the shop/design. THERE IS AN ISSUE: BEFORE I EXPLAIN, THE GUN HAS ALWAYS WORKED PERFECTLY UNTIL I FULLY DISASSEMBLED IT FOR A DETAILED CLEANING, IT WAS FINE, NOW IT HAS A MINOR ISSUE BUT I FEEL 99.9% SURE IT JUST NEEDS TO BE TAKEN APART & PUT BACK TOGETHER, IT WORKS PERFECTLY RIGHT NOW AS LONG AS YOU ONLY LOAD 2 SHELLS INTO IT, IF IT'S NOT GONE SOON I'LL FIX IT, I DON'T NEED IT SO HERES A NICE DEAL FOR SOMEONE, THIS GUN SHOOTS GREAT & PERFORMS AS WELL AS MY $1200 BENELLI- DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT OR THINK IT'S JUNK, IT'S MADE AS WELL OR BETTER THAN ANY SHOTGUN I HAVE OWNED & THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH REMINGTON 870 SHOTGUNS, GOOGLE ""REM 870 SHELL LATCH"" & SEE FOR YOURSELF. The Shotgun Shoots Great, Everything Works Fine But At the Moment you can only have 2 Shells in the Gun- 1 in the chamber & 1 in the tube. It's an easy fix.  One of the Shell Latches(Right Latch if Looking from Front, Left if From Rear). This causes It to Not hold the Shotgun Shells In the Magazine Tube As It Should, you can fully load it with 6 Shells & they stay until you cycle the action to load the next Shell & the shells just come out since the Shell Latch isn't holding tension on the left side. If you load one in the chamber & one in the tube it works perfectly, It Simply Needs to be Adjusted or Possibly Re-Staked, which can be done at home for free. By chance if the Shell Latch needed to be replaced it's easy & the part(new shell Latch) is cheap, they're less than $20 & can easily be installed at home or a Gunsmith will do it for a small fee. To adjust or install you field strip the gun in 2 minutes & pop out the trigger group by removing 2 pins & adjust or replace the Shell Latch. I just haven't messed with it, but if nobody wants to take advantage of this I'll hold onto it, I just thought I'd offer it. I have well over $500 Invested in this Shotgun, it was $389+ New @ Dick's Sporting Goods. I'll sell it with all extras listed including the Reflex Scope & Mount which are Brand New for $250, $200 with Everything Except For New Reflex Sight OR I'LL TRADE IT, SEE TRADE INTERESTS BELOW & No Crazy or Lowball Offers Please. Will Sell Or Trade & Will Take Partial Trades with Cash- Open to Offers- Would be Interested in Nice Name Brand RifleScope or AR Specific Scope As it'll be going on a Precision Built AR, So A Good Name Branf 3-9x40, 4-12x40, etc, or Bulk Ammo in 9mm, .40, .45 ACP, .357 or .44 Magnum, 12 GA Buckshot/Slugs, Weapon Mounted Light, Laser, Light/Laser Combo, May trade for Nice AR Scope Sight with Fixed Magnification like a 4x32 or Similar, maybe a 1-4X, or a Good Holographic, Reflex, Red Dot, etc. OPEN TO ALL SERIOUS OFFERS!
