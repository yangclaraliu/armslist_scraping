The Glock 35 Gen3 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry or as a duty weapon. It is a tactical size, .40S/W, polymer frame handgun that uses a locked breach system referred to as ""Safe Action"". This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger. Because it does not have a hammer, the spring loaded striker (firing pin) is technically blocked off, partially retracted and not in geometric alignment with a chambered cartridge. It is only by squeezing the trigger, which fully retracts and then releases the striker, that makes the pistol then capable of firing. The absence of a hammer also provides a sleeker profile that reduces both size and weight, while optimizing a smoother draw from concealment.

The low serial number suggests it's closer to WWI than WWII vintage. This rifle is also marked as being transfered to a school, so it was likely used to train students prior to WWII (Starting in the 1920s, all Junior and Senior high school boys in Japan were required to take military training). This is NOT a blank or dummy rifle sometimes found at schools, it is a full military production receiver with rifled barrel capable of firing live ammo.

NOTHING ELSE for that price. I also have the other accessories pictured that I will sell separately, but not until pistol sells. Buyer will have right of first refusal on accessories. Selling my Glock 19 ""Roland Special"" build and accessories (streamlight pistol light is NOT for sale). I've invested nearly $1,400 in the gun not including the smith work. If you were thinking of a Roland special build, here's one out of the box. I'm only selling to fund other projects. I will sell the pistol only, with the two Vickers glock mags for  $575. This doesn't include Comp, silencerco barrel, Wilson night sights, extra mags, holster, etc. The pistol started as a Vickers Tactical Glock 19 with RTF frame. A Professional gunsmith (Vid Custom Firearms) stippled the sides of the frame where support thumb rests and under trigger guard, undercut the trigger guard, added front cocking serrations, cut for an rmr, and cerakote the slide back to black. The work was done here in Knoxville by Vid Custom Firearms. I had an RMR mounted and it was a perfect fit. The sights perfectly co-witness with the Trijicon RMR. The gun is extremely fast and a very good shooter. Trigger is all stock except for a Ghost Evo connector and 6lb striker spring. Trigger is fantastic with a very short, crisp reset while keeping all factory safeties in tact. Trigger is appropriate for duty and concealed carry. All stock parts also included if you want to go that route. I don't think you will when you try the trigger. Pistol has been 100%. The silencerco barrel is like new, very low round count (less than 200 rds). The stock barrel has about 450 rds on it, still in fantastic shape and a good shooter too.

To me it seams like Taurus's engineers (which I went to NC State so...) were influienced by Glock, Ruger, Springfield, and Smith & Wesson. The things I'm talking about are that it field strips just like a glock, M&P grip angle and similar feel ( I think), Ruger chamber indicator and so forth. The PT111 G2 has a 3.2"" barrel, ajustable sights, has a trigger lock greats for if you have kids, and one cool thing about this design is that it looks like a striker fire set up but if you got a bad round pull you buger hooker twice,  becasuse its a single double action set up!.  This pistol comes just like it would from any store with two 12 round mags, manaul ( has not been registered with Taurus yet), and everything you see in the picture. I have never fired this pistol as I origally bought it for my mother for Christmas and she talked me into giving her my S&W 642 instead; and I already have enough conceal carry guns so I would like to sell or trade. Also we dont have meet an FFL and pay $20 bucks but Ill need either a pistol permit or your ccp # and would expect the same vise-versa Thanks for the intrest and have a good day."

The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.

Having been produced only 1/10 of an inch longer than the 1889/1900 Short Rifle, it was capable of firing the newer and more powerful GP1911 cartridge. The newer tangent sight was used on the carbine, but was graduated for the shorter barrel length.The Swiss at some point realized that its support troops, cavalry, and certain other units required a shorter rifle then what was currently available and so designed the Model 1911 Carbine. The Swiss 1911 Carbine being smaller, lighter and still lethally accurate, became a favorite of the Swiss Army and its popularity contributed to the design of its successor, the K31. They are also the last variation with the flatter mag plate which bench shooters tend to prefer, as well as the grooved Schmidt Rubin design bolt, and bakelite charging handle. Produced concurrently with the 1911 Rifle, the 1911 Carbine replaced both the Short Rifle and Calvary Carbine. While production of the 1911 rifle stopped in 1919, Carbine production continued until 1933 with some 184,000 Carbines being produced.My Schmidt-Rubin 1911 Carbine (K11) comes with a Waffenfabrik Neuhausen M1899 bayonet.  All serial numbers match and does not have import marks.  Serial # is 788xx out of 184,200 made which makes the production date in 1917.  Comes with original sling, cleaning kit, muzzle cap, hard case and 80 rounds of GP11.  It is in great shape for a 100 year old weapon.  I can provide more pictures upon request."

It would handle the most powerful rounds of the era. After years of offering more and more powerful chamberings, gun makers then found ways to make them lighter. Fitted with a tapered 22 inch barrel, this rifle is a pleasure to tote and point. The special order takedown feature makes it even more practical. It takes down in about 10 seconds, and locks up tight just as fast. Made in the year of our Lord 1910, she is in good condition for 106 years old. The wood is about flush or over where it meets the steel, with only light carry marks. The stampings are very sharp and clear, indicating good care was given to this rifle. The bore is good, with some light roughness in the grooves, but plenty of shine and good rifling. The front sight is typical for a special order 1886, and is one of my favorites. It is the Lyman ""hunting sight"", which has matting and a real ivory bead. Let's look at value. I see 2 more of these listed over at guns international, a very nice one at 9000 and another with a climbin' Lyman for 7500. I will start this one for far less.Willing to ship"

It would handle the most powerful rounds of the era. After years of offering more and more powerful chamberings, gun makers then found ways to make them lighter. Fitted with a tapered 22 inch barrel, this rifle is a pleasure to tote and point. The special order takedown feature makes it even more practical. It takes down in about 10 seconds, and locks up tight just as fast. Made in the year of our Lord 1910, she is in good condition for 106 years old. The wood is about flush or over where it meets the steel, with only light carry marks. The stampings are very sharp and clear, indicating good care was given to this rifle. The bore is good, with some light roughness in the grooves, but plenty of shine and good rifling. The front sight is typical for a special order 1886, and is one of my favorites. It is the Lyman ""hunting sight"", which has matting and a real ivory bead. Let's look at value. I see 2 more of these listed over at guns international, a very nice one at 9000 and another with a climbin' Lyman for 7500. I will start this one for far less.Willing to ship"
