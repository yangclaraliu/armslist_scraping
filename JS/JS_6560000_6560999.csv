They chamber the power of the .45 ACP and are fitted with custom features that make them an exceptional value.CDPs are some of the most successful pistols Kimber has ever produced, and certainly the most copied. Others have dressed up a basic 1911 to look like a CDP, suggesting it is as good as a Kimber and selling it for a lower price. They may be able to copy the look but no company can match Kimber quality and performance. There is also a certain irony in the suggestion that you should trust your life to the low bidder.Each CDP has 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap as well as under the trigger guard for a positive grip. A match grade Premium Aluminum Trigger is consistent from shot to shot. Stainless steel small parts like the slide release, magazine release and beavertail grip safety, plus hand-checkered double diamond rosewood grips compliment the two-tone matte finish.The 1911 is proven to be the most dependable semi-automatic platform for a carry pistol, and Kimber makes the best 1911. Don’t trust your life to anything less than the best. Meprolight Tritium three dot night sights and an ambidextrous stainless steel thumb safety are standard CDP features.

But sell they must, and today! On the block now is something you don't see every day. Actually you never see these. This is a double-barreled 10 gauge side-by side with 18.25"" barrels. This is one bad hombre of a Joe Biden-approved home defense system. If you are thinking that 10-gauge rounds are expensive, you are right. But trust me, there are more smiles in a 25-round box of ten gauge out of this thing than are in a whole case of 556 or 9mm. This thing punches fist-size holes in silhouettes at 7 yards with 4 shot. Get some of Federal's 1-3/4oz slugs and it will keep them in the black of 25-yard pistol target at 50 yards offhand. And I am a terrible shot! Keep in mind that 1-3/4oz is 765 grains! That is heavier than .50 BMG ball ammo! This is not a gun for girly men. Details on gun: Made from a Spanish Universal Doublewing. It has dings, scratches and dents, but is beautifully made and functions well. Comes with a bandoleer of 14rounds, mostly 2-shot, and a soft case. Sacrifice because I need money fast at $375 firm. You pay background and transfer at the dealer of your choice in the Portland metro area. I suggest Tigard Pawn as it is close to me and has about the cheapest rates in town.More pictures (put a ""g"" at the end of that first link, armslist is wacky):http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j3/ptnewell/IMG_4084.jphttp://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j3/ptnewell/IMG_4083.jpghttp://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j3/ptnewell/IMG_4080.jpg"

This one is a 1994... the last year before the Clinton ""foreign import"" ban kicked in. They started producing these in the U.S. after that, but were never the same. The US version had polymer and polymer-coated parts and they sported black controls. The Italian version also features a molded ""wraparound"" grip with finger grooves that wasn't commonly used on the US models. The Bruniton finish on the aluminum frame is basically flawless and the gun has a low round count (500 from the original owner, 50 from me).I've held onto it for years because it's a really nice pistol, but I never liked the fatness of the double-stack grip and have moved on to 1911's. It's just sat in a safe for years now, so might as well let it go and free up space for something that I will actually shoot. Not a motivated seller... so the $600 price tag is firm. Includes the original marked ""Made in Italy""  Beretta case and both original 15-round factory mags.Buyer must have a CCW or valid purchase permit, with matching ID."
