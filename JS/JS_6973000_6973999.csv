I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as hard to find unfired EL CEN series bright stainless 1911 38 super, Colt Frontier Scout 22 magnum, Detective Specials including a blue one in shooter grade, a blue one in collector condition and an unfired nickel one. Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 4 inch Blue Colt Python, 6 inch nickel python, and 4 inch nickel Python (shot 6 times, amazing looking).Have a nice unfired factory engraved Smith and Wesson model 29-10 with factory wooden display box and a Walther PPK/s with 2 mags and matching box (smith and wesson).Have several 1911 guns in brands such as The rare unfired Colt El Cen 38 super listed above, and a rare unfired Remington R1 1911 Pearl Harbor edition, only 300 ever made, still has factory preserve oil on it.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome. I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

Browning Buck Mark Camper Pistol -Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX™ and Ultragrip DX™ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.The straight blowback design offers enhanced simplicity and reliability.Built-in recess and raised side panels for better grip. The convenient manual slide release is easily operated with the shooting or support hand.Most models have bull barrels for improved stability. Challenge model has a tapered barrel. Lite model has steel liner inside an ultralight aluminum sleeve. Each chamber is hand-reamed and muzzle crowns are recessed to protect them from damage that could degrade accuracy.16-click per revolution adjustable Pro-Target™ sight is standard on all models. This sight provides a finer range of adjustment over the industry’s standard of 12 clicks per revolution.Plus models feature a Truglo®/Marble’s® fiber-optic front sight. 5.5 Target includes hooded target sights.While many popular 22 pistols are cast or fabricated from sheet metal stampings, each Buck Mark frame is CNC machined from 7075-T6 aluminum to exacting tolerances.Heat treated magazine body for long-term feeding reliability. Coil spring provides more consistent follower angle than typical Z-spring. 10-round capacity.Positioned adjacent to the trigger guard for convenient operation.
Trigger -Compare it to the competition and feel its light, crisp break with less creep and overtravel.
Large, manual thumb safety. Trigger is disconnected when magazine is removed for added safety.

Up for sale is an absolutely perfect example of an LWRC - M6 with very low miles.  The rifle is basically all factory other than the Magpul stock and a BAD lever to allow for dual controls for bolt catch and release which helps facilitate both right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness.  I might have run 500 rounds max through this one and every shot was without malfunction and accurate as hell as expected from LWRC.  It includes the original LWRC Iron Sites and all the paperwork and items it came with as new.  Got this a while back, tried it out and loved it but I just don't have room for it presently.  I am taking a significant loss (losing my ass) on it as priced so I really don't have a lot of wiggle room in it.  I will definitely entertain any offers
