THE FIREARM HAS BEEN FIRED around 25 times Hello. These badass guns were built in staggering numbers from 1900 until, still going. There are many who believe that the Smith & Wesson N frames are the single best revolvers ever to be produced. In a world with a lot of revolvers, many of which are exceptionally well made guns, that is a bold claim. But it hardly stops there. As some of those Smith backers also believe that revolvers are vastly superior to automatics, the Smith & Wesson 41 Magnum begins to look like to pinnacle of immense handgun pyramid. SPECS This Price is for a S&W 657 no dash 41 Magnum revolver. It has RR, WO with goncalo alves grips. This Smith, which was made in 1986, has a 3in. barrel. I’d have to break out a scale to weigh this thing, but to hell with that. It is 2 1/2 pounds, easy. This gun was made in the era that appreciated big-block engines and Great curves on women. This firearm was made with all American Labor. There’s more steel in this Smith 657 than there is in a 2016 Ford F-150 doors, hood and some parts of the body .The round butt grip is original to the gun. The entire firearm is original. The fat flair at the end of the one-piece design forces your hand up on the grip. The trigger on this one breaks like some of those anemic fashion models, right at 8 pounds in double action mode, and just south of 3 pounds in single action. It is that good. In single action, there is no creep. No take up. No over travel. The rear sight is completely adjustable. These Smiths were originally made in Stainless Steel, like this one. Make no mistake–these 657 41 Magnum are beasts. With six rounds of 41 Magnum, the capacity is on par with most of the competition. The 3? barrel produces muzzle velocities in the 1,447 fps.Range 930 lbs Kinetic Energy. That’s on the slow end of the 41s, as the bullet can weigh more."

In its Smaller 7.5"" Length by 1.375"" O.D. and weighing in at only 10 oz while delivering 36-44dB Sound Reduction it takes precision shooting to a whole new level. Get yours today! Crux recommends this suppressor for all .260/6.5mm Caliber rifle systems and smaller like the 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, and even .243 or 6mm Creedmoor, 6mm BR the list goes on. This suppressor also delivers a lower tone on 5.56 AR15 platforms while being only 1-2dB louder than the Saxon in .223 Caliber. The Saxon6.5 is by far the lightest, Smallest, and Best Performing 6.5mm suppressor on the market today. This is the lightest, quietest, toughest suppressor on the market. This is a new Class of SUppressors and Crux is the Best in this Class. Its why Crux Suppressors has been leading all technology development in the suppressor market for 4 years. Get yours today! The Saxon is a new evolution of the Sigma baffle design. When they started pushing their technology way beyond normal they found that the Sigman baffle design become more efficient and did more work. So they wondered if they could shrink the design down and get better performance. They were not only impressed with the Saxon they were blown away. Never has a suppressor this small done so much sounds suppression. In its big brother's (the Ark) 7.5"" in length (7"" added) and smaller 1.375"" O.D. this suppressor weighs in at only 10 oz and delivers 40-44dB sound reduction making it the top performing suppressor on the market. Suppressor Technology  Built with Templar Tactical's Pantented Sigma Baffle Technology developed with the latest in computational fluid analysis. They developed supersonic vortices in every baffle. This means that the harder you push it the more suppression it does. It also makes it possible to reduce the size of the suppressor. They were able to achieve this by running computational fluid analysis on all of their suppressors and this one has been through the ringer so to speak, squeaking out every last micro decibel out of this design. Crux also increased gas retention time to 50% longer than any other suppressor on the marker. Like the Archangel they tested many versions of this can in computational fluid analysis and they manipulate the gas flow at the right instant to improve accuracy and maximize sound suppression in a relatively small 1.375"" diameter and 7.5"" length package weighing in at just over 10 oz. This is why Crux Suppressors is the industry leader in hearing safe mini suppressors. The Sigma baffle design does more ""work"" the harder you push it. This is what makes Crux suppressors outperform all others on the market. In order for the baffle system to work and outperform the suppressor's size needs to be reduced to form more violent tornadoes. This patented divergence from the competiton's understanding of supersonic gas flow is why Crux suppressors can be so small and light and still out perform suppressors that are 2-5 times the size and weight.  Mounting System  The Precision Mounting System (PMS) is a modular precision suppressor mounting system that utilizes self locking threads, a conical coaxial alignment feature that perfectly mounts their suppressors to your firearm. The PMS system includes brakes, flash hiders, direct thread adapters, A2 flash hider adapters, OEM flash hider adapters, and more to come in the future. The PMS system has proven to be a more robust design than direct thread mounting systems and the performance meets the stringent accuracy requirements of Crux.  The Benefits  Self-Locking: Taking active rotational force to rotate it will not come loose or shoot off like others.

The Saxon has already tied the Ark30 as their most popular line giving you the best of both suppression and a small light weight package! These are going fast, get your's today! Crux recommends this suppressor for a cross compatible suppressor solution for 9mm pistols and AR15s as well as .338 Lapua Magnums. This is also a great do all suppressor and is impressive on all short action calibers and great hunting calibers like the 35 Whelen. The Saxon9 is by far the lightest, Smallest, and Best Performing 338 Lapua Magnum suppressor in the market today metering at 136-138 depending on the rifle platform. And to make it even better its an amazing 9mm pistol suppressor on the market. This is a new Class of Suppressors and Crux is the Best in this Class. Its why Crux Suppressors has been leading all technology development in the suppressor market for 4 years. Get yours today! The Saxon is a new evolution of the Sigma baffle design. When they started pushing their technology way beyond normal they found that the Sigma baffle design become more efficient and did more work. So they wondered if they could shrink the design down and get better performance. They were not only impressed with the Saxon they were blown away. Never has a suppressor this small done so much sound suppression. In its big brother's (the Ark) 7.5"" length (7"" added) and smaller 1.375"" Q.D. this suppressor weighs in at only 10 oz and delivers 40-44 dB sound reduction making it the top performing suppressor on the market. The Saxon9 is already becoming very popular with Military and Law Enforcement that want the ultimate in miniature size with powerful sound suppression and the ability to switch between their AR15, 9mm Pistol, 300 Win Mag, .308 Winchester, and even .338 Lapua Magnums with one suppressor. Using their Brake Attachment they rate the Saxon9 for full auto/hard semi-automatic use. All of their suppressors now come in their Extreme Duty (XD) configuration. This means that you can run them on 5"" SBRs. If you want to take a 338 Lapua Magnum and neck that cartridge up to a .358 Cal creating your own custom caliber, then this suppressor will easily handle this extreme set up. Crux has take the guess work out of suppressor ratings...its rated for anything fitted for .358/9mm and lower. The Saxon9 more than hearing safe on the .338 Lapua Magnum at 136-138dB depending on the platform configuration. This is the lightest, quietest, toughest suppressor on the market. This is a new Class of Suppressors and Crux is the Best in this Class. Its why Crux Suppressors has been leading all technology development in the suppressor market for 3 years. Nowhere can you get a full auto, 5"" SBR rated, suppressor at 9 oz added to your rifle, and only 4"" added in length. Suppressor Technology  Built with Templar Tactical's Patented Sigma Baffle Technology developed with the latest in computational fluid analysis. They developed supersonic vortices in every baffle. This means they use the laws of nature to work with them versus against them. It also means that the harder you push it the more supression it does. It also makes it possible to reduce the size of the suppressor. They were able to achieve this by running computational fluid analysis on all of their suppressors and this one has been through the ringer so to speak, squeaking out every last micro decibel out of this design. Crux also increased gas retention time to 50% longer than any other suppressor on the market. Like the Archangel they tested many versions of this can in computational fluid analysis and they mamipulate the gas flow at the right instant to improve accuracy and maximize sound suppression in a relatively small 1.375"" diameter and 7.5"" length package weighing in at just over 10 oz. This is why Crux Suppressors is the industry leader in hearing safe mini suppressors. The Sigma baffle design does more ""work"" the harder you push it. This is what makes Crux suppressors outperform all others on the market. In order for the baffle system to work and outperform the suppressor's size needs to be reduced to form more violent tornadoes. This patented divergence from the competition's understanding of supersoic gas flow is why Crux suppressors can be so small and light and still out perform suppressors that are 2-5 times the size and weight.  Mounting System  The Precision Mounting Sytem (PMS) is a modular precision suppressor mounting system that utilizes self locking threads, a conical coaxial alignment feature that perfectly mounts their suppressors to your firearm. The PMS system includes brakes, flash hiders, direct thread adapters, and more to come in the future. The PMS system has proven to be a more robust design than direct thread mounting systems and the performance meets the stringent accuracy requriements of Crux.  The Benefits  Self Locking: Taking active rotational force to rotate it will not come loose or shoot off like others No Teeth to Wear Out No Mechanisms to Activate Under Firearm Rail Compatible Metal to Metal Aerospace Seal Conical Locating Feature: Perfect Accuracy Mount"

Like new condition. Bought 1 year ago from Gander last Jan. I used it on one duck trip for 3 days, about 125 rounds through it, cleaned twice daily, then super cleaned it and put it in the safe. Actually I dropped it at Gander because it was the end of the season and I had a free expert cleaning from purchasing the extended warranty (which is transferable), and I didn't feel comfortable taking it completely apart. It's definitely like brand new.Last shotgun you'll ever need! Just selling as we have some expenses with new addition to the family.
 
Included is the factory hard case, Owners Manual-Warranty Card, 5 Chokes, Choke Wrench, Shim Kit(for adjusting stock Cast,Camber and Drop) and ComfortTech Buttstock.

The Alpha uses 6AL4V Titanium components to drop weight to 14.5 ounces for a .300 Win Mag rated suppressor that weighs less than most market 5.56mm offerings. The Ratchet-Lok front cap and keyed together baffles allow the alpha to be disassembled by the end user for cleaning and ease of service. Traditionally welded construction allowed the greatest confidence because serviceable suppressors were comprised of multiple components that could loosen. The Alpha's active locking front cap removes this concern and allows end users to remove copper and lead deposits which rob volume and add parasitic weight to centerfire suppressors over time. This allows lead bullets and rimfire use without concerns of damage to the suppressor. The Alpha features a CNC machined, billet tube body for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. 17-4 provides double the strength of traditional 316L SS tube bodies, providing redundant strength for additional safety. A 17-4 blast baffle reduces sparking common in titanium suppressors. Years of internal testing has found 17-4 stainless steel to provide longer service life than 718 Inconel, the prior market leading alloy. 17-4 stainless is also twice as strong as cast Stelite 6. A Taper Mount Minimalist Brake, dissassembly tools, and a 1/2x28 direct thread adapter are included, making the Alpha a terrific value. Overall SPL on a 12"" 300 BLK with Remington 220 Subsonic is 123dB, quieter than some 22 rimfire suppressors on the market. Whether hunting your favorite game or rucking on a long range patrol the Alpha is the rifght tool for the job.

For an affordable, lightweight, and durable silencer, the Spartan 3 is a perfect fit.  Diameter: 1.5"" Overall Length: 6.25"" Length Added: VS.

Knight's developed and fielded a much faster and easier system of connection which evolved into the Gat Latch. This system was first fielded on the M4QDSS and now the NT4 and M110/SR25 suppressors. The suppressor slips over a compatible muzzle device and the twin post latch, or gate, slides down into fitted grooves on the muzzle device. The gat latches down and a locking ring is twisted into place for a secure fit that maintains its connection even through high cyclic firing rates. This system allows for quick attachment and detachment without sacrificing a secure fit.

It is one of the lightest most durable, accurate, and high performance 5.56mm suppressors on the market. The Recce 5, weighs only 14.5 ounces on it's own and a mere 16.3 ounces as a suppressor system with the included Taper Mount Minimalist Brake. The included Taper Mount ensures minimal and repeatable point of impact shift with only minor weight gain. The Recce 5 achieves out of this world sound performance vs its size. Utilizing their Patent Pending Efficiency Baffle Technology this compact suppressor drops SPL by 35dB on a 14.5"" M4 while keeping gas block back to normal levels. To increase performance for military users a high efficiency low profile flash suppressor was integrated into the front of the suppressor. This feature reduces flash, providing minimal signature for the user in low light environments. Also new to the Recce 5 (Mod3) is a tuned, Patent Pending baffle system offering the apogee of multi-caliber sound performance. Elite tactical units requested minimal flash signature and Griffin responded by developing a low-profile flash reducer integral to the suppressor. For users seeking a dual role suppressor that can run on both tactical carbines and precision varmint rigs this is the ticket. At 14.5 ounces the Recce 5 is extremely light on the end of the gun keeping your muzzle fast on target, and enabling fatigue free carry for extended periods of time. The Recce 5 is CNC machined, and TIG fusion welded for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. Every component in the Recce 5 is manufactured from solid billets of strong, heat treated, high temperature corrosion resistant 17-4PH Stainless Steel. The Recce 5 suppressor has a precision bore ensuring maximum accuracy, as well as minimum, consistent, and repeatable POI shift. A Taper Mount Minimalist Brake is included making the Recce 5 a good value and a turn key suppressor system. Whether hunting your favorite game or rucking on a long range patrol the Recce 5 is the right tool for the job.

The Warlock II has minimal first round pop for optimal discretion. From varmint hunting to plinking, this .22 suppressor will ensure quiet success.The Warlock II has unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and user serviceability, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for  a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue they must be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Warlock II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily.  Warlock II   Caliber: .22 LR Weight: 3.0 OZ Diameter: 1.0"" Length: 6.0"" Sound Level: 117 dB (tested with Walther P22, CCI Standard Velocity) Finish: Hard Coat Anodized Materials:  Baffles & End Caps: 7075 T6 Aluminum, Tube: 6061 T6 Aluminum, Thread Mount:17-4 Stainless Steel Features: User Serviceable with CTA Baffles, Lifetime Warranty Lightweight, O-Ring engagement to keep barrel threads clean and the silencer securely mounted"

This ultra-light, combat-ready suppressor is constructed from the highest-quality titanium—one of the world’s lightest and strongest materials—and is designed and manufactured with extreme tolerances to ensure accuracy and meet the demands of a precision sniper. It features the same cutting-edge technology and design as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC and SOCOM762-RC suppressors, which were selected by U.S. Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in U.S. history.  At only 10 inches long and 22 ounces in total weight, the SOCOM338-Ti adds minimal length and weight to the weapon, minimizing any impact on weapon-handling characteristics. The suppressor tube is constructed from Grade 9 titanium, while the front plate, baffles, and lock ring are machined from Grade 5 titanium. Unprecedented accuracy is achieved from bore concentricity that exceeds match-grade ammo requirements and back-section tolerances that are tighter than a human hair, so the weapon shoots with nominal and consistent point-of-impact shift when suppressed, regardless of the number of attach/detach cycles.  Advanced internal venting reduces back pressure, lowering the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback onto the operator and increasing weapon reliability, while the unique front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminate first-round flash. This is a crucial benefit for the warfighter. Like all SureFire SOCOM Fast-Attach suppressors, the SOCOM338-Ti superbly attenuates a weapon’s sound, flash, and dust signature, helping to conceal an operator’s location. And for added safety, the suppressor features fail-safe baffles, which prevent a bullet from exiting out the side of the suppressor.  The combat-proven patented Fast-Attach design provides rock-solid attachment/detachment of the suppressor with no tools required. An innovative mounting adapter, which also serves as a high-performance muzzle brake that enhance a weapon’s performance when unsuppressed, features tapered multiple bearing surfaces for tight mating with the suppressor’s back section. For added durability and a long service life, the suppressor is coated with Cerakote and Ionbond DLC, available in Black or Dark Earth. This rugged suppressor is durable enough for fulltime use and, in most cases, SureFire suppressors outlast the barrels to which they are attached.  All SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing an operator's position and preserving dark-adapted vision; reduce dust signature, concealing an operator’s position and maintaining an unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.  The SOCOM338-TI-BK/DE is only compatible with the SFMB-338-3/4-24 or SFMB-338-5/8-24 muzzle brakes and is not backward compatible with 7.62 or 5.56 muzzle brakes and flash hiders.Features  Constructed entirely of ultra-light, ultra-strong titanium, which reduces weight with no sacrifice in strength and minimal impact on weapon-handling characteristics Engineered and built based on revolutionary design of SureFire SOCOM556-RC and SOCOM762-RC suppressors, winners of USSOCOM’s most extensive, rigorous suppressor trials ever Patented Fast-Attach design provides rock-solid no-tools attachment and easy removal in seconds Excellent accuracy resulting from bore concentricity that exceeds match-grad ammo requirements and back-section tolerances tighter than a human hair; minimal and consistent point-of-impact shift Superb sound, flash, and dust signature attenuation Advanced design reduces backpressure, suppressed cyclic rate, and gas blowback Extreme durability for long service life; coated with Cerakote and Ionbond DLC in Black or Dark Earth Every suppressor is individually test fired to ensure quality Proudly designed and built in the USA  Specifications:  Caliber: 8.6mm (.338 caliber) Length: 10.00 Weight: 22 oz Diameter: 2.0"""

So far the gun has been very reliable and does well feeding FMJ and HP ammo with no problems that I have experienced. Metal and bore in great shape. It has a higher power recoil spring and I installed a Wilson shok-buff so it shoots softer. Pistol has full length guide rod as well. The heavy recoil spring is not installed, I bought it because my plan was to use .45 Super for deer hunting but I never did. The frame and slide are heat treated so they can handle higher pressure loads, and Rowland even lists it as a preferred brand for their .460 Rowland chambering. comes with 4 extra mags, a sticky holster, blackhawk OWB holster, carrying pouch, and 20 rounds of .45 super.

The SOCOM556-MONSTER features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire's patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.  A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a current-model SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous versions, and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area.  Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MONSTER produces minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.  The SOCOM556-MONSTER is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach lock ring and Cerakote ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.  All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm. See Parts and Accessories on this page.  SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.  All SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.  NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders. Features:  Patented Fast-Attach design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds Identical to the SureFire SOCOM556-RC, but with serrated teeth on the front plate Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials Provides effective attenuation of sound and dust signatures Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach-detach cycles Compact and lightweight for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics Advanced core design to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash Integrated blast shield increases durability Constructed of advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and stainless steel Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote finish in Black or Dark Earth color"

Pmag.  This is a new unfired rifle that I never got around to doing anything with because of other projects.  I chose this particular AR-10 because I wanted a bit more range than a 16"" barrel would give and the medium contour barrel keeps the rifle as light as possible without compromising accuracy.  After looking over lots of ballistic data I saw no reason to go with a 20"" barrel, IMO the gain in velocity was simply not worth the extra length and weight.  Again, the rifle is new but it was purchased around three years ago, the only one I could find currently listed was one on Gunbroker for $1,650 in the same configuration.  I do have aftermarket pistol grips and stocks I can add for a little extra, just let me know.
$1,360 in cash or will look at good trade offers.  This one cost well over $1,500 after tax and it's new. 
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter in 9mm and .45 ACP and cash or??  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal and I will consider.
Must be able to own a firearm in TX.  I can ship insured to another TX resident for $30 more.
Thanks for looking!"

$340 in cash or may trade.  
Will look at trades, but not in need of anything at the moment, except maybe a nice 8""-10"" AR upper in 5.56 and shorter 9mm and .45ACP.  Might also look at a Glock 19, maybe 17 with factory Glock 15rd. to 30+ round mags, prefer a Gen 4 with bright night sights, but will look at Gen 3's too.  Not looking for one that has been ""customized"", except maybe a trigger improvement.  If wanting to trade, just let me know exactly what you have and how many rounds you need for it.       
Thanks"

Designed on the LWRCi Monoforge Upper Receiver with Modular 7"" Rail System. Like all IC Six8 models the PDW-Six8 is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on their patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCi raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance - delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the PDW-Six8. LWRCi Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard. Their investmetn castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb. The Kriss Vector GenII is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system and is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The Kriss Vector GenII is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The Kriss Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the Kriss Vector platform. It features a short, threaded 5.5"" barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the Kriss Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and Glock magazine.

Just very minor handling wear.The Hunter barrel is also in super nice condition. It has Williams Tru-glo sights [orig Browning rifle sights are in case] and a Browning Invector choke tube marked “Mod lead/IM Steel”.Extras include: Extended magazine complete with lengthened spring, spacer/adapter and barrel clamp stabilizer with short side mount picatinny railBrowning slug/sabot rifled adapter tube with wrenchBrowning “Duck Commander Full” choke tubeBrowning “Full Lead or Steel” choke tubeBrowning “Turkey/Deer No Slugs or Sabots” choke tubeSet of 5 Choke tubes that are unmarked as to make. Look to be Briley stainless. Includes IC, LF, IM, M, and SK. Just like the ones on the Browning website.Genuine Browning covered wood case with plush interior. Just beautiful 98%+ condition with keys. Inside is fitted out for the 2-barrel set with the extra chokes encased in 2 hard plastic protectors. Rifled tube and wrench are in separate plastic tube. Has the 'T' wrench for the Invector choke tubes as well.This is the best and most complete all-around pump shotgun set I have seen in a long time. Has been lightly used and cared for by a professional. Everything is in superb condition. Hunt everything from dove to elk and only carry one gun case. The gun shoots smoothly and patterns very well. Reminds me somewhat of the Ithaca Model 37. Bottom load and eject make it an excellent fit for left or right hand shooters.Put it all together new for about $1800 or so. You arent going to find another used set as nice as this one at anywhere near my cash price.Might listen to an interesting trade. Trades must be in excellent to near-new condition like my set and face to face. If the ad is live the gun is for sale.Shipping and handling, packaging at buyer's expense. Prepaid only.

I have 3 extra 8 round magazines and a 6-pack of Ed Brown bump pads that I have not installed on the magazines. I will also include 3 boxes of FMJ ammo. The original STI polymer trigger and Heine sights come with it. You MUST be legally able to possess this firearm and ammo and I require your name and date of birth prior to the sale as well as a copy of a current Missouri drivers license and completed bill of sale for the purchase. I reserve the right to refuse sale if I suspect you are attempting to purchase the pistol unlawfully."

Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.         Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.           Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.           Accessory Rail Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories           Model: 1-111031G2-12         Finish: Black         Status: Available               Caliber: 9mm Luger         Grips: Polymer Grips         UPC: 7-25327-61060-1               Capacity: 12 +1         Weight: 22 oz.         Barrel Length: 3.2""               Height: 5.1""         Frame: Compact         Width: 1.2""               Action: SA/DA         Front Sight: Fixed         Length: 6.3""               Safety: Manual Safety, Taurus Security System, Trigger safety         Order #: 1-111031G2-12         MSRP: $310.56   ON SALE WITH WELLS ARMORY LLC FOR $239.99  REDACTED               Rear Sight: Adjustable- 2 Dots"
