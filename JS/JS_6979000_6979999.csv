Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.
The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch’s American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components."

In 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's Sao Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs. This pistol is arguably from that period of time when Taurus' reputation was pretty good and it is a clone (not an exact copy) of the Berretta Cheeta. It is a DA/SA with no decocker. I have carried it so there is some holster wear on the front sharp edges of the receiver and some minor dings on the grips. Everything in the pic goes with the gun. The magazines are 12 round though getting the last two in is kind of a struggle. Sale is for cash only, face to face, Montana Driver's license required so I know you are a resident."

I intended to build a 3 gun rig. Changed my mind (building a 300 Blackout now) and forgot to cancel the order. Upper is brand new in the box as received from Seekins. Only took out of the box for pictures. $825 shipped to your door (lower 48). Text REDACTED or send a PM for payment options. Description below from Seekins website:The SPRO3G is an incredibly versatile complete upper receiver. By using a carbine configuration for quick handling characteristics, Seekins Precision exacting manufacturing processes and components give it precision rifle accuracy. This makes it a great upper receiver for 3 gun competition as well as tactical applications. Building the ultimate competition upper starts with the proven iRMT-R Upper Receiver. CNC machined from 7075-T6 billet aluminum, the iRMT-3 Upper Receiver’s handguard mount is machined into the upper to strengthen the receiver and maintain accuracy throughout long shot strings. Coupled with the receiver is the SP3RV3 hand guard. Flat on the bottom for stability when shooting off of barricades or other objects, the unique design is thin for use in dynamic shooting and rifle handling situations. Machined from 6061-T6 aluminum with MLOK slots, a top integral rail and integral QD sling mounting points, the SP3RV3 is the perfect hand guard for tactical, competition or sporting applications.The Seekins Precision 18” Match Grade Barrel aids in the quick handling and accuracy. Each barrel is inspected four times to insure match grade tolerances for maximum accuracy and performance. Chambered in .223 Wylde, the barrel comes standard with the Seekins Precision Advanced Tactical Compensator.Tuning the gas system is critical to maximize performance and reliability. The SPRO3 comes with the Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block, Melonited Rifle Length Gas Tube and M16 Bolt Carrier Group to fine the gas system for smoother cycling and operation. All are Melonite coated to resist corrosion and wear. This also aids in easier cleaning, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.Quick handling carbine with precision rifle performanceiRMT-3 Billet UpperMelonited Adjustable Gas Block, Gas tube and M16 Bolt Carrier Group18” Match Grade Barrel w / Seekins Armorblack CoatingRifle Length Gas SysyemSeekins Precision Advanced Tactical CompensatorSP3Rv3 MLOK handguard"

I've got so many people asking me, is it an ACR?So the base gun is a M10 which is a Romanian AK. Hold your breathe there, it's not the normal Romanian WASR that imported by CAI can compare of. M+M has imported brand new gun from their Arsenal (other than assembled with some ""Part kit"" as century does), and then CNC cut the magwell here in the US. It has 16"" Cold Hammer Forged barrel Made in Romania, all other parts are also brand new mil spec Rom made, only with some quality US substitute parts to make it 922r compliant, such as Tapco G2 trigger, etc. So you can use either imported or US made magazine.CAI sued M+M for they are making better rifle (well, the excuse is they accuse them break the monopoly contract), and these M10 are the most accurate AKs I've ever seen. I do precision shooting, and a good way to exam a rifle is shooting 5 groups of 5 shot each. You can get lucky shot for 1 group of 3 shots, but 5x5 don't cheat. and that's the method many professional firearm reviewers use. Shooting @ 100 yard with a 3-9x scope, I can get 5x5 test average of 1.5 moa (which is impressive for an AK) out of Brown Bear HP ammo.Upgrade has been done, including: M10                                                                                                                                 - 699.99 (when I purchased and hard to find now.)whole gun FDE ceracoat,                                                                                                   - 350Kerbs enhanced bolt hold open safety lever,                                                                    - 60M+M enhanced mag release with CAA extended ambi mag release lever,    - 60Ultimak gas tube with picatinny rails,                                                                                  - 98ALL FDE Magpul furniture: Zhukov hand guard and Zhukov-S Stock, hogue grip,                                                                                                                                               - 220Latest Gen AK Compact Muzzle brake from CNC Warrior, same as those used by Russian Spec Ops.                                                                                                             - 60Shock absorber installed.                                                                                                   - 10GripPOD G.P.S. 02 foregrip / Bipod combo. the real US military stuff, not Chinese knock offs.                                                                                                                  - 100I will include 2 to 4 steel AK mags into this package.So you can do the maths, I spent well over 1600 on this gun.

This is their sister company, and yes they're both produced in the phillipines. However, the Citadel is considered the slightly nicer version of the RIA models, with their sights cut out for NOVAK and Dovetailed so that they fit regular stock 1911 sights. This gun was my EDC, so it comes with a couple extra accessories that I'll be throwing in for no extra charge. The TFO night sights are still new (about a year old), so the tritium is still good at night, and the fiber optics pull light during the day and you really grab a fast sight picture because of it. I had the entire gun cerakoted a nice matte black, because I felt that it helps make the gun easier to clean, and it blends in a lot better with the holster. I've done my research on the value and cost of the gun, and I assure you that I'm losing out on this deal.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating ""pusher"" rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating ""pusher"" rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 ""Picatinny"" rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picatinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly. are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unqiue manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers belive best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178mm) twist. It is also moderately ""swagged"" with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5"" MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the M556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56x45mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensionedchamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commision Internationale Permanete). The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preemient AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new porduct. Technology: Highest Quality Steel:  They use the same grade steel used in making cannon barrels - for its rifle barrels. Using the famous HK cold hammer forging process, this advanced technology manufacturing produces a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. It is also moderately ""swagged"" with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity and the thick, heavy contour MR series barrels also contributes to its precision.

I added all the upgrades while the rifle was still unfired and have since ran exactly 100 rounds of xm193 thru it. The rifle preformed flawlessly. And at 100 rounds the rifle is still not broken in according to manufacturer recommendations.  I'm pricing this to sell right now. $800 cash and carry with proof of KY residency. I hate to sell it but life happens and I need the cash for other things. I will not meet half way, this is the you come to me price. I will not negotiate, the price is firm. I have roughly $1200 invested, it's already priced at 2/3 of what I have in it. No trades at this price, no shipping, not gonna play the armslist games. Due to spam i will not answer ""still have?"" Emails. Just google map the Danville walmart and tell me when you can be there cash in hand. If the ad is up its still available, I will mark it pending in the title bar if someone claims to be on their way."
