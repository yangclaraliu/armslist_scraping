LIKE NEW CONDITION!!Item#What’s different about the Ambush, besides its cartridge, is its free-floating modular tube handguards as opposed to quad rails. The tube has a single Picatinny rail running along the top for easy mounting of optics or accessories. And it lacks vertical fore-grip.
It has a mid-length gas operating system, so propellant gases are caught in a tube near the muzzle, the tube guides it back to the bolt and then catches in another tube on the bolt. When the gas is caught, it drives the bolt back. This delays recoil until the projectile has left the bore. Mid-length means that the gas is caught after a medium distance in the barrel, so less pressure is used to push the bolt back (compared to the short length gas system).This 6.8mm is your next pig gun!!!"

I am adding this information. I received this from a gentleman where this item is for sale on another venue. It appears he is knowledgeable.
 

Hi Mike --
I will try to be helpful Identifying what you have --
A set of ""310"" dies less the handles --  common way to find them as the handles are interchangable between calibers.
Starting at left --
Priming die --- s/b marked #2 for 30/06 size case heads.
expander die -- s/b marked 301 or 311 on top of plug and perhaps long on die proper -
CMR die -- Sizing die and decapping --  should be marked CMR 06 or perhaps 123  ---  This die neck sizes only -
DA seating die --  S/b marked  DA  06 or perhaps 123
seating plug will be marked with a Bullet nose number
such as 450  291 311 or any of a dozen other 3 digit numbers.
Last item is the Handle adapter s/b marked #2 , again for 06 size case heads.  This adaptes the handles to accept different caliber cases -
 
Hope this proves helpful -- Lyman 310 tooling has a long history and is confusing at best  --"

Model 1890 .44-40 WCF Single action Revolver. Remington Arms ONLY made 2020 of this model between 1890 and 1896. The top of the barrel is stamped “REMINGTON ARMS CO. ILION, NY” The left side of the lower frame is faintly stamped “44 CFW” The Serial Number of 11XX is stamped on the bottom left side of the frame near the butt area. This revolver has Serial Number 11XX. This pistol has a Six Shot cylinder. Has 5-3/4"" barrel. I contacted the Remington Arms company historical division and they indicated that this particular model 1890 was produced between 1891 and 1894 and that the exact date of records was destroyed and damaged beyond recovery, due to a factory accident. I believe this Remington Model 1890 had been Re-Blued in the 1950’s and the bluing is in VERY good condition. It does NOT have the original factory bluing. I am the second owner of this revolver. The original family owner was from the Austin Texas area. I live in Houston Texas. The original hard rubber grips are in good used condition with few nicks and with a chip missing (about ¼” by 1” long on the left bottom grip) and the upper indie tab is broken off the right grip with a small crack on the bottom butt plate area. See photographs. Once the grips are screwed onto the frame, they fit snug. The single action clicks open tight and strong as the hammer falls tight.

It's all original and in excellent condition, shiny bore with strong rifling, very smooth action with the factory Target Trigger and Target hammer. Part of why these 29-2 era guns book for more money is that they are so well put together, right from the factory the single action pull is a crisp 3 pounds or less and the double action pull is smooth and even. The blued factory finish is a high gloss and this gun retains 98% of it, the case colors on the trigger and hammer are nearly all there with the only wear from where they touch the frame which is normal. No rust at all on this older 1970's double action revolver, its the true ""Dirty Harry"" model. The grips are the original factory grips, I'm not sure what type of wood, they are in excellent condition with only a couple of very lite marks on them. It has all of the extras that the other models have to be special ordered to get, these come standard on the big ""N"" frame 44's like red insert front sight and the white out line rear sight, the already mentioned target trigger and hammer and the target grips which are of course the square butt configuration. Its just the gun, no wood case or tools and no paper work, just a nice condition Smith & Wesson model 29-2..shipment is within 48 hours of receipt of verified funds."

Just time to move on to other things.I built this particular gun with a bunch of random parts I had laying around my shop, hand-me-down stuff, and a serialized Armory USA receiver that was formerly a welded together monstrosity that was part Yugo M70, part Romy G. Receiver is an Armory USA unit that is ugly, partially painted, and was beat to pieces to get the previous MIG welds out of it. It's not going to win any beauty contests, but it functions.The front end of this gun is a post-ban Hungarian milled piece that has a chrome-lined hammer forged barrel. Note that this is NOT threaded and does have a hole drilled into the muzzle from the previous owner. Does not affect accuracy or function, but it sure is ugly.Bol, carrier, and gas tube are from a Hungarian AK63DFront and rear trunnions are from a Romanian rifle... G? WASR?Other parts and furinture are a mixed bag of whatever I had that fit. All parts have been hand-fit and properly assembled to spec with rivets by a builder with probably a bazillion AKs under his belts (me)Price is $600 OBOIf it goes for $600 I will include a sweet battleworn 30 Round Romanian magazine and a 40 round Romanian RPK mag.

This ammunition is manufactured in the USA using .308 diameter Flat Point heavy poly-metal coated ultra-hard lead-antimony core projectiles.These bullets are precision die cast with the top quality alloy followed by a thick polymer coating and a full resizing to ensure top accuracy and quality.
We use once-fired military/police brass which is acid washed and processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected to ensure safe internal tolerances. We use a high end Camdex 223 rifle case processor then our proprietary trim/cut off machine to very accurately reform the casings to 300 BLK.
In our loading process we only use the top quality SMP powders and ATK primers. Powder is dropped to +/- 0.1 grain accuracy to ensure the highest performance. Cartridges are loaded with H110, A1680, or similar proper powder to cycle AR-15 actions. Every single round is hand-inspected and loaded one by one to the tightest specifications."

The face of thecap at the smoke (day) end is smooth. A label on theouter surface around the whole body of the signalfurther identifies the smoke (day) and flame (night)ends. This label has instructions for its use.These things put out tons or dense orange smoke. I have 28 of these, two sealed containers of 12 and a partial container of 4. I'm asking 10.00 each or 8.00 each if you buy all of them! I want to get these things sold, feel free to make a offer!"

That is the Nighthawk Guarantee.**One Gun, One Gunsmith. At Nighthawk, each pistol is built from start to finish by a single gunsmith. Our slogan and philosophy, “One Gun, One Gunsmith,” is the direct result of how we build our guns. Once a pistol is built, the builder test fires the pistol to insure that it exceeds both The Nighthawk Standard, and his own. He then uses a metal stamp to imprint his initials under the left grip panel. While this is not the fastest, most efficient, or most cost-effective way to build a firearm, this shows the highest level of ownership, and it signifies the pride and commitment our gunsmiths take in the work they do. In addition to having the most talented gunsmiths in the industry building each gun by hand, Nighthawk also uses the highest quality parts and components to build each gun. All parts used in the pistols are fully machined from bar stock steel. This is the FM, Fully Machined Series of parts. Each part used is oversized and must be fit to each gun by hand - there are no drop-in, cast, or MIM parts used in the work we do. When the highest quality parts are combined with the most talented gunsmiths in the industry, through the process of One Gun, One Gunsmith, the resulting quality is unparalleled. It is our privilege to work with numerous talented, hardworking, passionate individuals. Our customers, vendors, and the loyal Nighthawk team, are more than just friends; we’re family."

LEFT HAND , 300 WIN MAG. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. . THE WORLDS LARGEST BLASER DEALER. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Manual Cocking System The R8 offers the capability of safely stalking with a round in the chamber without any chance of discharge due to the innovative manual cocking system. Without the need to move your hand from the pistol grip you can silently push the cocking lever forward allowing the firing pin and spring to be cocked, ensuring a shot at a moments notice. To de-cock the system simply push the cocking lever forward with slight downward pressure and the lever will return to the neutral position removing all tension to the firing pin spring. For the past half century the Blaser manual cocking system has been recognized as one of the safest systems in hunting rifles.No conventional safety system can surpass the uncocked firing pin spring. To safely open the bolt, simply move the cocking lever forward until you meet the first resistance (about 3 mm?/?1/8“) to unlock the bolt handle. This slight movement will not cock the rifle and you can load and unload the rifle safely. Protected against unauthorized access The unique design of the intergrated trigger/magazine assembly allows the trigger/magazine unit to be removed and stored separately. This important safety feature protects against misuse by unauthorized persons. Automatic Decocking By removing the trigger/magazine unit the R8 can no longer be cocked. Additionally removing the system from a cocked rifle, the cocking lever will return to the de-cocked position. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact. When traveling, the R8 can be transported stripped down in a rifle case. In contrast to very long conventional rifle cases, passers-by do not recognize the R8’s inconspicuous rifle case. Locked Magazine The double release buttons protect the magazine against unintentional drop out. Our innovation does not stop there. We also incorporated a locking device for the hunter who prefers a non-detachable magazine. When the magazine is locked in place, and with an open bolt, the rifle can be loaded from the top. Protected All metal parts of the R8 are either made of rustproof material or otherwise protected against corrosion. The closed construction of the R8 action prevents contaminants from entering the rifle. Every magazine comes with a protective cover (1) preventing dirt from entering the rifle when the magazine is stored outside of it. When taking out the magazine, the magazine chamber can be closed with a magazine chamber cover (2) which is included in the scope of delivery. Desmodromic Trigger Mechanism The critical link between shooter and rifle is the trigger. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing. This important design feature offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Hunting around the world There is no better advantage to a hunter than the ability to use one rifle anywhere in the world. With calibers ranging from .222 Rem to .416 Rem. Mag. there are no limitations for your Blaser. and more to come. Several rifle scopes on one barrel Every barrel is prepared for the Original Blaser Saddle Mount.
