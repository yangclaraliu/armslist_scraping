This is basically an upgraded Gewehr 98 with some cosmetic differences. Date stamp is 1942 from a Turkish arsenal. Ridiculously smooth action and surprisingly accurate rifle. Often considered the best value Mauser rifles on the market with great condition metal and wood. Well maintained and only used with non-corrosive, factory loaded ammunition. Current value of the rifle is approx ~$300 USD due to condition, vintage, and model.I am selling this as a package and will include approx 570 rounds of ammunition from various surplus lots. One such lot are 190 cartridges loaded on 5-round clips on cloth bandoliers. Another lot of 80 rounds are new boxed on clips as well. The rest are a mixture of German and Turkish surplus cartridges. These are primarily military surplus rounds and are subject to the nature of surplus ammunition - being extremely powerful and incapable of being shot in indoor ranges or at things you don’t want to be super dead afterwards. Some ammo might be ""collectible"" due to unique headstamps and origin, however, I am no expert to identify and/or confirm this, thus I am marketing at deeply discounted rates. The value of the ammunition would easily be approx ~$350 USD if purchased from stores and other sources.I can provide a plethora of additional images. Will ship if desired, you pay shipping, fees, and FFL fees. I prefer Paypal Paypal fees covered by buyer or F&F.Price is rock solid, I am in no need or hurry to sell. $375 is already my absolute bottom dollar.I am only looking to trade UP in value (your stuff has to be worth MUCH more than $375 USED bottom-dollar-market valueI can almost guarantee you that your AR15, generic shotguns, or generic pistols will not catch my interest. If you want to ""add cash"" to a partial trade, I will value your items at the BOTTOM-DOLLAR-USED VALUE. I will search for what I can find the absolute lowest price on the used market is for your item, and that is all I will deduct from the value of my rifle."

Actual round count is low, just beyond what Les Baer considers the break in period. I have installed a Wilson Combat magwell and the gun will include 2 Wilson Combat 47D magazines. The gun has been utterly reliable, incredibly accurate, and has an amazing trigger. I have just found myself carrying guns that are lighter and with a higher capacity these days and could use the funds for other gun projects. More pictures are available upon request."

This example is in remarkable shape, completely original and untouched.

No seam separation, and NO wear to toe or spare mag bottom. Top of left belt loop has come undone.The inside of the holster has a very old trag that reads "" HORACE NELSON, Tk 4 . HQ Co. 533 b. 84 Id. "" . Right below that, the words "" WAR TROPHY "".From my military experience, I would surmise it means: *  4th PLT ( not individual tanks. HQ elements usually held Reserve; being a 4hth PLT would make sense, as a maneuver Tank Company was usually 3 Tank platoons), *  Headquarters Company ( HHC today)* 533rd Tank Batallion * 84th Infantry Division ( Divisional Armored support ) They would have likely supported an INF RGT as they were not organic to the 84th ID. The 84th INF Division was a REserve DIV that landed in /France in Nov 1944 and fought there and in Germany through 1945.A very interesting holster to trace and research.  $299 + 15 shipp.Feel free to EM or call with questions."

ALSO molly ready and I'm selling it for $100. The SAPI plates DO fit in it, they will sit rather low seeing as it's a large carrier but it still works.  Finally I'm selling a BulletSafe soft armor rated at Level 3A and is in excellent condition. I am selling this for $200.  You can purchase all of this or as single units. I would recommend the SAPI plates be purchased WITH the carrier, it's pretty useless without them unless you have your own.

347,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6025347,For Sale:  Stevens Model 200 20 gauge pump shotgun,"Wintergreen, Charlottesville, Virginia",$ 900,"Listed On: Thursday, October 20, 2016",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"Stevens Model 200 20 gauge pump shotgun. Here is a rare one for the Stevens collector. The last patent date is 1912. I purchased this gun from a Stevens collector years ago.  Shot wobble trap with it once, using Winchester Super Target 2 3/4"" 7/8oz. #8 Shot, and the gun performed flawlessly.  Then cleaned the gun and stored it in my safe ever since.  Gun comes with a file of information including patent drawings, a component parts list, and a 1968 ""Guns & Amo"" magazine with an artice about the Model 200.  This gun also includes the spanner, which is a part often missing from Model 200s these days. 
The Stevens Model 200, 20 gauge pump shotgun was the first manufactured 20 Gauge Pump Shotgun. It was the brainchild of the famous trap shooter, Charles (Sparrow) Young. Sparrow Young is in the trapshooting hall of fame and was the first shooter to break 100 straight from back yardage. In 1910 he patented the original idea which became the Model 200.  The Stevens Model 200 was only made from about 1911 to 1914. The gun was meant to be a combination of a light ""field"" type gun for upland game with a heavy duck gun (when firing 3"" shells).
The Stevens Model 200 was considered the King of The Turkey Shoot Circuit in the 1920's. This is a 5-shot gun that weighs about 6.5 lbs.  Note that the stock was well-repaired by a previous owner (see pics). Additional pics available upon request.

Within the past year or so the kind of people that have come onto this site are just awful fucking excuses of human beings. When I post something for sale, which is posted at a very fair price, and you come email me and just say ""what is your lowest price?"", I want to rip your teeth out. That is a terribly insulting question. When I post an item for sale, the price I have posted is a very fair and equitable price, that includes a little wiggle room for negotiation. I AM willing to go lower than my asking price. But, if and when I respond to your cringeworthy question about my lowest price and then you try to drive the price down even further?!?!? Fuck off! If you are interested in my item, and feel the price I am asking is too high, email me an offer. When you do, one of three things will happen; I will accept your offer because you are not trying to be a low balling asshole and the price you are offering is within my range of acceptable offers, I will flat out reject your offer if you are so absurdly below my asking price that I feel there is too big of a gap to find an agreeable number, or, I will counter your offer if it is maybe a hair below what I would be willing to accept and I try to get to my minimum asking price, and if you do not come up on your offer, I will likely choose to accept it and eat a little more loss than I would've hoped for, and then you get a great deal on an item and everyone walks away happy. It angers me to no end when I post something and then start getting offers for 1/3-1/2 below my asking price. The point of this site is that when people try to sell something used, they are trying to get a slightly higher price than what their local gun shop will offer them. And when you're in the market for a used item, you can generally find it priced lower than your local gun store is selling it for. But when a private buyer makes offers that are equal to and in MANY cases lower than what a gun shop offers that has to pay for their physical store and employee costs, then you are just awful fucking people destroying the intent of this site"

Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions.Some of the hardest guns for me to sell as I consolidate down to just a couple are the ones that would be so difficult to replace. That is the case with the oldest model of a Smith & Wesson Chiefs Special that I have owned. It is a pre-Model 36 version J-frame built in 1956. That's right...this classic snubnose revolver is sixty years old but you couldn't tell it by looking at or shooting it. Designed to be small and compact for easy carry conceal or small storage areas, this pre-Model 36 Flat Latch J-frame Chiefs Special has a pinned 1.875 inch (sometimes called a 2 inch) barrel. It has 5-round capacity in a swing-out cylinder and can be fired in single or double action.This gun has a grooved rear sight and a ramped fixed blade front sight. It features a blued finish and has the original diamond-type wood grips with serial numbers that match the round butt frame.This classic S&W revolver is in great condition for its age. There is some honest holster wear on the bottom front of the frame and muzzle and a small chip in the bottom of the upper portion of the right wood grip. This gun was carried some but only occasionally fired. Very clean and shiny bore and cylinders with no rust or damage on this gun. I had the gun's side plate off and completely cleaned while intact the internals, then oiled them before replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to the accuracy of the gun.I have fired 50 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. As with all of the S&W revolvers I have had the pleasure to shoot, this one is fun and confidence-inspiring. This revolver is one that is of the age it could be put away in a collection to fondle and admire, but is also dependable and accurate enough to carry conceal or use as a house gun. Comes safely nested inside a new Bore Stores Silicone Treated Gun Storage rug.Please contact me for several additional pictures."

Here is a rare one for the shotgun collector. The Model 200 was manufactured from 1911 to 1914, with only 20,000 produced.  Serial no. 189XX.
The last patent date is 1912. I purchased this gun from a Stevens collector years ago.  Shot trap with it once, using Winchester Super Target 2 3/4"" 7/8oz. #8 Shot, and the gun performed flawlessly.  Then cleaned the gun and stored it in my safe ever since.  Gun comes with a file of information including patent drawings, a component parts list, and a 1968 ""Guns & Ammo"" magazine with an article about the Model 200.  This gun also includes the spanner, which is a part often missing from Model 200s these days. 
The Stevens Model 200, 20 gauge pump shotgun was the first manufactured 20 Gauge Pump Shotgun. It was the brainchild of the famous trap shooter, Charles (Sparrow) Young. Sparrow Young is in the trapshooting hall of fame and was the first shooter to break 100 straight from back yardage. In 1910 he patented the original idea which became the Model 200.  The gun was meant to be a combination of a light ""field"" type gun for upland game with a heavy duck gun (when firing 3"" shells).
 
The Stevens Model 200 was considered the King of The Turkey Shoot Circuit in the 1920's. This is a 5-shot gun that weighs about 6.5 lbs.  Note that the stock was well-repaired by a previous owner (see pics). Additional pics available upon request.
 
For FTF sale in VA, buyer must be 18+ years of age and have a VA driver’s license.  For an out-of-state sale, will arrange shipment to buyer’s FFL, at buyer’s cost.
Asking $800.  Open to reasonable offers / trades.

They are for sale in packs of 1,000 ct. for $40.00 USD, that makes each bullet $0.04 each (try to find them cheaper)! Please note, these are not live rounds. They are only the projectile bullet, not the entire cartridge/round! Also, please note, these are made of lead. Lead is toxic if you are lacking in the intelligence department! If you take precautions, there is virtually no chance of any problem.They are currently unsized (sizing isn't necessary and if your barrel is on the larger side, smaller will not work well for you) so you can try this or size them down for the standard using a reloading press attachment!I can size if you would prefer. No extra charge.They can be shipped lubed or unlubed according to your preference!Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you are looking to buy some!

Remington coupled the classic pump action with a long range cartridge and made one of the most reliable rifles ever. The .280 cartridge is not one of the most popular calibers, which makes this rifle a rare specimen of Remington quality. Jack O'Connor, possibly the world's foremost proponent of the popular .270, at the end of his life recommended the .280, stating that it's ballistics and stability were greater than that of the .270. Your rifle is equipped with a Bushnell Sportview 4x scope affixed with ironsighter mounts, so you can always take aim at your game. Your new favorite deer rifle comes with 3 boxes of ammo, so you will be ready for the upcoming season and more. Don't miss out on this great package!"
