I bought it and put 100rds down range, Hornady Crit Def 147gr, Winchester NATO Spec 124gr and some regular Blazer Brass 115gr, despite the size the frame eats up snappy 115s and is a sweet shooter. The trigger breaks like a finely tuned 1911 trigger, and the DA pull is MUCH better than stock Sig's even X5/Elite Match offerings. It has a high beaver tail and the trigger guard is undercut pretty good to get a very high grip on this weaponI want to stick with 9mm, I will consider a 38 Super Auto or 10mm Auto though, or a cheapo AR-15 in .223 Wylde (free floated please), so that means no other weapon systems or calibers please.

These guns are capable of accuracy, I've used the irons sights and consistently hit 10"" wide by 16"" long steel plates at 200 yards. The only markings on this gun are ""Special Weapons 7.62x51 Mesa, AL"" i do have a claw mount on it to mount optics and it is solid. I also have 20 rounds of hornady precision hunter which are not cheap and 20 rounds of 7.62x51. Some of these guns were made and put together horribly and were garbage, this one is not a lemon, it is a great gun and I don't mind keeping it. It is not new but in great condition. I put my hands on a new from century CETME and it was trash compared to this, not even comparable.

Both Rob and Fred have been Taran Butler’s gunsmiths since the beginning of his professional shooting career. Taran is also a professional consultant to Salient Arms specifically for the competition firearms production.""A comparable build can be set up on Salient's website to see the pricing deal.  This Salient Arms Tier 1 G34 base price was approximately $3,000 new, and there is currently a several month wait for this setup if purchased from Salient directly.  Lifetime warranty is still honored and transferrable here, making this piece a lifelong collector's item especially considering the previous owner and the similarity to the John Wick piece.  I'm offering the weapon for $2650 cash OBO.  Local sale preferred although I will consider shipping to an FFL but I will need payment in the form of a post office money order for the entire amount plus FFL transfer/shipping costs in my hand before I will ship.In case you're wondering what Texas Triggers is (on the mag in the photo) it is Colby Donaldson's ranch in Texas.  Search Youtube for ""Texas Triggers - The Ultimate Shooting Experience"" to prove it (look for this actual glock at 17 seconds in)."

This handgun has a light recoil, super good trigger and is as accurate a pistol as I have ever shot. I am looking specifically for a trade for a Springfield TRP. I have a couple other commanders and don't need 3 of the bobtail pistols. I am the second owner of this pistol and it has seen range time, but is in vgc. functions flawlessly.

It is a Ruger SR 556. For those of you not familiar, it has quad Picitinny rails from Troy Industries, Folding sights from Troy Industries, Collapsing stock from MagPul, 3 30 round magazines from PMAG.It comes with a combination Laser/Telescoping sight. The sight has both lighted Red and Green Recitule and is from 2.5 to 10 power. It also has the Gerber Magnetic AR 15 tool, complete with front sight adjusting tool. (This is a $80 piece of tools for the AR) I was disillusioned with the stock Trigger, so I put in a POF industries Trigger (4 1/2 lb single stage) and KNS Stainless steel anti Walk pins. To move this around I have the origonal unused Ruger soft case and a SKB Shipping case. (the shipping case is a AR 15 custom case and cost $250) This comes with 240 rounds of Green Tip ammunition. Sorry, No Trades at this time. Some negotiation on Price."

It has been professionally handled since new and properly maintained. The targets shown were shot by me using the bipod off a bench at our range in normal shooting conditions with typical ND wind so they are not modified targets like most guys show. We have shot this rifle in the indoor range off a sled which is boringly a one oversized hole 10rd group. The rifle will ship with build receipts we have available. The receiver on the rifle is a Real ""700 Tactical"" with the numbers matching bolt not a generic sps receiver. The rifle is top of the line and deserves a good home."
