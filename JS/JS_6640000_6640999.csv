I'd say this is all mostly once-fired stuff. But, I can't guarantee that it is.I've spent the last few months going through it in my spare time. Any aluminum and steel was tossed out. Anything berdan primed, damaged or even questionable was thrown in the scrap pile. All bags have an extra 5% thrown in to cover any crap that might have been missed when I bagged it up (ie - a bag of 250 will have 263 cases). The 9mm and .223/5.56 will have 10% extra.It's all brass, boxer primed and mixed headstamps. I sorted out a few headstamps on the .308, but don't have enough buckets/space/time to sort every headstamp from every caliber.Since it's been outdoors (or stored in drums) for up to a couple years, you'll definitely have to clean this stuff before you load it.Pictures are attached showing some of the nastiest .30 caliber cases before and after a 3-hour run though a wet tumbler.I also ran a batch of .223 through my dry tumbler and while the cases were reloadable, the tarnish was still present - picture at the very bottom.If you're concerned about loading tarnished cases, here's some banter about it: https://thefiringline.com/forums/sho...d.php?t=478057Payment can be gifted through PayPal.  I will ship in a USPS flat rate box.Price listed is ""each"". For example, $20 per 1000 rds of 9mm.Here's the list of what I have:.223/5.56 --- roughly 10,000 rds --- unsorted, so you'll get mixed calibers and crimped primersselling for $2.25 per pound --- roughly $30 per thousand*** fill a 5-gal bucket (approx 3,800 rds) for $105I have not had time to sort through this yet, so there is a caveat: there will be some damaged cases or an odd caliber in the bunch (that's why I toss in an extra 10%)5.7x28 --- 250 rds250 x 1 - $15.243 Win --- 25 rds25 x 1 - $4"

I will only ship to the address on the FFL.Before we meet, I will have you send me your valid driver's license and FOID card so I can run the number through the ISP for an approval number. Once we get the approval number, we can schedule the meet up. No cash will be exchanged, you will have to pay on Google Wallet or Paypal F&F before we meet. Once the funds clear (usually immediately) we can meet up to transfer the firearm. When we meet, I will have a bill of sale for us both to sign so we both have a copy, and I will take a picture in person of your foid next to the firearm and we will be good to go! Illinois is very anti-firearm and the laws surrounding legal private transfers are particularly finicky, so I want to do everything as safe, legal and on the up-and-up as possible.

The grip scales are secured with tiny screws set in escutcheons, as are found on early Japanese Type 30 bayonets.The characters on the ricasso say ""R.S. 121"" in Siamese, which represents the year 1903 on the Gregorian (western) Calendar. ""R.S. 121"" is an abbreviation for Rattanakosin Sok 121. This refers to the 121st year of the Rattanakosin Era, which began with the founding of Bangkok in 1782. The bayonet was re-designated Type 45 when Siam adopted the Buddhist Calendar in 1913. Year 2445 corresponds to 1903.The marking below the serial number is the Siamese character equivalent to the English letter B. It is believed that this symbol was of Colonel Prince Bavorady who was the officer in charge of the delegation that visited Japan during the manufacturing of the weapons. However, no historical documents have been found to confirm this.The scabbard throat is unique in having a depression that allows the scabbard to remain on the bayonet when fixed to the rifle."""

These casings will be bright silver.Only once-fired military and police brass is used in loading, which is acid washed / processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected for thin walls and defects, to ensure safe internal tolerances.In our loading process we only use the top quality powders and primers.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, a checkered slide release and an ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull-even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.Model: Solo CarryCaliber: 9MMBarrel Length: 2.7""Weight:17ozsSights: 3 DotFinish: Duo ToneGrips: SynthetricCapacity 6 +1MSRP: $924"

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.For search purposes...SigSpringfield XDGlockFNHKahr"

   Micro slides are made to the tightest allowable tolerances, with barrels machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.
 
Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.For search purposes...SigSpringfield XDGlockFNHKahr"

Strange though it may be, it’s perfectly set up for those who desire a two-stamp gun. The extended forend from the Carbine will hide most 9mm and hybrid cans, while offering M-LOK attachment points and boosting the sight radius a good deal. Still using the 7.7” barrel of the standard Scorpion Pistol, a 5” KAK Flash Can extends the barrel to just a hair past the forend. Dual threads of 18×1 and 1/2×28 make fitting a suppressor simple, and adding an arm brace or cheek rest is as easy as can be with our accessory adapter kit. Even simpler is the addition of the factory folding stock, assuming you can stomach the ATF’s current wait times. Current production Scorpion pistols lack the 3/4″ sling slot on the left side of the action that is present on earlier variants. The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax.
