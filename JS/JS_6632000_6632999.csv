Metal is in good shape with normal wear on bluing. It was like that when I bought it about 20 years ago which was before they started doing arsenal refurbishment on Mosin-Nagant rifles before import. It has the scout scope mount from B-square with a nice pistol scope which allows you to keep both eyes open while shooting. It is also mounted in an ATI Monte Carlo synthetic stock. Romanian Mosin-Nagant rifles are fairly rare and known to be of good quality. Numbers do not match which is common for Romanians.  I would like to trade for a nice little ccw pistol with a stainless steel slide like a Taurus pt111-140-145 Millennium Pro, Taurus pt111-140 G2 stainless, Taurus 24-7, S&W SD9VE or SD40VE, Sccy 9mm, Kahr, etc."

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” model.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.
Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.
With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 – 8.5 pounds (27.5 – 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7N).
The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.
Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.
A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.
Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines."

73,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6632073,For Sale:  HK P30S Safty & Decocker,"Renton, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,099","Listed On: Monday, June 5, 2017",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.
P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers.
A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.
Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.
During a 2010 endurance test, a randomly selected P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures."

Thanks for looking.Dealer Description""Originally known as the ""Improved Henry"" due to its patented loading gate on the side of the frame, designed by Nelson King, Winchester's plant superintendant, and the addition of a wood forearm, the 1866 model was known as the ""Yellow Boy"" by the Native Americans, because of its brass frame. The '66 model was the first true cowboy lever-action and the first that adapted well to carrying in a saddle scabbard, due to its slab sided design. With over 170,000 made between 1866-1898--it's popularity continued long after more powerful lever guns were introduced. The '66 model was famous worldwide, with guns used by the forces of Benito Juarez in Mexico, the Turkish army in their fight against the Russians and in the Wild West by such notables as Sioux Medicine Man Sitting Bull, the Union Pacific's chief engineer, General Grenville Dodge, and desperado Bill Doolin.Cimarron offers several 1866 Yellowboys, such as the 24-inch barreled Sporting Rifle, a 20-inch Short Rifle (both of these models sport octagon barrels), round barreled carbines including the 19-inch saddle ring carbine, a brass tack-decorated 19-inch Indian carbine, and a 16-inch Trapper model. Calibers available include .45 Colt, .44-40, .44 Special, .38 Special, .38-40, .32-20 and .22 Long Rifle, and with finishes like the Standard Blue, Charcoal Blue, or Original Finish, depending on which model you select. One of Cimarron's true, handsome Old West classics!""Link to new rifle page-http://www.cimarron-firearms.com/1866-short-rifle-45-colt-20-oct-barrel.html-"

The rifle is about 2 years old and has some upgrades. I have had a BCM KMR 15"" handguard installed. This is the original BCM KMR model (not the newer alpha model) which is lighter, and can no longer be purchased. I have also added a BCM pistol grip which has been custom stippled, and a Magpul CTR stock, both in FDE. A Griffin Armament tapper mount muzzle brake has been installed along with a Damage Industries 45 degree ambidextrous selector switch, H2 buffer, Enhanced Recoil Spring, and a Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA) trigger. The optics installed are Magpul MBUS Pro offset front and rear sights, and paired with a Primary Arms 1-6 power riflescope with ACSS gen 3 reticle in a 30mm American Defense Manufacturing Recon scope mount. I started to paint the rifle in Multicam, but it's just spray paint so if you want I can finish painting the rifle for you, or remove the paint and restore it back to its factory black form. Im looking to sell this rifle because I don't get to shoot long distance much, and figured I could put the money towards new builds. This rifle shoots amazing out to distance with the 18"" S2W 5.56 mid length Daniel Defense barrel. Looking to sell the rifle complete with optic and iron sights, but I am willing to sell it without irons and optics as well. Comes with the Factory Daniel Defense Ambush Firearms padded hard case, and 1 Magpul 10rd P-Mag magazine. I have a lot more pictures, but can only post 3. Willing to ship to your FFL dealer.

It comes with 3 magazines (2 extended, 1 regular), I bought it with nite sites already installed from Smith & Wesson, it does not have any manual safety. I have only shot about 300 rounds from it. I got it for concealed carry but have found it just a little bit too heavy for the type of deep concealement carry that I would like (although everyone claims that I am crazy because of how light/small this gun is, but I am very skinny). This Shield is a LOT of fun to shoot. Very accurate, and the grip is phenomenal, while it is very thin and can be easily concealed, the grip is wide enough to have a good grasp on the gun. I recently got a Glock 42 and am now shopping for a new car so unfortunately I have to sell this one. I originally paid $550 (without taxes and cook county firearm fees, which add another $100). I am also included two inside the waistband holsters, including one that has additional room for a trigger guard mounted laser. I have cleaned it thoroughly after each trip to the range, and it is in good-as-new condition. I even have the original box that it came with, as well as the manual and safety lock. Will be posting pictures shortly."

ATTACHED TO THE SPECIAL GROUPS, MIKE FORCES, LLDB 4, LLDB 5 AND THE ASA ...... REAL TIME SURVIVAL BECAME AN EVERYDAY REQUIREMENT FOR DALE ROGERS. NECESSITY FORCED DALE ROGERS TO INVENT THE SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL TODAY, AS A CIVILIAN HOLDING OVER 20 COMBAT COMMENDATIONS, DALE ROGERS IS A FULL TIME VA COUNSELOR TO HIS VIETNAM BROTHERS. THE SRT-1, THE ORIGINAL SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL WAS CONCEIVED, DEVELOPED, TESTED, AND USED BY THE SPECIAL FORCES DURING THE VIETNAM ERA. THE DALE ROGERS SRT-1 IDEA WAS FURTHER REFINED AND PATENTED AS A SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL. PRODUCTION WAS STARTED IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH AND MARKETING EFFORTS, TO RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONAL OUTDOORSMEN, CONTINUED UNTIL THE COUNSELING ACTIVITIES OF DALE ROGERS BECAME A FULLTIME DEDICATION. DURING 1988, THE COMPANY WAS SOLD TO THE SAGAD CORP. UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT THE INTEGRITY AND QUALITY, BUILT INTO THE ORIGINAL SRT-1, WOULD NEVER BE COMPROMISED. SAGAD CORP. AGREED.THE ULTIMATE SURVIVAL AND RESCUE TOOL ...... SRT-1, IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE ONLY KNOWN COMPARISON OF THE SRT-1 THAT CAN BE MADE IS TO A KNIFE. HARDLY A FAIR COMPARISON WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE SRT-1 CAN BE USED AS A WEDGE TO SPLIT LOGS. Using it as a spear can be the difference between starving and food. Now consider the uses as an axe...... A chisel...... Plane...... Wire stripper ...... A hoe...... Bottle opener ...... A glass and tile cutter ...... Nail puller ...... A knife ...... Saw Game Dresser ...... A handle. In addition, the back cutter can tear thru the sheet metals as found in a helicopter, plane, auto or a wrecked 4x4. Versatile and safe, the srt-1 is a workhorse. We certainly agree that the SRT-1 is a one piece mil spec casting of440c stainless steel, a rust resistant high carbon tool steel, 4 7/16"" X 3 1/2"" X 1/4"" tough, strong and capable of taking and holding a sharp edge under the most desperate survival conditions. SRT-1 is the safest tool of its type available today. The unique finger holes provide the most slip free grip of any design known. It can be held securely even when coated with oil, water or mud. The survival and rescue tool was designed and built to save the life of the person using it even if your hands are frozen, burned or broken you remain able to slip on the tool and use it when you couldn't even grip, open the blade, or hold a standard. You can swim, climb a rope, or fire a weapon with the uniquely designed handle that permits almost total use of your hands while holding the tool. The safety features built into the SRT-1 were designed to put the survival odds in your favor. Easy field conversions to functional implements are done by the nylon cord provided with the SRT-1. Use the SRT-1 to field dress a deer or cut yourself from a crashed auto, truck or aircraft. Make an axe to chop wood. Use the srt-1 with a rock to split logs, fasten the SRT-1 to the end of a limb and convert it to a spear. Tie the SRT-1 to the middle of a small branch to create a plane that can be used to shape a bow arrows or other hunting equipment. A chisel can be made by holding the SRT-1 on an angle and striking it with a limb or rock. The saw will function well on wood, metal or bone. Use the ""v"" shaped wire stripper to field cut or strip wires. The back cutter easily splits metal. Normal carving and knife usage is done by using only three finger holes. This is brand new, unused, very, very sharp, unre-sharpened with leather case and nylon cord.  When these were available they retailed for 250.00, This is a very hard to find item, do the research on it, not many to be found.  Im asking 150.00 firm."
