Laser works, battery is still good, gun functions as it should. Holster has been used maybe 2 times, if that many, and I put the rubber grip tape on the handle when I got the gun just because of how small it is to improve grip. Only reason that I'm getting rid of it is because I bought it New and it never gets used."

MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye. Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area. The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open."

PWS has for years successfully created working adjustable long stroke Piston rifles from .223 Wylde to Creedmoor. Simply put they just work really well and they require minimal cleaning and maintenance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j_jMVynheYThe new MK1 Mod2 design has focused on creating a lighter, and more ergonomic platform for the shooter. Read below for more details.PWS upper and lower receivers are now forged, allowing for a stronger and lighter product. A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR 15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part.PICMOD TECHNOLOGYThe MOD 2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyMod™ attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present.This gives you the most mounting options without having to use the KeyMod™ mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.Adjustable Gas Block:The MOD 2 comes with three easy to use gas block settings.• Position 1 is recommended for for all types of ammunition and conditions when not using a suppressor.• Position 2 is for use with low powered ammunition when using a suppressor.• Position 3 is recommended for normal suppressor use with normal and high powered ammunition.MAXIM CQB PISTOL EXCThe MOD 2 pistol comes with the Maxim CQB Pistol EXC making it lightweight and fun to shoot. This Maxim CQB Pistol EXC only adds 5.35” to your receiver at its most collapsed position with no special bolt carrier needed. It adjusts to 4 total positions giving your AR15 pistol the adjustments needed for the perfect cheek weld. MAXIM CQB RIFLE RAILThis Tactical kit comes with a Maxim Defense CQB Rifle Rails set. *After and only after removing the Pistol upper receiver from the lower the Maxim EXC Cheek Rest rails can be removed by simply squeezing the adjustment button and the release button together and removing the rail section from the buffer assembly. Squeeze the same two levers and insert the CQB Rifle Rails set. Now you are ready to attached the MK114 upper to the lower and utilize it as a rifle.SUPERIOR FITEverything about the MOD 2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.AMBIDEXTROUSWe’ve added ambidextrous controls for the safety selector, bolt release, and mag release to enhance the ease of use.SPECIFICATIONSMK107 PistolWeight -5 lb 10 ozBarrel Length – 7.75″Chamber - .223 WyldeOverall Length – 26.75""Gas Piston System – PistolBarrel Twist – 1:8Muzzle Device - CQBMK114 Upper w/ CQB Rifle Rails Weight – 4lbs 12.ozBarrel Length – 14.5″ Chamber - 223 WyldeOverall Length – 23.4″ (33.25” as rifle)Gas Piston System – CarbineBarrel Twist – 1:8Muzzle Device - Mod 2 FSCYou will not find this package anywhere else, I came up with it myself. I figured, I can only shoot one at a time, and the same lower will support each upper based upon the job I need it for. I can invest in just one lower with a quality trigger and a JP Enterprises Silent Buffer Spring for the Maxim EXC ($189) for when the HPA Gets passed and I get a suppressor (fingers crossed).*Note – All NFA Rules Apply. You must ensure that you never have a pistol upper receiver attached to the lower without the EXC Pistol Cheek rest rails installed first. Having a pistol upper receiver attached to the lower with the Rifle CQB Rail kit would be fabricating a Short Barrelled Rifle which is subject to the NFA and a crime. You have been warned. Also, As I have done here; You can convert a pistol lower to a rifle lower and back to a pistol lower but never make a lower that was manufactured as a rifle into a pistol lower.I will ship to your FFL you pay for insurance."

A common known fact that has been lost through the marketing efforts of many AR 15 manufacturers is that a forging can produce a piece that is much stronger than a billet part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain aligns to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the grain is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a part that is stronger, yet lighter, than a billet part.Picmod Technology: The MOD 2 handguard has been equipped with the new PicMod Technology. This allows you to mount any KeyModTM attachment anywhere on your rail while being able to mount most Picatinny accessories directly to the rail in the areas where the PicMod feature is present. This gives you the most mounting options without having to use KeyModTM mounted Picatinny rail sections, adding unnecessary width and weight to your rifle.Adjustable Gas Block:The MOD 2 comes with three easy to use gas block settings.· & nbsp ; Position 1 is recommended for for all types of ammunition and conditions when not using a suppressor.· & nbsp ; Position 2 is for use with low powered ammunition when using a suppressor.· & nbsp ; Position 3 is recommended for normal suppressor use with normal and high powered ammunition.Superior Fit:Everything about the MOD 2 has been designed to be an incredibly accurate fit and finish, including the new handguard mounting system, which features a trunnion machined into the upper receiver.New Buffer Tube:The new PWS EBT is impact extruded from 7075 to enhance strength and rigidity, and anodized in mil spect type 3 to exceed standards in hardness and corrosion protection. We’ve added a new Ratchet-Lock Design to eliminate the need to stake the castle nut, and gives a rock solid lock up while being able to be removed easily if needed in the future.BCMBCM Mod 4 Charging handle, Mod 3 Pistol grip and Stock SPECIFICATIONS Weight – 6lbs 2.8 ozBarrel Length – 14.5″Chamber - 223 WyldeOverall Length – 31.3″Gas Piston System – CarbineBarrel Twist – 1:8I will ship to your FFL you pay for insurance."

Preferably 22"" barrel or longer. Also would be interested in Trading for Mossberg Silver Reserve in 12 gauge. I dont need to sell it, so just know that the price I'm asking I consider fair. Thanks for looking. I will sell gun without extras, but the price won't be adjusted much. text three14-393zero325 with questions"

I am selling to pay for other gun projects and the price is firm.  No trades please.  Your FFL must be willing to accept this from a non-FFL holder.  I accept checks and MO.  I will ship the rifle to the FFL and the accessories directly to the buyer.  Thanks for looking and please feel free to contact me with any questions.

The AR10T is an upgraded version of the Ar10 Two features in particular make it stand out. First, it has a national match trigger, which is a two-stage trigger that sets off the action with a 4.5- to five-pound pull. The second feature are the free-floating handguards that attach only to the receiver whereas on the AR10 A4 they attach to both the barrel and the receiver. The free-floating handguards don’t add any stress to the barrel. Armalite recommends the Target for competitive and leisure shooting."

Each CMP M1 Garand Rifle is and authentic U.S. Government rifle that has been inspected, headspaced, repaired if necessary, and test fired for function. The M1 Garand Caliber .30-06 Rifle I am selling was manufactured by Springfield Armory in 7 of 1944. Other Springfield components are the barrel (10/46) and safety. Op rod is Winchester (12/57), and all other components are International Harvester (1953-56). The front and rear sights are National Match sights installed by CMP, that lend themselves to acute accuracy. The barrel for being from 1946 measures excellent. The stock is dark walnut, all matching color, and is in excellent condition (no cartouche markings though). Rifle comes with CMP Certificate of Authenticity, CMP issued four clamp hard case, CMP chamber flag and sight protective covers, and four loaded enblocs (32 rounds total, only for face to face sales).
