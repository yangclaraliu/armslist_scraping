All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength.

Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity.

I added the sling swivels and sent the rifle off to Scott Null at Savage Gunsmithing. www.savagegunsmithing.com It was a Norma rework and has the original barrel. Scott looked at it through a bore scope and said the throat and rifling are good. He also stated that it's been his experience that the barrels on these rifles are very hard and should last for many thousands more rounds. I've wanted to get into some long range shooting but that doesn't seem possible now.  He took about an inch off the length, threaded it 5/8x24 and made a cap. Then he changed the bolt handle over to allow for scope mounting, added a 15 MOA custom rail, bedded the action and refinished it in a nice dark matte finish. There are a few marks on the finish and end cap that are pictured. The CG63 stock is very ergonomic. I haven't refinished it so there is some tape residue on the front hand guard and some stickers from a former owner are still in place too. The stock is walnut with some nice figuring on the butt.  I've never shot the rifle. I've owned a CG63 in the past and it was a sub MOA rifle. They are very good shooters and I think the round they shoot has a lot to do with that.

It sports a Burris AR-Riflescope 4.5-14x42mm mounted in an Armalite cantilever mount. It also includes a soft case and 3 mags. Extra rails are also installed, including a fwd QD sling mount and a FAB defense angled fore grip & thumb rest. The Jager is the rifle for the precision shooter, competitor, or varmint hunter. This rifle was built with accuracy and high level performance in mind, and it does not disappoint. The rifle features a Hogue ambidextrous grip, Magpul PRS stock and Samson Evo rail for a top level furniture package. The stock is adjustable to the user both in height and length of pull. This allows the comfortable use of various scopes and optics in various shooting positions. In addition to being comfortable it is also rugged and durable even in unforgiving hunting, competition, or tactical environments. The 15 inch Samson Evo rail was made with modularity in mind, allowing the user to place accessories and rail sections where they want them. The long length of the rail also allows the user to use rests or sand bags with ease, and the option of mounting a bipod further away from the stock for exceptional balance and stability. Additional rail pieces and other mounting options are available as well. The rail also features anti rotational tabs making the rail that much more impressive, virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail loosing alignment even under hard use. The fire control group of this rifle features the amazing JP-EZ trigger system. This trigger provides a clean, crisp break at approximately 4.5 lbs. and a distinct strong reset. The performance of this single stage trigger is impressive as there is virtually no creep or take-up. The trigger also allows the user to configure the trigger to their needs by using different spring kits. This rifle also features an ambidextrous safety. The rifle-length direct impingement gas system is the original gas system of the M16/AR15 family of rifles and has been tried and true in all environments and has been in use by our armed forces for decades. The gas block is firmly secured under the Samson Evo rail with Unbrako set screws. By using a low profile gas block, the longer Samson Evo rail can be used allowing a longer sight radius if iron sights are used. The gas tube has been Melonite treated for extra corrosion resistance and reliability. The bolt carrier group is an M16 weight carrier made from 8620 steel and is finished inside and out with a new, cutting edge proprietary coating process by Adams Arms called Lifecoat™. The Lifecoat™ process offers multiple advantages over and above traditional current coating processes on the market today. These advantages include a harder surface level then hard chrome, superior lubricity properties, and excellent corrosion resistance, all superior to traditional Mil-Spec Parkerizing. The gas key is heat treated and finished with the same new coating process as the carrier, attached to the carrier with Grade 8 fasteners manufactured in the United States, and properly staked. The bolt is manufactured from proper Mil-Spec Carpenter No. 158 ® Steel, magnetic particle inspected (MPI), and has a carbine extractor spring, insert, and Crane O-ring. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical dimensions held within +-.001” and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil spec receiver extension/buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

It was used when I got it, but it is still in very good condition. It does have a few light scratches here and there, but it is a gorgeous gun with a high gloss finish on both the stock, and the bluing itself. The model 14 is much like the model 11 but with a fancier, shiny stock, and high gloss blued finish. The checkering is also cut into the wood instead of being pressed like the 11 is. It also has an accutrigger. I have never adjusted the accu-trigger, but it is plenty light for a hunting rifle.  Typical Savage accuracy; easy sub-moa groups with a tailored load. The load I used these last two years produced some five shot groups of about 1/4"" at 100 yards. Most of the animals I have shot have been over 300 yards, and the 708 Has done great with every one. I am selling it without the scope, or bipod. I will leave the rings on it though. I think they're Leopold rings. I'm firm on my price of $650. If you have any questions, or are interested, give me, Joe, a call or text. Four.zero.six.564-8793. I can also send the original pictures that have a lot more detail. I often don't have my phone with me while at work, but please leave a voicemail or text and I'll respond when I can.If by chance you have a Tikka 7mm, I'd be interested in a trade."

The only reason why I'm selling this rifle is because I recently purchased a Colt M4, and have no need for two AR-15s.If you have any questions, offers, or would like to see pictures, please feel free to contact me via email.

Also included is the XT07 Remote Dual Switch Assembly for X-Series Weapon Lights, this is brand new as well however I opened & discarded the bag it came in. Info and specs listed below for both items. Asking $700 OBO for both, email me if you're interested. I accept PayPal and will ship USPS Priority Mail for FREE.The SureFire X400 Ultra WeaponLight integrates stunningly powerful white-light illumination and bright green laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail-mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close- to medium-range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications.A high-performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.75 hours per set of batteries.The X400 Ultra’s 5-milliwatt laser sight, located below the primary light, emits a high-visibility green (505 nM) beam. The laser's aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed.Activating the X400 Ultra is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. A separate switch at the rear of the X400 Ultra allows you to (1) activate white light illumination only, (2) activate white light illumination simultaneously with the laser sight, (3) activate the laser sight only, or (4) disable the entire X400 Ultra. See illustration at upper left.The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its T-Lock mounting system permits rapid attachment/detachment from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.Specifications    Max Output White Light- 500.0 lumens    Tactical Runtime- 1.75 hours    Max Output Laser- 5.0 mW    Length- 3.6 inches    Bezel Diameter- 1.125 inches    Weight w/Batteries    4.9 ounces    Batteries- 2 123A  (included)Features        Virtually indestructible 500-lumen LED regulated to maximize output and runtime        High-visibility 5 mW green laser sight        TIR lens for close- to medium-range applications        Quick-detach rail clamp with adapters for Picatinny and Universal rails        Accepts optional pistol grip and long gun forend switches        Construction—High-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec anodizing; impact-resistant polymer; coated tempered window        Weatherproof—O-ring and gasket sealed        Includes high-energy 123A batteries with 10-year shelf lifeThe XT07 switch provides reliable, remote activation for any X-series WeaponLight (X200, X300, X400) attached to a Picatinny rail. Switch module clips to Picatinny rail and features constant-on/off pushbutton switch, momentary-on pressure pad, and a lockout toggle switch to prevent accidental discharge of the light. Gives operators greater flexibility and control. XT07 has a 7 inch cable.Fits: X200, X300, X400 WeaponLightsFeatures    Click on/off pushbutton switch    Momentary-on pressure pad    Lockout toggle switch    Fits all X-Series WeaponLights    Quick-detach connector offers easy removal of cable from switch housing for cleaning    Made of ultra-rugged glass-filled nylon for greater reliability    Titanium latch prevents disengagement from light due to recoil"
