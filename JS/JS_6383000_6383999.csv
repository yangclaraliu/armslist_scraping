In fact, I love everything about it...except the grip angle, which is the same as Glocks (and the reason I don’t own any Glocks). That angle is different from every other pistol I own, and since this was to be a carry pistol, that presents a problem, since I have to remember to roll my wrist forward more than I normally do to be on target. Glock owners should love it, but I’m too old to learn this new trick, so...No shipping, no trades; will meet in/near Chattanooga."

That's right!! I've never shot any ammo thru it. I was waiting for some upgraded parts (barrel, handguard, muzzle brake, picatinny rail gas block) before taking this AR-15 handgun/pistol to the range. I'm selling this for $210 because I upgraded my 450 complete upper receiver with a 11.5 inch barrel instead with a new customized muzzle brake including the upgraded handguard and don't need this one. This barrel for sale includes the Bushmaster factory Izzy muzzle brake (no crush washer included), the round free float handguard, low profile gas block (no gas tube), and barrel nut. These are all ""Bushmaster factory"" 450 Bushmaster parts that came with my complete upper receiver when I purchased it. There is a small cosmetic surface damage on the factory round style handguard during the receiver barrel upgrade and changeout procedures. This cosmetic damage can be touched up with some form of black coating/paint. Cash is the only option if a local North Carolina resident, but I do accept PayPal payments if not in the local area. The buyer pays for USPS shipping (cheapest route possible with tracking#) if shipping is requested. Please email for any further details, but please don't try to low ball the selling the price--that's all I ask for in return. Thank you for any inquiries.(P.S.  Price might be negotiable--must ask seller first.)"

The reliability, ergonomics and DA/SA action have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The ‘B’ designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.Extremely clean with no blemishes and well taken care of CZ-85 B. This all metal DA/SA 9mm pistol is dependable, accurate and made to last a lifetime. Pistol is very much like the CZ-75 but upgraded with ambidextrous manual safeties. The automatic firing pin block safety restricts any movement of the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This mechanism prevents discharge in the event that a dropped pistol lands on its muzzle with enough force that the inertia of the firing pin overcomes the firing pin spring. Pistol has been kept in safe and shot only occasionally with total of less than 400 ever rounds fired. It has no scrapes, scratches or wear.  Pistol comes with 2-16 round mags, cleaning tool, additional set of red grips, and hard plastic case.Buyer must have CCW or Pistol Purchase Permit and driver’s license. All laws observed and Bill of Sale completed. Sorry, not interested in trades. Cash $475.00"

Developed for Law Enforcement and Military use the 5906 Tactical was made to be as tough as they could make it with the slide and frame machined from a single block of stainless steel and remaining as a matched pair throughout assembly. The slide rests on larger full length rails and rides nearly inside the frame much as a CZ design ( and this gun was made in the late 80's). Smith also developed a delayed-unlock firing system for these that lessened felt recoil for quicker target acqusition and equipped them with three dot Novak sights (this one has trijicon night sights but they are very weak), loaded chamber window and decocker/safety . Most came with an accessory rail but some did not but mounting points are still on the bottom of the slide. This was a duty weapon at one time and shows some wear from being carried but bore is still bright and internal wear is minimal, plenty of years left in this gun. These are getting harder to find as people realize what fine and collectible weapons they are so the asking price is 550 or a trade of 600 value. Comes with two 15 round magazines and a hard plastc case."

It is a tactical airsoft scope that looks identical in picture to a real Zeiss scope. I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is telling the truth about buying it from another individual and just got ripped off himself and didn't know it was a fake. Aways find out all the details and search the make and model online if you don't know for sure. You can actually go on Zeiss website and it gives a list of fakes to watch out for. But anyway figured I'd share. Happy buying!!!

But about the rifle! It's in excellent condition, bore is bright & shiny and there is no damage whatsoever. The stock seems to have been lightly sanded at some point but that's it! This M38 Carcano is in the 7.35mm round. NOT the 6.5mm. Most of these rifles were sporterized back in the day but this one has stayed in original configuaration. The only parts that the italians numbered was the stock and barrel. Both of those match. There are Finish army markings from when Italy lent their carcanos to the Finnish during the winter war. But overall this is a great collector's gun because it seems like 90% of carcanos are either sporterized, or in awful condition. Not many have a bore that looks like this one's.
