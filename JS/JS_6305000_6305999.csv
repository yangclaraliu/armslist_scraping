Will comes with Leupold ring mounts and and extra detachable magazine.  These go for $1998.00 new.  Shoots almost every type of factory ammo I tried into 1"" groups and several were 1/2"".  I had a custom 270 built and this one just sits in the safe now.  Also has the single set trigger that allows you to push the trigger forward before firing and makes the trigger break at around a 1 lb.  Don't push the trigger forward first and the trigger will break at 2.5 lbs.  WILL SELL FOR $1300 OR TRADE.  Can take or add cash as needed.  Not interested in shotguns.  Accurate bolt rifles, AR's, and some pistols.  Quality scopes with at least 14 power.  Can take mulitiple guns in trade also.  
I have a few more pics I can email."

This has a sporter profile lightweight fluted stainless steel barrel for hunting. It is the perfect light weight rifle for hunting. It has a light weight Bell and Carlson aluminum bedded stock also. I dont hunt, I purchased it for target shooting and i dont believe this barrel will not heat up round after round target shooting all day, but will be great to drag thru the woods and take a couple shots at an animal at a great distance. The 264 win mag is the same size case as the 7mm Rem mag with a touch smaller diameter bullet. It has amazing distance and power without the harsh recoil of its big brother 300 win mag. I paid $1250.00 for this rifle and am willing to take a small loss because i just purchased a barrel to re barrel my rifle i have now and it cost me $750.00 and its not mounted yet. So i would like to sell this rifle to replentish the shooting funds. If interested call me at  REDACTEDThanks,Brian"

The Whindam built in the US as you know and is the flat top model and has a nice size rail. Flip up rear sights with large & small peap holes fixed front sight.  I only have 90 rounds through her but have always liked my Mini 14 which I had to sell while in FLA. The ar is spot on and I never even sighted her in. She's clean and in new conditon. Looking for at least 20 round mags in this exchange. Would like either wood or polomer frame stainless would be best of course but I really have no priority on this as long as it's a newer model like mine is. it's only about two years old and like I said only once at the range."

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

Built from the ground up and designed for large gear load outs needed for overseas deployments. TAG's Advanced Loadout Bag is made with 1000 denier fabric for durability, water repellent, and abrasion resistance. Inside the bag there are 5 tear out bags that have hook and loop attachments so they can be stuck in place with in the bag. 2 large bags attach to the fl oor of the bag and 3 small ones that Velcro® to the back wall of the bag.Large cargo pockets are sewn to the outside of the bag for extra gear storage if needed. Heavy duty handles are sewn to the body of the bag. One is sewn directly onto the frame so you are not putting stress on the bag while moving it. There is also a handle sewn to the bag on the edge near the center. This handle allows you to pull the lid closer to you while zipping it shut so if the bag is over loaded the zipper will not break by accident. There are 2 clear view windows on the bag so you can easily mark and identify your bag when you get to you final destination.The frame is 6061 aircraft grade aluminum with thick tube walls to prevent the frame form bending or warping under heavy loads. The frame has wheel wells covering the wheels. This helps support the weight of the bag when rolling and acts as a guard in case something punctures the bag from the inside. The axle for the wheels is one solid piece that runs through the frame.

Thanks for the interest.  PLEASE - include your email (or a text phone number) in the text of your contact to me, and I'm pretty good about getting back to you."
