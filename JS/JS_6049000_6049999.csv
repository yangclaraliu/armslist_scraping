There are no mechanical problems, and no rust anywhere except the buttpad.The stock has seen better days, with a goodly gouge on the left side about 1 inch in front of where your cheek rests and may have been restained in the 40s/50s but it's unknown if that was before or after the rifle was brought back. The stain matches throughout the rifle, including in the gouge.This was an heirloom within a friend's family, however no collectors remain so it was passed to me.

I paid $400 for a 1k round case shipped, but don't really need that many extra currently as I've been buying quite a bit of ammo and have plenty.Im asking $200 for the 500rds of PMC( These will come in 20ct boxes )https://goo.gl/M4xYNEI also have a 500ct box of the green tip XM-855 . The box of XM855 will be $200 as well. That is what I paid for it and I'm not looking to lose money. The prices on these green tips are close to  .50 or higher a round most places IF you can find them. ( This is one bulk cardboard box directly from Lake City Federal as far as I am aware. )I bought the PMC and ended up getting better groups out of my rifles so I'm going to stick with it.I will sell both for $380. That would be 1,000 rounds of high quality ammo for a very good price. SGammo has great prices, but I don't you will even find 1k rounds of decent 5.56 for that on their site, not even counting shipping.I live towards lake city, but can meet right off the Macclenny exit at the Walmart.

As it happens, I've got a few .22 caps and I had a few .22 super-shorts given to me and this little rifle worked perfectly!  Many of these were destroyed for one reason or another and it's suggested by experts that there are likely less than a couple hundred still around,  and less than 50 that actually are in working condition!    This lil' rifle was ""declassified"" as a weapon and it's an antique, so I can ship it directly to You.    The last couple I saw sell at auction went for over $300. each..  So my asking price of ONLY $295.  (includes shipping in the USA ONLY)  is a very fair price!   I will entertain reasonable offers or part trades.Thank you for your time... feel free to email me or call.  I'm in S.

Therefore, you should never purposefully be shot while wearing body armor or attempt to test this product while wearing it. The armor may stop the bullet from hitting your body, but it will not stop the inertia from the bullet transferring to your body and causing death or injury.

If you want a P228 or P226 (the two best 9mm semi-auto handguns in the world in my humble opinion) but don't want to spend a $1,000 than this bad boy is for you. It is essentially the same exact gun only with a polymer frame. Again, in my humble opinion, the SP2022 is the best polymer framed semi-auto handgun in the world, hands down. My previous one had over 10,000 rounds through it without a single hiccup, no jams or any other problems, before it was unfortunaely stolen out of my brother's truck. I know there is a lot of Glock fan boys out there, but the bottom line is I've owned two and have had several jams with each one, out of a couple thousand rounds fired. Again though, never a single problem with the Sig Sauer. I absolutely promise you, you will not find a better handgun under $1,000, certainly not for under $500; no other handgun in this price range even comes close."

The remaining pistols were primarily sold after the war to West Germany for police use, with a smaller number being purchased by Portugal. The gun was rugged and of high quality and accuracy, despite the blowback operation of the gun and heavy weight, it gave a snappy, distinct recoil. This pistol is numbered in the 7000 range and was in the group sold to Germany in 1944.  It was taken off a German soldier in August of 1944 and is a GI bring back. It is mint condition and has the Nazi mark on the right side.  Email for more pictures.  Would sell but would rther trade for a Walther P38.  Let me know what you have."

Also have the factory box, which is one of the nicest factory cases I've seen, and the three blackstraps. May have a bit more ammo to toss in, I'll have to dig it out.

The gun sells new for around $450, and by the time you pay sales tax, get the ammo, extra magazine, and holster you're looking at close to $600 to put this kit together yourself. Gun is in very good shape, I'm the second owner and carried it regularly, but didn't shoot it much. Previous owner kept it in a nightstand and hardly shot it at all.

I will only meet FTF in the North end of Columbus. And buyer must have valid Ohio ID. I will NOT ship. CASH ONLY!!! No trades!**I also have a brand new StealthGear AIWB + holster for the CCP. I just got it this week and never used it. I paid $120 for it. And I will add it to the deal for $60. Otherwise I can send it back for a replacement holster for another pistol.

NO OFFERS.I had to say that up front. Thanks for looking at this rifle. I am hoping to sell this as painlessly as possible and without giving Gunbroker a cut of the money. This is a Colt AR-15A4 Lightweight with custom work done on the upper. Colt BCG and CH included.This is a low round count rifle. I bought it unfired and sent it off to ADCO to have the barrel cut and crowned and a BE Meyers 249F flashhider permanently attached. Flashider is around $100+. The barrel shortening and gunsmithing ran around $250.Overall barrel length on this carbine is 16.1""Functions flawlessly, about MOA accurate with M193 ammo. The only reason I am selling is I replaced it with a lightweight upper/rifle from BCM. The rifle comes with the same 20 round PMAG it acame with. Original box also included. I had an Aimpoint H2 on it with a fixed rear sight that both went to the new rifle, so no sights included. This rifle is solid, quality, and won't ever lose value being a Colt. If you are looking for a handy, short carbine, this is it.Thanks again for looking. If I do not get $1,000 locally, I will list elsewhere or part out."
