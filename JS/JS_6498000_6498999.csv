The adjustments are 1/10 mil with 5 mil per revolution of the turret. The reticle has mil hash marks and is FFP. Scope tube is 30mm. Cash only, no trades."

Authentic PU sniper order from Classic Firearms in early 2015 before their stock ran out. These are very hard to find now. Lots of fakes out there too. It was refinished with a stain and oil finish because I didnt pay the handpick fee and got a rifle with half the finish flaked off. It was so bad that it would've ruined resale value anyhow. But my price is lower than others I've seen. The steel is excellent with a crisp shiny bore. Shoots great even with surplus ammo. Its a sniper so it didnt come with a bayonet. Not interested in trades at all unless you have an AR10 and I could add a little boot.

The action is butter-smooth, bluing is very nice, great bore, crisp SA trigger, and very accurate. This will be a FTF sale in the immediate Indianapolis area, no shipping. Cash only, not interested in trades. I will only sell to those willing to produce an Indiana issued CCW license and drivers license and will be willing to sign a bill of sale. The price reflects the addition of an extra original factory magaine (not Triple K after market) and leather holser, all in superb condition."
