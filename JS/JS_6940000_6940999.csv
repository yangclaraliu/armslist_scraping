The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance.    The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.        Meets demanding military specifications Single action/double action Two magazines included     Beretta 92A1: Half-moon, single-dot, fixed rear sight and a straight dust cover.

Thank you and god bless, just a simple message saying I will pray for you helps as well PLEASE I need some assistance and just a friend to talk to that can help ANYTHING HELPS I ALMOST HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED please let me know if I can do anything to earn it or a loan would have written terms and I will sign it, I really need help and prayer as I am starting to panic and I can't find any help, I have a 2 year old and I just want the help for him please I can meet with anyone to prove I'm not a fake or a bad person I'm just in a tough spot, for some reason my cry for help is going unnoticed and don't know what to do, the reason he was able to make us leave until i pay that is due to me not being on the lease as I took over the payments for another person so I wouldn't have to pay a down payment and he is being really unfair, I will even let you call and talk to him cause I don't want people to think I'm not a real person that needs help, PLEASE JUST A SIMPLE MESSAGE SAYING YOU WILL PRAY MEANS ALOT, cause I can't find the last bit of help I desperately need, I don't care if I have to give someone my bank card to hold and my social security card, even the registration to my truck just so you know I have to come back to pay if its a loan, I never use craigslist and posted this as my last resort so if someone could please explain why I can't get help or if there is something I should do to make people know that I am real person in need of help, I have received messages saying people are cautious to meet in person, well to prove I'm really in need I will meet at a police station or anywhere that makes you comfortable, this has been the hardest thing we have ever been through, God bless ANYONE who takes the time to message me and say they will pray for us THANKS The only reason I am posting here is cause I am running out of options and losing hope so I know it will most likely be flagged but I just need a friend"

407,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6940407,For Trade:  H&K G3/HK91 - Hesse Reciever,"Worthington, Columbus, Ohio",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, June 11, 2017",Rifles,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Will try to provide as much detail about this rifle as I can, there is a lot of confusion about the G3/91/CETME platform on a whole, this is probably the closest you can get to high quality without bending your own flat or buying a PTR (cannot beat a PTR at all).This G3 is built off of a Hesse Arms Receiver, these are not the earlier sloppy Hesse receivers that were like the Special Weapons abortions, or out-of-spec and badly welded up CAI, FAC or even some Greek EBOs that were technically contract rifles made on non-spec H&K tooling.This Hesse Arms is made of a flat pressed on H&K dies and rolled/welded to H&K specs, the bolt gap sits between .016/.017 (nominal range is .012-.020). The Trigger Group (both Pack and Housing) are semi-specific so you do not have to worry about weldments, SEF markings or anything else that will make an overzealous RSO or ATF guy try to infringe on your rights.All other parts to include the Barrel are MATCHING H&K factory orginals, if you really wanted you could disassemble it and sell the parts to builders or rebuild it on a PTR-91 receiver w/ a picatiiny rail.Trigger pull is nice as far as these things go, about 5.5-6 on my Lyman, a bit of non-resistant take-up, but clean break, tactile and audible reset and no real over travel. The cocking handle is still pretty tight, I have not put many rounds down the gun at all, I do not like putting a number but probably between 200 and 250 would be a good guess.I have shot PMC, Privi and Brit Surp L2A2 through it without any issues at all, good ejection and it did not make a mess of the relodable brass unlike other roller-locks or HKs.I replaced the factory fore-end with an AIMSports Tri-Rail. I have to say, for the price I expected junk but it fits nice and snug, did not have to file anything. It is secured with 3 bolts rather than the 1 the factory fore-end is, and you do not burn your hand when doing a mag dump. I also have a Magpul AFG+ mounted on it, I retained the original in case you wanted it for looks. I have also mounted a UTG Claw Mount, it does not have any optics, but the option is there. The irons are pretty dead on, if a bit confusing IAW original Kraut Army TMsIt will come with 12 mags, two of them are beat the hell up on the outside from being thrown in a toolbox but they still work fine. 10 of them are for-real HK G3 surplus with no rust or anything. I got them vacuum sealed and covered in cosmo/oil. I have cleaned them all up and oiled the springs and checked them all to see if they 1) Fit 2) Fed 3) Ejected 4) Loaded a full 20...suprisngly I had no issues, the oldest one is from 1966 IIRC, but unlike used up M16 USGIs, these are actually Brand New and not Surplus (I guess they're Surp-Never Issued?)I already have a CMMG Mk3 that I use as my ""precision/SPR"" platform and it already has a long barrel, I am wanting a carbine instead and will need to move this one.I can add boot to some trades, if you want to make a cash offer you are more than welcome to do so, but I prefer a trade so I do not have to try to track down what I really want.I am located in Worthington/Polaris area near Lazelle and off of US-23. I can meet at the Cabela's near Lyra and I-17, the Home Depot in Lewis Center down US-23 or the Worthington Mall at the Crossroads right off of US-23 and I-270...for the right deal I am willing to travel as far as Tuttle Crossing in Dublin (Exit 15 on 270) or anywhere in Easton...I do not like to travel downtown or outlying areas (like Lancaster, Canal Winchester, etc), so you will have to come up to one of the listed locations"

The package begins with a fixed, 1:16 RH-twist, 3.98-inch blued steel barrel. To improve accuracy and protect the rifling, the barrel has a recessed muzzle crown. The Mosquito’s aluminum-zinc alloy slide has beveled rear-slide serrations that provide excellent purchase when racking. Atop the slide are a blade front sight and adjustable rear, both with yellow-green inserts. The front sight is staked into place from the inside of the slide, while the rear sight is dovetailed into the rail. Sight radius measures 5.51 inches. The pistol’s primary safety is a slide-mounted, ambidextrous, manual safety switch located below and to either side of the rear sight. Simply push the manual safety down to engage, and the reverse to disengage. A second safety, an integral, key-operated safety lock, is located behind the magazine. Operation is performed using the provided key. A third safety is a magazine disconnect, which requires the magazine to be in place before the pistol will fire. Directly under the manual safety is the Mosquito’s slide stop. It has several horizontal serrations and is angled downward, making it very user friendly. Just to the front of the slide catch lever is the decocker, which allows the shooter to lower the hammer with a sweep of the thumb. The Mosquito’s double-action trigger pull weight is 13 pounds, 8 ounces, and single action is 6 pounds, 4 ounces. Magazine capacity is 10 rounds. Because the magazine is constructed nearly entirely of metal and is of substantial weight, it drops clear of the pistol.     Description: SIG MOSQUITO 22LR PISTOL 3.9"" barrel, three dot low-vis sights, ambidextrous manual safety, SA/DA, 10 round magazine, black matte finished alloy slide with black polymer grip and frame. This pistol is brand new in the box with two additional front sight posts and an extra slide spring for use with standard velocity rounds. Import marked on left side of the slide ""R Guns Carpentersville, IL”. This is an excellent pistol for plinking or range practice."

Meet and look at the firearm.2. A serious seller should have no problem sending you multiple pictures.3. Save your emails. If the person you were emailing turns out to be a fake you can save the emails. I have a file and I have about 5 people on the list. 4. If you are in the state there should be no issue meeting up and they should not ""be too busy"" to meet you but not ""too busy"" to cash out your money order. 5. The USPS does notship hand guns and again if you are in the state there is no need for an FFL transfer so they do not need to ship to a gun store. 6. A photo id should be a must. A CCW is even better but not all have them. 7. A bill of sale should be requested by both parties (in case it is stolen). Keep it for how ever long you feel reasonable. 8. There should be no issue for you to get the serial number in order to check the validity of the product (rare or harder to find guns)9. If it is too good to be true question everything. The scammers are hoping you will jump before you have time to think about it. A gun that is 30 years old, unfired, in box, that is listed for half the price the current market is asking should be approached with caution. 10. If they are in another state other than where the advertisement is supposed to be listed then it is most likely a scam. 11. Do not trust a gun store that is not willing to admit they are one, sorry but you cannot have a decent transaction based on a lie from the get go. These are just some tips that should be obvious but the amount of scammers I am seeing on here is growing so they must be finding some people willing to send them money. They know what guns will attract the attention of those on here and unlike many of the people on here they are not charging full retail or more for a used gun. Just be careful guys. THINK! I have almost been scammed because the deal was ""too good to pass up"". The first question they always ask is ""Where are you located?"" Watch out guys do not give them business."

BERETTA - STOEGER 8000 COUGAR PISTOL: CHAMPION OF TACTICAL RELIABILITY
Background: The Beretta-created Stoeger 8000 Cougar semi-auto pistols inherit the reputation of the original Beretta 8000 as reliable, durable and powerful. First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy.  The goal was to be a smaller, more compact and concealable pistol for undercover and security work. The LAPD issued a variant of the Cougar with a 4"" barrel for a time.
Beretta bought Stoeger for their skilled manufacturing employees and then shipped the original Beretta Cougar machines to Stoeger to continue making the famous Beretta Cougar pistol (which made room to make the PX4 model pistol).
In its new incarnation, Beretta developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail.
LOW RECOIL
Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots.
ADVANCED ERGONOMICS FOR EASY HANDLING, CONTROL, CONCEALMENT
The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal.
MORE FEATURES
Rotating barrel action: the barrel stays put while the slide travels backward, rotating approximately 30 degrees by means of a cam pin and tracked milled onto the barrel and frame that unlocks the barrel from the breech once a safe chamber pressure is reached. This enhances accuracy as the barrel stays pointed on target and does not travel to the rear and then slightly tip up at the muzzle as in many other designs.
 
All metal lower frame: In stark contrast to the polymers used by most other semi-auto handguns being sold today. No plastic guns here.
Visible External Hammer – a real hammer like a real gun!
Double action and single action.
Safeties: Safety and de-cocker are combined into a convenient single lever.  It is also AMBIDEXTROUS for right and left handed shooters.
Take down lever is easy to use for field stripping and cleaning
Reversible magazine catch
Sights: 3 dot sighting system easily acquire your target. Both front and rear sights are MILLED and DOVETAILED into the steel of slide for durability and easily visible.
Smooth trigger action. Clean, crisp let off when working the action.
High capacity magazine.

741,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6940741,For Sale:  HIGH CAPACITY 45 ACP AUTOMACTIC,"nashville, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 379,"Listed On: Sunday, September 17, 2017",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Caliber: 45 ACP
Action: Striker-fired Double/Singe Action
Barrel Length: 4.2″ for excellent accuracy!
Capacity: 13 (12 rounds in magazine, 1 in chamber)
High capacity 45 ACP by Taurus, model 24/7.
FEATURES
Accessory rail for lights, lasers and other gear.
Deluxe HEINIE sights: nicely visible and easily acquire your target, slightly slanted forward to eliminate glare from light. They are also low profile yet visible. Nicely beveled and rounded to be anti-snap. Both front and rear sights are MILLED and DOVETAILED into the steel of slide for durability and easily visible.
Loaded-chamber indicator.
Nested recoil springs and telescoping metal guide rod keep the 45 ACP recoil to a minimum.
Striker-fired DA/SA system: ‘double-action’ pull to cock the striker for the first shot, then switches to its shorter ‘single-action’ pull for subsequent shots.  Smooth takeup pull that breaks very cleanly for such a reasonably priced gun!  Very nice short reset trigger action (seems less than 1/4 inch).
 
ERGOMNICS
Handles and fires extremely comfortably. The grip is textured enough to stay grippy even when dripping wet.
Safety and slide release: perfectly positioned and easy to manipulate, yet almost impossible to engage accidentally.
The magazine release is well-positioned for almost anyone.
Unbeatable Taurus lifetime warranty (transferrable to all subsequent owners).

Includes one 20-round magazine, HK93 manual, and hard case. Manufacture date is 1975, and has SACO import marks. Finish is about 95%, there are some minor scratches and claw marks. Furniture is in good shape. Comes with the wide forearm which can accept the bipod."
