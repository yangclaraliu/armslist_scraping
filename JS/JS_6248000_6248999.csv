We asked ourselves why a semi-auto barrel rib starts at the front of the receiver, a full 4 ½” further forward than an over-and-under shotgun. Doesn’t that unnecessarily shorten the sighting plane? The answer is yes, but we can do better. The new Velocity LR has an innovative ramp style fixed rib that starts at the back of the receiver giving the shooter the maximum length sighting plane for better target acquisition and tracking. The bottom line is that a better sight picture equals more broken targets.The Velocity LR combines all of the other ground breaking innovations that have made the XLR5 Velocity so popular last year.FABARM Velocity LR – Moving Forward Faster."

The balde has an assisted deployment and flys open.  The blade is made of S30V and is 3.26"".  After buying the knife, I had it professionally sharpened.  The blade angle was taken down to 16 degrees per side and polised to 0.25 micron (100,000 grit).  That said, it is razor sharp, though it has seen no hard use an only been used for opening enveloepes and the occasional box.I bought knife for $150 new, and it is in nearly the same conditoin as it was when I took it out of the box.  I am looking for $115 but may be willing to negotiate."

The loops fit up to 1 1/2"" belts.  I am happy to meet anywhere near Alexandria to meet a buyer. Or, I can ship anywhere in CONUS for $10 after receiving a check. I have never used this holster - it is perfect.  I paid $120 for it.Jerry"

Handscrafted by Kramer Handgun Leather, this holster does all the things you expect a good pocket holster to do. It ensures the gun will stay in the same place inside your pocket, stops the front sight from wearing a hole in your pocket, and ensures the gun will not be wrapped in a wad of pocket material when you go to grab it to defend your life. AND it also disquises the shape of the gun as seen through the pocket.The body out side of the holster is covered with a piece of plastic laminate that breaks up the outline of the gun, so the tell-tale bulge inside your pocket looks like a wallet. The side of the holster pressing against your body is smooth, comfortable, precisely molded horsehide.  I am happy to meet anywhere near Alexandria to meet a buyer. Or, I can ship anywhere in CONUS for $10 after receiving a check. This holster is BRAND NEW - I never used it.Jerry"

The US Marines approved this magazine for our troops. This new GEN M3 is a huge improvement over previous PMAGS. The new PMAGS have way too many improvements to list so feel free to go to Magpuls website and check it out. This is a hot price for GEN 3. I will do 10 for $105. These are cheaper than the GEN M2 with cover currently on sale out there.  We can meet close to Lynnwood. I Accept PAYPAL and will ship as well. Please dont be an idiot and ask me to ship to a capacity restricted state. These are magazines at a great price through a private party. I decided to unload some as I purchased a bunch thinking for sure we were going to have an anti gun President. REDACTED Chuck 
-Included Dust Cover. One of the most obvious features of the Gen 3 is that it comes with a dust cover included. There are dust covers available for the Gen 2 magazines but they must be purchased separately. The dust cover is useful in keeping debris out of your magazines while in storage as well as protecting the feed lips from damage while not in use. It should be noted that Gen 3 dust covers will NOT fit Gen 2 magazines.-Over-insertion tab. The Gen 3 PMAGs have an over-insertion tab along the back of the magazine to prevent the magazine from going too far when reloading the rifle aggressively.-Floorplate. The floorplate on the Gen 3 has a slimmer profile than the Gen 2 which can make it easier to fit into tight mag pouches.-Marking Dot Matrix. Located at the bottom of the magazine is a dot matrix that the user can fill in with a paint pen to mark their magazines (Mag 1, 001, 002, IKE etc).-Increased durability. The Gen 3 PMAGs are made of a stronger polymer (see below) that holds up better to wear and impact. They have a different follower that is grey in color compared to the brown follower on the Gen 2."

Unlike a boring AR15, this rifle has character. Everyone has an AR but not everyone has an Armalite AR-180. This is the rifle you need for your collection. It has an original sling, original magazine, original manual and sales paperwork with it. Original British markings on the barrel 17.5 Tons. Condition: I can't go as far to say that this rifle has never been fired. However, I will state that this rifle is in MINT condition. I purchased it from the original owner who kept it as a safe queen. As you will see from the pic's, I completely disassembled this gun and expected every part. Check out the pictures of the gas plug. Zero carbon build up. I couldn't find scratches or wear anywhere on it. This is a perfect example for your collection of original vintage AR style rifle that are rising in value every day. Don't delay because this gun IS going to sell because I only sell the BEST examples of whatever I'm selling. You won't find a cleaner example with all paperwork, anywhere! History: This gun was made by Sterling in England and imported in the 80s through Costa Mesa. Don't let these ""latest and greatest"" AR's fool you with ""piston driven"" and ""folding stock."" Armalite was doing it before it was cool! From Wikipedia: The AR-18 is a gas-operated, selective-fire rifle chambered for 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. The AR-18 was designed at ArmaLite in California by Arthur Miller, Eugene Stoner, George Sullivan, and Charles Dorchester in 1963 as an alternative to the AR-15 design, which had just been selected by the U.S. military as the M16. While the AR-18 was never adopted as the standard service rifle of any nation, its production licence was sold to companies in Japan and the United Kingdom, and it is said to have influenced many later weapons such as the British SA80, the Singaporean SAR-80 and SR-88, the American Adaptive Combat Rifle, and the Heckler and Koch G36. Through the Provisional IRA, which was noted for its use of the rifle, the rifle became known as the ""widow maker."" If you wish to read more, link to Wikipedia Comes with one original 20 round Armalite magazine, (1) original sling, (1) original manual along with (3) original sales sheets from Armalite dated 6/1/81.

If you are not familier with these, they are slimmer than Glocks (extremely easy to conceal this little cannon) and have incredibly smooth triggers. I had the slide, barell, slide stop and striker plate (rear of slide) all polished out. Very shiny which doesn't show up well in the pics. It's an excellent gun, I'm just consolidating everything to 9mm or smaller. The night sights are VERY bright (removed right now as shown in the pics, but will have the gunsmith put them back on in the next day or so) and have white halo's around the tritium vials, so you can see them very well in the daytime too. Here's what all is included, as well as the cost: The gun was $628, polish job was $135, extra magazine (Chip McCormick, yes, these will take 1911 magazines) was $25. Total was $788 before transfer, etc. I have the case, trigger lock, manuals, etc it came with too.SECOND GUN: I have a SCCY CPX2 9mm.  Black frame and stainless slide. In like new condition with only two mags fired. 2 magazines, box, etc. I had an issue with the barell and they sent me a new one (they will send you anything you ever need FREE as their customer service and warranty are AMAZING). So, the barell is brand new and unfired (haven't gone back to the range yet.) I bought this one used for $220. Between my he two guns, $900 invested. I am not expecting to get near this amount back though.

This AR has an 18"" 1/7 twist that is great for longer ranges and heavier weight rounds for coyote, wild boar, ground hogs (prairie dogs), etc. It has the following features:THIS GUN HAS NEVER BEEN SHOT. ONLY TEST FIRE. The barrel is an 18"" SOCOM profile, 4150 chrome-moly, chambered in 5.56 with a 1/7 twist. It has a hard, durable melonite finish and is produced in-house by Hardened Arms. It is borescoped and is threaded with 1/2x28 at the end to make an extremely quiet suppressed gun, with an A2 flash hider on it now. It has a low-profile gas block and a mid-length gas system, allowing for softer recoil and faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The handguard is upgraded to a custom made free float 6061-T6 12"" M-lock Talon with full picatinny rail along its entire top and 6-slot rails on both sides and bottom towards the end. The handguard also has 4 Quick Disconnect (QD) sockets for any possible sling position and has a hard-as-nails Type 3, Class II black anodized coating. The entire upper receiver also has the same coating with M4 feed ramps and laser-etching. It has been upgraded to a nickel boron BCG.The lower is a forged 7075 PSA with Magpul CTR stock and Magpul grip. Like the hand guard, it also has QD sling attachment points. The trigger has been upgraded to an ALG Defense Combat Trigger-ACT, very smooth and crisp.This flattop is ready for your iron sights or the optics of your choice. With the 18"" CMV barrel, the mid-length gas system, nickel boron BCG, and the amazing ALG trigger, the rifle is an unbelievably smooth gun to shoot. Retail price is over $1270, asking $1100.  SOLD!!!!!!To go with the gun above, I have a brand new Magpul MS4 2-in-1 QD sling, never used.

It is brand new in the box, I took it out to inspect it when I recieved it to make sure there was no factory defects and I placed it on a lower reciever I had laying around to see how it would look. It has not been used on a rifle ever, just mocked up for maybe 2 minutes. I am selling it for $250 dollars FIRM. Do not contact me attempting to negotiate the price, I will ignore you. You will be saving the fixed shipping cost and taxes when you order plus $25 dollars off their price. I do not need to sell it and am in no rush to sell it at all. If you do not like my price then please keep scrolling, I dont need my inbox full of what you think I should sell it for. Face to face meet only. No shipping, no trades, no exceptions.

The revolver has been fired, I shot a few hundred wad cutters through it before packing it up. The Python has been cleaned and oiled on a regular basis. There is no rust or pitting. The finish has a few very small and hard to find marks under close inspection, nothing distracting. Light drag wear shows on the cylinder, with the finish intact. You will not find a Python in nicer condition unless you buy one new in box. The finish is beautiful and the trigger is silky smooth. This is a very late last year of production factory Python, Colt's quality standards were very good at that time.

I painted the front sight with heavy duty white finger nail polish to make it easier to see... easily removed if you dont like it but it really helps find that front sight. like i said it hasnt been fired a bunch so the trigger pull in double action is pretty heavy but it has a crisp single action break that will also get better with use... its actually pretty accurate for a snubbie. buyer must show a valid florida i.d. and sign a bill of sale, no exceptions."

I'm not sure if it's ever been shot; at least I haven't, but there is a faint cylinder line and wear from the cylinder being opened. There is a scratch/handling mark on the butt as shown. This would make a great CCW or collectors piece. I have the original box, some paperwork.The Second Cobra is also a 1st issue with the Factory Hammer Shroud. No box and is in the same condition as the first. This also appears to have been unfired. $800 a piece or $1600 for both.My schedule is super tight, so can't travel outside of the Greensboro/Winston/HP area.All law will be followed and bill of sale will be signed.Trades will be considered @ higher price"
