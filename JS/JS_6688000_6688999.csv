I bought it, and realized I will never have to take it out to a rifle range and shoot it. Never fired, in box totally new with all goodies.Medium-contour (.75"" at the muzzle) barrel features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Hybrid Muzzle Brake to effectively reduce recoil while minimizing noise and blast to the sides of the shooter (thread protector included). Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 5R Rifling at minimum bore and groove dimensions, minimum headspace and centralized chamber. Equipped with a Ruger Precision Rifle® Short-Action Handguard for improved scope clearance for long-range scopes. 20 MOA Picatinny rail secured with four, #8-40 screws for increased long-range elevation capabilities. ""Upper"" receiver and one-piece bolt are precision CNC-machined from pre-hardened 4140 chrome-moly steel to minimize distortion. Three-lug bolt with 70° throw features dual cocking cams and a smooth-running, full diameter bolt body. In-line recoil path manages recoil directly from the rear of the receiver to the buttstock, not through a traditional bedding system, providing maximum accuracy potential. Ruger® Precision MSR stock with QD sling attachment points features a bottom Picatinny rail and soft rubber buttpad. The left-folding stock hinge is attached to an AR-style buffer tube and accepts any AR-style stock. Length of pull and comb height are adjustable. Barrels can be easily replaced by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges. Magazine well front is contoured for a positive grip for bracing against shooting supports. Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation, with 5/16""-24 thread for easy replacement. Bolt disassembly tool is stored in the bolt shroud for easy striker channel cleaning. Also features a Ruger Precision Rifle™ Billet Aluminum Bolt Shroud. ""Lower"" magazine well halves are precision machined from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum and are Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Patent-pending multi-magazine interface functions interchangeably with AICS and M110/SR-25/DPMS/Magpul-style magazines (works with some M14 magazines). Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger is externally adjustable with a pull weight range of 2.25 to 5.0 lbs.; wrench is stored in the bolt shroud. Extended trigger-reach AR-style grip and 45° reversible safety selector. May be configured with any AR-style grip and selector. Also includes: two, 10-round Magpul® PMAG® magazines.

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature - consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels - is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. Despite the small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. Variant 3 uses a conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) trigger mode and has a frame-mounted rear decocking button. This model includes two 10-round magazines. It is MA compliant.

With a partially pretensioned striker, it has a crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset. The P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. It has an ambidextrous slide catch lever and a reversible magazine release for full ambidextrous operation. The P320 Carry comes with the medium size grip module with a Mil-Std M1913 Picatinny rail.

Fortunately, it was designed so well that many competitive archers took notice and it became their bow of choice in the tournament archery season. This may have been what helped the Prime Rival win the “Best in Show” award from Field & Stream at the 2015 ATA Show. The bow has a great deal of speed at 340fps(IBO), so it’ll have plenty of knock down power for bow hunting or a very flat trajectory for a competitive setup. The PCXL cams, Flexis-AR, and Ghost Grip work together to help make the Prime Rival a very accurate and comfortable bow. This bow is adjustable for draw length from 26”-30” this is done by swapping the entire cams out we are selling this at its current draw length of 28”. No trades."

I have brought this gun up to code for current California requirements including a Fixed Magpul MOE buttstock and grip shield/fin (this is currently on its way in the mail and will be installed prior to a sale). It sounds like once you apply these two options to your Vector it is now considered featureless, meaning that you could then use a standard mag release. My Vector would still come with the mag button cover if you would it like to be installed. It just stays on by two small set screws and has a hole in the middle of the cover to push the mag release with a pin. This is really an easy change back and fourth if you wanted it on or off. But now on to the more important info... This Vector is the newest model on the market with the rectangular barrel shroud. Its the full 16 inch barrel model. It's all black and looks very sleek in my opinion. Comes with a Magpul MOE foregrip, black Magpul MBUS flip up sights, an additional side mounted picatinny rail which I ordered through KrissUSA, and an aluminum forward grip stopper for the the lower rail which I also ordered through Kriss USA. I will sell the gun with one 10 round Glock mag (the mag that came with the gun when I got it new last year). I will also include the original Defiance butt stock stock that came with the gun new. I only put about 150-200 rounds through the gun and have kept it very clean and oiled. It is in brand new shape and doesnt even look used.I will post a picture of the gun once I receive the grip shield. I am asking for $2000 and I am very firm on the price. If you try to low ball me, you will be ignored. I know the value that this gun holds and you will not be able to find it new im California anymore so dont try to tell me that the $1599 plus tax retail price from out of state is current because you wont find it new here. I have added approximately $150-$200 worth of minor upgrades to the gun, and I am by no means asking a ridiculous price for the gun.$2000 is what I will take for it and no less because I am not selling the gun because I dont like it, I really like the gun, but I am in need of the money instead.Thank you and you can email me with any questions."

I can throw in a few extra 15 round mags if necessary.  
Maybe 200 rounds through it. I do not have the box. I had traded with a friend of mine for this one, and he doesn't keep up with boxes. I guess I don't either. Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I used a box effectively in a self defense situation.
If you look them up, these things are pricey, when you can find them, usually over $700 from what I can find. Plus, I have added about $120 worth of parts.
I'll take a loss on it and price it at $700. Or I keep the Wilson parts and price it at $600

Product information noted below:
The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M4. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position.
Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.
Made in U.S.A.
 
FEATURES* Mounts on durable Entry-Length Receiver Extension tube (included) to accommodate the common M4 carbine buffer and spring** 7-Position LOP adjustability with customizable preset system for fast access to preferred length* Adjustment lever requires only gross motor movement to operate yet the entire stock remains streamlined and anti-snag* Solid ""fixed stock"" lockup and consistent cheek weld in all positions* Enhanced lock mechanism w/ internal impact buffer increases drop strength and shock resistance* Multi-shell construction provides solid foundation and shields critical operating parts from penetration damage* Sloping cheek weld combines a slim profile with user comfort* Stout construction provides counterbalance weight for improved weapon balance and handling* Storage compartment in tail of stock is removable and the door is reversible for user preference* Removable 0.30"" Rubber Butt-Pad offers an anti-slip surface and increased impact protection* Sling Mounts          * Front/Rear - Reversible QD swivel sling mounts fit up to 1.5"" push-button swivels (swivel not included)          * Bottom - 1.25"" sling loop"
