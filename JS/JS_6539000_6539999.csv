Allows you to tell at a glance if the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. A shotgun-style sliding tang safety catch lies on the upper tang behind the bolt. A hinged floor plate that covers a detachable box three-round magazine. The serrated gold trigger can be adjusted by simply removing the trigger guard to gain access to the adjustment screw. Once zeroed, the trigger can be tweaked without upsetting the point of impact. The 26"" barrel is free-floating and the recoil lug is glass bedded. The action, barrel, trigger guard and floorplate features Browning’s beautiful highly polished and deeply blued finish. This rifle has scrollwork engraving on the receiver flats and floorplate. Deluxe select-quality walnut stock with a gloss finish, and rosewood end caps on the fore-end and pistol grip wrist. Sling swivel studs.  The 338 Winchester Magnum cartridge, introduced in about 1958, was pretty much an immediate success. There isn’t much that a 225 grain quality bullet cruising along at about 2,800 fps won’t handily take care of (providing energy values at 200 yards that are roughly the equivalent to the .30-06 Springfield's energy values at the muzzle). An excellent hunting cartridge, it has found uses on “everything from pronghorn antelope on the Montana prairie to Cape buffalo in Africa”. A great elk rifle when hunting wapiti in heavy timber, on big moose, and really shines on big bears. “When a motivated bruin is bound and determined for a up-close meet and greet, it’s nice to have the insurance the .338 Winchester Magnum allots.”  This rifle is in beautiful condition with only minor handling/use signs (see pictures) in the factory number matching box. The Serial Number of this rifle (*****NYL17) indicates it's date of manufacture 1992. Browning Medallions like this one reek of quality. Just pick it up, and you know you have a solid rifle in your hands. Reputed for its accuracy, a great hunting rifle with the lethal knockdown of the 338 Win Mag caliber to back it up. A quality, handsome and refined rifle, ready to make memories and be handed down for generations."

The scope, bases, and rings are $200 because that's what I have in it. So include that in your offer and specify if you want the scope. If not I will assume you don't want it. Bipod not included. I will trade for a nice over under with removable chokes in preferably 12 gauge but may do a 20 gauge also. Any other trades just email me with offer. I'll say yes or no either way. Thanks"

The limbs will top out at about 70+ pounds and can be set as low as 58 safely. Currently set at 70 pounds. -The riser of the bow is in Mathews Tactical finish.  -The string and cable are in great shape as they have been shot very little. I would give them an easy 9 out of 10. As you can see, they are in great condition. -Peep sight is installed, aligned and served into place. -String loop is installed and ready to shoot. -Custom Mathews Dampeners are installed on the two large riser spots as well as the small spot in the sight. -The sight is an Axion Gridlock 5 pin in matching Tactical finish. Just a fantastic sight. There are so many fantastic features to this sight that it would be tough to list them all here. Those of you who know and shoot Axion products know of their amazing quality and durability. 5 pins in .020 size. There is also an adjustable Axion rheostat blue light added to the sight. The light mounts in the bracket of the sight, so that it shines only on the extended fibers of the pins. This eliminates any halo that can occur when lights are shined on the pins themselves and helps to eliminate any external light so that you do not spook any game when hunting. Adjustable brightness on the light by simply turning it brighter or dimmer. 2 inch housing with Glo Ring. It also has a Mathews Harmonic Dampener in the sight to help eliminate any vibration and to match the look of the bow perfectly.  -The stabilizer is a Brand New Axion 6 inch in black finish As those of you who know the Axion products know, this is a fantastic stabilizer in both look and function. There are three Mathews Harmonic Stabilizers and one Mathews Harmonic Dampener in it. Again, matches everything about the bow perfectly.  -The rest is a Trophy Ridge Pro model drop away in matching Tactical finish. This is a great rest that gives you the best of both a containment rest and the drop away. The launcher on the rest can be locked into the up position preshot to contain the arrow for you. That launcher will not drop away until the bow is drawn and shot. With the this rest, you can draw the bow and let back down without the rest dropping away. Very few rests have this function as most other models reset when the bow is drawn. This rest will not drop away until the bow has been shot. The Pro models also have a lock down feature that will lock the launcher into place after the shot to avoid any vibration or noise. The rest is all set up and ready to shoot.  -Brand New braided wrist sling in black is also included.   -Mathews No Cam soft case.   - 1 dozen Easton Storm carbon arrows. Cut to 29.5"".   This setup is flawless and the only reason I am selling is to get a Halon. This bow shoots smooth and I do hate to sell it...but, I only need one bow, so I will pass along a good deal to another bow hunter. All this would be at least $1500-$1700 in a pro shop. $995 is a steal for all this bow comes with. Pretty firm on price. Serious inquiries can get more pictures through text, but you won't be disappointed. Oh, comes with all the packaging for accessories (as seen in picture) and a box for bow included.  Contact Steve @ REDACTED. Please be local to Woodbridge. Please only serious inquiries. I am not selling this because I have to...if need be, I will keep and use it this coming hunting season."

The firearm features a forend covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum fully adjustable aperture and post sights round out the platform with 4 rear aperture sizes, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. This model has a 20-round magazine.
