I had no plans of selling it, ever, but I’m going to have to put a new outboard on my fishing boat this year so I’m raising some $. This rifle has several upgrades. First, it has the enhanced polished trigger (EPT) installed which gives a much smoother pull and cleaner break than the typical AR. Next, the handguards have been replaced with a 15” Blitzkrieg Tactical ultra-lightweight aluminum free-float rail to improve accuracy and provide mounting positions for additional accessories. The Simmons 3-9x50mm scope lets in a lot of light and is already mounted and zeroed and therefore included. Finally the stock and grip have been painted ultra-flat charcoal gray and clear coated with ultra-flat clear coat. Finally, I’m including a color matched 10-round magazine and a 30-round black magazine. I may entertain some firearms trades, but again I’m looking for cash to purchase a 115+ HP outboard for my boat. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions."

Maybe get her a PX4-Storm Compact - will consider a trade. Can provide pictures.  Would prefer a local sale to having to ship to FFL. Buyer pays the shipping cost. Cash or USPO money order.Maybe I was thinking Zombie Apocalypse or have seen too many Lethal Weapon movies... but I couldn't resist this PT92 the extra 18 round mag and the two 33 round magazines. My wife looked at it and said, ""I want a cute gun."" So maybe a PX4-Storm? I don't know, but it is going to have a hammer and a manual safety on it. I know, I know, but I can't justify yet another 9mm along with the PT92. I tried both extended mags, and they operate flawlessly.  What fire power! Guys think fire power and not cute. The weapon is in excellent shape and operates flawlessly."
