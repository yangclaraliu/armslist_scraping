I will meet near Greensboro.Rifle is in the box and as new as the day it was built, in 1980. Still wrapped in the original wax lined paper that protects the rifle. All the manuals and paperwork are like new. Rifle was manufactured in the year of 1980 only, it is a numbered and limited run, and is the ""Oliver Winchester"" gold plated and engraved commemorative lever action rifle.  It is engraved everywhere on both sides of the gold plated receiver. It has a gold plated lever, as well as a gold plated foreend cap. It has the octagon barrel with gold engraved ""Oliver Winchester"" signature enlayed on the side of the barrel. Also has the Oliver Winchester medallon embedded in the side of the butt stock. There were 19,999 of these made. This one is in the 3000's(serial number).I've got many clear and crisp pics, from every angle, that I can send if you are serious and sitting on $850 cash.This thing is stunning; the gold, the engraving, the wood, the checkering in the wood, all of it is on a level that I have not seen anywhere, since acquiring this rifle. You cannot see that in the one picture included with this listing.Rifle is in 38-55 caliber, which is consistent with a 38special in diameter, but the casing (and its powder content) is longer than even a 30-30 round.This caliber was the ""go-to"" caliber before the 30-30 from Winchester took its place. I will give you a collector's box of ammo to go with it  It is not overly expensive ammunition nor is it hard to find, in case you this rifle as a shooter and need ammo. I myself had never heard of the 38-55 caliber, but later learned that this is the caliber that all of America was using, back when Americans were primarily horseback with a lever rifle in their scabbard.Exceptional rifle in every way, recouping some of the expense of Christmas.Price is firm as granite. No trades, just looking for cash."

Light, fast, ultra quick to the point, natural . . . . essentially perfect. Of all the pistol caliber rifles of the day, none have become more viable in modern Cowboy Action shooting than the '92. It's a good year to get your hands on some history.   The favorite of the Duke and just about all the cowboy actors. 'Fill your hands you . . . ' The Model 92 was elevated to the status of movie star for three quarters of a Century by many of the most famous on-screen cowboys. When you saw a movie with John Wayne, or watched The Rifleman with Chuck Connors you knew that the rifle they used was more than a screen prop.

Now is your chance. Here is a Winchester Model 1892.... Still in great condition for a rifle this old. Shoots very straight, very tight and looks great. Cal is 38/40.  125 years and still going strong. 2017 marks the 125th year of the Model 1892. Of all the rifles produced in an era often called 'the Winning of the West' the John Browning-designed Winchester Model 1892 stands out as an engineering masterpiece. Light, fast, ultra quick to the point, natural . . . . essentially perfect. Of all the pistol caliber rifles of the day, none have become more viable in modern Cowboy Action shooting than the '92. It's a good year to get your hands on some history.   The favorite of the Duke and just about all the cowboy actors. 'Fill your hands you . . . ' The Model 92 was elevated to the status of movie star for three quarters of a Century by many of the most famous on-screen cowboys. When you saw a movie with John Wayne, or watched The Rifleman with Chuck Connors you knew that the rifle they used was more than a screen prop. Going back in time, Annie Oakley performed across the world with Buffalo Bill shooting her special smoothbore 1892.   $2,900.00  Firm PriceOnly serious contacts....  please"

It's called a ""Mountain Gun"" because it has a lighter-weight barrel than most S&W ""N"" frame revolvers, and was designed to be comfortably carried for hours by outdoors people who needed a large caliber firearm for protection, but didn't want to haul a gun that weighed a ton. I purchased this revolver brand new to shoot bowling pins, but shortly after I did so, my friend who worked at the local bowling alley got a new job, so my supply of used bowling pins went away. The revolver has very little wear. If I had to guess, probably no more than 300 rounds, and they were low-power ""cowboy"" loads.I'm a private seller, but the sale will be handled throguh a local gun shop, so if you're a Florida resident, you'll have to have the background check if you don't have a CWP.You'll also have to pay Florida sales tax. If you live out of state, that's OK, too, as the local firearms shop WILL ship to an out-of-state address as long as THEY have a FFL, but the local shop charges an additional $50 for shipping and handling.

Fixed the timing on it recently and decided to thin the herd a little. I dont shoot it and do not keep to keep it. I am more into semi-auto pistols, and currently have a few too many. Pistol will come with a couple boxes of .357 magnum ammo and if I have any .38 ammo that will go with it too.These were only made for a couple years in the early 80s (81-84 I believe). Mine is one of the earliest 581s made, it is said to be a pre-production model due to the serial number. Serial number starts with AAA which dates to 1980, they didnt come out until 1981. With it being so early I have thought about getting the Factory Letter from S&W but right now I am too cheap to spend $50 to get it done.Blueing is nice, but NOT perfect. It does have some holster wear on the end of the barrel, and it has been shot quite a bit. I do not have the original wood grips, the grips I have on it are a set of Pachmyer presentation grips. Looking to sell, Not looking for trades. I don't NEED to sell so do not lowball me. This is a cool piece of history and have been told by several S&W enthusiests that it could be worth $800+ because of how early it is. I do not know if its worth $800, I have seen them sell on Gunbroker for around what I am asking. Looking to get $650 I would to open to reasonable offers. DO NOT lowball me, I will not give it away."
