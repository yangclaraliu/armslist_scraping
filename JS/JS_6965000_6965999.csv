The aluminum frame keeps weight down for comfortable carry and resists corrosion from carrying the pistol close to the body. Low profile sights provide quick sight acquisition and interfere minimally when drawing the weapon from a holster or purse. A match-grade aluminum trigger offers a consistently crisp pull for accurate shot placement. The Kimber Micro Bel Air is an extremely lightweight and compact semi-auto pistol that conceals easily and deploys instantly."

Original Colt SP1 for sale in excellent condition. Rifle is in the 95% mark for condition and use, probably couldn’t find one this clean if you tried for the price.
Real deal Colt with slick side receiver, no forward assist or magazine fencing, has 20” pencil barrel 1:12 twist with chrome lining, distinctive triangular handguards with shorter A1 style stock.
Very light rifle (6.5 lbs) and a notable change from the heavy military style barrels and carbines everyone has today. This is the one that started it all; the very first AR15 model available.
87xx serial number; original, unopened cleaning kit is still in the stock as well.
2017 Blue Book pricing for 95% is $1,850, I’ll knock $100 off and ask $1,750 for this museum-grade rifle. Seriously won’t find another one like it.
Calls only, please.

The Russian Slab-Side magazines are generally covered in inspector stamps, but the Izhmash factory mark (feathered arrow in triangle) will be found stamped low on the back of the mag’s body.  Made from thick 1 mm steel, it is without doubt extremely durable, but heavy.  They originally had a blued finish, but many appear to have been later refinished with a black enamel coating.WILL SHIP!!Buyer pays shipping, no sales to restricted states.PAYPAL.Thanks for looking."

With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. The 10/22's heat-stabilized, glass-filled polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact, and abrasion-resistance, and has an unmatched ability to withstand the elements. The hammer-forged barrel is locked into the receiver by a unique two-screw V-block system and the A380 aluminum alloy receiver is precision-machined to provide long-term reliability to the 10/22 action. Ruger's patented, detachable 10-shot rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding. The easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique flush-mounted magazine without leaving it exposed to dent or creating uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle's balance points.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing.

It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorter barrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels. SK models can also use a variety of HK magazines - compact double stack 10- and 13-round with flat or extended floorplates, in addition to proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model comes equipped with 3-Dot sights and includes one flat base and one extended floorplate 10-round magazine.

The full package comes with everything that came from the factory (as shown in the photo), including the box, lock, all paperwork and six factory magazines (one 7-round mag and five 8-round extended mags, four of which are still in sealed factory packaging).  I've also added the Talon Grip.

I’m in College Station so anywhere in the Austin, Houston, DFW triangle is OK.

If I don’t respond to your email immediately, that just means I’m still at work and I’ll reply as soon as I get home.Price is firm. I’m not looking for a trade or low-ball offers. Thanks!"

I have some nicer lacquered furniture on it and I have a couple upgrades as well.
I installed an upgraded Wolff recoil spring and a Primary Weapons Systems FSC47 muzzle brake. This muzzle brake is one of the best you can buy and really makes the gun more shootable. Retails for about $90 normally. Gun comes with one Magpul PMAG.
I'll sell the gun with the original brake for $575or with the PWS muzzle brake for $675."

I added an attachment for the handle, so you can add opticsIt has one flaw. The bottom forearm grip has a chunk broken off. It doesn't affect it at all and can easily and cheaply replace. I don't bother because it has rubber strips that goes over that spot to cover it up. No one knows unless you tell them.It also has, what looks like a S&W revolver pistol grip. I thought how weird at first glance, then I shot it and liked it. It can also be easily replaced, but I like it."
