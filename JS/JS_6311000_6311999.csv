I paid a high price for it but it seemed worth it for the beautiful condition it was in, it looked almost new. I purchased it for CMP shoots and probably put a few hundred rounds through it over the years. I shot it at Camp Perry in the as-issued Springfield Match twice, one time it shot a 100-5x in slow prone, not bad for a 70+ year old gun with 1MOA sights. It has a 4-groove barrel. I believe this would be considered CMP “Collector Grade” but since I have not owned it from the time it left the factory, I cannot attest that all parts are the same as those installed when it was new, but it sure looks it. I considered doing some polishing here and there to slicken up the rifle to make it better for competition but I realized it would be a shame to do that to such a nice piece of history. Even my local armor, a guy who has seen everything twice, said “this is a nice rifle”.  One part has been replaced, the leaf spring under the rear sight was weak and did not hold it secure, it was replaced with a surplus spring. Also, I used a custom front sight in matches but reinstalled the original for this auction. It is the same front sight but I may have used a surplus front sight pin.  The receiver and some parts have that beautiful green parkerize, the metal is excellent except for some pitting on the buttplate, maybe it sat on a damp rack for a while. You can see the very minor wear on the bolt from the use it had. The wood has a few dings, see photos. Everywhere I look there is a “R” stamped. I photoed everyone I could find. If there are any others that I may have missed, please let me know and I’ll look for it and send a photo. The only problem I could find with this rifle is that the front barrel band is not tight on the stock. I think the stock may have shrunk a bit over the years causing it to no longer fit tight. Everything else looks great but if you want me to check anything, let me know. If you have any questions or would like any additional photos, just ask. I built up a drill rifle into my new competition gun so I no longer shoot (or need) this Remington. If you are looking for a really nice rifle, here it is.Sell to FFL or C&R, otherwise buyer pays transfer."
