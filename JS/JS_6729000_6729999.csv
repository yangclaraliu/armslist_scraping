The syler (spl) flintlock action also works flawlessly, and the ""set"" trigger is literally the best trigger i have ever felt. It has no markings that i can find on it, but i am assuming it is in the .45-.50 caliber round ball range. You may know better than i do. I know my father payed quite a bit for this guy and similar models are very spicy, but he let it go a little bit, and it could use a bit of love. Again, everything functions flawlessly. Note: in the third photo there can be seen a hairline crack on the left side of the lock. Could easily be repaired, but as i am selling it i would rather sell as is. Its why i am asking such a low price.if truly interested, you can come look at it. Its in great shape, other than the slight crack. Make an offer. I probably wont send pictures, because i dont want to."

The scope is mounted at a 90 degree twist because I prefer the knob on the left. Could be easily rotated back for a more ""normal"" look.  Comes with 2 mags, box, manual, lock, and 263 rounds of ammo.  $500 for rifle, $600 with scope.  Buyer pays transfer. Will trade for quality (Colt, SW, Ruger) stainless revolver (.327, .357, .41, 44) with at least 3"" barrel or Remington Wingmaster 12 gauge in great shape.  Might trade for something else of equal value, but not interested in tactical firearms or automatic pistol."

These are the Russian Carbine versions of the WW2 bolt action rifle. Both are all matching and in perfect condition. The dark colored rifle has the original straight bolt and bayonet. The light colored rifle is more unique due to it having a custom bent original bolt and there is no bayonet placement and has no import markings.

Has minor surface scratches and wear from normal use, no major flaws in the finish. (black phosphate) Internals are fine and I've personally only put a few hundred rounds through it, and cleaned it often and thoroughly. I've also never had any misfeeds or misfires with this particular rifle, and I've exclusively fed it budget ammo. This rifle also has a factory 3.5 pound trigger, which is a nice addition.Let's talk about the downsides with this rifle: Once again, there are some minor scratches on the finish, being a phosphate finish. They're not bright and shiny and deep, but if you're pouring over it, you can see them. The rear sight can wiggle side to side slightly, and if you bump it, it will stay off to one side. (I suspect this is more of an IO problem than a this rifle problem.) Also, like many AKs, the charging handle can hang slightly at the bump area of the dust cover. This is mildly annoying if you are closing the bolt slowly. Miraculously, however, all the rivets on this rifle are put on cleanly and correctly. The front trunnion is also in excellent shape with no scratches, dings or deformation at all.What all do you get? You'll get the original cheap cardboard box from IO Inc, as well as the original ""waffle"" plastic mag the rifle came with. You'll also get 3 TAPCO mags along with the rifle. It feeds reliably with all these mags, even when being gripped tightly. I'll even throw in a MOLLE bandolier to keep your magazines in, if that's your kind of thing.Overall, this is a good rifle if you're not sure if you want to get into AKs, and want something simple to try it out on."
