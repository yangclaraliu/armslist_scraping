The PX4 utilizes a rotating barrel locking system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise by releasing recoil energy radially. Corrosion resistant fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame. Non-slip texturing on the grip also aids in weapon control. An integral Picatinny rail provides rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The PX4 Storm is a double/single action semi-automatic pistol with an external hammer. The ambidextrous safety doubles as a decocking lever. The slide features a Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating for superior corrosion and wear resistant finish, while forward and rear serrations provides a non-slip hold on the slide when loading and unloading the weapon. White, 3-dot sights provide quick sight acquisition in varied lighting. The gun's chrome-lined barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. The Beretta PX4 Storm Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips quickly without tools into 5 subcomponents for cleaning and maintenance.All firearms will be sold at Coast To Coast Pawn and require an ATF/FDLE background check for approval of the purchase.  There is tax and a $5 FDLE fee on top of the listed price.  Other rules and restriction will apply as required by ATF and the State of Florida.  For Example,  a manditory 3 Business Day Hold is required for Non CWP Holders purchasing a Hand Gun.

This pistol has been discontinued/Limited Production which is exactly what it says on the CZ website so for those of you who either collect or love CZ Pistols this is a great one for you, it is brand new in the box and has never been fired. I have owned two of these in my lifetime and the first one is absolutely flawless. This one has not even had a round chambered. A lot of these guys on Armslist claim they are selling new guns then you go to see it and find that they are not. This pistol has been upgraded with meprolight night sights and comes with an extra flush-fitting magazine. There are two reasons why this pistol was  deemed Limited  and discontinued  the Czech military decided they wanted this to be a primary firearm  so there was a large order placed and the Firearms were then made for the military rather than civilian use in the United States . Also the CZ p09 was made shortly thereafter  and while it is the cheaper counterpart it is still a great gun as well if that's the pricing you are looking for then go buy a CZ p-09. These guns are dead accurate which is why they have earned a reputation. The sp-01 series is regarded as the number one nine millimeter in the world and has been for quite some time if you check any top 10 list online you will see. This pistol has a decocker and is single/ double action. $650 is a fair price considering they may never come back out and I am asking less than what I paid I am sacrificing the taxes and the night sights pricing plus my time giving a background check. I am in no rush to sell the pistol. The pistol also comes with a Blackhawk holster for free.*** If you are not a buyer or not serious please do not contact me you will be blocked or reported*** if you are interested in giving a trade I will look at HK Glock and Sig Sauer depending on what it is and what it comes with. Also other brands I am interested in are anything in nine millimeter including multiple trades and concealed carry pistols that are high-end. 1911 are also welcome"

Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.

Will also come with the Vortex red dot, a Black Rain sling and Black Rain soft case. Sorry, no box - my dog apparently has a taste for cardboard.

991,http://www.armslist.com/posts/6409991,"For Sale:  Browning .22 Long Rifle Ammunition; Performance Target Rounds (3200 rounds total, but will sell individual boxes for the right price)","Burlington, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 250,"Listed On: Thursday, February 2, 2017",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 8 boxes of Browning .22 Long Rifle Performance Target Ammo for sale.There are 400 rounds per box, so in total I have 3200 rounds for sale.I'll sell all 8 boxes for $250 which is a bit less than 8 cents a round. I think that price is fair seeing as it is better than all the prices I've come across recently. That includes prices from stores and at gun shows I've been to in the past week. (It ends up being $0.078 per round if you buy them all together)If you'd like to buy less than all of them together I'd be willing to sell individual boxes for $35 each. Thats closer to 9 cents a round. If I have to piece them out, I'm going to ask for more per box since It will take more effort and time on my part.I'll update the listing if I sell some of the individual boxes.Thanks for checking the listing and I wish you all happy plinking."
