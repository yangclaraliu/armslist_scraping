Pushing down on the dual-purpose slide stop/decocker will first release the slide (if locked to the back) and then safely lower the hammer. The firing mechanism with exposed hammer operates is classical single and double action modes with the hammer remaining cocked after each cycling of the slide. The single action trigger breaks crisply at 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs) and resets with a short travel of 3 mm. the smooth and long double action 6 kg (13 lbs) trigger pull is engineered with safety in mind. The magazine is released with an ambidextrous button at the base of the trigger guard.http://www.arex.si/weapons/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuPOqDlaX6UAll key components: the slide, the frame as well as the barrel are made from solid bar stock. The slide is machined from chromolly steel and light but though 7075 aircraft aluminum alloy is used for the frame. The heart of the pistol is a precision machined barrel, cold hammer-forged from one piece of chromolly steel. The slide and barrel undergo a proprietary nitro carburizing surface protection process that provides high surface hardness and extreme corrosion resistance for extended use or storage in hostile environments. Hard anodizing is used on the aluminum frame for its abrasion resistance. The barrel unlocking block with an angular ramp is also a solid steel piece inserted in the frame.The entire design process was performance driven and oriented towards long-term durability. The materials and technologically advanced manufacturing process will ensure cost effectiveness and an extremely long life cycle. An internal extractor was chosen since it allows for a closed slide design and renders the same or better reliability with fewer parts. The long dustcover adds to the rigidity of construction and incorporates full-length slide guides and an extended accessory interface (MIL-STD-1913). The large trigger guard was conceived for use with various gloves. The iron sights with contrasting white dots enable quick target acquisition. The pistol can be safety disassembled without any tools – the slide must be fully retracted and no trigger pull is necessary.REX Zero 1 pistol has several independent safety features that guarantee safe operation under most unfavourable circumstances. The Firing Pin Safety catch acts as a main drop safety catch which is disengaged only when the trigger is fully depressed. The hammer can be lowered safely by a dual-purpose lever located on the left side of the frame in front of the ambidextrous manual safety catch. The safety catch can be engaged with the hammer in either a cocked or decocked position. When put on “safe” it disconnects the trigger bar from the sear. The safety catch can be intuitively disengaged with the thumb in a down-sweeping motion. A loaded chamber indicator both visually and tactilely declares the presence of a round in the chamber."

Ive loved every second that ive shot it and i am in mo hurry to sell it or trade it. But i am interested to see if there are any interesting offers out there. This is a piston gun and it is considered a top of the line gun i paid 1650.00 for it so please dont low ball me. I will not respond to those low ball offers thanks..  i am willing to work out a deal. You can have the rifle by itself or with mags(i have about 10 ) and the case thats in the picture is also up for bargain . The price listed is the rifle with the sling that it came with and one magazine. Willing to trade for other guns of equal or less value with money on top ( on your end) like i said i paid 1650 so am example of somthing i would consider is a 800 doller ar or ak with 800 dollars cash ( just an example) . Looking for military type rifles ars aks . No revolvers or bolt actions or antiques .. but if you have anything interesting let me know worst i can say is no ... also if you are buying it cash buyer pays transfer fees.

These were specifically re-barreled to accept .308/7.62x51 in the 1950's as the 7x57 round was becoming obsolete, however, not all of them were re-chambered. This allowed for the more common .308 and 7.62x51 rounds to be used instead. If you desire an inexpensive rifle to stash or simply want a reliable .308/7.62x51 rifle to enjoy at the range, then this is the rifle for you.    These are stock photos – exact condition will vary.   Must be 18+ years of age to purchase.   Price: $224.99 each"

Details from RD Website:
The Rifle Dynamics AK to M-4 Stock Adapter (Gen II) allows for the replacement of any standard fixed stock AKM (see exceptions below) to work with an AR buffer tube assembly. The angle of our adapter is designed specifically to position the buffer tube, allowing the shooter to easily access proper sight picture with iron sights and/or optics.
This feature also allows many different sling-mounting options for the individual users. Any sling adapter that fits on the AR buffer tube should work. This adapter is easy to install without modification to your AK-47, AK-74, AKM and with no need to permanently alter the stock tang.
The Rifle Dynamics RDAK to M-4 stock Adapter is designed by Rifle Dynamics and made in the USA!"
