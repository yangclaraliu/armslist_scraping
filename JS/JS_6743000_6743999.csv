This is a nice little gun that was originally a French police trade in. Since I've purchased it I've only put around 50-60 rounds through it but it's definitely one of my favorite guns and my primary conceal carry. It's a little on the heavy side for its size and there's normal wear o  the bluing which is to be expected from a gun this age. It shoots crazy accurate for its barrel length. These are interesting guns that have a few quirks that you might want to research before purchasing. I will also be including my custom leather kydex hybrid holster and 200 rounds of ammunition and two mags as well as the originall leather holster and cleaning rod not pictured. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have. Note!! this uses 9x18 Makarov not 9x19 Luger.

Here are two modestly priced pieces which are perfect for somebody just getting into 1911s.One is a Charles Daly. It's a full size 1911 with tactical trigger, beavertail grip safety, extended safety switch, and drift adjustable sights. If you don't know, Charles Daly imported 1911s made in the Philippines, just like Rock Island Armory. The quality is comparable--a decent 1911 at a pretty low price point, better than the Turkish 1911s that sell for about the same price.The other is a Commander size Llama Max-I C/F. It has rubber grips, a shorter beavertatil grip safety, an extended slide release. I bought this 1911 from a police officer several years ago. He put a sold guide rod into it that really tightens up the groups. I'm not a huge fan of Llama, but this one has been good. The finish is better than it looks in the photos, a VERY flat phosphate. My flash makes it look thinner than it is.These are both good pistols, not shot much (by me). I just have better 1911s that I shoot more often. Time to let somebody else play with these.You must be a legal Minnesota buyer to purchase these pistols.I'm asking $400 each. Please, serious enquiries only."

The ARAK 21 is a gas piston actuated AR/AK hybrid with AR style controls. Although I'm selling it with a Faxon lower, the ARAK upper is compatible with any standard spec AR lower. The upper has a quick change barrel which can be swapped out for any of Faxon's other “Barrel Assembly Units” which come in a wide variety of calibers. I'm selling the rifle with a 5.56 heavy barrel. I also have a 12.5 inch 5.56 barrel, which I'm willing to throw in for an extra $100. (NOTE: This is not a registered SBR. Before installing the short barrel, you'll need to go through all the standard BATF paperwork.) The rifle also features detatchable picatinny rails (not pictured), an adjustable gas system, side-charging handle and ACE folding stock. I'm also including an MD legal 10 round Magpul PMAG. 
Condition: This rifle is in excellent overall condition and has had just shy of 200 rounds put through it. The reciever has a few minor cosmetic dings, visible in the included photos. 
Price: $1,200 Cash or best offer. As far as trades, I'm interested in Milsurp rifles of all kinds, a decent AR-10, a PTR-32, VZ-58, and any Maryland legal AK variants in 7.62x39, including an AK pistol (through an FFL). I'm open to combinations of cash/trade as well as trades outside of this list, so don't hesitate to contact me with other offers.
