Used this a few times at the range for dialing in hunting optics, and don’t need any more. It has the lifetime Vortex warranty. Great for really seeing long distances, but you’ll need a tripod to hold it steady.
Definitely a high level of ruggedness in a spotting scope from Vortex Optics. The distinctive broadband coatings reduce surface reflections for crisp, bright images. This scope brings you spectacular color, regardless of the lighting conditions outside.
Step up from a conventional 60mm spotting scope to the larger 65mm series - and still keep a hand on portability. The Vortex Spotting Scope pulls in more light for brighter views throughout the versatile range of this modern 15 – 45x eyepiece. Your eye will rest comfortably against the soft rubber eyecup that twists back for full field viewing if you wear glasses.
If you're serious about hunting/birding/scanning, you won't let a little thing like ""poor weather"" keep you inside. This spotting scope is tightly sealed with O-rings and nitrogen purged for complete water-proof, fog-proof viewing. On brighter days, you simply pull out the sunshade for high quality images that are free from glare."

Nothing wrong with it, just recently purchased a Galil, and don't think I need another 5.56 AK.  When i purchased this Arsenal, it had a bad headspace issue. I have already had the rifle sent to Arsenal, had all the issues fixed, and have taken it out myself to shoot it—runs like a top, and is VERY accurate. I have paperwork for the maintenance done at Arsenal Inc.as pictured, she's in a tan Arsenal 100-series stock set, but I'd like to keep that set for another AK. This rifle would come with black factory furniture in that case. Tan Furniture can be negotiated though. Also have a like-New CRH Customs sidefolder that can be included.The 106CR is the model with the combo gas block/sight. The 106 series of rifles have been discontinued, and are only getting harder to find—especially the CR's.i like this rifle a LOT. Very sweet shooter. I actually prefer it over the Galil, but Galil mags are cheaper for the most part. Speaking of mags, this one includes 3 Pro-Mag 30rd mags. I've never shot with any of them, some fitting may be required. Extra Bulgarian ((10)) steel reinforced magazines are available for negotiation.Also included is a cleaning rod, and original Bulgarian sling. no ammo included.interested in trades—Steyr AUG, RFB, M1A, MSAR, ARX-100, ACR, SCAR, FS2000, PS90, maybe some other odd battle-style rifles....not interested in any AR-15's at this time, but rifles that accept AR mags are a preference! May also be interested in a higher-end bolt action. I will not sell for cash, don't bother asking."

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*.  All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

This is a large frame (original Vaquero), not the current ""New Vaquero"" model. The large frame originals are capable of ""Ruger only"" loads. It's the blued model with Ruger's faux case hardened frame. The revolver exhibits a slight turn line on the cylinder from handling but has not been fired outside of the Ruger factory. The model number is 00511 and the catalog number is BNVBH-453. Now the backstory on the rare part....Ruger transitioned from the original Vaquero to the new Vaquero late 2004 early 2005 timeframe and stopped making the originals. Thus gun was made in April of 2010 (based on the spent shell casing that came with it from the factory), 5 years after the end of production and 5 years after Ruger stopped the faux case hardening on their blued single actions. Furthermore, the notorious Ruger warning label on the barrel was much smaller and on the underside of the barrel. Prior examples were larger and on the side of the barrel. After acquiring, I called Ruger to verify the manufacter date. Between that and the model/catalog number (which were unique to this particular gun), I was able to find out through a few searches this was one of Ruger's parts clean up releases that were only sold through Davidson's, and that there were likely less than 200 or so made. The late production alone makes it a Ruger collector's object of desire, but the barrel warning label variation puts it over the top. If interested, feel free to reply with your number. I'd be happy to text additional pictures, including the factory label showing model/catalog as well as the dated spent casing. Price is $500"

Short History: I took this Glock as partial payment for a trade. I already own one just like it! But, we needed to complete the trade! I’ve shot enough rounds with this Glock to know it shoots well and is very accurate. I have reason to believe it hasn’t been fired excessively, although, it seems to me, you cannot hurt any Glock and the more you fire it, the better it continues to perform.  It's a Glock thing...
However… it does have some holster wear, although the, obvious IWB wear on the right side of the firearm, is primarily on the removable clip rather than the gun barrel. All-in-all I would, and have, carried this gun concealed IWB for a short time. It feels as good as the one I owned before I traded for this one, and shoot just as well.
I doubt true Glock enthusiasts, should they be aware of this listing, hesitate at a Gen 4 Model 19 Glock for a below market value price, especially without any of the paperwork involved, although I do want to see your Indiana driver's license.  Included with this Glock is an extra magazine.

These rifles were originally adopted in 1870 as single shot rifles, then updated to a magazine fed rifle in 1887, then they were then thrown in storage after the carcano was adopted. When WWI rolled around the Italians found themselves short on rifles and converted many of these rifles to 6.5 carcano. This rifle is dated 1885, so it saw all three of these stages. This particular rifle is in good condition, and the bore is still shiny. It also retains the cleaning rod, which is uncommon for these rifles. Has a few cracks in the stock, and there is some sort of repair looking thing on the endge of the bolt face(pictured).These are considered to be unsafe to fire, since they were meant for black powder cartridges. So this rifle is more of a wall hanger, unless you want to hand load your own reduced load ammo."
