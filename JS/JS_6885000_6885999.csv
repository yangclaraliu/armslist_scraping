It's got a brand new battery, but it's sat for a while and will need the carburetor scleaned. There's a small cam timing issue that just needs the chain tightened up according to a mechanic, I just haven't had time to work on it. It's a beautiful bike, I'm just considering trading it for firearms and cash. Unless you have a messed up back like me, this is a hell of a deal considering it would take a weekend or two in the garage to get it going. I simply can't do it because of my injury, which is really upsetting. I'd rather see it go to a good home than sit in my garage. I'll send more pictures upon request. Feel free to send offers, worst I can say is no. Things I won't consider:Anything in .22Air rifles/pistolsJunk firearmsAnything not related to firearms unless it's a really good deal. Please, don't waste my time and yours by offering a $400 gun and trying to pass it off as something worth twice that.

It has been in my family since new and has sat in my safe for the past 20+ years. It's in excellent condition, however it has been sitting so I will include a complete seal kit for it (bought from Mr. Schimel's sons a month ago.) I also purchased two manuals on how to completly rebuild the pistol (these are also from the Schimel sons and were not very cheap at all). I have a few c02 capsules I will include as well.I KNOW THAT THE BARREL IS NOT FROZEN TO THE FRAME ON THIS VERSION AS I HAVE REMOVED THE PIN AND PULLED THE BARREL TO CHECK THE CUP SEAL SIZE. I have never fired this airgun nor have I tried too. I just assumed that it will need the seals replaced due to it sitting for so long. I purchased everything with the intentions of rebuilding it and giving it to my son, but have since found out that it is far to powerful for a plinker! Asking 200.00 OBO I tried to put a pho to of this up but it kept telling me it was too large so if you are interested in this I can send you all the photos you want, just ask.

Made in Italy, this little rifle is ideal for a bugout kit, or for kids just starting out and wanting a safe gun to practice with. This gun is super accurate according to every review on it, it is also threaded for a silencer/supressor as well as just about any AR barrel attachment like flash supressors and muzzle breaks (not that you would need either). It has a Picatinny type rail on it for a scope or a Red dot and it has a very good trigger pull. The extractor on this gun allows for very easy extraction and the gun comes with 12 notches for convenient ammo storage on the wire butt, so you can reload pretty quick. I tested myself without shooting and it took me 6 seconds to unload the old round and reload the new. Got this brand new 3 days ago, decided to go with a floating survival rifle. These run from $169.00 to $189.00, depending on where you go."

Quick rundown: this is the sniper variant of the 1903 rifle that saw service primarily in ww1 and 2. By the serial number it was made in spring of 1943. Unfortunately a previous owner sporterized it, but the full stocks can be had for a relatively reasonable price, that was my eventual plan for the rifle but have decided to go a different route. Has a tasco scope on it with a single post sight, scopes are not really my thing, i would like to say it's fixed 4x, but not 100%. The scope is close to a ww1 style optic I believe.Rifle is very accurate but iron sights are more of my deal. Chambered in .30-06 rifle is in very good condition and has been well cared for/stored.

Bledsoe was inspired and trained to some extent by Agee, and continued this type of work after Agee died in 1952. Both men used only brands from the state of Texas and their work is very similar. This 5 1/2 inch barreled gun, with its combination of gold and silver and steer-head pearl grips with gold and ruby decoration, is one of the more ornate examples we have seen. Based on the fux book leather casing, it was done on special order for Mr. Ray Kirby, who was a well known Colt Collector during the latter half of the 20th Century. The casing itself is magnificent and may be unique. Regardless, it certainly adds to the appeal of this gun. The bore is as new and the action is in perfect working order and the mechanics are tight and crisp."

The MCX is a badass design that runs flawlessly.MCX will come with box manual and everything else from Factory including 3 magazines and about 300 rounds also a few small upgrades like Surefire brake Magpul forward grip and a few other odds and ends that will be added in at no additional cost I will upload pictures as soon as Armslist quits being a pain in the ass
