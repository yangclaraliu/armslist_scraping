Was done not too long ago and never actually got to the range to sight it in. Front of slide was angle cut as well. When cutting for RMR, rear sight dovetail was cut off. Could perhaps use a Cerakote on Slide. Bare metal on front of slide was blued to protect it. Comes with T.Rex arms ragnarok holster to fit it with inforce apl fde light. Holster is coyote brown. Grip was custom stippled as well and finger grooves were taken off. Makes grip feel slimmer and has good grip. Comes with two 17 round mags.  Looking for a sig legion mostly.

I am asking 550.00 dollars, a bit pricey... perhaps, but if your looking for the best P89 for your money, this is it and perhaps the only 1 around like it... Sure you can see these around for 350.00 or 400.00 but they are worn--- not like this pretty girl, 99.99%...Note this gun is a handful and not light polymer plastic... thus it is a great gun for the new folks- it makes for less recoil- aiding in a steady aim...Note: we must meet at an FFL dealer to do the transfer at your cost..."

Original ""flip-up"" lens covers and rubber strap, includes extra Duracell battery in-box.  Eye relief is very broad so it's like a 2x magnifier without having to worry about a perfect cheek weld, it allows very flexible rapid targeting with an added level of magnification.  It's suitable to target close range to whatever your 2x magnification capabilities are, I've shot a tight 300 yard group with it on an M4. I don't need it anymore, can't find them online anymore so I figured I'd offer it up for folks looking for a clone optic.  I checked a M14 forum and the last one available was sold a while back so if you think you might need one snatch it up.   Thanks for looking!"

When I got it the mag catch wouldn't hold the mag when you fired a shot. Through research and forums I found out that isn't a rare thing. Following advice I ground the mag catch as instructed and now it works fine. The part can also be replaced for about $50 but then you run the risk of the same thing happening. The othe option is to take it to a gunsmith and have them charge $400 to do what I did. These sell for $1350 or so with the form fitting case and one stick mag. Since I had to modify it my price reflects that. I am mainly looking for revolvers but cash works too. I like Ruger or Smith and Wesson revolvers. Any questions feel free to ask.

Also, it has an aluminum 4 shot side saddle shell holder. Aside from a couple insignificant scuffs from storage, the gun is like new. I have tapped the forend for 10/32's screws to accommodate the addition of a picatinny rail for mounting a light, and the receiver has been tapped with 8/32's holes for mounting a rail for an optic. Also included for the sale price is 17 boxes of Royal Buck OO buckshot. At 80 cents a round, that's about $70 in ammo. If you'd like more pictures, feel free to text me at 256-4nineseven-3five9four. Firm on price at $250, and might consider trades for an RMR plus cash on my end. Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

This is a large frame (original Vaquero), not the current ""New Vaquero"" model. The large frame originals are capable of ""Ruger only"" loads. It's the blued model with Ruger's faux case hardened frame. The revolver exhibits a slight turn line on the cylinder from handling but has not been fired outside of the Ruger factory. The model number is 00511 and the catalog number is BNVBH-453. Now the backstory on the rare part....Ruger transitioned from the original Vaquero to the new Vaquero late 2004 early 2005 timeframe and stopped making the originals. Thus gun was made in April of 2010 (based on the spent shell casing that came with it from the factory), 5 years after the end of production and 5 years after Ruger stopped the faux case hardening on their blued single actions. Furthermore, the notorious Ruger warning label on the barrel was much smaller and on the underside of the barrel. Prior examples were larger and on the side of the barrel. After acquiring, I called Ruger to verify the manufacter date. Between that and the model/catalog number (which were unique to this particular gun), I was able to find out through a few searches this was one of Ruger's parts clean up releases that were only sold through Davidson's, and that there were likely less than 200 or so made. The late production alone makes it a Ruger collector's object of desire, but the barrel warning label variation puts it over the top. If interested, feel free to reply with your number. I'd be happy to text additional pictures, including the factory label showing model/catalog as well as the dated spent casing. Price is $550"
