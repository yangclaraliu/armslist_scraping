It has been a safe queen. It has approximately 300 rounds through it and was always cleaned and lubed after each shooting session. Other than shooting it, i have ran snap caps through it on occasion (no dry firing). The trigger is crisp and smooth and it shoots like no other AR/M4 I have ever fired. I have never had a malfunction with this rifle, which is to be expected with a company like H&K. I have never seen another AR/M4 with this exact fit and finish. The tolerances are exact and it easily shoots sub MOA. It is built like a tank. As you can see by the pictures, it is in new condition and has been babied."

and the only problems I've ever had with it were because of shitty aftermarket magazines.
Includes 1 BX 25 magazine and I have 2 more I can include for an extra $40 if you like.  (I've switched to HC Mags)
Heck...  I'll even load em with CCI so that's like $1,000 worth of impossible to find .22 ammo right there!!! lol
it also has a $90 laser engraved ""sniper"" bolt.
 
the only problem is that i somehow smacked/broke the rear sight.  (see pic) I was gonna replace it with a better truglow anyway but I always used a scope on it so just never bothered to fix it.
 
Asking $300 and I'm pretty firm on the price because...  well...  like I said it's a cool gun and I keep toying with the idea of customizing it or something."

The feel, fit and function of this Maxus are just as comfortable, responsive and accurate as a Maxus we make, but you won't be able to pick up the Maxus Sporting Golden Clays without admiring the gold enhanced Engraving on the satin nickel finish receiver or the gloss varnished grade III Walnut stock and forearm. As the name says, this is a sporting gun and it comes standard with a HiViz fiber optic sight, yet it's light enough to be carried as a field gun. The Maxus boasts incredibly fast trigger lock time, enhancing accuracy, and a super-efficient PowerDrive gas operation system that reduces recoil for greater shooting comfort and quicker followup shots. It comes with 5 choke tubes (Full, Improved Modified, Modified, Improved Cylinder, Skeet) has a 14 1/4"" LOP, 2"" drop at heel and weighs roughly 7lbs 4oz. Displayed images are of the actual shotgun you will be receiving. There is a 5% processing fee for the use of a card. I am not a store and this shotgun is not valid for any current Browning rebates.

For thise that don't know, He was a Master Gunsmith that lived in Cooper's Landing, Alaska. H e passed away 1988 Fuller offered an invaluable skill as one of only two gunsmiths on the entire Kenai Peninsula. He made rifles, and for those who already had them, he kept them working. His exquisite work — particularly with Hawken rifle replicas — was well known nationwide, and still is today. This rifle has a real SCHILLINGER Lock. Schillinger only made locks for ""Master Gunsmiths"" and are also hard to find and built like no other, the quality is Top of the Line! The trigger was a very very light hair trigger when set, but last time I cleaned it, I put some ballistol gun cleaner on lock, and it will only set at half cock, so this lock would need a tune-up (by black powder gunsmith)to shoot.

The primary xenon light provides 70 lumens of smooth light beam maximally-focused by Pentagonlight proprietary textured reflector for achieving the greatest distance and center brightness. The xenon bulb is protected by an anti-scratch tempered glass lens, and is damped against recoil by the internal spring loaded back-plate deflection mechanism against a completely isolated battery compartment. The pre-configured LED side light is available in red navigation light or NVG-compatible light. The LED side light is optically-enhanced to project a low visibility and low signature perfect spot into the distance. This side light module is easily interchangeable between any of these LED's for meeting task-specific needs. Configure a red navigation light for staging and pathfinding while maintaining stealth. Configure an NVG-compatible light for reducing signature and minimizing saturation of night vision devices. The unsual blue-green color of the NVG-compatible side light can also work as a ""good guy"" signaling light for communication with other team members during an assault. The thumbscrew style mount easily engages and disengages the light from the Picantinney rail. Manufactured by high precision CNC machine from aerospace grade aluminum with anti-abrasive, anti-corrosive, and anti-reflective military spec Type III hard anodized exterior finish, MD2 Xenon DuoLight is rugged and durable for illumination in the most critical environments. The anti-reflective finish reduces glare and minimizes signature in ensuring stealth. MD2 Xenon DuoLight is preconfigured with TR3 straight-cord tri-mode remote pressure pad switch. Positioned in momentary mode, the light can be activated by pressing the pad on the back. Turn tail-cap slightly to position in constant-on mode. Constant-on switches light on continuously without pressing, and is also useful in the event of remote pressure pad or cord failure. The pentagonal shape tail-cap facilitates rotation for operating the switch mechanism, including positioning the switch in lockout mode. This tail-cap is compact and light-weight, allowing the system to have better form factor. An independent recessed push ON/OFF tail-cap switch easily activates the side LED light. The pentagonal shape tail-cap facilitates its rotation for placing the remote tail-cap switch in safety lock-out position. Additional tail-caps are available for alternate methods of operation. Optional conversion heads are available for the primary light in meeting your mission-specific needs. The unit can be easily serviced in the field with a Field Service Kit, including the option of replacing the front tempered glass lens if it is damaged during an unexpected frontal impact."

The original fluted steel barrel has been replaced with a light weight Tactical Solutions 4.5"" threaded barrel with fiber optic front sight. I added a picatinny rail for an optic, like a Deltapoint. The original trigger kit has also been replaced with a match grade adjustable trigger kit that has a 3.5lb trigger pull. I also replaced the original Ruger grip plates with a very comfortable, rubber Hogue grip with finger grooves and thumb rest. Over $1000 invested!
I am including the original fluted barrel with weaver rail, the original trigger parts and the original Ruger grip plates. This particular Ruger is VERY difficult to find. This package comes with (2) 10rnd clips. I have more Ruger brand 10rnd clips if you're interested. The extra clips will cost $40 each. I do not have the original box but I will include a black zippered gun bag that holds the gun and parts. This gun is in amazing condition and is VERY accurate and fun to shoot! It's also a lot less expensive to shoot than other calibers. I usually shoot CCI Mini Mag 40 grain ammo but it will work with just about anything. It's a reliable Ruger! Contact me if interested and I'm open to serious cash ""Best Offers"". Buyer will need to sign a Firearm Bill of Sale and present their Texas Drivers License and/or CHL.NOTE: Because both barrels are included in this sale, you will esentially have 2 firearms. The barrels of Ruger .22 pistols are the serialized part, which the ATF considers ""the gun""."

I am selling my custom built Saiga-12 short-barreled shotgun. Not only does this gun look amazing but it's also incredibly fun to shoot!For quick speed and convenience, the charging handle has been relocated to the left side, instead of the right, which is most common on Saiga shotguns. The stock also folds to the right.
This 12 gauge shotgun has an adjustable pressure plug to allow for a wider range of ammo choices.
The stock is incredibly strong, comfortable, and telescopic, to allow for a wide range of operator arm lengths.
The barrel is 14 inches including the 3 inch spiked muzzle breach/compensator
I am including (3) 12 round mags (SGM Tactical brand) USA MADE!!!
I am also including (1) 20 round drum (MD Arms brand) best lightweight drum!
I will also include (6) boxes of DDupleks Monolit 32S tactical 12g shotgun shells. These things are beasts!
NOTE: Once the payment is completed, I can give the ammo to you immediately. You will still have to wait to pickup the shotgun from your FFL dealer, until you acquire the tax stamp.
This is a Class-3 firearm! NFA RULES APPLY!
If you are not located in Houston, this shotgun will require a Form 3 transfer to your local FFL dealer and then a Form 4 transfer to you. Otherwise, I can meet you in Houston at an FFL dealer to do the transfer.
Know the laws in your area. Make sure you can legally own this item. Having a Gun Trust is the most convenient way of acquiring CLASS-3 Firearms.
Buyer must make full payment up front before the transfer process will begin. I accept Cash, Certified Check or Money order. There are no returns or refunds allowed. Buyer is responsible for all shipping, insurance, and transfer costs. Contact me with any questions. I am open to serious cash ""Best Offers” Thanks!"
