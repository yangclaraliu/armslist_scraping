It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. This model has an OD Green frame, black slide with 3-dot sights, and includes two (2), 15-round magazines.

Chances are if you’re reading this you already know what it is. It has the EBR-2C MOA “Christmas Tree” reticle; the one you want. A good number of top precision shooters use this scope. As you can see from the pics, it is in excellent, as new condition. You get everything that came with it in addition to the 34mm one-piece Vortex picatinny rail mount. Unfortunately, this sweet piece of glass never made it out to the long range for me as I sold the rifle I originally bought it for and have since set my sights on something else.

A sixgun anyone would feel proud to carry! 45LC CALIBER5 1/2″ BARREL The EMF Great Western II is made by Pietta’s Italian craftsmen in Brescia, a region famous for making guns since before the Revolutionary War. Alessandro Pietta, SASS Life #41531 took a page out of history books and reintroduced the 1873, paired with the 1860 Army grip frame. He added a competition trigger that is wider and set back, allowing for a larger finger in the trigger guard. When you first pick up the “Alchimista”, your initial reaction is, “WOW! What a nice feel!” The 1860 grip is longer and slimmer than the traditional 1873 Single Action Army grip. While not quite the 90 degree angle of the Bisley model Colts, it points better and more naturally than the revolvers with the standard 1873 grip. The “Alchimista” with the 1860 grip would be a great addition to your Cowboy Action Battery.

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. The accuray and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m. Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing. The FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine. The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns. Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use. The FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing.  Won't last long!"

The best thing about this variation of the 92 is capabilty to add an accessory to the rail below the barrel if you choose. This gives it a little more versatility over the other 92 variations and opens the door to a host of applications without having to modify the gun beforehand.

The Kushnapup Bullpup Stock in its factory original application is designed for use with the Saiga 12, 20 gauge and .410 Shotguns and the Catamount Fury 12 gauge Shotgun and certain designs of the AK47.Copy this < photos.shutterfly.com/album/REDACTED9/full/REDACTED1 > then Paste into URL browser / address bar for more PHOTOS.
The company only makes the 1 version and buyers are instructed to make certain fitment adjustments as is deemed necessary for any particular gun.
This particular stock was custom fitted for the Fury I.
1) Since the Fury has the Weaver/Picatinny rail on the receiver's bolt cover that part or the Kushnapup was removed as can be seen in the photos which I can email to you.
2) Also the opening on the bottom for the receiver needed a very small amount removed due to the slight size difference between the Saiga and the Fury.
3) Also a very slight amount of material was removed from the hand grip for clearance of the Fury I five and 10 round magazines since they rock into place, vs the Fury II which slips in. That modification is hardly noticeable.
4) The customizing also includes the installation of 2 picatinny / Weaver rails on each side of the fore grip to which one can add accessories such as a light or a sight.
I mounted a quick detachable rail that cantilevered over the rear sight and mounted a holographic reflex red/green dot type of sight which worked very well since this stock raises the shooters sight orientation too high to make good use of the standard iron sights. [I included 1 photo with this arrangement with the Fury in the stock and with the mounted reflex sight for illustration purposes only.]
NOTE: This listing is only for the Customized Kushnapup Stock only. Photos with other items, like the gun and the sights are not included! [sorry - but its required to mention this for obvious or not so obvious reasons]
Will be shipped in its original box with included owner's instruction manual. Contact me for payment.

The Kushnapup Bullpup Stock in its factory original application is designed for use with the  Saiga 12, 20 gauge and .410 Shotguns and the Catamount Fury 12 gauge Shotgun and certain designs of the AK47.Copy this < photos.shutterfly.com/album/REDACTED9/full/REDACTED1 > then Paste into URL browser / address bar for more PHOTOS.
The company only makes the 1 version and buyers are instructed to make certain fitment adjustments as is deemed necessary for any particular gun.
This particular stock was custom fitted for the Fury I.
1) Since the Fury has the Weaver/Picatinny rail on the receiver's bolt cover that part or the Kushnapup was removed as can be seen in the photos which I can email to you.
2) Also the opening on the bottom for the receiver needed a very small amount removed due to the slight size difference between the Saiga and the Fury.
3) Also a very slight amount of material was removed from the hand grip for clearance of the Fury I five and 10 round magazines since they rock into place, vs the Fury II which slips in. That modification is hardly noticeable.
4) The customizing also includes the installation of 2 picatinny / Weaver rails on each side of the fore grip to which one can add accessories such as a light or a sight.
I mounted a quick detachable rail that cantilevered over the rear sight and mounted a holographic reflex red/green dot type of sight which worked very well since this stock raises the shooters sight orientation too high to make good use of the standard iron sights. [I included 1 photo with this arrangement with the Fury in the stock and with the mounted reflex sight for illustration purposes only.]
NOTE: This listing is only for the Customized Kushnapup Stock only. Photos with other items, like the gun and the sights are not included! [sorry - but its required to mention this for obvious or not so obvious reasons]
Will be shipped in its original box with included owner's instruction manual. Contact me for payment.
Any questions? Please email or text / call Dennis, REDACTED."

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.
The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American."

This ammo is mixed headstamps but mostly hebrew markings years 67-88. THIS AMMO SHOULD NOT BE FIRED. I am purely selling for component breakdowns of someone who is willing to spend the time to do so. Brass is tarnished and corroded due to storage method by company that sold it. I am looking to get $.07 per round (450 rounds by weight w/o can). Asking $30 for the entire can as you also get a nice .50 cal can with the ammo. I have been told but cannot speak to the use of the powder, some have stated the powder can be used and is fairly good quality.I must reiterate, this ammo is known to have extremely brittle brass and can cause massive failures even in heavily built guns. It should be fired at only at the risk and decision of the shooter."
