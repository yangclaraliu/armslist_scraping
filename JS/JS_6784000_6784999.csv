Very precise measurements that are much, much better than the typical solvent trap, or maglight make-shift suppressor.These can be Cerakoted to your liking if you find that necessary.1/2-28 threadYou will need a drill press to modify this into a suppressor***ONLY do so if legal in your state, AND you are legally allowed to have a suppressor and only AFTER you get the tax stamp from the ATF***---Why you should suppress your firearm---HEARING PROTECTIONSuppressors reduce the noise of a gunshot by an average of 20 – 35 dB, which is roughly the same as earplugs or earmuffs. By decreasing the overall sound signature, suppressors help to preserve the hearing of recreational shooters, hunters, and hunting dogs around the world.SAFER HUNTINGMost hunters do not wear hearing protection in the field because they want to hear their surroundings. The trouble is, exposure to even a single unsuppressed gunshot can, and often does, lead to permanent hearing damage. Suppressors allow hunters to maintain full situational awareness, while still protecting their hearing. The result is a safer hunting experience for the hunter, and for those nearby.NOISE COMPLAINTSAs urban developments advance into rural areas, shooting ranges and hunting preserves across the country are being closed due to noise complaints.ACCURACYOne of the most common problems for shooters is decreased accuracy caused by flinching in anticipation of the firearms discharge and recoil. By containing the explosion of the gunpowder at the muzzle, suppressors reduce recoil, and help decrease muzzle flinch. These benefits lead to improved accuracy, better shot placement, and more humane hunts.---How it works---1. Purchase the legal Solvent Trap that attaches to the end of your barrel of your rifle or pistol.2. Complete the Form 1 tax form and send the $200 tax to the ATF (https://johnpierceesq.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-new-form-1/)3. Wait until you get your Form 1 Tax Stamp Approval back from the ATF (Last I was told about 100 days)4. ONLY ONCE APPROVED - You can now modify and drill out the cone cups and the end cap to allow projectile to pass through the Solvent Trap (now legally a suppressor)5. Go shoot and notice the difference in sound!*It should be noted that Trump has vowed to remove Suppressors from this list that requires the $200 tax stamp fee, once that is done buying a suppressor will be like buying a shotgun - No tax.---Are suppressors legal?---Silencers are legal but are regulated by federal law and on a state-by-state basis by the Nation Firearm Act (NFA) branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE). Private citizens can legally purchase and possess silencers in 42 states* without a permit.To purchase a silencer the following qualifications apply:• RESIDE IN ONE OF THE 42 STATES THAT CURRENTLY ALLOW CIVILIAN OWNERSHIP• BE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES• BE LEGALLY ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE A FIREARM• PASS A BATFE BACKGROUND CHECK• BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE TO PURCHASE FROM A DEALER• BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE TO PURCHASE FROM ANOTHER CITIZENhttps://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/05/jeremy-s/nfa-for-beginners-form-1-to-manufacture-an-nfa-item/https://johnpierceesq.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-new-form-1/"

The photos show the rifle with a New SilencerCo Hybrid Silencer which is NOT included with the rifle however it can be purchased with the rifle for $950 transferred NFA rules. This fine rifle was professionally built by one of our clients in 2009 I purchased the rifle in 2010 new and have shot it approximately 150 times using only Norma Match ammunition. The Scope, Bipod, and Stock Pouch system is all Brand New and was put on the rifle for this listing, the scope has the Factory Box and all the paperwork. The rifle is in excellent condition. It has been professionally handled since new and properly maintained. The targets shown were shot by me using the bipod off a bench at our range in normal shooting conditions with typical ND wind so they are not modified targets like most guys show. We have shot this rifle in the indoor range off a sled which is boringly a one oversized hole 10rd group. The rifle will ship with build receipts we have available. The receiver on the rifle is a Real ""700 Tactical"" with the numbers matching bolt not a generic sps receiver. The rifle is top of the line and deserves a good home. It can be viewed at my shop in Grand Forks ND if you are in the area otherwise if you have questions email them and I will get back to you right away. PLEASE NOTE: The Silencer is NOT included, we are a FFL/SOT with a large selection of NFA items in stock if you would like something specific drop me a note perhaps we can help you out. We are selling off a number of our weapons from our Collection of Fine Firearms this year including Military Rifles, Machine Guns, and related items so keep an eye on our listings."

ALL OTHER CALIBERS IN STOCK. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. . THE WORLDS LARGEST BLASER DEALER. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Manual Cocking System The R8 offers the capability of safely stalking with a round in the chamber without any chance of discharge due to the innovative manual cocking system. Without the need to move your hand from the pistol grip you can silently push the cocking lever forward allowing the firing pin and spring to be cocked, ensuring a shot at a moments notice. To de-cock the system simply push the cocking lever forward with slight downward pressure and the lever will return to the neutral position removing all tension to the firing pin spring. For the past half century the Blaser manual cocking system has been recognized as one of the safest systems in hunting rifles.No conventional safety system can surpass the uncocked firing pin spring. To safely open the bolt, simply move the cocking lever forward until you meet the first resistance (about 3 mm?/?1/8“) to unlock the bolt handle. This slight movement will not cock the rifle and you can load and unload the rifle safely. Protected against unauthorized access The unique design of the intergrated trigger/magazine assembly allows the trigger/magazine unit to be removed and stored separately. This important safety feature protects against misuse by unauthorized persons. Automatic Decocking By removing the trigger/magazine unit the R8 can no longer be cocked. Additionally removing the system from a cocked rifle, the cocking lever will return to the de-cocked position. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact. When traveling, the R8 can be transported stripped down in a rifle case. In contrast to very long conventional rifle cases, passers-by do not recognize the R8’s inconspicuous rifle case. Locked Magazine The double release buttons protect the magazine against unintentional drop out. Our innovation does not stop there. We also incorporated a locking device for the hunter who prefers a non-detachable magazine. When the magazine is locked in place, and with an open bolt, the rifle can be loaded from the top. Protected All metal parts of the R8 are either made of rustproof material or otherwise protected against corrosion. The closed construction of the R8 action prevents contaminants from entering the rifle. Every magazine comes with a protective cover (1) preventing dirt from entering the rifle when the magazine is stored outside of it. When taking out the magazine, the magazine chamber can be closed with a magazine chamber cover (2) which is included in the scope of delivery. Desmodromic Trigger Mechanism The critical link between shooter and rifle is the trigger. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing. This important design feature offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Hunting around the world There is no better advantage to a hunter than the ability to use one rifle anywhere in the world. With calibers ranging from .222 Rem to .416 Rem. Mag. there are no limitations for your Blaser. and more to come. Several rifle scopes on one barrel Every barrel is prepared for the Original Blaser Saddle Mount. This allows for several rifle scopes to be used with one barrel."

Please read carefully so we can make this painless as possible. I have in my possession a DDI Arms 47s. It has 405 rounds fired through it without issue. It's been spray painted with green and brown stripes, it doesn't look bad at all. With this rifle I will include a Midwest Industries QD side mount and an Aimpoint Comp4. With the Aimpoint I will include an American Defense QD mount. Now, the only issue is that I broke the safety lever trying to make it more ""snug"" to the reciever. This doesn't affect the rifle in anyway, just needs a new safety for a stamped receiver which will cost 14 bucks. I'm getting rid of all my guns and honestly don't want to mess with it. So with the broken safety lever and the spray paint, I'm only asking $850 for everything. Will include original box and PMAG that came with the rifle. That's a hell of a deal once you price this stuff separately. Serious buyers only! No trades at this time. I can provide links to a new safety and pictures upon request. Price is firm.

I am an extremely careful reloader and weigh all of my charges individually by hand but this does not mean you should trust a stranger's reloads! I do keep accurate record of the date loaded, powder, charge, primer and bullet. I expect that you will be pulling these rounds and reusing the components. The lead bullets all vary too much(a few grains) to be able to weigh the loaded rounds and accurately verify the powder charge. You could weigh the jacketed rounds to verify the powder weight. They are all within 1 grain of eachother(variance made up by brass and bullet weight). Again, I am selling this ammunition as components to be tore down and reloaded. The 700gr bullets wont likely come out easily with an inertial puller so you will need to pull them on press using a piece of pvc over your press ram and grip the bullet with cutters to pull. those bullets will be rendered unusable. all of the bullets will lose their gas check when pulling. They arent necessary for the powder coated bullets. To remove the stuck gas check from the case, remove your decapping pin from the sizer die and run the case through. the gas check will fall right out. There are 340 pieces of starline brass and 5 pieces of federal brass. I have 560 loads fired between all of these pieces of brass so most of them have two reloads.

Well, if you answered yes to both questions, this wonderful Cooper M21 Phoenix, LEFT HANDED ACTION, in .204 Ruger may be the rifle for you. The stock is synthetic, black in color with red “spider webs” covering the surface for cosmetic appeal and to provide a good gripping area. A Pachmayr basket weave, ¾ inch recoil pad finishes the butt, and two post sling swivel studs are placed along the bottom of the stock ~ 3 inches from foreend tip and ~3 inches from the tow. The single shot action is pure Cooper with a machined steel receiver, a solid bolt with three locking lugs forward, a Sako-style machined extractor, a machined plunger-style ejector, and a fully adjustable trigger. The action is bedded in the stock. The stainless steel Wilson barrel starts at ~ 1 inch diameter at the receiver and tapers over its special order 26 inch length to ~ 0.720 inch.

They'll fit all Government and Commander-sized 1911's. Price is $20 cash, or 100-rds rounds of 9mm ammo. A wood laminate has advantages over solid wood, since it is structurally stronger, won't warp,  and is resistant to moisture, oils and solvents. In person, they have a little more of a reddish-brown tint than the plain brown color seen in the photo (but still pretty close), but this color looks particularly nice against a darker finished pistol. I'm letting them go because I didn't think they worked on my stainless 1911, and I went back to some funky green/black G10 grips.If the ad is still up, then I still have them.Thanks for looking....."

Sidebar:  Vortex offers full warranty coverage for life of the optic regardless of ownership stream don't even need to show a receipt.  Can't say enough about the quality of the glass this was my first Vortex and I was not disappointed.  The low light conditions with this Vortex are significantly better than my Nikon, as good as Leupold, but not quite as good as Carl Zeiss to give a point of comparison.  The reticle width is significantly narrower than Nikon which makes a huge difference when shooting out further: wider reticle covers up more of the target which equals less accuracy.  It's not as thin as an EBR or MOA offering, but for a BDC reticle I much prefer it over the abnormally wide Nikon reticle thickness.  The parallax adjustment is a dream if you reach out to intermediate distances where distortion can creep in on hot days.  The sun shade was a really nice option on hot days as well that is a great too I wish I'd of invested in one long ago.  The green light was used for night hog hunting and I was comfortable taking shots out to ~100 yards.  Beyond that a positive ID became sketchy and I'd choose not to shoot, but close the distance first to 100 or less b/f taking a shot.  If there were no baby calves out there masquerading as big hogs I'd of felt comfortable taking a shot at 150.- Vortex Diamondback HP 4-16x42 - Second focal plane BDC reticle.  Box, manual, sun shade, bungee covers and soft cloth.  Full warranty applies to you just as it did for me for life.- Vortex Defender flip covers for both eye piece and objective with lifetime warranty.- Burris PEPR cantilever mount for 1"" tubes and objective lenses up to 44mm.  2 sets of ring tops a smooth(installed) and picatinny for mounting whatever you'd like(green light).  Also comes with a spare set of rail nuts.  - 2000 lumen green light with adjustable objective zoom and picatinny rail adapter.  This light takes both regular and rechargeable AAA's.Thanks"

I know it was for me.  I feel like I can scratch this off my bucket list and pass it on for someone else to have fun at a nice savings.  Gun does not have a scratch on it, optics are flawless, and everything is as it would be new out of the box.. there are no dissapointments or surprises on this, period.  Comes with all original accessorires, Carry case, boxes for the scope and BORS, etc.  I can throw in 3 boxes of .50BMG ammo ($100 value) also to the buyer.  Please, serious inquires only.  Not interested in any trades.  Price is very reasonalbe for what you get, if you went to buy a 20"" version with this Cerakote and skope/BORS, you'd be in at over $10K.  Price is $8400 FIRM FIRM..   That's over a $2K savings and about all I am willing to discount this.  You can get a 29"" cheaper than a 20"", you can get black cheaper, etc., but this is a premium gun and the way I see it you should get what you want or wait until you can.  No need to tell me what you can get for cheaper, I've shopped these and I already know this is a fair deal.  Thanks for looking and I hope to find a buyer that will appreciate this rifle!"
