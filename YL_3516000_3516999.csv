Selling because I bought this BCG for an upper, but was not aware that the upper would come with a BCG included. Keeping the one that came with the gun(is identical) because I have been told it's good to use a bolt/barrel that comes with a gun(don't know if it's true, but sounds safe enough).

VITAL COMPONENTS:

-carrier is regular specification/""M16"" profile, not cut back ""AR-15"" profile
- Gas key machined, not cast; hardened, chrome lined inside, phosphate outside, grade 8 fasteners, staked
-Bolt carrier chrome lined inside(smoother function, easier cleaning), phosphate coated outside(no possible worries about shine/gleam from open ejection port)
-Bolt is made of 158 Carpenter steel, shot peened, MP inspected, HP tested, phosphate coated
-Extractor made from tool steel, phosphate coated, has black/O-ring insert for increased tension

IMPERFECTIONS:

Has brass stains on bottom where the carrier rides over the mag(I shot 3 mags through it just to see if there was any difference, there wasn't), could not get them off with polymer bristle brush/CLP.

Has brass stains on bolt face(couldn't get them off, but the rest of the BCG is cleaned).

Has tiny, but noticeable dent on the front tip of the gas key. I was worried about it, but apparently it is too far away from the gas tube to touch it/mean anything.

$80 is firm/fair. $20 off for a BCG having 90 rounds through it, also no cost of shipping, or dealing with PSA's bad shipping times."

I am looking for a quality 1911 chambered in 9mm and that would be my first choice in trade.
Heres the specs:
For improved accuracy and precise shot placement during competition, the M&P C.O.R.E. pistols are standard with a Performance Center sear. The specialized sear allows for a crisp 4.5 pound trigger pull along with a faster, defined reset in between shots. On top of the slide, Smith & Wesson has added higher sights that can be used in concordance with the mounted optic. Other standard features of the new pistols include a crowned muzzle for improved accuracy, picatinny-style equipment rail and reversible magazine release.

Internal features of the new M&P C.O.R.E. remain consistent with the original design and include a stainless steel internal chassis designed to reduce flex while also providing a stable shooting platform. The M&P pistol’s low-bore axis helps maintain ease-of-use and a comfortable feel and the passive trigger safety prevents the pistol from firing if dropped regardless of angle. A sear release lever eliminates the need to press the trigger in order to disassemble and the simple take down lever is located on the left side of the frame. A loaded chamber indicator is present on top of the slide and rear scalloped slide serrations enable easy firearm manipulation."

It is very accurate because of improvements from the old models, such as heavy tapered barrel, lighter pull in the trigger, bedded stock. I got 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards with expensive ammo at the range. Not bad considering the older models get 3 to even 4 inches at 100 yards which is why Mini 14's are sometimes ridiculed by AR owners. With this rifle you can teach those AR owners a lesson.

This is the Sig Sauer Compact Nickel 1911, Model No. 1911CO-45-NI.  These are extremely hard to find. This was manufactured in late April 2014, and is in absolutely pristine cosmetic and flawless mechanical condition. These are not nickel plated, but is a nickel nitron finish that doesn't have the problems associated with nickel plating.  Pictures cannot do justice to this finish, which I can best describe as a satin nickel finish with a slight, light brown undertone (hence why Sig chose to equip them with VZ desert sand and black slant grips.  

It is currently wearing the Raasco cocobolo slim grips pictured, but as shown in the photos, it also has the original VZ Slants and screws.  I was going to remove the magwell (which requires replacing the mainspring housing) and put on the pictured,  new Sig (Hogue) double diamond blackwood grips and VZ aluminum black MSH, but then the deal  for another compact 1911 came through.  So, included with the gun is everything pictured (except for ammunition, which is NOT included):  

     -  Sig Sauer 1911 Compact Nickel, officer's sized grip, 4.2"" barrel, Siglight night sights, custom factory magwell, with original case and owner's manual
     -  Garrett Industries G6 superslim IWB holster with slim Comfort Pad Plus, for quick removal and reinsertion (this is thinner than either Kydex or leather, and so comfy you don't feel anything but the weight)
     -  Original VZ Slant factory grips, custom Raasco cocobolo slimline grips, and new, standard thickness Sig Sauer double diamond blackwood grips (made by Hogue)
     -  New VZ lightweight aluminum mainspring housing, in checkered black to match the existing hardware
     -  Four, 7 round Sig magazines (which all function flawlessly in the gun) (one is flush, but I have and will include the slam pad and screws)
     - EDIT:  An additional two, 7 round flush mags, new in sealed packages, for a total of SIX MAGAZINES INCLUDED!

I have fired about 400 rounds through this gun, with only a single FTF early in the break in, and I think I probably limp wristed that shot.  It has flawlessly cycled Federal HST and Hydra-Shok, Speer Gold Dots, Winchester 1911 HP's and Remington Golden Sabers, as well as Federal American Eagle FMJs without a single problem.  The gun presents like a brand new firearm.

I have rarely fired it but since I am considering selling or trading it, the least I could do was put new springs in it. The finish has very few handling marks and no holster wear because I never holstered it.

* Original Springfield Plastic Case and all 1911 Gear

** NOTE ** This is one of my favorites so only respectable offers will be considered.

Treated Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. The surface is harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. Our treated Nickel Boron finish bolt carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additionaul lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer.

Other info: Purchased from Tracy Rifle and Pistols about a year ago. California model with Bullet Button and pinned (non folding) stock from the factory to comply with CA DOJ requirements. (Solar Tactical sells a Kydex wrap if you wish to run this featureless w/o bullet button (not included)). I Put 3 boxes of factory ammo through it (WWB, Federal, and PMC) with no failures. Runs great and very accurate! This rifle wears the Troy sights which means it is a late model version with all the factory revisions. Absolutely nothing wrong with it

Mechanically: 10/10 - Clean after every range session and lube with Slip2000 as recommended by Kriss
Aesthetically: 9.5/10 - Has normal wear from brass bouncing off the ejection port. Only ever shot at the range so this thing never got banged around. Safe queen.

Selling because I just picked up the pistol model which is what I originally wanted.

Comes with everything you see pictured, (1) 10rd glock mag, Kriss CAA Vertical Forward Grip, Kriss Hard Case, Lock"

The SB-X barrel provides the versatility of a short barreled rifle (SBR) without the burden of red tape paperwork.  The SB-X barrel allows the addition of a suppressor without drastically increasing the overall length of your firearm.  

The barrel length of 12.25” would be considered an SBR if not for the shroud which brings the overall length to 16.5”.  This barrel avoids cumbersome paperwork and provides a shorter, light-weight solution for those who love shooting suppressed.  With the standard threaded end, attaching a suppressor is easier than tying your shoe.

PredatAR® 7.62 Overview The PredatAR® 7.62 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 7.62 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly-accurate OBR 7.62 “Heavy” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 7.62 rifle. The barrels are lightweight-profiled and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section. Comes with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger."

The reason for this is that I am on my last gun and don't want to leave my home unprotected. I would really like a PK 380, or maybe something similar.

This rifle comes from a pristine Bulgarian kit built by Mark Tucker of Coyote Gulch Armory (I think he retired), as the kit was never refinished but the American Receiver and barrel extension/fake suppressor were finished to match the kit. 

In fact there is very faint pencil writing with the serial number on top of the dust cover written in Eastern-Euro style.  I am assuming when the original AKS-74U was demilitarized it was to keep all the parts together.

Asking $1,800.00 which if you can find an original, pristine, all matching Bulgarian Krink kit for sale (they were going for $1,500.00 before they dried up) this is a deal.  

Also comes with three Russian Plum mags, paratrooper cover (green color), Russian desert tan sling and matching mag pouch (the desert color sling and pouch were made before the Soviet Union fell and while they were occupying Afghanistan).
