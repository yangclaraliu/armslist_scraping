In the last four years the HD7 Red Dot sight from LUCID has been battle proven and tested in the very capable hands of Law Enforcement and Military professionals. While we believe in the old adage, ""If it's not Broken, don't fix it."" It was time to make a set of customer requested improvements to the HD7 and introduce the Generation III Unit. These improvements include capped turrets, a new reticle set with more capabilities for the operator built in and the availability of a KillFlash Accessory.

As with the original version of the HD7 you don't have to compromise with the GEN III HD7. At LUCID we recognize that no two shooting situations are ever the same. We feel, your optic should be able to provide functional feature benefits to assist in most situations. The HD7 has been designed from the ground up to be a strong, reliable optic that offers the most in operator selectable features and benefits that exceed the market standards at a price that is friendly to the wallet.

Some information on the LC smith collectors association site 
More SBT guns (1,470) were built in Specialty Grade than any other; one gun in this grade was finished by the L.C. Smith Gun Company in 1948 after Hunter Arms production stopped at 1,469 in 1940. The Specialty was a mid-grade gun selling for $133 in 1927 allowing many options from which to choose: different stock dimensions of full, half or straight grip and 30, 32 and 34 inch barrels of Nitro Steel. Standard features include two Lyman ivory sights, ejector, ventilated rib, beavertail forearm and recoil pad. Engraving patterns usually consist of a sitting dog on the left of the frame and a sitting bird on the right, both surrounded by foliage and moderate scroll. Some early guns such as shown here have a standing dog on each side.   Most Specialtys have a silver inlay at the junction of the ventilated and solid portion of the rib near the breech end but specimens have been noted with gold and no inlays. The rib inlays only appear on Specialty’s and higher grades and are mostly found in gold on the higher grades. Barrels are usually roll stamped “L.C. SMITH SPECIALTY TRAP” on the left side."

Only issue I have EVER had with this pistol is with the sights, the shields are notorious for this issue. The white epoxy sight dot will fall out. Rather than take advantage of the awesome S&W lifetime warranty, a simple dap of the wife's orange nail polish took care of the issue for me. However, it can be fixed for FREE if you simply send it back to S&W or simply replace the sights with aftermarket.

It is an original Flintlock converted to Dual Percussion Hammers!

It is 44 inches long x 7 3/8 inches wide - Circa 1800.

A rare and impressive whaling gun from the earliest period of firearm innovation in the fishing industry, this English Whaling Harpoon Gun is a stout and serious instrument that revolutionized whaling. Made by George Wallis of Hull, he is recognized as the first successful maker of the swivel-mounted harpoon gun, circa 1800. The author William Scoresby indicates this period to have been 1772-1792, while other later sources credit the invention to 1800-1815.

When originally made, this Wallis gun had two flintlock hammers that worked off a single trigger, and have long ago been converted to two dual-percussion cap hammers, that would have lanyard triggers threaded out the locks to be fired simultaneously, ensuring the firing of the harpoon. With a full charge, it had an accurate range up to 40 yards. The name Wallis of Hull is on the iron barrel, amongst the heavy aged pitting, deep rust and signs of use under an old remnant of black oil paint. The left brass hammer compartment is marked “SHIP”.

Owning a deadly presence, the gun barrel is a stout 30½ inches in length with a 2½ inch diameter with a 1¾ inch bore, while the overall harpoon gun is 43¼ inches, plus the split-shaft barbed harpoon with ring for line attachment. The English Society of the Arts had paid premiums to whale men and artisans in the 1790s and early 1800s for those showing innovation and improvement in the use of the guns and harpoons. When William Greener substantially changed the design and powder of this type of harpoon gun in 1837, the new styles became known as Greener guns. This older gun was kept in use during this period, as indicated by its conversion."

Crescent was a major arms producer for hardware stores, sporting goods retailers, and five and dimes across the country between 1892 to about 1930 when it was sold to a subsidiary of the Savage Arms Company which continued to make shotguns with the Crescent name until 1940. All Crescent records were lost or destroyed during a scrap paper drive in 1943 so my best estimate in this was from the later years, before the buyout. There have literally been books that include the history of Crescent Arms.

This particular shotgun was found in my basement ceiling after having lived here for over a decade. It is at least 80 years old and shows its age well. It had some pitting and had rust when found, which I carefully removed without disturbing the patina. I am not a gunsmith and cannot say with certainty that it is safe to fire but it seems to be functional. I also has a Lyman choke on it.

92 Compact with Rail (Stainless and Black Bruniton)92 (M9A1) Compact With Rail Inox: Sleek Tactical Perfection

The M9A1 is an evolution of the legendary Beretta M9 military semiauto pistol, developed with the advice of several law-enforcement and military agencies around the world. The M9A1 Compact With Rail Inox is a smaller and lighter variation that features an attractive and super-resistant stainless-steel (Inox) finish. Its many tactical features, ruggedness and absolute reliability make it a great choice for on- or off-duty carry, as well as personal defense or concealed carry.


Compact and Super-Resistant

Compared to its full-size counterpart, the M9A1 Compact Inox is a full ¾” shorter and 2.3 oz. lighter, making it even more comfortable for all-day carry. Also, its shorter trigger-reach will make it simple to shoot even by users with smaller hands--and even for that first double-action pull. While in the holster, its super-resistant stainless-steel finish makes it stand up to sweat even on scorching summer days, while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning.


Full of Tactical Features

This handgun offers a great number of useful tactical features, without compromising on its military-style sturdiness and toughness. The magazine well is beveled, for lightning-quick tactical mag-changes without taking your eyes off the target. The combat trigger guard facilitates the use of the handgun while wearing gloves, as well as an ideal and secure placement of the off-hand; also, the front and backstrap are checkered to ensure a positive and consistent grip. Lastly, an integral Picatinny rail enables the easy mounting of tactical accessories such as lighting and sighting systems--without any gunsmithing or modification to the pistol.


Reliable and Easy to Shoot

Engineered to withstand the hardest use in the most demanding conditions around the world, the M9A1 meets and exceeds the standards of reliability of professional military and law enforcement. This handgun will reliably feed most commercial ammunition designs, including the wider hollow-points and the hardest-hitting +P. An attractive, perfectly-engineered pistol for most uses including competition. Also available in standard, Bruniton finish."

The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK216 Rifle is perfect for those wanting to suppress their MK2 rifle. The MK216 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 800 meters with varying types of ammunition.

The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 inch handguard and free-floated barrel.  The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.  Upper and lower receivers have been carefully designed to offer the perfect balance of weight and strength. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, stock, and 45 off set sights."

It is in great condition, very clean and perfect mechanically. 

Interestingly it has a unique vent rib barrel rather than a solid rib, similar to the Python.  The muzzle end of the barrel is also countersunk, this may be a gunsmith job or custom from Colt.  Real collectors would love to get their hands on a custom Colt from the factory, but there is perhaps a chance that this could be aftermarket.  The only way to know all the details about this specific gun is to have it ""lettered"" by Colt, which takes 100 days and $75.  I have a blue plastic Colt box that it fits in (might be original to the gun), the correct original black colt rubber grips (the slot in grip screw is a bit torqued by some dummy), a set of nice goncalo alves fancy wood grips. 

I'm going to value the revolver at maybe $1500.00 and see what kind of response I get.  I've been offered $1200.  If I can't get a bit closer to asking price, I am going to send for the Colt letter from the factory, so it will be off the market for a while.  I am open to trade ideas and partial trades.

The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK216 Rifle is perfect for those wanting to suppress their MK2 rifle. The MK216 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 800 meters with varying types of ammunition.

 Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK216 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 inch handguard and free-floated barrel.  The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.  Upper and lower receivers have been carefully designed to offer the perfect balance of weight and strength. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, stock, and 45 off set sights."

This rifle has a really pretty wood stock, but has a few scratches and dents from an elk hunt in North Dakota. It has a fantastic factory trigger that breaks crisply at 3.5lbs; probably the best factory R700 trigger I've felt. It's a fairly rare ""DM"" model, which denotes that it feeds from a detachable box magazines and 2 are included in the sale. It has a Limbsaver recoil pad installed which allows you to shoot it all day without a sore shoulder. It also comes with 2pc scope mounts, 1"" rings, and a box of Remington Core Lokt ammo.

The only reason I'm selling it is because it has sat in the safe for well over a year without being touched. I hate to have a gun sitting around that doesn't get used and I've got another project on my mind.

This would make a great hunting gun for someone who likes magnum caliber rifles.

2 pcs - NEW, OEM Glock Magazine Gen 4 Glock 17, 34 9mm Luger Polymer Black (17 rounds)

$40 FIRM

Product Information:
This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

Technical Information:
Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity. 

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load. 

NOTE: All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols."

I've shot less than 2 magazines out of it. I can be confident with this because the only time I took it to the range, I only brought 2 loaded magazines.
Other then that, it's been sitting in my gun cabinet well oiled but unloved.

Breakdown of what I bought:

Rifle was $700 brand new from PSA
Carry handle was $20
Ammo was a bit over $100
Hard case was $30
Magazines were $100 for 6

For a grand total of approximately $950 I've spent retail. So stop bugging me about the 'price being too high waaahhh i can buy shitty mags and cheap ammo for cheap'

If you want JUST THE RIFLE I'll sell it for $650 cash. That's cheap guys, you know that. Good luck finding a reasonably priced AR-15 locally, trust me. I've tried.

I put a carry handle sight on it, and that's about it.
I have 6 Pmags, 4 still sealed in the bags unused.
Comes with a hard case and a bunch of brass .223 and 5.56 factory ammo. About 300 rounds or so?
I'd rather sell for cash, but I'll take trades

I'd also consider silver/gold coins, bullion, scrap gold and silver jewelery, antiques, or putting this as partial trade to a decent car.
