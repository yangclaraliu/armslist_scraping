It is in very good condition. The wood has a nice original yet antiqued finish to it. There is a few small indents in the wood near the lever but not bad. The lever doeant have much blieing left and blueing on the barrel is good with a few blemishes. The receiver has a combination blue/brown finish with wear to the finish near the edges. The gun functions flawlessly and the bore is in good condition. The rifling is clear and the edges are good, with minor blemish in the grooves but overall quite impressive for a gun that I understand was loaded with black powder shells at the time. It is NOT ONLY a first year gun, but this is a model 1894 MADE in 1894. I would guess the few surviving relics from this era are in museums by now. It was part of an estate and I am much more of a shooter than a collector so I'm selling it. I cant imagine a piece like this doing anything but appreciate substantially but I cant justify keeping it right now and will listen to offers from Serious buyers. Leave your contact information and I will contact you. I have an A+ rating on GB. A Cody letter verifies the information and dates. Images available on request. NO Trades."

Started to straighten the beavertail, edges need smoothing before refinishing.
