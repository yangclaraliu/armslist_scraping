Just bought this truck and a few others and did needed repairs. This Dakota has a new rearend, tie rods, tranny filter and fluid along with a full service checkup and new oil and filter a week ago. Very strong engine and tranny. Only thing wrong is the rear CO2 sensor needs to be replaced or possibly moved up some as it sits on the split and not the single pipe. Has newer dual exhaust in great condition with the bad sensor, sometimes causes engine light to come on but does not effect anything. Complete error code check was done engine light is for sure CO2 sensor and nothing else. Runs great, acceptable loud mean exhaust sound, shifts great now with new rearend. Also needs alignment something I cannot do. Cooper tires in great condition. Only real rust is at passenger door bottom front and rear less than 150 worth of body work if picky. Typical rear bumper corrosion at plate otherwise bumpers are great condition. Come with heavy duty grille guard. Great heat and a/c. Interior is near mint with new detail done a few days ago. Comes with four floormats, full manual and two sets of keys with remotes. Power windows/locks/seat.

I do not need to sell so 3500 cash price is firm I will not go any lower as book with miles is 3200+ and I did about 1000 in labor and parts. Plus take a look at what's available in mid 90s to 2003-4, high miles! The 5.2 will go 250k+ easy if not 350k. Great all season truck but definitely a great winter auto. 4x4 on the floor engages easily, properly and works great.

Overall a great truck for being 15 years old and you won't find any with this low of mileage.

Clean title will go down to DMV with you if you want for title change at time of purchase, cost is $40 being truck is 10 years or older. Plates/tabs good until August of 2015.

No credit card fees and shipping to your local FFL is FREE!  Price does not include the NFA tax stamp or local sales tax.  Also, with the purchase of this suppressor, we can assist you in creating a basic living trust!  A living trust will speed up the transfer process.  Let us know if you have questions.  With its construction of ultra high performance and tough Stainless Steel, the Spectre II allows weapon fire to go virtually unnoticed. It is not only super tough, but also one of the quietest .22 suppressors known to man. With the Spectre II, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility. The Spectre II has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 LR silencer. Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 LR silencers on the market. The Spectre II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily.

Look no further!  This is a Remington 700 SPS Tactical with a tactical scope rail and Wyatt's Detachable Magazine System.  The Wyatt system allows the rifle to accept single stack Wyatt magazines in either 5 or 10 round capacity.  This sale also includes two 5 round magazine.  

It is important to note that the R700 SPS-T is not available with detachable magazines from the factory so this $250 kit from Wyatt allows you to not have to worry about the bothersome floorplate setup from the factory.  Wyatt magazines are also single stack to ensure perfectly reliable feeding.  The original trigger guard and floorplate/spring are also included just so you have a complete set of parts for the factory rifle.  

All other original contents are included along with a Weaver tactical picatinny rail system that allows the rifle to accept virtually any 1 or 2 piece ring setups you want.  I have some nice quality Weaver 30mm rings and a Caldwell Harris-style bipod I will throw in if you need them.  All in all this is a killer rifle that is amazingly accurate and fun to shoot for a killer price.  The unofficial Remington 700 motto ""700 yards for $700"" still applies, you just get the reliable and convenient (and expensive) Wyatt system for nothing!  And for the record this rifle will get you out past 800 yards easily and even further with the right ammo and skills.

Text or call REDACTED with questions or offers.  Cash only.  Requires an Oregon driver's license to purchase.  Will sell to Washington residents but you will need to both set up and pay for an FFL transfer in Portland, OR or Vancouver, WA.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

I have a Remington 7400 Semi-Auto 30-06 in a black synthetic stock for sale. The rifle itself comes with a Leupold scope base and I believe Leupold rings, but I am unsure about the rings.. I know the base is Leupold. Also, it comes with a Bausch and Lomb Elite 3000 1.5-6x scope. There is not much to this rifle.. I inherited it a while back and have no use for it. My buddy used it last year when we went hunting and he dropped a doe at 120 yards. It is a great starters set up or even for people who have been hunting for a while. I have a little nicer rifle to hunt with and I would rather take the cash. There is of course your typical wear and tear. Nothing that is major, just some minor surface scuffs on the stock.
This is a private sale and the rifle is not registered, so therefore we won't need a bill of sale.
I would just like to take a look at a valid MN ID if your younger just so I know I'm selling this rifle to an adult.
$350.00 is firm. No trades please just cash.

Stainless steel threaded bull barrel, full length quad rail, and ported flash hider / door breach (intimidation x 1000). Barrel and quad rail are made by CMMG, receiver is made by Cerro Forge. Forward assist and dust cover.

I also have about 200 rounds of hunting ammo (Hornady VMAX and Sierra Soft Point) Could be + / - a few rounds. Market price is $1-2 / round for non-FMJ, so this is easily $200 worth of ammo.

I bought this upper with full intentions of hunting with it and getting a silencer, but never started the paperwork. 300 Blackout is a 30 cal bullet loaded into a 223 case, so it has plenty of knock down power for hunting deer or hogs, but you can still use your same magazines you have for a 223/556 AR.

If you are looking to get a silencer, the guy that built this for me said that when suppressed and using sub sonic ammo, this set up will sound like an air rifle... loudest part being the bolt closing. He said you can actually hear the slug hit the target when shooting at 100 yards +. 

Will ship on your dime. Looking for $450 (which is less than I have in just the upper) and I will include the ammo. Schmidt and Bender scope in the picture not for sale!"

532,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3599532,For Sale:  Ti-RANT .45™ Pistol Suppressor,"Howell, Michigan, United States",$ 850,"Listed On: Thursday, February 19, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE>Ti-RANT .45™ Pistol Suppressor

The Ti-RANT .45 is the world’s first silencer for .45 ACP pistols that is truly stealthy when fired dry. The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a Heckler and Koch USP Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package. 

The Ti-RANT .45 incorporates AAC’s new A.S.A.P.™ CLUTCH. This highly evolved Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols, and can be fully disassembled for cleaning or piston replacement with no tools in seconds. The Ti-RANT .45 can be outfitted with pistons threaded M16 x 1 Right Hand, M16 x 1 Left Hand, and two pistons threaded .578-28; one extended for the Sig P-220 and 1911’s with a full length guide rod, and a flush mount for 1911’s with a standard G.I. guide rod. For multi-caliber use, pistons are available in the most common 9mm and .40 thread patterns to allow use of the Ti-RANT 45 on hosts in those calibers.

This gun has a low round count (approx. 500) and is in very good condition.  Selling because I have 2 that are identical.

Below is a list of modifications.

1. Zev Technologies Fully Adjustable Fulcrum Trigger
The Zev Tech Fulcrum is the finest trigger available for the Glock. The CNC Billet Aluminum trigger pad has an ergonomic shape with a wide flat face that is ideal for shooting with the pad of your trigger finger as opposed to the rounded face of the factory trigger. The trigger safety of the Fulcrum is 3x wider and more flush when depressed. The trigger safety also features a real spring as opposed to the thin plastic nubbin of the factory safety for greater heat and chemical resistance. The Fulcrum trigger features adjustment screws for PRE and OVER travel. Range of trigger movement can be shortened to ¼” overall, with all factory safeties intact. Trigger reset has been shortened by half so that pistol can fire mechanically faster. The trigger bar is high polished and precision ground to help eliminate trigger creep and allow the trigger to stack up and break consistently.

2. 3.5# Striker Spring for a lighter trigger pull.

3. Glock Extended Slide Release Lever
- Gives the operator more torque for easier slide release.

4. Frame has been modded by Damon Young at SSVi, modifications include:
- Magazine Release Bevel
- Finger groove removal
- Double under cut on trigger guard
- Stippled texture on grip, under trigger guard, and frame flats

Gun will come with factory trigger, factory slide release, factory springs, 2 magazines, Glock case, and everything that was included with the Zev trigger (papers, adjustment wrenches, etc).

  The P.38 was the universal sidearm of the German army in WWII.  After the war the proven 9mm design went back into production by Walther , virtually identical to the WWII model except for the frame being made of alloy.  In it's new incarnation the P.38 was carried by the military and police of virtually all the Eastern Bloc countries.  Thus , this P.38 9mm pistol is a piece of Cold War history.  This particular piece was built by Walther in 1962 , and I could detect virtually no evidence of use when I acquired it.  I have put approx 200 rounds thru it.  The holster is period correct and holds a spare magazine. My asking price of $475 is very reasonable given how clean and tight this pistol is."

Excellent bore, rifle is in very good condition, there are some cuts on the side of the ejection where the rounds have clipped the stock, they are cosmetic only. Previous owner painted the stock a custom camo color, I cant tell if its duracoat but its on there well and can be removed by sand blasting or using a paint stripper.(Green stock underneath).

Scope is crystal clear and works well.
I impulse purchased this one a year ago at a price I could not refuse. However I have 2 now so this one needs to go.

$1000, comes with 1 40rd magazine.

Everything works perfectly, there are a few scratches on the top of the receiver as I kept this shotty in my truck for a few years. If you're looking, you know, this shotgun isn't made for looks, it's made to function flawlessly in all conditions.  

Shotgun will hold 8+1 and the speed feed stock will hold another 4 rounds, giving you access to 13 rounds of 12-gauge should you need it.  I typically kept 2 slugs / 2 bird shot in the speed feed and 00Buck in the tube when traveling so all bases were covered.  Ghost ring sights make target acquisition a breeze.  A new one in this configuration with the speed feed and ghost ring sights installed will run about $600-650 plus tax.  Here's your opportunity to save some money buying used.  No trades will be considered.

Only selling because I got another new truck shotty and no longer need this one, however, I also don't need to sell so save the lowball offers for someone else.  I'm offering a great gun at a fair price."

This is a quality build that will come with a Pelican 1750 rifle case and four 10-round Lancer L5 Advanced Warfighter Magazines. I have put 400 rounds through it and it has been 100% reliable with Federal 5.56 and various PMC and Hornady 5.56/.223 (have not tried anything else). I have shot sub-MOA at 100 yards with 55 grain FMJBT .223 and can ring an 8"" steel at 300 yards every time with the Nikon BDC scope. This setup is much better than I am.

List of components is below. With case and magazines I have just over $2,500 into it at non-panic pricing and I am looking for $1900 cash, though I would be willing to let it go without the case and mags for $1700 cash, or $1300 without case, mags, scope and mount. I would also be willing to split off the upper for cash offers only.

I will want to see an NC issued pistol purchase permit or CCH permit, otherwise we will need to do a transfer at my FFL so that I can verify you can legally purchase a firearm. I will not keep your purchase permit, I just want to see one with an ID. I do have a valid NC CCH permit for trades.
