Happy Independence Day!I bought these on a whim awhile back when browsing Cabela's. I really wish they had these around when I was younger! lolThe first is the KWC Umarex ""Legends"" M712 (Mauser ""Broomhandle"" clone). The feel of this pistol is surprising very much like the original. It features all metal construction with plastic grips (the grips look very realistic). But the best part is just how insane this thing is! I can't describe the full auto action as well as the following video, so I will let actions speak louder than words :)http://www.pyramydair.com/s/m/Legends_M712_Full_Auto_CO2_BB_Pistol_Full_Metal/3487It will come with extra magazine (trust me, you need this. Once you start shooting, things go fast :) )I will take $75.00 for the pistol, extra magazine and bottle of BBs.The 2nd one is the Umarex Steel Storm. This pistol uses 2 CO cartridges simultaneously and features semi-auto/6-shot burst selection. It is surprisingly accurate. I added an extra forward grip and red dot/laser pointer I had laying around. I will take $75.00 for this one also (BBs go with the M712 though).Here is a video/review someone else had done in the past:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyFgooVMeV4Both of these pistols have seen very little use. Both are like new and in perfect working condition. Must be 18 to buy.Thanks!"

I've displayed it off and on over the years but it's now time to see if I can find a new home for it. As you can see in the photos this rifle in in excellent condition. Right after the war the Italians did arsenal refurbishments to some of these rifles that were already in good mechanical condition then exported them, and this is one of those. It's the M41 rifle which was the workhorse of the Italian Military during WWII. The numbers match and the finishes on both the metal and the wood are great. Everything works as it should and this rifle is chambered for the 6.5x52 Carcano round some of which is included with the sale. Barrel/receiver is stamped FAT 42 and the bore is bright and shiny without pitting or corrosion. Rifle comes with an original WWII era leather sling in great shape, original oiler and screwdriver tool in good condition, a high quality but older reproduction bayonet that works perfectly and 14 rounds of Hornady Custom ammo plus an original box of 1942 ammo that contains 18 rounds. Finally there are 3 blued steel 6 round Carcano clips and one made of brass. This rifle is one for the real collector out there and I doubt you'll ever find another one any nicer. I'm putting it out there to see if there is any local interest and it won't be the end of the world if it doesn't sell. I'm not set up to ship firearms so I won't do it. Therefore it's pickup deal only in the Brandon area by a Florida resident who,is 18 or older. Price for the rifle and all the accessories is $600. I can only post 3 pictures but have more that I can send to a serious buyer.  Thanks for looking."

If you're not familiar with them these are like the 'sticky' holsters. I have bought many of them over the last few years as I changed guns and tried out different carry styles. If you know anything about Remora you know that there are several options (reinforced top, artemis cut, sweatshield, full sweatshield) so I bought a lot of these looking for the perfect setup. I now have what works for me so I've got a lot of holsters that aren't being used (I don't even own a gun that fits some of these). I'm cleaning up my gun closet and figured that I should let the ones that don't get used go to a better home. Since I have a few of them I'll list them all out below and start marking them off as they're sold. Almost all of these are still in the original bags and none of them have been used for carry except for 2 that I call out in the list below. I'm selling them for $5 for the basic holster or $10 for the ones with options. Go to remoraholsterstore.com to get info on what sizes fit which guns. I have some single magazine holsters that I'll throw in with them while supplies last. If you want an up close photo of the one that you're interested in let me know and I'll snap one with my phone and email it to you. I maintain my listings, so all 'are these still available' emails will be ignored.
