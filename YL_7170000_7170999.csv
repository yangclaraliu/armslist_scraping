My grandpa bought it for my grandma as a birthday present after she said she wanted to try shooting. He had no interest in guns and hers faded before she got a chance to fire it. It was in a gun sock in their closet for years and years until she gave it to me in 2005.  I have no need for it myself and would like it to go home a home where it will be used.Picture is pulled from google. If anyone is really interested I'll pull it out of storage and snap a few pics.

Better than my Anschutz, Hammerli and walther rifles! This is very rare find. Finding a genuine US property marked Winchester 52C in good shape is hard enough, but this is a GENUINE BULL BARREL GUN. Why do I emphasize that? Because, an actual factory bull is very rare and very low numbers. Most people who think they have a BULL, actually have a ""Heavy Barrel"" model. They are often mislabeled because people see a thick barrel and think Bull. Not the case. The winchester 52C actually came in 4 barrel profiles. The Sporter, Heavy sporter, Heavy Barrel and Bull Barrel. The latter is very seldom seen and labeled correctly! Most of them on gunbroker called ""Bull Barrels"" are actually Heavy barrel models. So this is the real thing. How do you prove you have the real thing? Simple. Put a caliper on the receiver and the barrel. If it reads 1.35"" on the receiver and 1.125 on the barrel where it meets the receiver it's the real thing. The Heavy Barrel models only read .92"" at the receiver. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! I have only seen two other models sell in the last ten years that were all original and correct. One at the Rock Island Auction sold for $3700 and one on Gunbroker sold for $2900. I am asking FAR LESS!The other great thing about my model is it's condition. Many consumer models can be found still in great cosmetic condition, but the US property models, usually sold off later through the CMP program are usually beat to death as they were army trainer and competition guns typically. This one is in great shape!  Sure there are scratches and small nicks, but nothing major. No cracks in the wood. All original everything and un-messed with. Original gorgeous walnut stock, buttplate, FACTORY INSTALLED Redfield Olympic sights and factory single shot adapter. This can be removed to use a magazine although I don't have a mag for it. In it's current configuration, single shot is the correct setup for it anyhow. The action is smooth as glass and the trigger will remind you of your best tuned 1911 trigger! Amazingly nice. Very, very, very accurate. Has the correct Electropenciled US Property marking on the side of the receiver and the cartouche stamping on the bottom of the pistol grip of the stock. Will come in a standard soft case. I am asking at least $1000 less than it's worth and at least $700 less than the exact same guns have (seldom) sold for!$2200 or best offerHighly motivated to sell. Need money to get a tax dept paid. TEXT OR CALL FOR MORE PICTURES. I HAVE 12 MORE HIGH RESOLUTION PICS. Would take a threaded 1911 as a partial trade or a genuine Gibson Les paul. No other trades considered.Thanks for looking!Do not email me please. Text or call only. I am very quick to reply.No calls or texts after 10PM Please(757)270-6919"

You know, the good looking gun that's fun to accessories with a little ""bling?"" Hehehe!I bought the flashy polished stainless/aluminim alloy finish, and I ordered some pearloid white grips. The problem is the pearl grips require special screws, and I just don't have time to look for them online or in local stores (new child born last week). Included with the packaged deal hear are new four stainless Hogue ""skinny"" screws, four new Taurus ""fat"" screws, and of course the original rubber grips mounted on the gun which contain three original Taurus ""fat"" screws and one ""skinny"" screw that's screwed into a bushing or adapter to make it ""fat"" to retain a screw. This is simply the design from the factory at Taurus. If you email me for more details, I'm sorry, but I simply won't have time to help you get the grips to work. You'll need to find adapters or bushings to make all four of the stainless ""skinny"" screws fat, or you'll need to remove the bushing currently on one of the blued screws, but it's on really tight.The gun is brand new, and I've never fired it. Make me a cash offer, or propose a trade. Thanks!UPDATE: If you're thinking about emailing me to propose a purchase without a background check, just stop. It's a crime. A Class ""A"" misdemeanor. I'm not going to risk my neck because you have a criminal history. I'm a proud and lawful gun owner, a life member of the NRA, and I'm not going to sell a deadly weapon to someone who beat their wife years ago or got pinched for a felony. Dig? You want to buy a handgun from me, we're going to do the $10 background check at a local FFL. If you've got a problem with that, don't email me."

The original factory engraving on the left side panel of the receiver of the number 44 over the name ATLANTA POLICE is sharp and defined. This rifle is chambered in 44-40 W.C.F. and has the barrel marking of 44 W.C.F., along with the marking of KINGS PATENTED IMPROVEMENT. The brass elevator block is engraved with,  44Cal. It has a 24 inch octagon barrel which is shiny bright inside, and a full length tubular magazine. It retains it's original factory dustcover, factory installed sling swivels, and adjustable buckhorn sight. The wood in in excellent condition as is the metal retaining 95+% bluing which has aged to a nice brownish patina. The factory dustcover is tight and works like new. The buttstock is curved steel and contains the original factory cleaning rod kit. The entire unit shows very little wear or usage and is in good firing condition. This rifle has not been refinished or altered from it's original factory configuration. It is serial numbered,  289574B. I do not have a letter of certification from The Cody Museum. Do a bit of your homework in regards to the order that was placed for this rifle, and the other 124 units, and you will find that this particular rifle number 44, whereas the ordered rifle number matches the caliber thereby making it one of a kind, in this condition is a rare find. Due to this rifles cartridge capacity, ease of reloading, potent caliber, and rate of fire, this was considered to be one of the first shoulder held, center fire, rapid fire firearms, that could be used for the express purpose of ""Crowd Control""! This is a one hundred-twenty-nine year old beauty! COWBOY SHOOTERS WILL LOVE THIS PIECE, especially if it were to be matched up with a Colt Peacemaker chambered in 44-40 (Pistol Not Included with sale of rifle).I also have two full boxes of ammunition for this rifle both being Genuine Winchester WESTERN X paper cartons which are in excellent condition, in addition to the case the rifle is in, that will be included with the sale. This unit has been unfired and in it's case, other than for periodic oiling of the metal, for the past sixty or more years. It is very well preserved and looking for a new home. THIS WILL BE, a person to person, CASH IN HAND, with witnesses, sale ONLY!  No other method will be considered. This is a one of a kind historical item that may never come on the market again. And it will never wear out or lose it's value but only become more valuable with age and time. SEE TRADE UPDATE BELOW!Additional pictures upon request. If you have ever wondered as to #44's whereabouts then wonder no more once you have bought it, taken it home, and secured it in your safe. And the sooner the better, I fight the temptation to take it out and shoot it, which I have never done. This gun is crying to be fired yet I do not want to shoot it even one time. I may never be able to sell it after falling in love with it. I look at this gun like I look at Heroin, one shot and I would be hooked! I have received several offers of trade along with lesser amounts of cash but I am firm on my price of $16,460.00 CASH.Please, SERIOUS COLLECTORS ONLY need respond. Thank You,  for your consideration. UPDATE, I Will consider taking a motorhome in trade, model year 2008 or newer, 21 or 26 foot length range.  NO FORDS WILL BE CONSIDERED! CHEVY OR DODGE DRIVETRAINS ONLY! Unit must be clean and under 60K Miles. Prefer one owner unit. NO DEISELs, NO FOREIGN MAKES!"
