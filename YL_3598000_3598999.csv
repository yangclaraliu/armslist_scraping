I am looking to sell my CM9 due to it being for my wife and her having a hard time with the recoil and going back to her P238. My CM9 will come with everything it did new along with a Crossbreed Horse Hide SuperTuck Deluxe IWB Tuckable Holster ($79.99) / Don Hume J.I.T.

If you haven't looked at the CM9 / PM9 and you’re looking for a slim concealed carry option with a great trigger and reliability this may be your ticket. The CM9 is as close to a quality pocket 9mm as you're going to find being smaller than the Shield / XDS / PPS. The CM9 is rated for +P loads as well. I am looking for something else at this time and below are a few things I would be interested in. No black powder / archery / shotguns or antique firearms please.

It is chambered in 300 win mag and I have replaced the standard trigger with a rifle basix trigger set at a VERY crisp 2.5 pounds. It also has a badger ordinance single piece steel picatinny rail mounted on top with a 20 moa slope to it to aid in long range shooting. It sits on and comes with a fully adjustable folding bipod (I am unsure of the brand). This rifle has only had 80 rounds sent through it, all of them being on a bench, never hunting. This has mated the action to the stock quite nicely. This along with proper barrel brake in gave me several groups around 0.5 moa with factory ammunition. I'm sure at that point its me and not the rifle holding back the group size. Ive included the Remington online description for any details I may have left out. I will pay for standard ground shipping. OVERVIEW: Built on the famous Model 700™ cylindrical action, Remington Sendero rifles are the most accurate rifles we produce for over-the-counter sale. You’ll be stunned by the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won’t be so lucky. Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website The Model 700 Sendero SF II are finely tuned tack-drivers created using input from serious shooters across America. The stock is reinforced with aramid fibers and features contoured beavertail fore-end with ambidextrous finger grooves and palm swell. Twin front swivel studs accommodate a sling and a bipod. Full-length aluminum bedding blocks create accuracy-enhancing platforms for the barreled actions. The 26"" heavy-contour barrels are fluted for rapid cooling. KEY FEATURES: 26"" heavy contour barrel (0.820"" Muzzle O.D.) for the ultimate in long-range accuracy. Concave target-style barrel crown. Composite stock with beavertail fore-end. Chambered for popular Magnum and Remington Ultra Magnum cartridges. Black stock with grey webbing."

It has the ""M"" designation in the first digit of it's serial number. It is chambered in 30-30 . It cycles as smooth as butter and feeds and ejects very reliable. It has a set of Williams ""peep sights"" installed on it. It holds 6 cartridges and has a 20 inch barrel. It is the older original style that has no safety (pre-safety) . The bore/barrel is nice and shiny . I tried to take a pic of it but it's hard to get the camera in there on a lever-action rifle. This has the ""half-cock"" safety without the cross-bolt manual safety that the newer ones have.  I am including two boxes of premium 30-30 rounds , 40 rds in all. This is an amazing rifle for a 59 year old rifle. I just don't use it since I mainly use a muzzleloader. I am asking $339 FIRM for this Marlin and the ammo. I am in Clarksville but I can drive to meet a buyer a reasonable distance from here like the Nashville area or so . Thanks for looking

An illuminated red and green mil-dot reticle greatly enhances targeting in low-light situations with 5 levels of brightness. Also includes protective scope cap and a set of rings.

To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil. Every gun is hand fitted and assembled. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum and real carbon fiber grips.  These guns are the most sought after pocket pistols in the industry. This gun has had less than 100 rounds put through it with no malfunctions. It is incredibly accurate! The package comes with 1-Case, 1-Lock, 2- Six Round Magazines, 1- Extra Recoil Spring, 1- Set of Manuals, 1 – Takedown Tool, 1 – Desantis Pocket Holster."

First gun is a Henry lever action with octagon barrel chambered in .17 HMR. Very rare and chances are you haven't seen one before and won't in a while. shoots very straight and is in immaculate condition. Asking $400

Next is a Uberti No. 3 Schofield chambered in .45 Colt. Has the highly sought after trigger guard with the finger rest. Has original box and all papers with it. Fired exactly 50 rounds through it. Pretty much impossible to find this exact model but it just sits in the safe so it has to go. Asking $850

Next is a gun that my wife just HAD to have. It is a pink Ruger lc9. Sat in her night stand for the past year and she shot exactly one magazine through it. Looks brand new. asking $250

Next is a Colt WW1 commemorative edition 1911. Comes in a fancy box with 2 mags in wax paper and all paperwork. It is extremely clean with no scratches or marks anywhere. Looks brand new. Has the roll marks on the side to designate the commemorative edition. Asking $950

And Finally, I have an Armalite AR-180B which was one of the first AR's marketed to civilians. It is a piston operated system and has significantly less recoil and is so easy to clean. It is in PERFECT condition with no scratches or nicks anywhere. Extremely lightweight and very accurate. Barrel is in amazing condition and is bright and shiny. Takes standard AR mags and will shoot 5.56 or 223. Pretty rare and won't find one in this condition. Asking $1,000

All of them are for sale or trade. The only trades I'm looking for at the moment are a 12-13 inch piston driven upper and a Savage 10p-sr in 308. All prices are ""OR BEST OFFER"". 

First gun is a Henry lever action with octagon barrel chambered in .17 HMR. Very rare and chances are you haven't seen one before and won't in a while. shoots very straight and is in immaculate condition. Asking $400

Next is a Uberti No. 3 Schofield chambered in .45 Colt. Has the highly sought after trigger guard with the finger rest. Has original box and all papers with it. Fired exactly 50 rounds through it. Pretty much impossible to find this exact model but it just sits in the safe so it has to go. Asking $850

Next is a gun that my wife just HAD to have. It is a pink Ruger lc9. Sat in her night stand for the past year and she shot exactly one magazine through it. Looks brand new. asking $250

Next is a Colt WW1 commemorative edition 1911. Comes in a fancy box with 2 mags in wax paper and all paperwork. It is extremely clean with no scratches or marks anywhere. Looks brand new. Has the roll marks on the side to designate the commemorative edition. Asking $950

And Finally, I have an Armalite AR-180B which was one of the first AR's marketed to civilians. It is a piston operated system and has significantly less recoil and is so easy to clean. It is in PERFECT condition with no scratches or nicks anywhere. Extremely lightweight and very accurate. Barrel is in amazing condition and is bright and shiny. Takes standard AR mags and will shoot 5.56 or 223. Pretty rare and won't find one in this condition. Asking $1,000

PWS 16"" .223 Wylde chambered barrel
PWS piston bolt carrier group
BCM mod4 charging handle

YHM picatinny bipod adapter (throwing in for good measure)
and all the paperwork and pamphlets it came with

I have approximately had about 500 rounds through this rifle with the majority of those rounds being slow controlled shots at long range. I broke in the barrel like I do with all my rifles (is it needed probably not but I do it anyways). Its an incredibly accurate rifle easily capable with sub-MOA groups (the .223 Wylde chambering is great) as long as you are doing your part. I was able to hit 16"" ringers out at 200-300yds with ease.

Also being a piston driven platform, the bolt and carrier have always stayed immaculate (although I never let more than 2 range trips go by without a thorough cleaning).

Only quality parts have been used in this build and it was done right the first time. Nothing else is needed. And it's fully capable of printing sub MOA groups all day long. It was built, to see if I could do it. I did, and it was highly successful, now on to the next project. Bellow is the list of parts used. There are several, that were installed after the photo was taken. Which have been noted in their description. I am taking offers on the rifle and in no hurry to sell. If interested, you can contact me through Armslist or by call/text at 541-743-1493. Please, don't waste my time or yours with lowball offers. They will be ignored.

Are you looking to build an SBR? Maybe you're purchasing your first suppressor? A gun trust offers you a great deal of convenience when you own these items.

Hanna Law, P.C. is a different kind of law firm, specializing in firearms trusts. We do not operate on a normal business week schedule, but can accommodate your needs on your schedule. We are available during the day and in the evening as well as weekends.

We understand that buying an NFA item can be a lengthy process, so we strive to offer great service with a short turnaround.

We offer two levels of trust:
Basic Gun Trust $225 - fast and easy, convenient for those who do not wish to speak at great lengths with the attorney. If you e-mail your info and give us a call, everything can be handled in person very quickly. Notary services provided at time of delivery.

Comprehensive Gun Trust $500 - Also fast, however, the attorney will meet with you and discuss all the provisions of the trust. If you do not like specific provisions, need clarification on certain provisions, or would like to add or remove provisions, this is the level for you. Generally it takes 1.5-2 hours of face time with the attorney to go over the entire document. Notary services provided during meeting. This is a good option for those who are unfamiliar with firearms trusts, and demand extensive clarification. Some people are a bit nervous when starting their NFA item collection, and face-time with an informed attorney can put some of these concerns to rest.

For various reasons, you may wish to also put your Title I (regular) firearms into your trust as well. We also offer this service.

We wish you the best on your journey into the land of SBR's, AOW's, SBS's, and suppressors. They can be great home defense weapons, and sure are a whole lot of fun to shoot at the range. We hope to hear from you soon. Feel free to call at REDACTED. Leave us a voicemail with your number and a good time to return your call, and we will get back to you promptly. You can also e-mail us at REDACTED."

For those wanting to use their 375’s in the lower 48 for animals up to 800 lbs, this load is superior. At over 3,000 fps, this deep penetrating Barnes bullet will give ample penetration for animals up to 800 lbs. If I were going to use my 375’s for deer, black bear, interior grizzly, caribou and elk, this load would be my first choice. It is very fast and flat shooting and the long-for-weight all copper homogenous bullet penetrates far deeper than the typical premium jacketed partition type of bullet that weighs 260gr. to 270gr.

Are you looking to build an SBR? Maybe you're purchasing your first suppressor? A gun trust offers you a great deal of convenience when you own these items.

Hanna Law, P.C. is a different kind of law firm, specializing in firearms trusts. We do not operate on a normal business week schedule, but can accommodate your needs on your schedule. We are available during the day and in the evening as well as weekends.

We understand that buying an NFA item can be a lengthy process, so we strive to offer great service with a short turnaround.

We offer two levels of trust:
Basic Gun Trust $225 - fast and easy, convenient for those who do not wish to speak at great lengths with the attorney. If you e-mail your info and give us a call, everything can be handled in person very quickly. Notary services provided at time of delivery.

Comprehensive Gun Trust $500 - Also fast, however, the attorney will meet with you and discuss all the provisions of the trust. If you do not like specific provisions, need clarification on certain provisions, or would like to add or remove provisions, this is the level for you. Generally it takes 1.5-2 hours of face time with the attorney to go over the entire document. Notary services provided during meeting. This is a good option for those who are unfamiliar with firearms trusts, and demand extensive clarification. Some people are a bit nervous when starting their NFA item collection, and face-time with an informed attorney can put some of these concerns to rest.

For various reasons, you may wish to also put your Title I (regular) firearms into your trust as well. We also offer this service.

We wish you the best on your journey into the land of SBR's, AOW's, SBS's, and suppressors. They can be great home defense weapons, and sure are a whole lot of fun to shoot at the range. We hope to hear from you soon. Feel free to call at 720-568-0564. Leave us a voicemail with your number and a good time to return your call, and we will get back to you promptly.

SIG SAUER P226 MK25 9MM
The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.
This  version features coated alloy frame, and stainless steel slide. It also features a UID identification label, anti-corrosion coatings on controls and internal components and anchor engraving on left side of the slide.

No credit card fees and shipping to your local FFL is FREE!  Price does not include the NFA tax stamp or local sales tax.  Also, with the purchase of this suppressor, we can assist you in creating a basic living trust!  A living trust will speed up the transfer process.  Let us know if you have questions.  The Warlock 22 was created for maximum sound suppression in a lightweight aluminum package. The Warlock 22 has minimal first round pop for optimal discretion. From varmint hunting to plinking, this 22 suppressor will ensure quiet success. The Warlock 22 has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and user serviceability, which is very important for any .22LR silencer. Because the .22LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue they must be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22LR silencers on the market. The Warlock 22 has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily. Check out this video showing how easy it is to clean!

This particular Model used to be referred to as the
            “K38 Target Masterpiece”

This Smith & Wesson “K” Frame model is known to be an outstanding shooter, a great piece of S&W history, and a finely crafted work of art. 
Smith and Wesson are now reproducing this model in their “Classic” Line but, it was originally produced from 1947 to 1982. It was re-introduced in 1991 with the 6”, “Full Lug” version and was again discontinued in 1999.

This particular model 14-2 is in all original form, No box or manual included but, I do have the original Magna Style Grips that are Serial Numbered to the Revolver. I will be including the pair of Hogue Rubber Grips that are currently on it as well because they are simply more comfortable to shoot with.

I rate the finish to be about 90% condition with normal wear for its age of 50 years old (See Pictures). It shoots to Point of Aim and, locks up like a S&W Should.

Features of this Fine Revolver are,
* 6 Shot, Fluted Cylinder
* 6” Pinned Barrel
* Partridge style Front Sight
* Micrometer Adjustable Rear Sight
* Checkered Walnut Magna Style Wood Grips (Included)
* Hogue Rubber Grips (Currently on it)

I picked this Kimber up in a trade in excellent condition. it does not appear to have been fired much and it actually looks to have been carried more than fired.

The trigger on these little gems are factory set a between 4 and 5 lbs. Recoil is managed by the 18 lb, Double Spring system with Full Guide Rod and it works well with, surprisingly low felt recoil for such a small framed .45

978,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3598978,For Sale:  NEW Silencerco Sparrow 22 Silencer Suppressor,"Amissville, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 402,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 11, 2017",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Check us out online!  www.54-17arms.com Brand new Silencerco Sparrow 22 Silencer Suppressor with thread mount. No credit card fees and shipping to your local FFL is FREE!  Price does not include the NFA tax stamp or local sales tax.  Also, with the purchase of this suppressor, we can assist you in creating a basic living trust!  A living trust will speed up the transfer process.  Let us know if you have questions.  The Sparrow 22 is the first silencer in the world to offer the patented multi part containment (MPC) technology, which allows the Sparrow 22 to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use. Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance. Until Silencerco introduced the Sparrow 22, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

It is currently set up and ready to go (zero'ed) for NRA-type matches and has the top end aperture sights on it (Warner rear sight, RiteSite 30mm front site). But it is also build to do double-duty as a tactical rifle -- just remove the aperture sights and add scope. This gun has only top of the line components on it. It has fewer than 100 rounds fired -- enough to zero and get dope at 100 - 600 yards. I was planning to try this at some local NRA matches but got the tactical rifle bug, and already have invested in 6.5mm for that game.

This kit is ready to go, including the below upper and lower descriptions but also magazines (most never used), a Pelican case, dies for reloading 6mmAR, 6mmAR brass, and I think i even have about 20 or so of the initial 100 rounds I loaded up for zeroing. You'll get everything you need to start shooting -- you could take your package to the range, open it there, and begin firing.

If you want to shoot 6mm, the 6mmAR is a terrifically accurate round with great ballistics and in this gas gun gives you rapid follow up shots. Here is the equipment list:

UPPER:

    Robert Whitley built upper with (Kreiger or Bartlein barrel, can't remember which) barrel, 1:7.5 twist. 26"" long. Medium Palma contour, diameter where front sight is mounted is 0.750 inches.
    Heavy walled rigid receiver with side charging handle
    Adjustable handrest with sling swivel
    Warner #2 Match rear sight
    RiteSight 30mm adjustable front sight 



LOWER:

    Aero Precision lower
    Geisselle match trigger
    Locked trigger pins
    PRS Adjustable buttstock with additional buttstock plates to give cant adjustment as well
    Magpul grip 



If you want this package without the aperture sights, I will take them off and charge $2900 for the remainder of the package. Shipment outside of WA must go to receiving FFL. (Please specify a receiving FFL that will accept shipments from individuals.) Shipping costs will be $40 (shipped inside a box around the Pelican case).
