The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648-308H ACOG® reticle features a red dot aiming point circled by a black ""horseshoe."" It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 7.62mm M80 out to 1200 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG® line, the new ACOG® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 500 feet"

It also has the renowned three lever MOA trigger system -- a design proven on the legendary Model 70. The addition of a threaded barrel makes it easy for those in areas where a suppressor is allowed and those who have acquired the necessary paperwork, to hunt quietly for various reasons: to not spook other game and varmints after firing , to protect the hearing of yourself and those around you and to be a good neighbor in areas where less noise would be appreciated. And the threaded barrel also allows the mounting of a muzzle brake when recoil is your concern.Features:Action: BoltCaliber: 308 Winchester/7.62 NATOBarrel Length: 20""Capacity: 3+1Trigger: M.O.A.

Adjustable night sights, match grade bull barrel, checkering front /back of grip, front/back cocking serrations, outstanding trigger, flared magwell. I could go on and on but Im guessing if you want one of these you already know what features it has. I am asking 1400 and Im pretty firm on that at as it has not been fired. I also have four spare springfield magazines(gun comes with two), springfield holster, and springfield mag carrier I got on a special promotion to be included with firearm(120 dollar value)."

The 5.56 Carbine Base 16"" Upper is a standard M4 style upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

I will provide a simple bill of sale.Please feel free to text me at 9 five 2-two two1-7 zero five 4 if you have any questions.  The only trade I'd be interested in is a Kriss Sphinx SDP compact.Thanks for looking!EDIT:  One of the 30 round mags has a broken feed lip!  Just noticed as I was unloading the mag.  It still retains the bullets, but I would only use it for plinking! I will probably replace it, just in case the gun doesn't sell."
