I am selling this for a good friend who’s had it in his collection for quite awhile. He bought it as you see it, years ago…….

My friend is a Maryland Gun Dealer and this gun is on his books, so a Maryland buyer must pay Maryland sale tax.

The gun shoots smoothly. The slide and barrel are vented at the front. Slide is incorporated into the frame, making recoil more manageable. The holster and gun have been carried before.

The pistol has also been Duracoated HK black. The slide to frame, mainspring to frame, and grip safety to frame fitting is all very well done... pics just don't do this piece any justice.

This revolver was made in 1994 and has been checked with Taurus USA and is covered by the transferable lifetime warranty. This revolver is very rare in its condition and more so in its length. A search on any gun site shows no availability of this model. They simply are not being sold by their owners, partly because of the Strength and quality of this revolver. It is said to be the best revolver Taurus has ever built. I would easily compare this to a colt Python. The action is crisp and light. Shot placement is very accurate. This is a very, very nice revolver. I hate to have to let it go. This opportunity will not be available often. Very good early year quality, unbeatable lifetime warranty.

You can't get it at Walmart and importation has stopped. Though you can still find those selling the full cans at $240 and up plus shipping, maybe you just want enough for a couple trips to the range, or to load 9 mags for your SHTF kit. This is for 9 sealed 30 packs of what is I BELIEVE to be 1992 production. (may be a different year) This is the ammo that is devastating in all recent tests. Not that you want to defeat armor, but barriers for sure, and against the bad guys or walking zombies (when they rise to get you) this is the real deal. Far superior to typical 55gr 5.56/223 this is 69 grain longer bullets. Known for superior penetration and tumbling, this is badazz ammo. These are offered at $7.22 per pack of 30, and remember that all other ammo sold is in boxes of 20. So when you see 223 for a similar price, that is for 20 and this is 50% more. That is 24 cents per round, and the only thing that really adds to the price is shipping. That is why a local sale is the best deal for you. If you want it shipped, no problem, and Fedex Ground for 8 pounds from 33324 will run a MAX of $21 for West Coast. Figure about $2 a pack for the shipping so 30.7 cents a round delivered for 270. Again, if you are on the East Coast or close to FL, it will be several dollars less. **They add almost $4 to deliver to a residence, so the rate may show lower but be sure to check the box for residence, as they will 100% figure it out. If delivering to a business address, let me know as it lowers the price. I will try to find a lower price to ship, but as it is live ammo, choices are limited. The flat rate Fedex is cheap but not ground, and the Post Office will not ship live ammo. I know many do so, but that worries me too much. Paypal is okay but dont mention ammunition, I will discretely invoice you. For the 270 rounds, message me for exact shipping,or figure 8 lbs from 33324 and see what you can find, but plan on $18 to $21 unless I find some other way. Of course, Local Sales are the best, fastest and cheapest. Need a valid ID"

I purchased this setup in December '14. The rifle it was mounted to was only taken out and shot three times, for a total of less than 200 rounds. There are a couple small cosmetic scratches on the top right of the sight. They are hardly noticeable, and much more pronounced in some of the attached pictures due to lighting.
I never registered the product online, and it has a two year warranty, so it is covered until December '16.

This one is like new and has only seen the field 5 or 6 times, I have the charger mounting bracket etc.. 

I'll start by saying these are nice devices. I know there is a lot of controversy online whether they are effective or not and I went out on a limb and bought one because of their money back guarantee. I did not get to hunt my property much last year but on one of the few occasions I had 4 deer under my tree stand ( one being a 125"" buck) the Ozonics was running and the deer were never spooked until I flung an arrow. I truly believed it made a difference. The reason I'm selling is having a baby this fall and I wont be able to get in the woods for a while.  if you would like to read some more about them ... http://ozonicshunting.com/

That being said these retail for $400 before tax, if you look online you wont find them much cheaper then that and will have to wait.  I'm asking $225 and think that is a fair price, I will negotiate a little if you pick up and bring cash.  I am also going to be listing a bunch of stands, feeders, trail cameras ect. I would be willing to work out a good deal if someone wanted a good amount of it.  Also open to trades and I can add cash or other trades for the right items. Thanks"

This is designed for .223/5.56 caliber firearms with 1/2x28 barrel threads like standard AR-15 barrels. This comp does a good job of reducing muzzle flash. It does an amazing job reducing muzzle rise and felt recoil. There is a noticeble difference when shooting the same gun with this device compaired to an A2 birdcage. $75 shipped via USPS. $70 local pick up. I can do paypal or certified check. I will also take a standard check but the check must clear before I will ship.

Terrific little gun that I got on sale in Montrose. I was hoping to keep it as a variable to my truck-gun, but its ultimately too small for a 6' frame. Who would have thought...

Only the .243 has had lead sent downrange. It is accurate to a certain point - I got about a 3"" spread at 100 yards. This DOES NOT have a floating barrel because of the adaptability, however for the price and ability to put a kid into three cartridges, it is a terrific value.

20 Hornady .243 - 95 grs
25 Federal 20ga - #8 Shot
