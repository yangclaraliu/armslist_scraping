Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

All that would need to be done to make it Massachusetts legal is weld/pin a muzzle device because this does have a Smith Vortex flash hider. Here are the stats.

I have a LOT more pictures if needed. 

Upper - Vltor MUR-1 ( older version ) with brass deflector and forward assist 
Barrel - Noveske 16.1 Recon midlength gas 5.56 1-in-7 twist , I bought this as a complete kit from Noveske so it came with the gas tube , low profile gas block and matching M/P bolt 
Rail - Larue 11"" handgaurd 
Carrier group - Lewis Machine Tool 
Charging handle - Lewis Machine Tool with Badger tactical latch 
Larue Index clips and Larue handstop 
Flash Hider - Smith Vortex 

The upper is in very good condition , NOT perfect it does have a few marks light scratches on it. It has about 800 rounds through it of only factory brass cased ammo and never one issue , XM193 and was cleaned after each use. I have almost $1400 into this upper asking $900 shipped , insurance is extra if you want it you pay for it. Paypal gift or +3% Any questions feel free to ask. Not really looking for any trades. Unless you have a Springfield TRP Operator and live in Massachusetts or a H&K VP9 with cash on your end."

The stock folds into three different positions. It has extremely nice grips including a foreground. Comes with a heavy duty bipod and a very nice milldot scope that is very clear. Very light trigger pull, great for target practicing. I have two 25rd magazines that will come with the rifle also. It is a tac driver at 100 yards! I only had 50rds through the rifle. I decided that I want to buy a .45 pistol and that's why I'm selling it. I Have over $650 in the rifle and I'm asking $550 cash or I would like to trade for a .45 pistol or a revolver.

I have a brand new Sig Sauer P938 SAS. I bought it for concealed carry, but I think I can get away with something a little larger in winter. I did a ton of research before buying it and I think it's an excellent handgun for concealed carry - but still maintains the ability to be fun at the range. I haven't shot mine, but I've shot a friend's. It's got a great single action trigger and 1911-style operations. It's got really nice night sights (tritium, no need to ""charge""), and a super nice trigger. It's also the ""SAS"" version, which stands for Sig Anti-Snag. Basically that means it's ""melted"", all the corners and points are rounded and polished to make a more comfortable carry weapon. Some of these ship with the 6 round flush magazine, I got lucky and mine came with the 7 round pinky extension magazine. It feels really nice in the hand.

Here's the description and specifications from Sig:

EASY TO CONCEAL. IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE.
We gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle. The result is the SIG P938 - a carry pistol of the highest caliber. Inspired by the 1911, this lightweight handgun offers leading accuracy and durability, delivering total confidence when called upon.

I'll upload this ad with pictures that aren't my specific gun, but I'd happily take pictures of mine. Just know that they'll look identical. The only inconsistency is that the third picture shows one with a 6 round flush magazine - mine has the 7 round pinky extension magazine like in the first two photos.

I should also mention that mine comes with everything originally in the box. There's a holster, a lock, the manual, etc. I can show proof that I'm the original purchaser.

The extremely popular Taurus PT111 Millennium G2 chambered in 9mm. Face to face sale in Hampton Roads area. Most that are selling are Blued, but this is the more expensive and harder to find stainless steel version. No worries about damage to he finish or rust. 

Some of the features include:

* Smoothed and rounded edges on the slide which helps with reholstering and defends against snagging.

* A loaded chamber indicator which shows you that there's a round in the chamber. 

* A fully adjustable for windage and elevation 3 dot sight system.

* A Glock like tigger Safe Action trigger safety.

* A manual thumb safety.

* An accessory rail (should you choose to add a flashlight and/or laser).

* An aggressively textured grips that aid in keeping the pistol in your hand.

* Restrike capability which allows you to pull the trigger a second time without the slide needed to be racked. This gives to option to attempt to fire a bullet for a second time if there was a light primer strike. 

* Has restrike capability. It normally operates as a conventional Single Action system e.g. every time the slide cycles it pre-cocks the firing pin. If an ammunition failure occurs and a misfire happens, the system automatically goes to a double action condition allowing you to fire again by pulling the trigger (double action), with no need to cycle the slide manually.

* Disassembly/reassembly is also extremely quick, easy, and does not require any tools or elbow grease. 

* 12 + 1 round capacity in a compact light 22 once frame. The PT111 G2 is a double stack magazine that's similar in sight and weighs only 3 more ounces than the M&P Shield, but gives you 4-5 extra rounds compared to the Shield. IMHO, excellent ergonomics are also excellent.

* Comes standard with magazine pinky extension which gives you a full 3 finger grip.

* Comes with a lifetime factory warranty.

The 5.56 Midlength Evo 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own."

Crimson Trace has combined three tactical tools (flashlight, laser, and vertical grip) into one robust, easy to use implement. The MVF-515 attaches to the Picatinny rail found on many tactical long guns by means of a CNC machined aluminum mount and tang which forms the ""backbone"" for the assembly. The flashlight and laser are molded into the right and left grip panels and can be removed and reattached to the aluminum tang without tools. The instinctive activation switches on the grip panels allow the operator to use the laser and flashlight independently or simultaneously. The programmable functions allow the flashlight to be used in three different modes: momentary, strobe, or constant-on. A master switch allows either side to be completely turned off. Two CR123 batteries provide over 4 hours of illumination and over 48 hours of laser use. The MVF-515 grip is a Red laser.

Crimson Trace has combined three tactical tools (flashlight, laser, and vertical grip) into one robust, easy to use implement. The MVF-515 attaches to the Picatinny rail found on many tactical long guns by means of a CNC machined aluminum mount and tang which forms the ""backbone"" for the assembly. The flashlight and laser are molded into the right and left grip panels and can be removed and reattached to the aluminum tang without tools. The instinctive activation switches on the grip panels allow the operator to use the laser and flashlight independently or simultaneously. The programmable functions allow the flashlight to be used in three different modes: momentary, strobe, or constant-on. A master switch allows either side to be completely turned off. Two CR123 batteries provide over 4 hours of illumination and over 48 hours of laser use. The MVF-515 grip is agreen laser.

I started sanding down the barrel. And have 4140r shavings to fill pits. ALL INTERNAL PARTS, HAMMER&BREECH BLOCK ARE NEARLY PERFECT, Planned on restoring it and building either a sheutzen or buffalo rifle. Was going to reduce the receiver dimensions to sporter dimensions. As the military configuration is overkill. Being a smokeless action it can handle nearly anything you'd like to chamber it in BP or smokeless. 
Hate to see this go but I don't have the space or time to build this. 

I'm not against selling single parts it's currently disassembled. And I'll sell parts at fair market value. And the more parts you buy the better deal you'll get. If I don't sell in the next week I'm going to put all individual parts on eBay.

The Finns took a basic M91/30 rifle and redesigned it to maximize it's potential. The barrels are approximately 3 inches shorter than the M91/30 while being beefier and well rifled. It was engineered to maximize the 7.62x54r round efficiently utilizing the powder for maximum effectiveness while more fully stabilizing the bullet in flight. As a result these things are just accuracy personified and if you think your M91/30 rifle is accurate just wait until you pull the trigger on one of these. The sights are greatly improved, the stocks are more ergonomic and user friendly, and the triggers are enhanced. Heck even the magazine has been improved to ensure smooth and efficient feeding of the rounds up into the chamber. Condition - We are listing these rifles as Good - Very Good, and overall they are quite nice. However, whenever you deal with a group of surplus, there is always a best one in the bunch and a worst one in the bunch with all of the rest being somewhere in between. Many of the rifles will have varying degrees of bluing wear, or some mottling of the color on the metal. Also, while some of these have wood that is really nice ( with the exception of light storage marks which is common to almost all of them ) , other stocks may have dents, dings, discoloration, or even some slight cracks in the wood in either the butt stock or the hand guards.For more information or to order online click>>>finnish-m39-sako-mfg-mosin-nagant-762x54"

Swedish Mauser by Carl Gustaf, 1896 version, with later Elit diopter sights and pistol grip.  Very similar to what Sarco is selling for a little less money but with no ammunition, no accessories, and only one sight insert.Armslist does not always forward inquiries successfully.  If no response, keep trying.  Due to the level of scam requests coming via Armslist, a traceable phone number MUST be included with the inquiry.  No traceable phone, no reply.All SN match, except of course the sight. Original rear sight still atop barrel (not swung below), original front sights and stock bolt also with gun, full set of Elit apertures, tool, case. Includes 1896 sling, muzzle guard for cleaning, cleaning rod extender (not SNs), brush, and twin solvent flask. Incl. 400 rounds NORMA Prikskytte sniper/match M96 ammunition, still in original sealed packs, and 20 LiteMag progressive powder load 6.5x55 cartridges (Hornady). The Norma cases now sell for about 0.75-1.00 PER CASING but these are Swedish military cases and bullets. Rifle not sold without the cartridges, or visa versa unless the cartridge offer is pretty high. The gun is was NOT originally a marksmanship competition gun. The Elit sights, pistol grip, and target trigger shoe were added later, and are not date-correct for this rifle.Gun is in excellent condition cosmetically and mechanically. Sold because it has been replaced by Tanner and G&E rifles in other calibers for precision use. It can not complete with those rifles. This rifle has NOT had its barrel fully floated or bedded. The floating of the barrel likely would need to be done for improved accuracy, to realize the full accuracy of the rifle.  Also this is alonger barrel gun, rendering it useful to 600-800 M.The Carl Gustaf 1896 were the best of the entire Mauser line, unless perhaps one includes the SIG 205 CISM rifles in that consideration. Those are better guns. Very few of these were made, with the ones by Mauser itself, or the Swedish follow-on contractor, Husquevarna, not as good.Direct transfer is possible in IL or NH. If in IL, FOID is required, at least 24 hrs in advance of transfer. In NH, any of a number of IDs are suitable (firearms carry permit, residence ID with local police department check, etc) or FFL/C&R FFL. Can ship USPS if desired also.More pictures available, if base price is ok. Please don't ask for images if the idea is to haggle over pricing. The ammunition alone is worth around $400, and the sight set alone is work around $300-400. Not much leeway on this due to utility as a comparison rifle to the others.Some handguns also are available. These includeWhitney WolverineHi Standard (CT) VictorHammerli 208S, 215SWalther GSP (various mid-age and later models), Walther OSP"

PLEASE Do not listen to anyone who has not owned this set about how good this set is. There are plenty of detractors online and almost without reservation they are people who have never had them. If you go on Youtube you can see this set shoot the a dime at 10 yards and a quarter at 25 yards. I have never been THAT good with my set and it is great for using ammo that is otherwise not of use to you. I love this set - I ended up with 2 sets by buying one after thinking I lost the auction I was bidding on and then winning the auction as well. I love the 44 mag adapter - it is a blast to shoot. It is a great set. They are rifled adapters and shoot very very well. I am very pleased with the purchase and cannot say how helpful this would be in a SHTF scenario.
Ever wished that you had a way to take your favorite break action 12 gauge shotgun and convert it to shoot a variety of your favorite calibers, well now here is your opportunity. Introducing the Chiappa X-Caliber set! This caliber conversion kit has more to it that meets the eye. This kit features 8 fully rifled adapters with an over all length of 8"" each. These 8 adapters allow you to convert that break action 12 gauge in popular handguns calibers such as 9mm Luger, .357 Magnum, and .45 ACP just to name a few. So dust of that shotgun and head to the range with the Chiappa X-caliber conversion set.
