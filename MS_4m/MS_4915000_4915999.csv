From the Manufacturer:

""Military Ballistics Industries (MBI) specializes in custom ammunition and ordinance products for use by the military, law enforcement agencies, and training facilities in the United States.

This remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 


The brass for this ammunition will have various headstamps and may be brass or nickel-plated brass.

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world’s best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection.""

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is “precision” remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit."

Also also it is 1 of only 9 out of the 200 with the contoured handle scales that Ryan was experimenting with. It has been used only One time lightly to chop some wood in the rear Spike has not been used at all. It is an amazing blade with outstanding craftsmanship which if I didn't need the money right now I would not sell  when I have to provide for my family before my own personal wants. Im open to some negotiating on price but don't insult me with a low ball deal please I'm not trying to make a profit I just have bills to pay unfortunately. The blade is hair shaving sharp and  when in hand just feels like a natural extension of your arm . Little Bird 150 comes with all the original hardware and sheath. When I purchased the Tomahawk I never intended to sell it so I tossed the original box but i do you have the original sales receipt and a quick call to RMJ tactical customer service would allow you to verify that it is truly one of only nine with that style handle. RMJ doesn't have the specs for the little bird on their website anymore but it is very comparable and dimensions and weight to the Jenny Wren hawk.

It had a 6.75 in (17.1 cm) double edged dagger. The handle is made of cast bronze and uses a conical steel nut to hold the blade in place.[1] The Mark I's blade was blued with a black oxide finish, the bronze handle was chemically blackened, with cast spikes on the bow of each knuckle. Usually the blackened treatment wore off exposing the bronze handle and steel blade as is the case with this example. Also included with the knife is the scabbard which is complete (usually the tabs break off and or the scabbards are lost. The scabbard is rarer than the knife itself and considerably valuable on its own. It is included for the price.

This is a piece of World War I history and is sold for the purpose of collecting, not as a weapon.

Retail Price: $135.95

Winner of Blade magazine's 2010 Most Innovative American Design award, the Spyderco Manix2 knife is drawing praise throughout the knife world for its clever build. Like its G-10 handled counterpart, the lightweight Manix2 features Spyderco's Ball Bearing Lock, which operates around a free-floating ball bearing contained inside a custom polymer cage. The ball bearing's round shape allows the lock to self-adjust across a large surface, ensuring smooth and consistent lockup each time it's engaged. Plus, the lock is engineered to be self-contained, meaning the Manix2 doesn't need internal liners to support the blade. This further reduces weight and improves maneuverability. 
The translucent EdgeTek fiberglass-reinforced co-polymer (FRCP) handle comes in a semi-opaque dusk blue color with a series of jimped areas molded around the handle's perimeter. The handle includes additional bi-directional texturing on both sides of the handle scale, making the folding knife ideal for gripping in wet or uncertain conditions. The blade, meanwhile, is made from newly released BD-1 Carpenter steel. BD-1 is gaining the attention of knife enthusiasts for its rust-resistant high-carbon and chromium content, which also offers enduring edge retention. The blade is flat ground with spine and choil jimping and an oversized Spyderco round hole. 

The Manix2 concludes with an ambidextrous, tip-up wire silhouette pocket clip and screw-together handle construction, giving the folder several carrying options.

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat FIREARMS, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

THERE ARE A LOT MORE BENEFITS TO HAVE THINGS CERAKOTED OTHER THAN MAKING THINGS LOOK REALLY GOOD. iF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TESTING THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON FIREARMS, CAR PARTS ETC. GO TO NICINDUSTRIES.COM 

If you have any questions or if you would like prices don't hesitate to Text or Call me I am more than happy and willing to help and answer any questions you have. If I have to disassemble and reassemble there is a extra charge of $30-$75 depending on how hard the gun is to disassemble. Thank you for your time I greatly appreciate it. Chris: 513-309-9042"

This is a 1865 US Providence Musket that was modified to become either a short shotgun or large pistol of some sort.  1865 was the last year that US Providence produced this form of musket.  Marking on the pistol are apparent with 1865 stamped and the US Providence seal, in addition to the Federal inspectors stamps on the barrel.

Not interested in trades currently.

The SR-556E offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. This rifle has all the modifications to be state compliant."

Replaceable grip panels allow you to adjust the feel and grip circumference to suit your individual needs and a threaded barrel which allows the attachment of a suppressor. The pistol features ambidextrous controls with dual slide released and enlarged magazine releases.

Bluing is excellent with a very small area at tip of barrel where bluing is slightly worn.  Not noticeable unless your attention is drawn to it.  It has a very, very thin line on the cylinder, but again very unnoticeable.  The grips are original, but had a coat of polyurethane in late seventies which is now beginning to wear. Could be easily restored to original finish. Only selling it because I need the funds for another purchase.
