Factory Description:

The open-tipped rounds until now have been available only to Special Operations Command troops. The first 200,000 7.62 Special Operations Science and Technology rounds are already downrange with Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan. SOCOM developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel, at 13.8 inches, is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine’s. Using an open-tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition, SOST rounds are designed to be “barrier blind,” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields, car doors and other objects."

The rifle though, all original condition. No rush to sell whatsoever. It's a 1943 Smith Corona with the Original 8-43 Smith Corona barrel. The screws don't even look like they've ever been undone. The barrel looks brand new. Tight muzzle, no rust corrosion or anything like that. The *original* walnut stock is in fantastic condition, very very light storage marks. This is the king of collector's rifles, certainly the prize of my personal collection.However, I'd rather have a rifle I wouldn't feel bad shooting personally, so I'm introducing this 1903a3 to the market. You will have to search very far and wide to find another 1903a3 in this condition. The parkerizing is at 99%+ condition. The sling is maker marked with a date stamp of 1918. Just the sling alone is worth $150+. Never shot the rifle myself. Smith Corona was originally a type writer factory which picked up a rifle contract during ww2. Very interesting piece of history. Even has an original cleaning kit in the butt stock. In case some people doubt the authenticity of a rifle in this condition, during ww2 when the war heated up the US mainly produced m1 Garands. However, the m1's had lots of production and functionality issues. Because of this, the US government ordered the production of more 1903 rifles. Remington designed the 1903a3 which increased production speed and functionality over the 1903. Remington was then given the contract to build these rifles along with Smith Corona. However, once the new 1903a3 production was in full swing, the problems with the m1 were mostly resolved, so the US began sending freshly produced 1903a3's straight into storage and were never issued. These rifles were either stored for war preparedness in the future, lent to allied nation's in need of weapons, or, a select few were sold to the civilian marksmanship program. The original owner bought the rifle in the 50's, still in the factory packing, never fired it and kept it in storage. Then the owner before me bought it from him, for his collection back in the 80's. It then came into my hands. So for all 3 owners it has never been fired, and only been treated as a collector rifle, not a shooter. I've had the rifle appraised by a gunsmith and Cabelas so I do know it's true value. At that; there is shooter value and collector value. This rifle is more likely going to sell to a collector because shooters, in my experience, are usually not willing to pay collector value for a rifle they are only buying for the range.

Quantity: 500
Size: Our 9mm 115 grain hardcore bullets are sized to .356""


These bullets are as close to match quality as any plated bullet can get. Though plated bullets are difficult to get a perfect weight every time, we have added several extra features to this bullet to make up for any variances in weight and still provide match accuracy. The first thing to mention is that they are plated very thick compared to other companies. Our plating is measured between .012-.014"" thick. This is almost twice as thick as other plated companies. They also have a harder lead core (11-12 BHN) than any plated bullet company that we know of. The hard core and thicker plating resists resizing during the seating process and can actually eliminate bullet setback in many cases. These features alone separate us from all other plated bullets on the market. We also put the bullet through two different types of plating process to get the correct thickness. The first plating process is a liquid electolysis similar to all other plated bullets. The second process is much more involved and results in excess copper on the edges of the base of the bullet which can then be ""folded"" over onto the base to give it a strong and uniform base. You will notice that the base of the bullet has a ring on it similar to a FMJ bullet. That ring is actually the excess copper after it has been triple sized and folded over. That ""ring"" helps trap expanding gases and provides a better seal as the bullet obturates. All of these qualities help make our RMR Hardcore bullet the best plated bullet on the market. All that said, it is still a plated bullet so try to keep it within 1500 fps.

These Targets are made of AR 500 Steel or AR400 Steel I personally use the 3/8 AR500 because I shoot with pistol and rifle at them.  Once you get into shooting steel shooting at paper is only done on specific drills such as closer than 9 Yards.

Shooting at steel is very safe and offers many things shooting at paper targets can not.  For starters they last forever, YES forever and if they don't they have a LIFETIME WARRANTY.  I started by hanging them from Shepard hooks available at lowes for $5 I then made rebar stands out of 2X4's and 1/2 in rebar which was about $20.  I then purchased their stands which are great.  All very economical and very effective, I still use all of them. 

Shooting at steel gives you a audible feed back so you know when you hit also if you paint your targets you get a visual hit as well, it chips a bit of paint off every time you hit it.  Paint can be a spray can which can be .99.  I personally use .99 spray primer paint in white or black, red is also popular, paint also seals the steel from rust so they don't get so dirty.  I spray them about 2 times while out shooting so one can will last years.

Shooting at steel is completely safe when done correctly, for hand guns up to 9mm it is recommended to shoot at a distance of 9 Yards for larger hand guns such as  44 mag, 40S&W, it is recommended to shoot at a distance of 12 yards.  For a complete marking of shooting distance you can click on the link and find their shooting directions which let you know what they can be shot with.  from .22 to .50BMG these targets will work for you their is no caliber that they cant handle, just get the distances safe.  ALWAYS angle your steel at a 5 degree minimum angle down ward so bullets can deflect downwards once hitting the target.  ALWAYS allow the target to swing freely never mount targets to a static back ground such as a wall or a tree trunk this is dangerous.

These targets have eyelets (holes) built into the steel when they are cut their is no welding of this steel to degrade its hardness.  Also holes allow one to easily hang them from chains, rope, hooks, anything and allows the steel to move when hit.  I have had more expensive steel targets that have hangers built in or have a hanging system with a spring but these always mess up in different ways from losing the spring to welding areas warping and pitting with high velocity rounds.

With out a doubt these targets are the best I have come across and by far the most reasonable in price, from IPSIC targets, Bullseye targets, Animal Vital Area targets, GONGS, in sizes from 3 in. to 26in.  Stands and Hangers which have everything but the bullets.  Also the more you buy the more you get, you get free targets with purchases, the larger the purchase the larger the free target you get.

Richard Speer founded CCI to provide a steady source of component primers to reloaders. Primers were CCI's first product, long before Mini-Mag™, Stinger® and our other well-known ammunition products. Our primers are highly evolved products because we continuously test and improve. Today's CCI primer is more sensitive, easier to seat, and more compatible with progressive and automated loading equipment than even before. CCI primers have always incorporated modern non-corrosive and non-mercuric initiator mixes. FEDERAL PREMIUM® GOLD MEDAL® CENTERFIRE PRIMERS  Gold Medal® Primers are manufactured to exacting tolerances, so if you load your own you know you're getting the same high-quality primer components and optimum ignition that make our Gold Medal cartridges the choice of match shooters everywhere. Knowing this will give you the extra confidence you need. REMINGTON  Whether you're at your bench working on shells or cartridges, you'll want to use Remington reloading components. We offer industry-leading products that have changed the way sportsmen think of reloading. For shotgunners, our Premier® STS® primers offer more uniform velocities, while our shotshell wads improve patterns and produce more reliable gas sealing. In centerfire, our Kleanbore® primers are renowned for their reliable uniformity, and Remington cartridge brass are widely hailed as the longest-lasting, most easily formed available. So whether you're at the range, on the sporting clays course or in the field, use Remington reloading components. They just might turn your good day into a perfect one. WINCHESTER  Winchester makes the highest quality ammunition components available to the ammo reloader. And each and every component is made to meet and exceed the most demanding quality control and performance standards in the industry - Winchester's!"

Up for your consideration is one of the best 1911s I have ever seen let alone owned. These are hard to find and about $1600 when you find them at a bass pro, field and stream or gander mountain.

Smooth slide is ported for quicker action and the gun is lighter than most full size 1911 but super accurate and limited recoil. Built for competition shooting but a great addition to any collection. 

She's a beauty for sure and handles like a dream. This is for cash sale only, UNLESS you have the S&W 1911 Performance Center carry edition with the 4"" barrel and bobbed tail. I would consider an even trade."

Literally just bought this firearm on August 14, and shot less than 25rounds down range. Bought it to replace my previous hip Snake Gun for the Woods right before the Hunting Season began... But I'm going in a different direction already... This Taurus Judge is the BIG BOY (3inch Barrel, 3inch Cylinder to hold the bigger shells, Stainless Steal Finish), and as stated, it's capable of shooting BOTH 2 1/2inch as well as 3inch shells. Lifetime Manufacturers Warranty, Original Box, Paper Work, Carry Bag, Safety Lock Keys and a lot of ammo. All the ammo I have is yours. I Have One Box of Winchester .45 Long Colt (255grain), One Box of Winchester AA .410 Super Sport (2 1/2in shells - 8shot), Five Rounds of Winchester Xtra .410 Super Speed (3in shells - 6shot) and Five Rounds of Remington's Ultimate Home Defense 000 Buck (2 1/2in shells - 64mm). If you're interested, $620 moves everything! I'm located in Ruskin but I work in Tampa. Text or Call me for questions at 813-Seven85-5462"

This one is in excellent shape unlike many of these that are out there today. There are very few blemishes with the worst being some light rub marks from being holstered. I put it an easy 95% condition. The bore is excellent as well with no corrosion or pitting. Many don't realize it, but most of the flare cartridges available today are quite corrosive so if you don't clean these things after use the bore will end up looking like a sewer pipe in short order. 

Also included is the correct miltary flap holster that has storage for flares and accessories. The holster is made of an OD green color woven vinyl material designed to keep the pistol dry, and it's in very nice original condition with no rips or tears. Additionally there is a correct rope style lanyard attached to the pistol and an adapter that allows you to fire .22 Short, Long or Long Rifle ammunition. The adapter is a great accessory for emergency self defense or survival scenarios. A word of caution is that once the adapter is installed in the flare pistol it becomes a real handgun and would be subject to the same rules and regulations. 

Finally there is a complete cleaning kit included that has a stiff bristle nylon brush for normal cleaning. A brass bristle brush for heavy fouling, and a felt wad tipped cleaning rod that fits snuggly in the bore so that cleaning can be done without patches.

$300 picked up in the Brandon area. Buyer must at least 21 to purchase.

This item could be shipped to places in the lower 48 states where owning a flare gun is legal via Priority Mail for $13."

For sale is my CZ PCR, hands-down the most accurate compact 9mm I've ever handled. It has been my EDC for a while, but it's a bit long in the grip and just didn't serve me well for that purpose. I carried it across the country on a 10-day trip this summer, though. It's doable, just not perfect. On the range is a different story. It shoots equally on par with a full frame 9mm. It is an incredible piece of workmanship. I own and have owned other CZ handguns, as well as many other quality makes; for its size it is almost without parallel.

Enough of the pitch. The gun is almost 3 years old, it is functionally and cosmetically in excellent condition. Despite being carried in a holster, the black factory polycoat shows no wear except in the slide rails, hammer, and the interior of the slide stop. The magazines are blued, they show some wear from contacting the frame interior. I don't have a round count on it, but it's been to the range quite a bit. It has never been used for competition of any type and I've never had a single failure to feed, fire, or eject from it. Nothing has been replaced, every component is OEM and I have never disassembled it any further than a field strip. It has been kept clean and lubricated, I typically run light to mid-range 124 and 147 grain copper plated handloads. 

I've purchased around 7 handguns this year. I'm low on space and I need to rotate some out. I carry a smaller Sig P239 now, so this one is not getting used at all anymore. I hate to see it go, but I just need to rip the band-aid off, so to speak. I have a kydex shell for an Alien Gear IWB holster; if you can use it, you can have it. These pistols sell for roughly $550 new, I'm asking $450 or a reasonable offer thereabouts. Emails to the effect of ""What's your bottom dollar?"" will be ignored and I'm not looking for trades. Ohio residents over the age of 21 only, Ohio ID required. I will ship out of state on the buyer's dime, I'll do my best to keep the costs down. Thanks for looking."

I guess I don't need to tell how rare they are. Cosmetically in pretty rough condition but fully functional. Sits nice and tight on my SVT. I had to tap it with a wooden block to take it off the rails. Scope also sits very tight. Unfortunately no screws and cross pin. I tried the repro cross pin (from Numrich mount) and with slight tension adjustment it fits perfectly. Finding fitting screws shouldn't be a problem either. The rust ate thru the metal right where the buffer spring sits on the back of the mount (see pictures) but it doesn't compromise the structural integrity. There's plenty of metal to hold the spring in. Spent in the ground 70+ years before it was dug out in Crimea mountains. Fully serviceable! Rifle and scope obviously not included.
