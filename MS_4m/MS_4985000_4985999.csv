Stock is still spot welded from factory. This gun was purchased new buy me in early 2014, and put away in my safe. This gun comes with the factory 5 round magazine. New models being sold for $799 have the non folding tubular stock, and not the factory folding stock. So if you buy the new model with the high quality wolf ammo you will spend $799 plus shipping and FFL, and have a non folding model and 100 rounds of crappy ammo. So you'll end up paying near $900 for a new gun. I will not entertain offers below $700, and if you negotiate a price on the phone and then come with less money, be prepared to deal with an angry large in shape guy. I'm sorry to sound like an asshole, but posting on here is worse than Craigslist. If you're looking at this ad you know what it is and what it's worth. Do not waste my time. I'm not in need of money. I just have lots of guns, and it's ashame it's just sitting in my safe. Also, this gun is an AK Variant, so it's not going to function like a New 4k Novekse, but it's in perfect condition, and is a great gun."

I currently have, or shall I say “HAD”  a couple of post on Armslist for two reasons, what better opportunity to try and sell gun stuff (“Merry Christmas!”) and also to be completely honest with you, I need the money, especially this time of the year. But for some reason the Armslist community decided to FLAG my post for whatever reason. I absolutely and truly respect and support ALL efforts to stop the ID thieves, scammers, unwanted marketers, and especially all the bad guys living in our great Country, trying to find a way to circumvent methods to illegally obtain firearms solely for the destruction, mayhem, fear and an effort to bring udder chaos to our GREAT COUNTRY.  That being said, I ask of you all, PLEASE do not flag any of my posting, it was my mistake NOT listing my phone number, which in hindsight might have brought a little more credibility to my postings if in question of their validity, and I did so only to try and do what you folks just did, stop the crap that sometimes comes along with using classified media like this, and Craigslist etc. I am a Proud Veteran of the United States Army, Honorably Discharged, 118th Military Police Unit (Airborne), Honor Graduate of the Department of Defense Military Working Dog Team School, and also served with the Army Security Agency (ASA). I served our Country during the Vietnam conflict, was attached to the 18Th Airborne Corp. I am now retired and living on a very meek disability, but I am still truly blessed.

But for some reason the Armslist community decided to FLAG my post for whatever reason. I absolutely and truly respect and support ALL efforts to stop the ID thieves, scammers, unwanted marketers, and especially all the bad guys living in our great Country, trying to find a way to circumvent methods to illegally obtain firearms solely for the destruction, mayhem, fear and an effort to bring udder chaos to our GREAT COUNTRY.  That being said, I ask of you all, PLEASE do not flag any of my posting, it was my mistake NOT listing my phone number, which in hindsight might have brought a little more credibility to my postings if in question of their validity, and I did so only to try and do what you folks just did, stop the crap that sometimes comes along with using classified media like this, and Craigslist etc. I am a Proud Veteran of the United States Army, Honorably Discharged, 118th Military Police Unit (Airborne), Honor Graduate of the Department of Defense Military Working Dog Team School, and also served with the Army Security Agency (ASA). I served our Country during the Vietnam conflict, was attached to the 18Th Airborne Corp. I am now retired and living on a very meek disability, but I am still truly blessed.

These grips are tailored to fit the Beretta 92 and M9 and are will not fit the Taurus PT92. 

They are CNC machined to exact tolerances from a billet piece of G10. If your not familiar with G10 its roughly 10% heavier than carbon fiber and as strong as 6061 aluminum. But much more resistant to wear and tear. Simply put its one of most durable material for handgun grips and the only one that can provide this look. 

The cross hatch texture provides a medium texture and is cut slightly smoother compared to my 1911 grips. The fit and finish are exceptional (very noticeable on the front strap compared to other grip makers). While other improvements would include improved access to the magazine release and slide stop."

This is a hard one to let go of but I'm selling my Marlin 336 CS in .35 Remington.

Rifle has a 20"" microgroove barrel and the walnut stock on this one is beautiful.  In particular the forend is highly figured.  Couple of small nicks in the buttstock but nothing serious. Bluing is great with some minor wear under the receiver from field carry.  The rifle wears a weaver fixed 4x scope in burris rings and base.  This rifle will clover leaf Hornady Leverevolution 200gr at 100 yds and is MOA or better with Remington Core-Lokts if I do my part.

Serial on the rifle begins with 05... which I believe makes it a 1995 model. Sorry, no box.

With the sale comes the ammo and brass I have around:
3 boxes + 5 rounds Hornady Leverevolution flex tip 200 gr (allows you to shoot pointy bullets in a tube magazine)
35 pcs spent Hornady brass from the same lot as above.

* G10 
* Ambi Notch Standard
* Thumb Notch Standard
* CNC Machined
* Machined to fit any 1911 frame
* Fully De-horned
* This listing is for a set of gun grips ONLY

As cut the design provides an aggressive, slip free, no-nonsense grip for you 1911. However the grips and can be sanded to a smoother texture depending on customer preference. The grips are very competitively priced with lot of colors to choose from, options for every full size 1911 and choice of thickness.

The material is called G10 and its one of the best materials for handgun grips and the only one that can provide this look. Its much tougher than wood or acrylic... it won't absorb moisture and doesn't scratch very easy. The material is tough as nails and will last normal shooters a life time.

The grips will fit nearly all guns...and look about the same as the photos regardless of options, G10 can vary a little bit in color and thickness of grips can affect the look slightly. But I try to make the most attractive grip possible regardless of any variation. There are only a couple guns the grips won't fit and they are the Llama 1911, Girsan 1911 (metric bolt heads) and double stack 1911's.

I can custom make these to fit ANY bottom cut

**Bottom Cuts:
Standard Bevel - Most people need this option.... Has a 30 degree taper and a notch for the MSP

Magwell - If your gun has a magwell you probably want this option, straight 90 cut on the bottom with a covered MSP 

Wilson 188 Magwell - If you want to install a Wilson Combat 188 magwell you need this option (PT1911 requires slight modifications... basically filing the hooks about.020"")

Other Bottom Cuts (Full Size ONLY... Leave a Note on Checkout or Send Email)

Bobtail - you probably have an Ed Brown or Dan Wesson, bottom corner of the grip is cut off and beveled

This is the higher end model and not the one with 2 magazines and illuminating night sights.In development for more than four years, the VP Series is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP, but the VP Series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs."

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"" available as the hunter variant. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.Last one! $1599!!"

I am a novice gunsmith who is working towards an official certification. To help get there, I am offering gun cleaning services for a reduced fee. 

Have a collection? Or that nice hunting rifle that saw some use (hopefully getting your nice haul this year) but hasn't had the opportunity to be cleaned up? 

Save yourself the time and hassle, I can do pickups, drop-offs, multiple item collections, etc. I have experience with most weapons systems, anything I am not 100% comfortable with will be turned away without any cost to the customer. 

Prices will depend on the extensiveness of cleaning. If you are looking for a quick internals maintenance/lube, and a clean bore, that could be a pretty low cost. However, if you're looking for a pickup of multiple ARs with 1000+ rounds through it, and a few hours of scraping to be done, that will cost more.

My initial point, in doing this however, is to afford the closing costs on certificates and final classes required, and to build a portfolio. Anyone who is willing to put in a word, and leave a reference, I am sure we can work out some other deal in these regards.

Thanks for any consideration, I look forward to any inquiries you may have, feel free to send them over.

Have a Merry Christmas, all!"

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

This is not a bubba'd AK, this is the real deal closely matching what would come straight from the Balkans with exquisite craftsmanship. Has an awesome trigger pull, top notch finish (IE not an Arsenal spray paint job) and the action runs very smooth. Friends who have shot this comment how they like it much more than my Rifle Dynamics AK. It comes with one magazine (that's what came with it when I bought it) and I'm asking $1150 but open to cash offers (no trades). Let me know if any more info or pictures are needed, I also have pictures of the original proofing marks on the Yugo barrel."

Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to .22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction. PortingReferred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality. Ribber Grip Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Model: 44TRACKER4B Finish: Blue Steel  Caliber: .44 MAG Grips: Ribber Grip UPC: 7-25327-35123-8 Capacity: 5 Weight: 34 oz.
