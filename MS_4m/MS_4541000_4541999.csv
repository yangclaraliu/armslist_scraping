I bought it with plans to use last year, but that doesn't look like it's going to happen. It's a Coleman Sequoia. Has AC/Heat (roof-top), and a queen and King size beds. Galley kitchen, out door camp stove, on-board water tank, OEM manuals, etc. Not a bad unit (particularly for this price)! I was using the AC today as I cleaned, and it was nice and cold.

Needs attention: The forward slide is bent (BTW, always have the supports in place). I haven't tried straightening, but it could be an easy fix.. or just replace. The canvas is useable, but you might want to replace/repair here and there. I've found the top doesn't crank all the way up... no idea why.

I even thought it'd make a great utility or sled trailer if you're willing to 'customize' it. You could probably sell the roof top unit, and parts to get most or all of your money back.

I'm interested in trades, but no basket cases (I don't have the time, hence selling this). Let me know.
If the ad is here, it's still for sale. Best offer, but please don't bother with scrap rates. I'd be interested in a smaller motorcycle (no scooters), and firearms (no black powder, though)... Doesn't hurt to ask. Please ask specific questions or it'll go to spam/trash.

Uberti, but since the U.S. Historical Society Firearms Division was sold to America Remembers in 1994, no one remembers the actual manufacturer and no official information is available. This was manufactured in 1992.

Model:  Single Action Army 

Serial Number: 504 or 2500

Year of Manufacture: 1990 (per Fjestadâs âBlue Book of Gun Valuesâ) 

Caliber: .45 Colt 

Action Type: Single Action Revolver with Side Loading-Gate Cylinder 

Barrel Length: 4 Â¾â 

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a half round blade fixed to the barrel. The rear sight is a âUâ groove milled into the top strap. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The two piece natural stag horn grips exhibit only the natural variances in the material.  The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Blue Barrel, Frame and Backstrap, Gold Plated Cylinder and Trigger Guard 

Bore Condition: unfired

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. Almost no signs of handling are present. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. It has very MINOR cylinder wear.  Overall I would say it is still in excellent condition.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We did not fire this handgun. 

All the original Paperwork: This pistol comes in a lacquered hardwood display case with a Roy Rogers signature burned into the lid.  A brass keyhole is visible on the front edge and a full length hidden brass hinge can be seen on the rear edge. The inside of the case is lined in royal blue velvet. The floor of the case is a form fit compartment for the pistol and compression marks from contact with the revolver are evident in the velvet. The floor of the box sports a brass plaque which is engraved with a rope border and reads âRoy Rogers King of the Cowboys / Single Action Army .45â / an American Eagle Emblem / âUnited States Historical Societyâ. An ornate brass key is included which operates the lock. The case is in Excellent condition. 

Our Assessment: This is a Roy Rogers âKing of the Cowboysâ commemorative Single Action Army revolver, issued in 1990 by the United States Historical Society. This is number 504 of 2500 produced. The cylinder is marked with an Italian proof mark and most writings list this series as being manufactured by A. Uberti. This is a reproduction of a 1st Generation Colt Single Action Army black power frame, with a set screw securing the cylinder pin. This pistol is finished in a deep blue with a gold plated cylinder and trigger guard. The left side of the barrel displays gold lettering which reads âU.S. Historical Societyâ and the right side reads âRoy Rogers King of the Cowboysâ. A guitar with notes and two American Eagles adorn the left side of the frame, while a guitar with notes, an image of Roy Rogers and â1940â, a Circled â50â and â1990â are visible on the right side. The cylinder is gold plated and features three stars between each flute and a musical staff encircling the rear of the cylinder, with musical notes and âHappy Trails to Youâ visible within the staff. The pistol is in Excellent condition, exhibiting almost no evidence of handling and resides in a dark hardwood case which is also in Excellent condition. This is a very attractive display pistol, honoring Roy Rogers, perhaps the most beloved Singing Cowboy this country has ever known."

The pistol has well under 500 rounds fired (I'd say closer to 300) and is in GREAT condition. The pistol has factory 'suppressor height' sights to co-witness with the red dot and comes with two magazines. The Apex parts kits are already installed, and I still have ALL the original factory parts and Apex packaging. I lost the box to the DeltaPoint so it just comes 'as-is' without the cross slot mount, and is currently mounted on the pistol. The DeltaPoint shows some evidence of wear, as the magnesium housing has some minor 'knicks', but the glass and internals are in excellent shape!! I also still have the torque wrench to adjust the windage and elevation. Retail, everything adds up to about $1,500 after tax. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100 - cash, and will pay the transfer if asking price is met. I am located in Seattle, but am willing to meet within reason. My preferred FFL is Pantel Tactical in Renton, but am open to meeting elsewhere if buyer prefers. Thanks for looking!!

227,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4541227,For Sale:  1916? Marlin Model 19S Take Down â 80%-90%+ Condition,"Englewood, Denver, Colorado",$ 450,"Listed On: Saturday, September 5, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Iâm not a dealer or collector so I canât really accurately assess the condition of this gun on the typical percentage scale. I can say that itâs a beautiful and functional piece that still has most of its original bluing. 

I took this gun to a recent gun show to get otherâs opinions. I was told by most dealers I spoke with that this gun was in about 80%-90%+ condition, and would likely auction as a collector piece for around $1100. Most of the bluing is in good condition. You can view the higher resolution pictures on my dropbox site and decide the condition for yourself: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/75aspa95txtl4uj/AAC5bhc3pHBTndIAkotbt0Laa?dl=0

The first picture in the dropbox group named âMarlin Model 19S in the NRA National Firearms Museumâ is NOT this gun that Iâm selling. I included the photo to show what a very nice Marlin 19S looks like in the NRA museum. All other photos in the dropbox folder are of this piece that Iâm selling. 

I do not know the precise age of this piece. It may be a post 1916 piece based upon the âAâ in the serial number. The serial number is âA12720â. I searched the web but could not find an accurate age based upon the serial number. The last patent date stamped on the barrel shows âMay 19 â08â. Perhaps there are experts out there who can more accurately determine the age.

This gun was purchased as a used gun by my father in about 1934 near Crabtree, Pennsylvania, from a neighbor. My father used and owned the gun since then. He passed away last year. Before he passed, he asked that I find a good home for it with someone who could appreciate it. He told me that everything was original, so, as far as I know, itâs all original. He always took excellent care of all of his guns.

Although the gun is fully functional and in beautiful condition, Iâm selling it as a collectors piece. Marlin has issued warnings about the older Model 19âs stating that they should not be fired due to noted failures to achieve full lock up, their age and their inability to handle the pressures of modern loads, even short 2.5â or 2.25â 12GA loads.

The long, 15â DDM4 quad rail over a 16â cold hammer forged Government profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

It is built from original H&K military parts using a specially modified PTR USA made receiver and RCM barrel to keep it 922(r) compliant.Â Unlike other HK91/G3 type rifle clones on the market, the vector is built from actual German HK original new parts and has all of the features of the original.Internals are all full HK including a full-auto bolt group and carrier in case you have a registered full-auto trigger pack.Thread on flash hider.All Vector Arms firearms are built by hand, one at a time, by highly skilled technicians utilizing the best available parts (original and new whenever possible).FYI- These firearms are difficult to photograph and as such the finish sometimes looks weird due to light reflections and such. However, the finish on these guns is amazing (its actually a proprietary ceramic based finish). In my opinion, the Vector finish better than what H&K put on their guns back in the day.This is one very nice and well built firearm.Includes one magazine.This is an extremely limitedÂ custom production firearm.Get this while you can.MSRP $1699You can buy it here:http://shop.redcircletactical.com/manufacturer.vector-arms-1921All Vectors include a 5 year warranty and are built to meticulous standards one rifle at a time.We are an authorized Vector dealer.Â www.vectorarms.comThese sell fast and often so fast that we occasionally deplete our inventory.

If this were a .54cal... Id never let it go. But, alas, my collection does not include .50cal pieces and I just cannot get setup for a whole new caliber.

I was very content when I rust blued mine, but this has been antiqued to an extreme. Very nice form of rust bluing, its lightly pitted, very uniformly across the entire surface, even the end cap and the belt clip are done the same way.
It accents the dull brass and case colored lock very well.

Beyond that the grips has been fully hand checkered on this, the stained finish is not the best but it definitely rounds out the look on this one. Very nice.

Anyhow, I took it on a trade sight unseen thinking it was a .54. So away it goes.

The bore looks good, fairly bright when I shine a light down it. But again, I dont shoot .50 so I dont have any jags or brushes for a .50cal. It looks free of any major rust or pitting. Im sure you can get some dirty patches out of it... but definitely looks like a nice shooter.

I can ship if needed, give me a zip code and Ill give you a price

Straight from the pages of history comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exact speciï¬cations of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction riï¬e comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge. Used by oï¬cers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand riï¬e, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. â nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the âUnited States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1â, its oï¬cial military designation."

The .221 Remington Fireball is a centerfire cartridge created by Remington Arms Company in 1963 as a special round for use in their experimental single-shot bolt-action pistol, the XP-100. Based on a shortened version of the .222 Remington, it is popular as a varmint and small predator round while also finding increasing use among target shooters.
Despite its smaller size, the .221 Fireball is capable of velocities nearly equal to that of the .222 Remington due to its higher SAAMI pressure. The maximum SAAMI pressure level for the .221 Fireball is 52,000 C.U.P. as compared to 46,000 C.U.P. for the .222 Remington."

.58 cal rifle by Ranson of Italy.

Im not sure what to make of it as it is unlike anything Ive seen before.

Its the illegitimate child of a '63 Zouave & an Enfield Musketoon

You can see in the first picture it is much shorter than the Zouave and very much resembles the Enfield. However, the Enfield had a straighter stock and no patchbox.

Anyhow this is a cool little .58 carbine that while it may not get you into the reenactment world... it will be fun to shoot and will take any four legged game in the area. 

This gun has been refinished by a previous owner as well as having Thompson Center fiber optic sights installed. There are some scratches in the finish and the finish on the stock is in good shape. 

The bore is a little dirty but when I shine my light in there its shiny and I cannot see any pitting.

Here is Rev's first TiN barrel that they made. They are a smaller company based on the VA/NC border.  i asked them to make this custom upper for me. It has matching TiN bolt & barrel. It is a 10.5"" contour barrel covered in TiN. They decided to take this idea and make it as their 3 gun upper just with their 18"" instead. I have shot it about 100 rounds and absolutely love it. Unfortunately, I need to part with some of my uppers/parts cause i am wanting to buy a suppressor. Details below.

I do also have a tan full S&W upper seen in the other picture. I'm willing to part with both as a combo if the price is right. The S&W is a 16' 1:9"" twist. Has tan Cerekote (non baked). I also have a 16"" 1:7"" twist standard contour barrel if anyone is interested. I am willing to part with the ACOG on the S&W as well. Just  aheads up, I bought it off a local SWAT company so it has some dents but I sent it to Trijicon after I bought it and they confirmed that it is in perfect working order and up to par for the age of the product in spite the abuse. All extra parts are not included in the $750. The $750 is fairly firm considering this is a fully custom upper but I am willing to entertain possible trades or price negotiations.

The VZ 98/22 was one of the earliest made BRNO series of Mausers, and was of the full length style.  This particular rifle is fairly clean with cosmoline left in the firing pin removal tool (circle in rear of stock) and the bayonet mounting grooves.

I have an Ishapore Enfield 2A1 chambered in 7.62x51. It has a detachable 12 round magazine and is ridiculously soft recoiling. With only a small bit of practice you can crank off all 12 rounds in only slightly more time than you can accurately fire a semi auto thanks to the design of the bolt. The rifle itself is in good shape for it's age, with some shallow marks in the wood that would be easy to refinish for someone with much more skill with wood than I have. The rifle has the standard handling marks, including a 66 marked on the stock from where it was issued. The metal is in great shape with normal wearing on the bluing, and the action is still butter smooth. The bore is mirror smooth, so much so that all my pictures turn out far to glare filled and bright to see. As you should always do, I had a gun smith check the head spacing and the internals of the rifle, and they are in great shape. 120 rounds of 7.62x51 ball ammo will come with the rifle. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED. Thanks."
