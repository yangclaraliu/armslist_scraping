Remington Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) Tactical 300 Blackout rifle. Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC® Blackout®, this new rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price.  A long-time favorite of both military and police units, the Model 700 offers the legendary accuracy and unfailing performance you’ve come to expect.

At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16 ½ -inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle breaks and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed.

The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue® OverMolded® Ghillie™ Green pillar bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington’s X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to “break-like-glass” and set at 3 ½ pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.

Other key features include a drilled and tapped receiver for the addition of optics; distinctive, laser-engraved “300 AAC Blackout 1:7” roll mark; convenient hinged floorplate magazine with 4-round capacity and a non-reflective, black oxide external metal finish; and sling swivel studs.

The Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the perfect tactical bolt-action rifle and available at a very affordable price. Suggested retail price is $817.31. Buy it now $700.00

I also replaced the 30""smooth bore barrel with a 21"" fully rifled barrel, but i sold the 30"" barrel and the original stock and forend. The reason I am selling it is because I am originally from Ohio and thats all we were allowed to use for whitetail gun season.

I purchased both of them just last year and put them on a rifle I was planning on shooting 3 Gun matches with. I have zeroed the rifle with them on but have not shot a match with them and it does not look like I am going to start now so… I am selling them to recover some of the “Impulse Buy” money I have in them. Like I said… They are practically new with one minor scratch on the aluminum housing of the sight. I dropped it putting it in the back of the safe and struck another rifle. It is very small and can easily be covered with a flat black rifle pen but I wanted to wait so anyone who buys it can see how minor it is and not think I am trying to cover something up. 

Both of these sights are still current and sell for $569 for the sight, $549 for the magnifier or $1089 for the set on Amazon. With tax I paid $1155 for both of them. With the minimal use and condition I am asking for $890 for the pair. I am also willing to split the items up if someone wants one but not the other. I am asking $450 for the magnifier and $440 for the sight. That is quite a bit less than I paid for them less than a year ago and I think it’s more than fair price for them considering the condition and the tax savings at a retail establishment. Here is a little more about the items below:

EXPS2-2: The EOTech is the new EXPS2-2 with side buttons. I paid $529 for the sight on Amazon and it currently sells for $569. This sight is not night vision compatible. This model has the side buttons and integrated quick release lever and also has the BDC second red dot at the 500 yard hold point below the original dot. Other than the scratch on the top of the aluminum housing this sight is NEW IN BOX condition. This sight also comes with the original pelican style box.

G23.FTS: The magnifier is a true EOTech 3X sight with an Adams quick release mount. I paid $549 and it currently sells for the same price on Amazon. The Samson mount alone sells for $160. It is in NEW IN BOX condition and I could easily claim it as that. However, I mounted it on the rifle and zeroed it with the sight. This magnifier comes with the original pelican style box and still has the warranty card with it that has not been filled out yet.

If you are interested in the sight and want to mount it to your rifle to make sure it works as described I am open to meeting at a range so you can test it out. I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at them please let me know and I’m sure I can work something out. Thanks for looking."

This 3.4"" threaded barrel is an authentic Walther P22 replacement part and has never been used.  

I recently sold my Walther P22 and all of the accessories/extras that I had for it. However, I still have a replacement barrel and replacement recoil spring that need a good home. Both have never been used and I purchased them just to have as replacement parts. The inside of the barrel is still glossy and free of imperfections that would be visible from any amount of usage. 

The barrel is 100% perfect condition with all Walther proof marks and labeling. Feel free to email me if you would like more pictures. 

INCLUDED FOR FREE: Authentic Walther P22 recoil spring, never used (never even racked the slide with it installed, although happy to test it if you request). Installing it will give you slide behavior similar to when you first started using your P22 when it was new. When I first bought my P22, I heard the spring was prone to losing its elasticity and/or breaking (it has been a while, forgot what the complaint was). I can't remember how I managed to get one, as they are not sold anywhere online, but I now have it as an extra and would like to pass it on to another P22 enthusiast.

I'm not interesting in selling the spring on its own - honestly I have no idea what it's worth so I'm just including it with the barrel.

""Born of gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of Remington's great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, the 887 has no external surfaces to rust. Remington's exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that's barbed wire, gnarly thorns, or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it's time for action, the revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12-gauge feel like a light field load. Featuring a 28"" barrel with a solid rib and a Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable fiber-optic light tubes to maximize visibility for the conditions, the Model 887 Nitro Mag handles 12-gauge 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" loads interchangeably. Like the Model 870, the receiver of the 887 is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged, ensuring strength and longevity.""

Other info: Purchased from Tracy Rifle and Pistols about a year ago. California model with Bullet Button and pinned (non folding) stock from the factory to comply with CA DOJ requirements. (Solar Tactical sells a Kydex wrap if you wish to run this featureless w/o bullet button (not included)). I Put 3 boxes of factory ammo through it (WWB, Federal, and PMC) with no failures. Runs great and very accurate! This rifle wears the Troy sights which means it is a late model version with all the factory revisions. Absolutely nothing wrong with it

Mechanically: 10/10 - Clean after every range session and lube with Slip2000 as recommended by Kriss
Aesthetically: 9.5/10 - Has normal wear from brass bouncing off the ejection port. Only ever shot at the range so this thing never got banged around. Safe queen.

Selling because I just picked up the pistol model which is what I originally wanted.

Comes with everything you see pictured, (1) 10rd glock mag, Kriss CAA Vertical Forward Grip, Kriss Hard Case, Lock"

Beretta makes high capacity mags and there just as common as the glock mags. Since it is so short i had to register it as a hand gun so you will need cpl or purchase permit. $500 firm or possible trade.

2) i have a Mossberg 835 12 guage shotgun. Has a great camo paint job on it. Also has the orange and green fiber optics on it as well. Picture does not give it justice. Beautiful gun. Does come bandalier and the ammo shown with it. 300 or trade.

The extra length of the XL model provides a flatter angle for easier climbing. The extra width gives larger dogs more room and thus more confidence when using the ramp.

Sporting Dog Owners: For use with 4x4 pickups, the extra length in this model is essential!

The unique construction of the XL model gives it the best combination of size, strength and light weight on the market. Even though it's ""oversized"" it still weighs only 18 lbs, and it supports over 300 lbs. It’s also very compact, making it easier to use and store.

It extends from 47"" to 87"" and anywhere in between. Use it fully extended for heights up to 36 inches - SUVs, pickup trucks, grooming tables, etc. Shorten the ramp when space is limited or when the upper surface isn't as high - the Deluxe XL Telescoping Pet Ramp is many ramps in one!

The telescoping design is the secret to making this ramp so easy to use - just slide it out to use and slide it in to stow. No clumsy folding and unfolding required. A high-traction walking surface gives pets a sure footing, especially on steep climbs.

The ramp also includes a convenient carry handle, and safety release latch to prevent accidental opening. The ultra-stiff design utilizes four rubber feet to keep the ramp stable while in use.

Don't risk injury to yourself or your pet! The Deluxe Telescoping Pet Ramp is perfect for all pets that need assistance reaching high places""


USED ONE TIME! Changed trucks and no longer need it.
 It's tough, extended it all the way and climbed it myself to test it. I'm 300 lbs, it's rated much higher. Take a look at the site above

My dogs nails scuffed the non slip material on the ramp, it's going to happen until your dog gets comfy going up it."

Research says it should handle most pistol rounds and several rifle rounds. I use it to check guns for proper firing after I have worked on them. The box is made out of 1/4"" steel.

Here is another site explaining the gun

http://www.guns.com/2013/09/25/remington-2020-smart-scopes-masses/

In short, this rifle uses a digital optics system that allows the user to tag a target and the scope will range it itself, adjust for elevation and tell you the windage so you can adjust that with the buttons on top. Remington claims this rifle can shoot out to 500 yards without a problem and can accurately range out to 750. This system also can hit a target that is running up to 10 miles an hour. The other revolutionary thing with this package is the ability to stream what you see through the scope onto an iPad or iPhone which will alow you or others to see the shot. The scope will also take pictures and record audio and visual of your shot to save for replay. I am selling eveything as a package how it originally came from Remington: The Remington 700 in 30-06 with the trackingpoint scope and the extra batteries and charger inside the custom fit case from Remington. It also came with 300 rounds, 100 of 168 grain, 100 180 grain and 100 rounds of 168 grain Barnes Vor-tx.

Serial number 18385 was made in 1941 and is a DELUXE Pre-War short tang rifle. The change over from long tang to short tang took place gradually around the 17000 serial range. As not very many Model 71's were made after 1942, it is quite difficult to find a Pre-War short tang Deluxe Model 71. The ORIGINAL condition of this rifle is outstanding. Excellent stock and fore end with the Pre-War checkering at 20 lines per inch. Nearly ALL of the original varnish and blue remain with some very light high edge wear and handling marks. Original butt plate, original sights and front sight hood. There are NO extra holes or other non-factory alterations. This 71 was produced just before Winchester started drilling all Model 71's for the side receiver sight. The bore and all mechanics are excellent. It would be a challenge to find another all original Pre-War short tang Deluxe that is better than this one. Includes its original Winchester Deluxe swivels and period leather sling. This is a great Winchester collector and investment rifle. Offered at NO RESERVE. Please look at all the pictures and email any questions or for more pictures."

Serial number 18385 was made in 1941 and is a DELUXE Pre-War short tang rifle. The change over from long tang to short tang took place gradually around the 17000 serial range. As not very many Model 71's were made after 1942, it is quite difficult to find a Pre-War short tang Deluxe Model 71. The ORIGINAL condition of this rifle is outstanding. Excellent stock and fore end with the Pre-War checkering at 20 lines per inch. Nearly ALL of the original varnish and blue remain with some very light high edge wear and handling marks. Original butt plate, original sights and front sight hood. There are NO extra holes or other non-factory alterations. This 71 was produced just before Winchester started drilling all Model 71's for the side receiver sight. The bore and all mechanics are excellent. It would be a challenge to find another all original Pre-War short tang Deluxe that is better than this one. Includes its original Winchester Deluxe swivels and period leather sling. This is a great Winchester collector and investment rifle. Offered at NO RESERVE. Please look at all the pictures and email any questions or for more pictures."

The picture on here is not mine.  I could not get my picture to load, but my pistol is identical to this one. You can call me at 6four1-2nine5-361four or email me through here."

An IDEAL for deep concealment or as a pocket (backup) gun; thanks to its enclosed hammer its not going to be affected by dust or pocket snags (modeled after the S&W Centennial w/enclosed hammer) If you are a collector, you know these don't drop by every day even on Nationwide listings, there are only a 1/2 dozen. It does have the original little case as sold, case is not in great shape, but it will be with the gun. The gun and bore are pristine, with no wear inside or out. Not shot a lot and won't show carry wear at all. Do your research, this is not an everyday find. Not on fire to sell and the price is already reasonable."

There are some scuffs in the paint and small chip in the paint on the stock. The wood doesnt have any chips. I I have a full choke on it because I have lent it out for turkey hunting a few times. I dont have any other chokes for it. The action and barrel are clean. Not much else I can say about it other then its an older shot gun. I figure its worth $200 in the condition its in.

Its solid, ultra-dependable action makes it America’s favorite. If you could throw the lid off every duck blind, you’d probably see more Model 870™ Express® pumps than any other shotgun. It’s been the standard for slide-action performance for more than 50 years. And because it’s a Super Magnum, it handles everything from light 2 3/4"" loads to heavy 3 1/2"" magnums, it’s the standard for versatility as well.  MSRP Starting at $629.
