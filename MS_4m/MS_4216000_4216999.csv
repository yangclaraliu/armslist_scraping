The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

The result was the Super X2, which proved to be every bit as reliable and soft-recoiling as its predecessor. Winchester marketed this as one of the fastest shotguns.

Built to perform in the worst conditions, the reliable Super X2 3 1/2"" action is built to shoot factory field loads from 2 3/4"" (1 1/8 oz.) to heavy 3 1/2"" magnums, thanks to efficient, reliable gas operation. This model also has a back-bored, Invector-Plus ventilated rib barrel with a white bead front sight.

Gun is ultra clean and in great condition, I only fired it at only 3 range visits, not really into 1911's so its up for sale.  It was carried by my brother in law (previous owner), it has some light carry marks on the slide.  Also, it has one white dot missing from the rear site, not sure how that happened, price reflects a discount for that.

Super sweet light double action trigger is amazing, para has patented the LDA action trigger.  Won't find an action like this on any other gun. 

For some reason Armslist will only upload 1 photo, I have about 6 more I can send.  More photos upon request.

This sale includes the actual gun, Sorry, no box.  1 x 7 round magazine and 1 x 8 round magazine for a total of 2 magazines as pictured."

The CZ 75 B is used by more Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol and is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line. The CZ-75B features the short recoil, Browning Hi-Power design tilt barrel with radial locking lugs. Characteristic features of all versions include: all steel construction, fixed sights, a double column magazine, and slide stays open after last cartridge has been fired. The 'B' designation indicates that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.  USPS Money Order or Walmart MoneyGram only. Buyer pays actual shipping cost to lower 48 only.

Here is the description form the manufactures website:

This new and Innovative proprietary design does not mount to the barrel and provides a solid mounting platform for optics and accessories as rugged as the AK-47 itself. Features a beveled front gas tube, new relief cut design, and all mounting hardware use the same diameter hex wrench.

Made in USA using advanced precision manufacturing with Mil-A-8625 Hardcoat Anodized protective finish. Constructed of high-strength aluminum with aerospace alloy gas block insert and heavy duty M4 metric thread fasteners.

Easy installation! Simply replaces standard handguard & gas tube. Instructions & hardware included.

Adds only 4-6 ounces to weapon depending on type of forearm & gas tube replaced.
Only fits standard length AK-47 & AK-74 operating systems with stamped or milled receivers. This model does not fit Yugoslavian or Draco model AK's and does not support .308 or shotgun caliber (variants coming soon). There have been reports of this not fitting the Century C39 - customers have informed us that its gas tube does not conform to a standard length. We have also received reports that this isn't fitting the M&M M10."

Description:

G2X-D

The G2X Pro is a compact yet powerful polymer-body flashlight that uses a high-efficiency LED—virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break—to provide two light output levels: a brilliant, penetrating, perfectly pre-focused 320-lumen beam, and a 15-lumen low-output setting that lets you greatly extend the runtime per set of batteries, an invaluable option when you find yourself miles from civilization. Press the tailcap switch for momentary-on low, press further to click constant-on low, return to off and press or click on again within two seconds for high. The tough Nitrolon® polymer body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. A polycarbonate micro-textured reflector delivers a comparatively wider beam with generous peripheral light. We also make an aerospace aluminum-body version of this light, the 6PX Pro, and a single-output version with a tactical tailcap switch, the G2X Tactical.

Features:

Virtually indestructible LED emitter regulated to maximize light output and runtime
Two output levels—high for maximum light, low for extended runtime
Precision micro-textured reflector creates smooth, optimized beam
Tough polycarbonate window resists impact
Tough Nitrolon® body, anodized aluminum bezel
Dual-output tailcap click switch—press for momentary-on low, click for constant-on low, return to off then press or click again for high
Weatherproof—O-ring and gasket sealed
Includes high-energy 123A batteries with 10-year shelf life

The MSRP from Surefire Tactical is $70.00 plus shipping... Thanks for looking!"

I bought this handgun a few months ago from a friend. This glock has 3 dot night sights with tritium, but are getting a little dim. I do not have an accurate round count as the prior owner never kept track. I have put 200 rounds through it with 0 malfunctions. 2 weeks ago I replaced internal springs including recoil spring assembly, firing pin spring, trigger spring, firing pin safety spring and extractor depressor spring (http://glockparts.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=126610&CAT=3649). I do have the original springs that will come with the gun. Also, at the same time I replaced the magazine springs and followers as the old springs were heavily used. Since the parts were replaced there have been 50 rounds without failure. 

This is a great gun that will last a long time. If you are aware of the glock lineage, you will know that glock changed the finish used on their slides. The finish this gun has is the older style that, in many opinions, is better than the newer finish style.

	Hello Everyone, 
Ive decided of late that I would like to get another Lever gun. I am torn between a 357/38 or a 30/30, but heavily prefer the 357/38 models so if it is for a 30/30 it would have to be a “really great” deal kind of thing. I am open to either (or both) if the price is right and fair. I know what I can order them online for with FFL Fees and shipping, but being that it is tax season I would much rather buy local from someone who wants to sell rather than give the cash elsewhere! The main requirements I have for the gun are this:

-Must be in perfect functional shape
-Must be able to mount a scope on it
-Must be the rifle/carbine configuration (no mares leg models)

	Easiest bet is to shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Or shoot me a message on here if you prefer. The guns can be ugly as sin, so long as they function perfectly. But please don’t price it at ferrari prices for your VW. I have cash and possibly trade items if you are interested in them. Im located in Norman and would need to meet around here if possible. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!
