This pistol was designed by Trey Tenery, Victory Gun & Guitar Works, in Dallas, Texas and is only available at this location. The pistol starts out as a hand selected carbon steel frame and slide. The frame and V-grip are then carefully fitted to the slide and then sent off the Turnbull Restorations for color case hardening treatment. The slide and small parts are meticulously prepared for the high polish blued finish. The small parts, pins, and screws are all even further exhibition polished. The pistol features a flush cut bull barrel with steep reverse crown and a fitted flush plug. The V-grip is a modern upgrade to the “A1” rounded backstrap of the grip. It fills the palm of the hand and increases the contact surface area of grip. The slide stop pin is recessed with bevel in the frame. The front strap has a unique checkering pattern designed by Vic Tibbets, the custom shop manager for Wilson Combat. This design gives plenty of grip, while allowing for the beautiful case hardening to been seek on the frontstrap next to the grips.

The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made. The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots.

2 Colt Gold Cup National Match Pre-Series 70 1911's

Both of these beauties are in good (85%) original condition. They are in great shape considering that they are 47 & 48 years old respectively. They do have an imperfection or two in the blueing.

These pistols are the finest shooters to come off of a production line from Colt. They have tight tolerances and light, crisp triggers. These are the ones fitted by hand by Colt gunsmiths and they will give any 1911 on the past/current market a run for it's money with quality and accuracy! I love these weapons and would like to see these two make it to a nice home where they will be properly shot and exercised as they were meant to be.

These two do not have boxes and will come with 1 Colt 7 or 8 round mag (not original)."

I have decided not to hunt, so I need to find a new home for this really nice rifle-scope combination. CZ shipped the rifle with a single magazine, and they had stopped providing scope rings at the time of my purchase. I did my research and bought some nice Warne rings to mount the Leupold scope, bought a Scopecoat cover, plus an extra CZ magazine. Together, these items add well over $250 to the value of the rifle combo offered here.
Please inspect the photos carefully, they are an essential part of the description for this very nice CZ rifle-scope combination. I will answer questions promptly and/or supply additional photos of any part or angle of interest, but please ask only if you are serious about the firearm.

The rifle was represented to me as ‘unfired’ when I bought it from a local collector, but all armory-refurbished rifles were undoubtedly fired at some point. That said, the bolt face, barrel, crown, bayonet, etc. are all in great condition with no obvious evidence that this rifle has been shot. The previous owner removed the Russian armory cosmoline (thankfully). I have not shot this SKS, but everything appears to operate correctly, and I am confident that it will function perfectly whenever the next owner shoots it. The 1954 Tula’s have a chrome-lined barrel, and these Russian SKS are essentially the gold standard. The rifle comes with the full KBI retail package, including an ammo pouch, stripper clips, oil bottle and storage pouch, butt-plate tool kit, rifle sling, and manual. Stamped numbers match throughout, although the Arctic Birch (Russian Birch) rifle stock has the original serial number ‘X’ed through and a re-arsenal ‘box-and-slash’ stamp is visible. I installed a dark earth Tapco ‘tactical’ stock on this SKS a few months ago when I planned to keep and shoot it, but I recently got another 7.62x39 rifle, so this fine SKS package needs a new home. Upon request, I will provide the original package for the Tapco stock in case the new owner wants to remove and store the ‘tactical’ stock and re-install the original Russian wood stock. Please inspect the photos carefully, they are an essential part of the description for this very nice Tula Arsenal SKS. I will answer questions promptly and/or supply additional photos of any part or angle of interest, but please ask only if you are serious about the firearm."

Serial number places its manufacture in 1985, I believe. I think the Security Six family of revolvers were manufactured from the early '70s till about 1988. 

This is a 4"" barrel, six shot, stainless .357 Magnum. It has fixed sights: front ramp and rear frame channel. 

It comes with 5 pairs of grips as seen in the picture. Pachmayr, Hogue, large wooden, and two small pairs of wooden (don't know why previous owner had 2 pairs of the small wooden). In any event, you are set on grips, I should say. 

Also comes with original box, 2 speed loaders, a dual speed loader pouch for a duty belt, and 2 boxes of ammo: Hornady 125gr FTX hollow points (25 rds) and Fiocchi 142gr range ammo (50 rds). No picture on the speed loaders and pouch, sorry. 

It is ridiculous how easy this gun disassembles. You take off the grips, then the main trigger spring pops out, then the hammer, then the main trigger assembly comes off the frame. I watched one YouTube video and took this thing apart in 90 seconds for cleaning. 

I would say this is a 90-95% gun. Very clean, metal looks great. Trigger is smooth in double action and super sweet single action - light crisp break at about 3.5 lbs. Cylinder lockup is tight and rifling and crown look great. 

In the market for a 4"" stainless, .357 Magnum beauty? This is a solid Ruger, capable of firing the hottest .357 full-house ammo without worrying. Built like a tank. 

Asking $490. Will not ship. Cash only. Will only drive to meet if a reasonable distance.

Many people may not know that today FN actually owns the likes of Winchester and Browning. FN's relationship with Browning goes back over a hundred years and spawned the venerable Hi-Power pistol. FN took up U.S. residence back in 1982 when it won a contract to manufacture automatic weapons for the U.S. military, building a manufacturing plant in Columbia, South Carolina. A few years later FN established a commercial foothold in the U.S. when it acquired its US partner, Browning. In 1998 FN became its own U.S. commercial presence when it established FNH-USA in McLean, Virginia.

So, it's no surprise that FN's new polymer handgun was actually first introduced in 2003 and marketed by Browning as their Browning PRO model. In 2006 the gun was re-introduced by FNH-USA as the FNH FNP.

It runs great, about 3,000 miles ago i cleaned the carb, put new Bikemaster chain and sprockets on it, and replaced all 4 blinkers, i change the oil every 1,000-1,500 miles. 1,000 miles ago it got a new battery, new front tire, new fork oil and seals, a radio/mp3 system, and soft saddlebags.

 When i bought this bike it had a small dent on each side of the tank (pictured), i layed over at about 15 MPH 500 miles ago causing some scratches on the exhaust and breaking off the rear right blinker which i taped on and has held fine (pictured). There's some cracking on the seat that i have covered most of (pictured). 

So there is some cosmetic damage to the bike but it runs and functions great! Clean title, 17,385 miles, these bikes are known for being practically bulletproof. Would make a great christmas present!
