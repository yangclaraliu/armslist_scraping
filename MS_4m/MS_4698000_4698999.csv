features of this lightweight, semi-automatic rifle include a heavy barrel with chrome lining in both bore and chamber for optimum durability and accuracy. The barrel, and all steel components are manganese phosphate coated for complete protection against exterior corrosion or rust. The latest M16A2 rear sight system is incorporated offering dual flip up apertures: the short range aperture (0-200 meters) has a larger opening for greater light gathering as well as better moving target visibility; the smaller aperture is designed for maximum accuracy at longer ranges. Knobs adjust the sight for windage and elevation the elevation knob is graduated from 300 to 800 meters so that range adjustments may be made without the need to compensate for bullet drop. The receivers, of 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum, are precision machined from forging for maximum strength. The upper receiver includes an integral cartridge case deflector and a last round bolt hold open feature to alert the shooter of an empty magazine. The ribbed front hand guard offers increased control and heat dissipation and is molded of polymer thermoset composite.  20"" chrome lined heavy barrel."

This is a non matching numbers rifle in a nice condition with clean bore and very good rifling .
These have never been used in a war and are very popular for hunting and long range shooting due to superior quality and
a caliber/load that gives a flatter trajectory line.

Local pick up in 34266 Arcadia or shipping to your FFL outside of Florida possible for about 60 bucks, that includes my fees for my FFL and shipping from FFL to FFL.

I do not want to travel since buyers tend to not show up without notice.
Pick up here gives you the opportunity to test fire it right on my property!

Will consider a trade for a .22lr, or .9mm, or 5.56 tactical semi auto rifle.

The PCR is near identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

Target model. All information will be found as you research the firearm. 2x10 round magazines.

Though mine is a tad different from most. I have a relatively inexpensive 2-7 scout scope mounted on mine, and it has served incredibly well due to the light recoil of .22. Holds zero well, even if the scope is removed and put back. I'm able to hit quarter sized groups at 25 yards, a rest, and quality ammo. Will come with the single point sling that's mounted securely on the ring stud, since holsters for scoped pistols are hard to find/pricy.

At some point in time, I realized that I didn't need to carry ""The Survival Rifle"" of some semi-auto .22 rifle. Even take down models are bulkier than even a scoped pistol, and that's without the rifle having a scope. Unless you're a horrible stalker, anyone can get within 50 yards of small game, and that's easily scoped pistol range. No need to carry something that I don't need. 
But that's just my thought process.


I'm moving to a state that requires firearms to be registered, and I figured that I can live without this one while I'm there.
Thanks for your time."

I bought this from a guy who puts together rifles under the impression that I would like the AR-308 rifle but I still prefer my bolt 308. I have shot a handful of rounds through the rifle and would rather the simpler bolt action counterpart. I did have a failure to feed and fire due to a lack of gun lube. The rifle is in great condition with it being painted from the previous owner. There is a gouge in the finish on the upper but it only cosmetic. Here is a list of the parts.

SOLD $120 - Savage Factory .308 DBM (detachable box magazine) systems, blued – has the metal release lever (not the cheap plastic one from later package rifles), the magazine, and the trigger guard. I will include the front and rear action screw, so it should bolt right in. Works with all the .308 sized cartridges (.243 Win, .260 Rem, 7-08, .308 Win, .338 Fed and should also work with the Creedmoor cartridges)
$135 - Savage Factory 7mm Magnum DBM (detachable box magazine) system, blued - has the metal release lever (not the cheap plastic one from later package rifles), the magazine, and the trigger guard. I will include the front and rear action screw, so it should bolt right in. This will work with all the 300 Winchester Magnum class belted cartridges (.264 Win Mag, 7mm Rem Mag, .300 Win Mag, .338 Win Mag).
SOLD $5 – Savage Factory Bolt Handles, blued (2) – nothing special or tactical, but if you need one or need an extra, here they are.
$20 – Savage Factory Short Action Stock, black synthetic, 4.4” spacing, side release, sporter contour, center-feed blind magazine – includes a plastic trigger guard and .308 class magazine box
$30 – Savage Factory Long Action Stock, black synthetic, 5.062” spacing, side release, sporter contour, center-feed detachable magazine – includes trigger guard screwSOLD $110 – Boyd’s Prairie Hunter Stock, short action for Hog Hunter, Pepper laminate, 4.4”, side release, varmint/heavy contour, center-feed blind magazine
SOLD $500 – McMillan A-5 Stock, black fiberglass, 4.4” spacing, side bolt release, varmint/heavy contour, detachable magazine inlet – this could be made to easily work with a factory Savage bottom metal or inlet slightly to work with Accurate-Mag, CDI, or Pacific Tool and Gauge options. This is a take-off from a 10FCP McMillan I recently purchased and is essentially in brand new condition.
SOLD $50 – Savage Factory 7mm Remington Magnum barrel, 22”, magnum contour, blued – appears to be very low round count – it was obviously off a hunting rifle that didn’t get shot much. Very good condition, nearly brand new bore.
SOLD $200 – Savage Factory .308 Winchester barrel, 24”, varmint contour, threaded 5/8”-24 and fitted with a muzzle brake from Harris Precision in Stayton, OR – previous owner verified round count of less than 300. The finish is the flat finish used on Savage’s higher end models, the brake is stainless. Avoid the cost of threading your barrel. The muzzle brake will likely time up to your action just fine since but may need a slight tweak.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I know pic isn't great but I wanted to show the superficial marring on slide. It is similar on the other side as well because of the holster. this gun has never been dropped or mishandled and I have cleaned it every time I have shot it. 
Also, I preferred an on target sight picture as opposed to aiming right under the target, which is what the 
standard hight sights did. so I have a tall front fin that brings it to shoot directly on target . I'll throw in the original height front fin night sight in case you want the factory aim under style of shooting.

I have also notched the safety so you can hold The bolt open. The furniture has been upgraded to the new Magpul Zhukov kit in FDE, and the side folder is not only very comfortable but the gun is still operational with the stock folded. Grip is Magpul as well. I have also added two rail sections, one on the bottom and one on the left side that is currently hosting a Magpul QD mount. Also included is the NcStar scope mount and BSA 1-4x24 scope. The trigger is a G2 that has been polished and smoothed. It has very little take up, a really crisp smooth break, and the reset is awesome. Muzzle break is a Tapco birdcage style. The vertical grip is not included, I'm keeping that. Rifle comes with 4 mags, bayonet and scabbard, and a decent molle coyote tan mag pouch (holds 3 ak mags and 3 pistol mags).
