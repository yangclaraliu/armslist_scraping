Rebate is redeemed directly through LWRC.The rebate form can be found at https://lwrci.com/support/forms/aimpointform.pdfThe unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper (not included). The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.Manufacturer: LWRCModel: REPRAction: Semi-automaticType: ARCaliber: 762NATOBarrel Length: 16"" Spiral FlutedFinish/Color: BlackGrips/Stock: SOPMODAccessories: Four Rail HandguardType of Barrel: Hammer ForgedCapacity: 20RdManufacturer Part #: REPRR7BF16"

It utilizes a simple, patented, no-tools mounting system that slips over most NATO weapon 5.56mm flash hiders. There is no need for proprietary mounts or modifications to the barrel. It may be swapped between many different weapons easily, including the M16, M4, HK416, and M249. HALO's have earned a reputation as a product of exceptional quality at an absolutely fair price. Welded construction alone isn't enough – the HALO is a fully welded inconel and stainless suppressor core encased in a stainless shell for double-walled security and impressive longevity. If you break things for a living, this is durable enough to be your can. Birthed for battle, the HALO has proven itself in conflicts around the globe. As technology has advanced, the combat-proven HALO has been improved by trimming weight and length while retaining the same excellent dB and flash reduction.The patented mounting system utilizes the 22 mm standard NATO-specification bird-cage type flash hider as used by the military worldwide. Mounting or removal can be performed without the use of tools in less than 30 seconds.The suppressor comes with detailed instructions for installation and use. It also includes a peel washer for remounting of the AR15/M16 flash hider should the original flash hider be mounted with a crush washer.Caliber: 5.56mm NATO / .223Sound Reduction: 29 dBLength: 7.25""Diameter: 1.5""Weight: 21.8 oz.Materials: Stainless Steel & InconelFinish: Matte Black Cerakote with Reduced Visual-IR SignatureMount: 5.56x45 Universal, Fits A1/A2 NATO flash hiders, includes shim kitFor Barrels: 10.3"" or LongerPrice: $750.00"

The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication of craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include:Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracyOptimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-useClean, long stroke gas piston operation5.56 NATO detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steelOptional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left-hand bolts for 5.56 NATO.

For sale are eight(8) factory Ruger Mini 14 magazines, 20 rounds each, .223/5.56mm. Blued finish. These are like new condition--some were very lightly used, others are unused. No factory packaging--they were lightly oiled, placed in zip-lock bags, and stowed in the bottom of my safe.

I no longer own a Mini 14.

These were purchased prior to, during, and subsequent to the 1994 Assault Rifle Ban. Several are marked ""For law enforcement and government use only"" and bear specific reference to the expired law. Those will in fact probably be collector's items at some point in the distant future.

There are no issues with any of them.

Price is firm at $200 cash. 

Please, do NOT spam me with mindless e-mails asking for pictures of something that you do not intend to buy, haggling about price, or offering trades when I have twice in this ad said ""no"". They look like what they are--Mini 14 factory 20 round mags with Ruger markings. Blued.

DA/SA.  ~300rds fired through it. Fine shooter but I prefer the 226 ergonomics. Manufacture date on box is 10/10/2012. A small quantity of these pistols with the blued German rolled carbon steel slide were released after Sig discontinued the P228 to the civilian market and before the commercial M11-A1 was introduced. 

The story goes these were overruns for a U.S DOD order. However, this is NOT an official M11, there are no govt. stampings. Slide is marked Made in Germany with no serial #. Alloy anodized frame marked Exeter NH serial number AJU prefix. No visible wear on outside of slide, bluing wear on slide internals is minimal & consistent with what little use it has seen. 

Comes in original case with factory installed SIGLITE® Night Sights, two original mags, manual and factory tube of mil-tec TW-25B. This is not one of the beat up '90's LEO P228's you may find in the gun shop or elsewhere. The only difference between this firearm and a true military M11 is lack of govt stamping. Price is somewhat negotiable. Asking $740.00 OBO. If you know Sigs you know this wont last! 

I am a private seller not an FFL dealer. All transfers must be made in accordance with federal and local laws. I will accept certified checks, cashiers checks or cash if you are local. Price does not cover shipping. (Usually about $30.00 or so)

I believe that this is a Type 99 rifle but my knowledge of Japanese rifles is limited.  Everything is functional on this weapon to the best of my knowledge and there is still a bit of cosmoline or heavy protective grease on it.  The rifle is unmodified and has an intact chrysanthanum.  The chrysanthanum (Imperial Ownership Seal) on many rifles of this era were filed off or otherwise defaced prior to surrender because it was an indicator that the rifle was owned by the Emperor.  After the surrender of the weapon it was no longer the Emperor's property and the seal was thus removed.  An additional story is it was done based on General Douglass McArthur's orders but historians differ on which story is correct.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.Manufacturer: Kel-Tec Model: P-3ATCaliber: .380 AutoBarrel: 2.75""Capacity: 6+1 rounds"

The rifle was built for Portugal by Styer in lieu of the short-lived M1885 Portuguese Guedes-Castro, an elegant, well made single shot rifle (never actually adopted by Portugal but used in combat extensively by the Boers in South Africa against the British) competing in the age of repeaters.  The Portuguese Kroptchek however did retain basically the same cartridge as the Guedes, a sharply bottle-necked 8mm black-power round.  The black powder loading was phased out when smokeless powder bacame available to Portugal in 1896.  The sights on the modified rifles are altered to give a maximum range of 2,200 meters.    This magazine system is utilized in the M1878 French Kropatschek Marine rifles, the M1884 French Kropatschek Infantry rifles,  and was utilized as the magazine system for the well known M1886 Lebel (the first military rifle specifically built for smokeless powder.

None of the finish remaining but still very nice.  
Comes with one, thirteen (13) round magazine.
All serial numbers matching.
No Chinese markings.  Manufactured for the Chinese contract, but was never delivered due to the lack of markings.  Because China didn't pay their bills back then, the Inglis Company did not deliver guns that were not paid for.  
Very rare piece for you to enjoy.

755,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4373755,For Sale:  (NEW) Huntertown Arms Kestrel 7.62 AK,"Howell, Michigan, United States",$ 499,"Listed On: Sunday, January 10, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"GREAT DEALS SELL QUICKLY, CHECK HERE FOR AVAILABILITY OR TO PURCHASE>(NEW) Huntertown Arms Kestrel 7.62 AKHuntertown Arms Kestrel 7.62 AKPurpose-built for the AK platform, the Kestrel 7.62 AK is designed specifically for short cartridge 7.62 rounds.SuppressionThe Kestrel 7.62 AK had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor for the AK platform that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.MaintenanceCleaning the Kestrel 7.62 AK is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors.With the Kestrel 7.62 AK full user servicability is truely a reality.The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel will allow up to five times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.SafetyThe Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.SpecificationsCaliber: 7.62x39Overall Length: 6.5 inchesDiameter: 1.5 inchesWeight: 18.5 ounces (includes mount)Core Material: Stainless steelTube Material: TitaniumRegistered Part Material: Stainless steelFinish: Black Moly Resin"

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.Manufacturer: Kel-Tec Model: P-3ATCaliber: .380 AutoBarrel: 2.75""Capacity: 6+1 rounds"

Protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A
