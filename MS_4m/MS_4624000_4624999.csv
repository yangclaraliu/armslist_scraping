Hello everyone and thanks for taking the time to view my listing. This Remington 700 .308 has been my baby for about a year now and is the most accurate rifle I have ever fired. I have tested it at 100yds and it will easily shoot 1/4MOA. The HS Precision fully adjustable stock was $685 by itself. This was my first time using the HS Precision company and I am very pleased with the results. Recoil is minimized to almost nothing. Of course, the heavy threaded bull barrel also helps with recoil as well. The flash suppressor really makes it look mean and does its job well. The glorious Timney Trigger is set to a solid 2.5lbs and is incredibly crisp. The tactical bolt knob is phenomenal and the bolt has been polished by hand to be as smooth as you can imagine. The bipod compliments everything very well and I believe it is a Harris. I have purchased several bipods over the past year for several of my guns and this one just has the part number on it. All of the bipods that Ive bought for each of my guns have been around $100, so it isn't a cheap one either way. I'm also including my Vortex Viper 6x24-50 First Focal Plane PST illuminated Scope. Its already dialed in and I just feel like it belongs on the gun since its dead on accurate. I bought it new for over $1,500. I should also mention that there are no blemishes on the gun and it is basically flawless. I have babied it and it still looks new. It has only had around 100 rounds fired through it total. I have over $2500 in the gun including the scope. Im willing to sell for less than what I have in it and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you will be very pleased with this 700"

AR500 Armor® Level III Body Armor is manufactured from an extremely rugged ballistic grade steel core and coated with our PAXCON (a division of Line-X) spall and fragmentation protective coating. Our ballistic steel plate is unmatched in the industry and is formulated and treated specifically to our specifications for improved consistency, durability, and then tested to NIJ standards. Our ballistic plate core is stress fracture resistant, features an ultra-low profile ballistic core of only 0.26”, and is designed to handle extreme abuse in day to day use, training, and less than ideal storage conditions. AR500 Armor® body armor will outlast alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic, Dyneema, UHMWPE, and raw/uncoated steel trauma plates.

Level III Rating: AR500 Armor® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-hit capable. Designed to defeat rifle threats up to 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,780 feet per second and all pistol calibers.

AR500 Armor® 6” x 8” side armor plates provide light weight and ultra slim rifle threat protection to the sides of your plate carrier.

Our 6” x 8” side plates are thinner than Ceramic and other comparable side plates, and are on par with the profile of soft inserts but with increased rifle threat protection. Improve ergonomics and comfort by having less interference from your side plates with our AR500 Armor® 6” x 8” side plates. These will fit in standard plate pockets that are capable of accepting 6” x 6”, 6” x 8”, and 8” x 8” side armor plates. The orientation on the 6” x 8” side plate armor is intended to be worn with the 8” side vertical.

Hello everyone and thanks for taking the time to view my listing. This Remington 700 .308 has been my baby for about a year now and is the most accurate rifle I have ever fired. I have tested it at 100yds and it will easily shoot 1/4MOA. The HS Precision fully adjustable stock was $685 by itself. This was my first time using the HS Precision company and I am very pleased with the results. Recoil is minimized to almost nothing. Of course, the heavy threaded bull barrel also helps with recoil as well. The flash suppressor really makes it look mean and does its job well. The glorious Timney Trigger is set to a solid 2.5lbs and is incredibly crisp. The tactical bolt knob is phenomenal and the bolt has been polished by hand to be as smooth as you can imagine. The bipod compliments everything very well and I believe it is a Harris. I have purchased several bipods over the past year for several of my guns and this one just has the part number on it. All of the bipods that Ive bought for each of my guns have been around $100, so it isn't a cheap one either way. I'm also including my Vortex Viper 6x24-50 First Focal Plane PST illuminated Scope. Its already dialed in and I just feel like it belongs on the gun since its dead on accurate. I bought it new for over $1,000. I should also mention that there are no blemishes on the gun and it is basically flawless. I have babied it and it still looks new."

The Desert Eagle has been immortalized in movies and video games, probably because of its instantly recognizable shape and massive, rapid-fire power. Whatever the reason, the Desert Eagle has a reputation as a seriously respected handgun.

The Desert Eagle is a True ""Hand Cannon""

In a class by itself, the Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated mechanism normally found in rifles. Lesser semi-automatic pistols use a short recoil or blow-back design.

With a rotating artillery-style bolt like the M-16 and a reliable, recoil-absorbing gas system like the Mini-14, the Desert Eagle is strong enough to handle the stoutest loads you’ll want to feed it.

For All Its Massive Power, The Desert Eagle Handles Like a Pussycat

It’s a BIG pussycat for sure, but the recoil is surprisingly manageable and controllable. The massive rotating bolt with its reliable gas operation smooths out recoil, and the large and ideally sculpted grip and generous top tang helps direct recoil forces straight back instead of whipping upward and to the left like most magnum revolvers do. This makes muzzle rise minimal and follow-up shots quick, easy, and accurate.

Two Guns in One – A Rare Find

This Desert Eagle has an uncommon bonus. The .44 is the highly desirable early Israeli made IMI model WITH an extra scoped .357 barrel assembly. The extra scoped .357 top end allows quick, easy caliber interchangeability. In other words, it is essentially ""two guns in one.""

The pistol is a .44 Remington magnum early (small safety lever) Mark VII in bright nickel finish. It has been fitted with a MK VII adjustable trigger and IMI Desert Eagle Rubber grips made by Hogue. It is powerful, accurate, reliable, and fun to shoot.

The .357 top end (barrel, slide, bolt, recoil springs and guides) is an Israeli-made Mark VII type in black, fitted with a Bushnell Phantom 1.3x scope on custom mounts. It has been shot little and is wickedly accurate.

This package includes:
·         IMI Desert Eagle MK VII Bright Nickel finish in .44 magnum with IMI adjustable trigger and IMI (Hogue) rubber grips
·         1 Nickel .44 magnum 8 round magazine
·         3 Black .44 magnum 8 round magazines
·         IMI Desert Eagle MK VII Black .357 top end assembly
·         4 black .357 9 round magazines
·         Original IMI MK I non-adjustable trigger group
·         Original IMI Desert Eagle one-piece hard grips
·         Bushnell Phantom 1.3x scope on custom mounts. (Mounted to the .357 top end)
·         IMI Desert Eagle marked Cordura belt holster
·         Cordura / nylon tactical thigh rig holster
·         IMI cleaning / maintenance tool

Everything is in excellent condition – no scratches or scars. It was my steel plate gun and was only ever used at range competitions.

As you know, this is a gas-operated, rotating bolt pistol – it has the strength of a rifle action. While it will handle the stoutest loads that you can find, I have always loaded it moderately, for accuracy. Neither the .44 or the .357 barrels have ever seen a non-jacketed or cast bullet – the gas systems are clean! The polygon rifling increases velocity and accuracy and is easy to keep clean.

You get 2 guns in one --- a .44 and a .357 ---,8 mags, scope and mount, spare trigger and grips, tool, and 2 holsters – WOW! The entire package is only $2300.

Go ahead and price out the individual components – you’ll see that this is a very good deal!

I will consider trade offers for a 1995 or newer full-size extended cab pickup truck in very good condition – but no “monster truck” or race truck mods please."

GLOCK 43 9mm 6+1 Rd - NIB

The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.

Looking for $600 cash or best cash offer. If you consider the ammo, magazines and the handgun itself that a pretty sweet deal.

Would consider partial trade on wood stocked Mossberg 500 12 ga plus $350 cash or best offer.

Thanks for looking!"

The XD series set the new industry standard for ergonomic comfort, ease of operation, features and performance.Pick up an XD and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how natural it feels. Whether you reach for a Full Size, a Compact or a Sub-Compact, the first thing you’ll notice is how it nestles perfectly in your hand. Next, discover the ease with which you can acquire your target. Because it uses the same perfect grip angle as John Moses Browning’s proven 1911, the XD points effortlessly and naturally.XD’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. The fully supported ramped barrel and rugged Melonite or stainless steel finish will keep your XD running round after round. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness.Whether you’re a new shooter or a seasoned pro, you’ll find that the XD series stands out from the competition. Get your hands on an XD today, and experience what a polymer pistol should be.If you're looking for a pistol to carry  and you want something that delivers uncompromising firepower and unusual capacity, look no farther than the XD 4"" Compact. The XD 4"" Compact has the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make the XD easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated big-bore (.45 ACP) package. The XD 4"" Compact has a four inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of X-Tension magazines, the XD 4"" Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension magazine, and you have a 13 round full-sized .45 ACP pistol. Use the flush-fitting 10 round magazine, and you have a Compact. Of course, the XD 4"" Compact has all the features that make Springfield's XD's easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD 4"" Compact that you're used to with every other XD.If you want a gun for your inside-the-waistband holster and a gun for your range bag, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD 4"" Compact. You'll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It's two guns in one.SpecificationsCaliber: 45 ACPRecoil System: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSights: Dovetail Front and Rear (Steel) 3-DotWeight (with Empty Magazine): 29 ozs w/ Compact Mag, 30 ozs w/ X-TensionHeight: 5"" w/ Compact Mag, 5.75"" w/ X-TensionSlide: Forged Steel, Melonite FinishBarrel: 4"" Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite / 1:16 TwistLength: 7.3""Grip Width: 1.22""Frame: Black PolymerMagazines: 1-10 Round Compact, 1-13 Round w/ X-Tension, Stainless Steel"

The unique design of the spring loaded rear sight, ensures constant battery action and repeat zero. The sight is held in the locked down position by a quick release lever, that prevents the sight from being accidentally engaged, but is as fast as a trigger to release even with arctic mittens. Flip up rear sight uses the standard A2 rear sight apertures. The initial elevation zero utilizes the standard M16/M4 front sight bead. Other type rear iron fold-down sights require the shooter to push it into position, which means they can be accidentally knocked down at the worst time. The A.R.M.S. spring loaded flip-up sights never let you down, because they're designed to always be there even when going thru brush or being dropped.

The democrats always file a law suit when republicans try to do the right thing for our country and state. Example is every time we try to log our timber.........they file a suit and tie it up in court for years. If we try to hunt or fish which is our right, they file another suit. And they do this every single time! This would have worked perfectly for this situation for a law suit to stop these idiots from passing SB941.  Why didnt Oregon gun dealers do this? Are they now traitors like the Democrats? I see a very bad future for gun shops as guns slowly become a thing of the past. People will just say to heck with it and stop buying guns all together. Who wants to buy a gun that you have a hard time selling later or giving as a gift etc. Now that SB941 has passed, the only way to get rid of it is to get rid of moron democrats who keep dirtying up our state capital building for the last 28 years. Oregon has been going downhill ever since the 1980's since the Clintons let enviromentalists take over our country and our state. And some of you want to put them in office again!!!  A law suit is needed. Or maybe.....we all need to tell the gun rights groups that we will quit the group if they are just going to sit on their butts and DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Like they did, to make sure this did not pass. If a moron from New York can help pass it, then the gun rights groups could have stopped it.
What is STRONGLY needed in Oregon and every other BLUE state, is to get rid of the damn state electorial vote. What an outdated stupid idea. We need to use each county, counted as 1 vote, not a district! If we had 36 votes, one for each county, the dems would only get about 2 votes. The other 34 of us who actually love this state would get the vote we really want, including Governor and the next President. This would show how the REAL Americans who belong here actually want to vote in our state as well as a lot of other states. This crap of Communist, free hand outs for all, and terrorist safe haven Portland and Eugene always winning the votes in our state, are not how real Oregonians feel!  Those cities are filled with the commy's and illegals who only vote for free handouts, given by Democrats. Who by the way are not even allowed to vote, as many are not U.S. citizens."

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comAIMPOINT COMP M4 RED DOT SIGHT M68 CCOThe CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army’s M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The CompM4 is the finest sight that Aimpoint has ever produced. Improvements include improved energy efficiency that provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! The CompM4 incorporates an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems. The CompM4 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility.The performance of the CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint’s unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 is ready for use around the clock.Unique features  Compatible with every generation of Night Vision Devices (NVD) Super ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery. Seven night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settingsr QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation, and lessen the chance of becoming snagged on other gear. Mount base is “keyed” into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil. Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring is required. 500,000 hours of use on NVD setting 2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement Matches perfectly with Aimpoint 3X Magnifier. Unequalled light transmission. Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash® anti-reflective device. Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters) Vertical spacer included Standardized as the US Army’s new M68CCO Improved adjustment caps are easier to remove, and are protected against impact.

Pristine Condition Heckler &

safety / decocker, two 12 round magazines,
Shocklock Model 10000-PTR-4 Firearm Lock, and
HK Case. The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol
gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to
that of the finest custom made handguns — yet
exceeds the most stringent operational
requirements ever demanded of a combat
handgun. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy
without the need for hand-fitted parts common in
custom-built match pistols costing thousands of
dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested
handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project
originated in 1991 when HK began development
for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the
organization that directs the activities of
America’s most elite military units, including the
Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May
1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered
to the U.S. Special Operations Command for
operational deployment, making the MK 23 the
first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American
military service since the venerable Government
Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met
the most stringent operational and accuracy
requirements ever demanded of a combat
handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a
service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P
ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement,
the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of
2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS)
with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All
pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average
of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test
firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters,
MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government
requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65
groups of less than one inch. There were four
groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through
the same hole!."

Many were customized after purchase by Police Officers and Security Officers alike. They favored the Black Rear Target Sights which prompted S&W to make that change in production a few short years after it's release. Some say it was possibly because the hardness of the stainless steel was to rough on the tooling required to make them.

Born from the very popular Model 19 it shares the exact same features with the exception that it is made with Stainless Steel. This very popular model has been made since 1970 and continues to be produced today which signifies it popularity and success.

With the Micro T-1, Aimpoint has introduced an aiming system that provides the performance of our full-sized sights in the smallest package possible. Built to offer the same battle proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on Rifles, Carbines, Shotguns, Submachineguns and Handguns, the Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be “piggybacked” on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision comptability.The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint’s unique band-pass coating on the reflective lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness, while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD.

These kits are from Finland world war 2 era. have all the parts to build a complete gun as well as another just need to order a mag well parts kit. The other kit is just the bolt/spring lower receiver. If you were to buy all this online it would be close to 600 bucks.
These little 9mm carbines / smg's are going to be a very good investment for the future. Many states are banning parts kits so get them while you still can. Check your local laws all states are different. These kits are legal to send in the mail WITH OUT a FFL. Transfere due to the upper receivers needing to be cut with a dremel tool. I will post pictures soon. Please check all the laws I only go the legal route.

The Ruger® 10/22® is one of the most popular, and widely used Rimfire Rifles in the US. And justifiably so—the 10/22 has had a solid reputation for reliability and accuracy for over 50 years, making it a favorite for target shooting, plinking, and small game hunting. The lightweight 10/22 Semi-Auto Rimfire Rifle handles incredibly well by adult and youth shooters alike. The popularity of the Ruger 10/22 has led to a myriad of after-market 10/22 accessories, making it one of the most customizable firearms ever made. The Ruger 10/22 Carbine is an indispensible, go-to firearm for any American serious about shooting, training, self-defense, or hunting. Made in USA."
