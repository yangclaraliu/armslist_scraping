The Signature Compact Model features many of the Signature Series attributes such as a proprietary thinned frame and mainspring housing that are scalloped to provide a positive grip without the abrasion some people feel from checkering. The grips are a unique pattern of G10 that are thinned to make concealed carry even easier and feature a relieved area on the side to allow easy access to the magazine release. Add to that the soft shooting 9mm caliber and you have an ideal carry gun.

The specially designed barrel/bushing combination make for an easy take-down without the use of any special tools.

Just like all manufactured Nighthawk Custom handguns, the Signature Series Compact features our ultra hi-cut frame that allow shooters with larger or gloved hands to get a full grip while shooting. It also allows a more natural point-of-aim when you extend your arm since your hand goes up into the frame much further.

Mainly looking for lighter weight AR with fixed FSB and magpul polymer handguard.

For sale is an AR-15 made up of a YHM upper, handguard, and barrel, on an Anderson lower. It has a 16 inch barrel with a 1:8 twist, to handle a wider range of ammo. Has a YHM bcg, properly staked and in great shape. Shoots great, does not malfunction, and has been kept well cleaned and lubed. The YHM quad rail is about 12 inches long, and is free floated. The rifle weighs about 8.5 lbs unloaded. The buffer tube and both stocks are commercial-spec. I have fired about 400 rounds through it since I purchased it, and it works great, even eats up steel cased ammo like it's candy and asks for more. I am not willing to split up the parts. There is a good amount of money in parts and the lot will all be sold together. The list of all the parts included are as follows:

Magpul XTM handstop kit (pictured)
Magpul XTM enhanced rail covers x4 (pictured)
Magpul MBUS Pro steel flip up sights (pictured)
Magpul ACS carbine stock (pictured)
Magpul 30 round Pmag (pictured)
Magpul MOE+ grip (pictured)
Allen tactical one point sling (pictured)
Ambidextrous sling attachment receiver end plate (pictured)

FDE off-brand angled foregrip (not pictured)
FDE standard AR collapsible stock (not pictured)
Brown NCSTAR red dot sight with cantilever mount (not pictured)

The off-brand angled foregrip and red dot came with the rifle when I bought it. The previous owner had painted them brown. On the Angled Foregrip and stock, I took paint thinner and wire brush and scrubbed 80% of the paint off leaving it about 80% FDE with about 20% brown paint I couldn't / didn't care to remove. The red dot seems to function fine, but personally I just don't know how sturdy it is so I opted not to run it on my rifle. The Angled Foregrip and red dot are the only two cheap pieces that comes with this rifle. Everything else is in great shape and the iron sights are awesome!

Text me with any offers, I am not looking to trade for other rifles / handguns / bows / fishing boats / 4 wheelers / dirtbikes / 1980 Honda Civics... Please don't waste my time, money talks. Must be a carry permit holder willing to sign a bill of sale. If you want more pictures I will be happy to send them. If you're sketchy or offering me a low ball price, do not expect a text back.

All items are new and never used.I am hoping to have these sold this weekend, as I purchased them to run two blinds this year, and ended up only running one. Hopefully someone can grab them and put them to use before season end, or get a good deal for the fall, or next spring.

The blind in the original box and never removed or setup. The dimesnions are 6'x6'x64"" and 18.5lbs. The Camo pattern is the ""Epic"" line. These grouynd blinds are hard to find in box stores and really are amazing. 

Here are the specifics on the decoys.

One (1) Avian-X ""Lookout"" Hen 
One(1) Dakota Decoy ""Dual-Purpose"" Hen
One (1) Dakota Decoy ""X-Treme Jake"" 

I am not willing to break these up, so if you want a good deal, I am willing to let everything go for $325.00. I have proof of purchase, as well as all peripherals and carrying bags. This is well below what I paid, and you will not have to pay shipping or tax. Currently at local sporting goods chains these sell for over $400 combined (not including tax). 

I can provide pictures upon request, but obviously I do not want to inflate the decoys or setup the blind so please do not ask. No low ball offers will be accepted unless a possible trade plus cash. If you are looking at this listing, then you know what your buying and what kind of deal it is. I do not need to sell them, so please do no not waste my time or your own trying to get something for nothing.

Thanks for looking!"

This is one of 589 made, ever.

This is a  Ruger GP100, 4"", 6 shot .357 magnum revolver finished in a very high polish blue, with Pao Ferro wood grips from the factory.

As you can see this is in excellent condition with a faint turn line.  Comes with Ruger case, lock, manual, etc.

I also have: Hogue Tamer grip (like new), hand made walnut grip with inlaid ruger medallions (like new), new model (more durable) HiViz fiber optic front sight, and a pair of Wilson Combat spring sets. 

I've had several appraisals done and based on what the professionals are telling me the asking price is fair, and firm.  There are none of these currently for sale online that I can find, and please, you don't need to send me information on what they have sold for unless the sale was within the last 6 months.  Valuations, especially on limited production items, change over time.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Lightweight, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic.  All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™.  When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm.  Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw.

I bought this holster and then sold my pistol, so it is practically brand new.

Single action/double action. Steel frame. Ambidextrous decocker. Firing pin block. 3 Dot tritium night sights. Integral 1913 accessory rail. Rubber grips. Black polycoat. Extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand.


The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. 
 Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.
 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the fi eld of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper.

The Ruger P-Series is a line of centerfire semi-automatic pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company produced from 1985 to 2013. The P-Series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong. The P-Series are short recoil–operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. They utilize a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel. The P-Series were made with a traditional double action/single action (DA/SA), or double action only (DAO) trigger mechanism.
The standard models have an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.
This is DA/SA. Must have a AZ driver license and CCL"

The History... The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.
Today...I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position."

In good shape. Never had a jacketed round through it. Only cast lead. Not shot much. Only reason I'm letting it go is I'm bored with it and want something I'll shoot more often.  

Leupold bases & rings, hinged floor plate, nice monte carlo walnut stock with raised cheek piece, action has been glass bedded, barrel free floated, aftermarket heavy duty barrel lug & nut, accu-trigger.

Barrel is 24 inches.  Rifle is accurate with the only load I've ever shot through it, a 250 grain lead bullet.  I have the mold, reloading dies, and over 200 pcs of brass. Powder too if the deal is right.  I have the Savage action/barrel wrench, which might be for sale tool.  Not sure yet.

I've shot deer out to 300 yards with this combo.  Very effective.

Anyway, I'm asking $650 OBO for the rifle.  If there's someone out there who already casts and reloads or wants to get into casting and reloading, all the other ""stuff"" (dies, mold, brass, etc) can be for sale too for the right price/deal.  

Not looking at trades, or at least not at the moment, although feel free to make offers if you'd like to.  I'll consider them.  

You can call or text at 763-six91-9three39, or send an email.  

I get down to the metro now and then, so maybe I could deliver if the opportunity was there.
