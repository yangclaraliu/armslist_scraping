The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology 1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. 2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. 3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot. Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

Manual & trigger lock are not shown in the pictures. The date on the pictures is wrong, sorry about that, my camera forgot the date & time.

I bought it new from a local store about April 2013, I have the receipt, I'm the only owner of this gun. I took it to a range and fired about 35 rounds through it, it worked fine, I didn't sight it in because I didn't have time that day, then I never got around to using the gun after that. I cleaned it a little and oiled it. I'm selling it because I don't have a need for it.

If you bought it new today, it would cost about: $312 for the gun + $48 for 2 extra magazines + $40 for 4 three-round followers (actually they sell a five-rounder now) + $15 for the aftermarket takedown lever = $415.
I'm selling it all for $300. Pick it up in person, I can meet you anywhere in the Southern Oregon area, if you have a concealed license or if you wouldn't mind filling out a bill of sale that'd be great, but if not, it's okay, the reason I'll waive that is because I understand ppl are afraid of our lovely gov't, if the gov't wasn't so crazy I'd actually be more strict, go figure. Or add $35 for UPS Next Day Air if you want it shipped to an FFL dealer.

The Citori 725 is the evolution of John M. Browning's legendary B25 Superposed, now with the modern performance advantage of a low-profile receiver. The 725 receiver is significantly lower than other Citori 12 gauge receivers, yet the 725 shares the renowned durability of generations of Citori over-and-unders with the same rugged full-width hinge pin and tapered locking bolt design. With a 725, you get the ""one with the gun"" feeling you want, with the long-lasting durability you expect from a Browning over-and-under. The features don't stop there-the 725 showcases the FireLite mechanical trigger that offers unmatched feel and lighter pull weights than ever before. Inflex Technology has also been added to make shooting more comfortable and the Invector-DS choke system moves the gun to a new level of performance. The Field model features a gloss-oil-finished, checkered grade II/III walnut stock and an engraved low-profile steel receiver. A set of three Invector-DS choke tubes are included.

Hogue grip with Allen screws. Volquartsen target trigger, target hammer, target sear, all this makes for an unbelievable trigger pull.
So far, the only ammo that it doesn't like is the cheap Winchester stuff, it just doesn't have enough power to cycle the action. Everything else that I have tried works great. This pistol is very accurate. If you do your part, it will shoot one hole groups at 25 yards, and I'm talking the whole 10 rounds in the magazine.

 I know you cant find them anywhere because all of the gougers bought them to resale so dont panic we will rape the shit out of you for the all mighty dollar. 
 These rounds are extremely  sought after even though none of us use them in the way they are being banned but why not take advantage of fellow sportsman and make some cash. 
  Will take 25 dollars per round.  Only have 1 round right now due to shortage of green paint.  
 Or just go buy normal 556 223 ammo because it shoots exactly the same.  Non of us are in iraq fighting against tanks anyway so whats the big ruckus over other than making profits.  
  Look assholes you didnt pay $1 or more per damn round so stop trying to act like you did.  No some havent stocked up and neither have you. You just got lucky and found 1 or 2000 rounds somewhere cheap and are selling for triple what you paid so dont act like your doing  us a favor.  Take your precious green tip shove it in your anal cavity.  Ill keep buying normal ammo at normal prices and use them at range just like i did the other crap."

So you stupid whiney jerkoffs throwing fits because you were too stupid to stock up M855/SS109, DEAL WITH IT !   It's a rare commodity, banned for sale or distribution as on March 16th.  It is however legal to own and sell if you're an individual.  So if you think it is priced high now, just wait until after March 16th when there will be no way to purchase it other than from individual sellers.

If you practice with ""Managed Recoil"" loads, what's going to happen when you have to shoot those full power hollow points you carry? Will you be surprised by the recoil? You might not be holding the pistol tightly enough. 

Then again, you don't want to dump money into the backstop at the range by shooting hollow points for practice either. 

I have a single sealed box of 120 rounds of Federal .45 ACP ammo. It really is an ingenious concept. If you've just bought a .45 and need to practice with it before it becomes your CCW gun, this is a perfect deal. If you just want some practice ammunition and some jacketed hollow point ammo for defense, it's a good deal, too. Otherwise you could buy this one box and add to your overall supply of practice and defense ammo.

The price was $65, which is Midway's price before shipping. I have lowered it to $55 as aguideline. I'll take the best offer that puts cash In My Hand by Tuesday. I have another deal in the works and have to pay the guy on Tuesday.

Both the practice ammo and the defense ammo are 230 grain bullets, so theoretically, you'll have the same recoil, muzzle flip and recovery in practice as you will get if you ever have to fire the Hydra-Shok defense ammo, when your life may depend on that second or third round."

Leatherwood Camputer ART (Automatic Ranging and Trajectory) scopes features fully adjustable cam systems which allows the shooter to place an extremely accurate shot. This scope is also easily calibrated to automatically compensate for bullet drop. The shooter simply zooms in to frame an 18"" area on the target in the reticle, and an integral cam in the included scope mount adjusts the elevation to account for the distance to the target. The shooter's eye never leaves the scope and there is no need for holdover. Simply place the crosshairs on the target and shoot! Flip-up lens covers are provided separately in the box with the scope. The integral base features screws at different heights to provide maximum holding strength."

The EOTech LBC combines the lightning fast target acquisition of the Holographic Weapon Sight with the versatility of integrated aiming lasers to create an optic capable of excelling in any environment. These battery caps offer a low power red visible and IR laser making them ideal for home defense, CQB and force-on-force training. The LBC’s operate through the use of an easy on/off toggle switch and come with an accessory port for a remote pressure switch (sold separately). They run on easy to find Lithium AA batteries for between 36 and 60 hours depending on laser type and usage. They are also waterproof to 10ft for up to one hour. John Bailey Director of Product Development stated, “The 512 and 552 Holographic Weapon Sights have been some of our most successful products. This new Laser Battery Cap (LBC) doubles the aiming capability of the HWS without incurring the added cost of an entirely new sight.”

This is an excellent gun to add to any collection for numerous reasons 
1. The caliber as stated .35 Remington is the most sought after caliber for the model 8.

I selling my Springfield Range Officer Compact in 45acp. 
It's had a few parts changed out, the trigger, a skeleton hammer, new mainspring housing(one without springfield safety lock), VZ grips and a few other small parts. Plus a couple of new Wilson combat mags to go with it. Close to $1175 invested.
I'd like to get $900 for everything.

It is New in the box never have taken it out to shoot it. I do have all the original parts if you wanted to put it back to bone stock. 
Comes with factory case factory paddle holster,twin mag pouch two factory mags all the paper work. Everything from the factory. Just swapped new Wilson parts for the factory MIM parts, I DID NOT file, polish or tinker with anything internal. 
With the 4"" bushingless bull barrel and the shorter grip this was going to be my new CC pistol. 
But I'm sticking with my old faithful 1911.

You have up to 45 days after sending me money to dispute the transaction and make any claims against me. Avoid using Western Union and Moneygram as there are no protections offered. My paypal email address is gunslinger@linuxmail.org

 Even if it is banned who gives a damn 223 556 ammo is still going to be available that shoots exactly the same.  The whole panic is because of it being called a armor piercing round but honestly how many people actually use this stuff to shoot through armor?  Paper targets and cardboard is what we shoot so therefore you dont need this ammo anyway.  Especially at over 1 dollar per round.  
 Let the pricks who bought it all be stuck with ammo just because they decided to jump on a bandwaggon to take advantage of others.  
 All of them are acting like they paid 2bucks per round  and making you a deal.  Reality is they got this crap at gun shows and on line in mass quantities at less than 50 cents per round just to rape us on it now.  Its not all gone so do some searching if you just have to have it.  
  If you cant find any dont panic just buy any other 556 ammo it all works the same. 
 We are living in a world full of douches who unfortunately use the gun world as a job instead of a hobby or a sport.

It has been dead reliable and accurate, and there are no problems with it. This is an early one (probably the mid-1980s) and was a high tech, high quality pistol in its day. 

I assume you already know that this Taurus was made on Beretta machinery left over after Beretta fulfilled a military contract with Brazil. I actually prefer it to the Beretta since this one can be carried cocked and locked like a 1911. Frame mounted safety feels better to me and is quicker than the slide mounted one on a Beretta too. Of course since it is a double action, you really don't even need to use the safety to carry it.

It comes with three magazines and all function fine. Features orange three dot sights. I have never had a malfunction of any kind with it, and I would trust my life to it.

Overall it is as reliable as any Beretta, and for the money I don't think you can beat it. I am firm on this price (lol, it's cheap) and I don't think you can find a better value in a serious self defense handgun. Period.

I am in Santa Fe and can meet you almost any time. Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call you so we can meet up.

Thanks a lot for looking!
