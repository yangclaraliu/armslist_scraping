This rifle is a clone of the M-14 rifles that were used in the military. This rifle has a pre-ban flash suppressor with bayonet lug. The IDE versions of this rifle are said to be of better quality and are more sought after. Many say that these rifles with their forged receivers are as close as you could get to a real USGI M-14. 

Although Polytech is a Chinese company, this is not a Norinco rifle - Poly's are build better and have better reviews and are very dependable. Additionally, they are no longer imported to the US. Many M1A/M14 collectors and enthusiasts buy Polytech rifles for their receivers or as alternatives to the more expensive Springfield M1A. 

The only issue of note is that Polytech M14's have some bolts are rumored to be not properly headspaced. However, I have not personally experienced any issues with this particular rifle, so I guess this is not one of them. Also, this rifle does not have a stripper clip guide, but most people do not use them anyway. The only part I swapped out was by adding a USGI recoil spring. 

This rifle is fitted with a USGI M-14 stock that has a Circle P proof mark on the pistol grip, as well as a DAS cartouche on the left side. Overall, the stock is in great condition and shows only average use with no major cracks, dings, etc. Stock also has all original metal work, including the hinged butt plate. An unmarked 20 round magazine and clone M1907 leather sling are also included."

The gun has had less then 200 rounds thru it. Has a small amount of holster wear on the front, when u take the gun apart you would think you were looking at a brand new gun, it's CLEAN. I just like 9mms better. I have a gen 3 model 17, but I'd even consider trading for another 17... I only have one 10rd mag that comes with it. I took it to millers last week to have them look at it and they said it was in great shape. I'll sell it for $400 and the buyer pays for the transfer,
Let me know what u have, I will add cash on my end.
Thanks!"

This pistol is VERY accurate, trigger pull is around 3 lbs and VERY smooth. It comes with the standard gen 4 3 mags, backstraps and box. I do also have 2 Kriss Mags for it which are 30 round capacity each. Also have around 300 rounds of ammo. Reason I am selling is I just don’t shoot it much and have other things would rather get into, BUT I don’t need to sell it so don’t even waste your time with lowball offers. I value the gun at $750 as it sits, the Kriss mags I would sell for 40 apiece with the gun or once it is gone. Would also make a hell of deal on the ammo to a buyer. I could convert it back to bone stock if necessary but parts I listed are a good $200 from glockstore. 

Far as trades go I would possibly be interested in some higher end home defense shotguns, AR 15’s, Trijicon Acogs, higher end optics, can add cash or take cash for the right deal."

They come equipped with Vickers Tactical sights, mag release, slide catch and magazine base plates. These GLOCK models will also have unique serial numbers (this is 1696 of 5000) for collectability and authenticity.

 Larry Vickers chose close industry partners Wilson Combat to create the sights and Tango Down who manufactured all other parts. When asked about the joint venture Larry said, “I’m proud to be working with Lipsey’s on a pair of GLOCK pistols that not only feature my parts, but are offered in a configuration never before available in the market. Serious GLOCK fans take note, these guns are a must have.”

The 96A1 is an evolution of the legendary 92FS (M9), one of the world’s most successful pistols for military, law-enforcement and self-defense use.

Chambered in the powerful .40 S&W, it comes with three 12-round magazines to deliver impressive firepower for any tactical use. It is safe, accurate and reliable while offering easy operation, accessorization and disassembly; and its durability is further enhanced by a recoil buffer that greatly diminishes component stress. A pistol that bears the unmistakeable Beretta looks, it is the ultimate choice for shooters wanting a professional-grade personal- or home-defense pistol that can also be easily adapted for concealed carry

Accurate and Reliable

The cold-hammer forged barrel on the 96A1 is designed to deliver great accuracy out of the box, while the dovetail-mounted front sight is easy to adjust to always keep you on target. The barrel is encased in an open slide typical of Beretta’s 90-series pistols; besides reducing weight and backward-momentum during firing, this design maximizes reliability and virtually eliminates “stove-piping.”

Durable and Made to Last

With the 96A1, the hard-hitting .40 S&W comes back stronger than ever in the 90-series lineup. We have worked in conjunction with law-enforcement experts to make this pistol shrug off tens of thousands of full-power rounds with Beretta-style durability. The brand new recoil buffer that is machined right into the action of the 96A1 essentially acts as a cushon against the stress between moving parts, greatly boosting the service life of this powerful pistol. Also, the Bruniton finish on the metal is designed to be corrosion resistant to give worry-free maintenance even after all-day concealed carry in scorching-hot conditions.

Easy to Accessorize

The 96A1 comes with an integral Picatinny rail on which users can easily mount a variety of tactical accessories--such as tactical lights, aiming devices or even both. Additionally, the front sight is dovetail-mounted, meaning that it is adjustable for windage and can be easily replaced with an accessory front sight of the user’s choice. If you love the unmatched performance of the Beretta 92FS or M9 and want a few extra tactical features as well as the extra power of the .40 S&W, the Beretta 96A1 is your ultimate choice."

The barrel is the original Glock barrel with matching serial number, it is just polished. (Aesthetics: the parkerization is all that is removed, the tennifer coating is mixed in the steel and is what prevents oxidization. Also glock refinishes barrels black for $20 if you don't like it.)

I'm looking to trade this as I already have a G27 w/ conversion barrel. 

I'm looking for these and CAN ADD CASH if the value is there

Up for sale or trade in the Bay View area of Milwaukee is a Walther PK380. It is in great shape, some bluing worn on the outside of the barrel, which is absolutely normal for these guns. I am the second owner, I've only put 50 or so rounds through it myself. I estimate it's had a few hundred over it's lifetime. It functions perfectly and the barrel is shiny and clean. It is surprisingly accurate and it's size would make it a great concealed carry piece.

Includes:
PK380
Factory Case
One 8rd magazine
Field strip key (ultra important)
Cable lock
2x .380 snap caps
50+ rounds of FMJ target ammo

Our 9MM Fake Suppressor is as close to a real suppressor as you can get without paying the tax stamp. Its CNC precision machined from solid aluminum with a durable hard black anodized finish identically to our real NFA registered suppressors. Since its a fake suppressor, the sound is not reduced and bullet impact is not changed. Many customers do prefer the weight and balance improvement that the suppressor provides. Its perfect for use on a Glock 9mm pistol with a threaded barrel and will also of course work on any 9MM firearm that has the barrel threaded 1/2x28. Don't let the low price fool you... Tactical Innovations are the source and manufacture 1000's of fake suppressors to supply other major manufacturers, distributors and resellers. You won't find a better fake suppressor at ANY price. Order a Fake Suppressor today and get your gun lookin' right! NOTE: Guns that have floating barrels have more difficulty cycling with either a fake or a real suppressor since the additional weight on the barrel makes it harder for the barrel to lock into battery.  For many handguns, when real suppressors are fitted, they have a booster added so that there is additional recoil to compensate for the additional suppressor weight.  Especially if your pistol has a floating barrel, it could be problematic and heavier bullets with hotter loads will be necessary to ensure it will function reliably.*******************************************"

Named for the Toklat River in central Alaska, this Talo version of the Ruger Super Redhawk would make an excellent general purpose handgun. This revolver has a satin stainless finish and an unfluted cylinder with a 5″ slab sided barrel and adjustable sights (red insert ramp front/white outline notch rear). The textured rubber finger groove grips help manage recoil. The powerful .454 Casull is a capable round for defense against bears and other dangerous game. The gun is also capable of shooting the common .45 Colt round allowing for practice without the stiff recoil of the .454. The frame is machined to accept Ruger scope rings (Included). This gun weighs 3 lbs. 2 oz.
The potent Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers are popular among hunters, metallic silhouette shooters and those looking for an added level of safety when outdoors in dangerous game country.

Featuring a new SoftCoil™delayed gas blow back technology, Walther Arms, Inc. has introduced its latest concealed carry firearm -the CCP.This semi-automatic pistol comes chambered in 9mm and is the ultimate concealed carry weapon.
Weighing only 22 ounces,the CCP’s SoftCoir™ delayed gas blow back system uses gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and feeds them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined-after the bullet has left the barrel­ hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion,opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Two other benefits to this system as a result of SoftCoil™technology are that the slide is easily racked and because barrel rise is reduced, the shooter can acquire targets faster. Tests show that the barrel rise is a third less than similar models on the market allowing shooters to be more accurate on follow-up shots.
With an overall length of just 6.5 inches,Walther’s CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or traditional black and provides all the features that have become signature of Walther’s line of pistols – smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull,interchangeable front sight;adjustable rear sight; and reversible magazine release for left or right handed operation.
This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety,the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual safety and one internally that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip Hi-Grip™surface. Other key attributes of the gun include an easy access slide stop;loaded chamber indicator for added safety; and front, rear and trigger guard serrations for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.

1x FNH non-threaded barrel, maybe 100rds fired through it. 
1x FDE Dr. Optic 7MOA.

Ideally I would like to trade it for two Glocks. Please don't send me lowball offers. 
If you're offering just one pistol I would expect something (cash) to bring your value up unless it was a high dollar gun. 
Would consider other items (nice spotting scope is a high priority), worst I can say is no thanks.

Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.  Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.  Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol. ________________________________________ Features Unlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models:  - Striker Safety - Disconnect Safety - 3-point Take Down Safety System - Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine - System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear - Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation."

This pistol is a real beauty, round count is less than 500 rounds. Excellent shape! 

From SIG Sauer's website: The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. The P220® Carry Equinox is a limited production .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER® Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox features gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function. 

All items from factory included - total package includes 9 magazines. Five 8-round (two SIG, four are ACT-MAGs). Also includes four 10-round ProMag magazines.

This was made sometime in the 1970's, however I do not know exactly when due to my relative unfamiliarity with Colt serial numbers.  That said it's in perfect condition, it's a 6 inch barrel with Colt's royal blue polished finish, wood grips and the fit and finish typical of vintage Colt revolvers.  These are basically Colt's beefed up duty line of pistols that were meant as a counterpoint to the iconic Python series of pistols.  While the Python was and is a great gun, some say that the lockup and timing can be a bit finicky over extended duty cycles, so Colt beefed up the innards to create the Trooper Mk3 series of pistols.  Action and lockup are of course perfect, never been fired, just a great vintage Colt.
