From the CZ website:

“… After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public…” 

This pistol is in better than very good condition with 300-400 rounds fired. Only blemish and reason I say ‘very good’ is tiny spots around take down post; otherwise, extremely clean with no handling marks, like new. The pistol displays the NATO ‘NSN’ designation and has Meprolight night sights, picatinny rail, and rubber grips on alloy frame and includes two 10 round magazines with CZ carrying case. This is a really fine pistol.

The Golden Saber High Performance Jacket successfully combines four critical elements of handgun bullet performance: match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion and virtually 100% weight retention. This ammunition also features primer and mouth waterproofing for long-term reliability, nickel-plated cases for reliable feeding, treated powders for low muzzle flash and primers that are triple-inspected during the manufacturing process. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.
Remington Golden Saber features a high performance jacket built around a revolutionary brass jacketed hollow point design. The Jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass which releases energy over longer distance while mushrooming perfectly. The spiral cut nose promotes mushrooming at lower velocities without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. Golden Saber features primer mouth and waterproofing as a standard feature. Golden Saber cases are also nickel plated for reliable feeding, function, and extraction in a wide variety of firearms."

Bought this for a build and ended up not using the carbine barrel I had and instead went with a midlength. Absolutely flawless, no issues and has never been mounted or even mocked up. Got it, tossed the box, took the plastic off and then put it back in the bag. As stated, no box, just the plastic bag it came in but everything else is there as far as bolts, washers, etc. Only partial trade interest would be for 75 grain Hornady TAP ammunition in .223, factory new.

From LWRC: 
Our ARM-R carbine Length Rail Kit. This three piece rail kit is made from 6065 series aluminum that is Type III mil-spec hardcoat anodized in black. The kit consists of three main pieces: 1) Lower section that contains the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock rails, 2) The rail clamp that attaches the system to the upper receiver, and 3)The removable top rail, which attaches to the lower section via hardened steel pins and 'J' shaped cuts that are found on the rail. These hooks and pins allow a 100% return to zero when removing and replacing the top rail. The top rail is held in place by pusher screws, which seat against special high-temp rubber o-rings.

The removable top rail allows the user easy access to the piston components on a piston operated gun or to the gas tube on a direct impingement gun. The top rail can be removed and replaced without tools other than the rim of a cartridge case. This rail kit fits any standard mil-spec upper receiver without any special mounting hardware.

Two Quick Detach swivel mounts (one fore and one aft on both 3 and 9 o'clock positions) accommodate most Uncle Mike's® pattern QD sling swivels. Rails are T-Marked on all four sides for quick location of accessories. This lightweight and durable rail system has made LWRC rifles and carbine the go-to choice for the operator that needs plenty of 1913 Picatinny mounting surfaces for optics, lights, bipods, and lasers."

The break action, shell ejector, hammer, trigger, and cylinder advance all work great. The rifling is still strong, but there is some slight pitting of the bore near the cylinder and some loss of nickel plating along the upper portion of the revolver. Appears to have the original S&W grips. The shotgun is a break action side by side Richards exposed hammer, dual trigger model. It has a fairly good lock up, good bore, and great patina on the metal and wood. No cracks in the wood furniture and good wood-to-metal fit. Everything appears to be functioning as it should. I do not know if these are safe to shoot, and I would strongly suggest having a competent gunsmith look at them if you intend to do so.

Description:
The Beretta 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively on or off. The safety lever also functions as the pistols decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
The Beretta 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them. One of the most tested and trusted personal defense weapons in history.

A nice, albeit relatively used, Model 60 made by Glenfield (Marlin) complete with the ""squirrel stock""  

Based on the serial number (20XXXXXX) and the Model 60 coding for dating production, this rifle is dated 1980. 

In addition to being a tack driver, this rifle was produced before the change in tube length. Therefore this rifle has the full length tube magazine with a capacity of 17+1, a total of 18 rounds. 

as for condition with rifle was used for varmint hunting as the stock has handling marks (no cracks, gouges, or defects) and the metal also has usage marks (light scratches, very minimal pitting).

However, the buffer was so old that it cracked over time and broke off the rifle the last time I went shooting. However, this part can be found for around $10 online (will deduct $20 from total price to cover it and shipping costs on your end). Trigger guard also had a cracked tang, but looks like it was fixed with some type of epoxy. Has not been a problem for me. (Will also deduct from total price)

That being said, I have kept this rifle very clean and oiled. Every time I used it, it has been cleaned and oiled afterwards. 

JM stamped barrel

Bill of Sale WILL be filled out. 

Would make a great first rifle for a child or a great all around plinking gun."

It is topped with an older but reliable Weatherby Supreme 3-9x44 scope and is also equipped with iron sights. These scopes are still highly desired and go for over $150. It comes with a factory 5 round magazine and after market 10 round magazine.  It has a blued barrel and wood gloss stock. There are sling mounts on the pump swivel so the barrel is not clamped. There are a few small dings in the clear coat on the stock but the rifle is in great shape and a shooter. This rifle is underrated and can hang with most bolt guns due to the double locking bolt/receiver. Rifle comes with two boxes of premium Hornady Hog-Hammer ammunition, three boxes of range ammunition, and about 20 rounds of 180 grn Winchester ammunition.  I am willing to sell the bundle for $450.  I will also consider trades for other long arms (rifle or shotgun), blackpowder Civil War replicas, flintlocks, or blackpowder shotguns.  Will also trade for a second generation Colt 1851 Navy, 1st Model Dragoon, or 1849 Pocket Pistol."

KY Residents.

From the Browning web site:
Pump-actions have long been lauded in the world of shotguns for their reliability and ability to cycle just about any load they are chambered for. The BPS stand head an shoulders above the rest with it's superior forged and machined steel receiver - combined with dual steel action bars, it has the strongest action of any pump gun on the market.

Also unique to the BPS is its bottom feed and ejection port. Shells are loaded and ejected from the bottom, leaving one less port for dirt and debri to enter the action. Likewise, a left handed shooter won't end up ejecting empty hulls into their face. Combined with the top tang safety, this gun is truly ambidextrous."

Black Hole Weaponry Barrels employ the use of 416R, match grade stainless steel. BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore.This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.

 These where built using Moultrie 30 gallon hanging feeders. I used them for two months and they work great. You can set these feeders up as high or as low as you want; I just set them up like this so you would have an idea of how they look.
 The only reason I am selling them is because I'm going to large capacity gravity feeders. I have about $500 invested in each of these feeders. I also have the original lids and hangers that will go with the feeders as well. Everything except the ratchet straps go with the feeders. You can lag bolt or ratchet strap them to a tree or post.

Here are the costs of the components used to build the feeders:
• Moultrie hanging feeder with Pro-Magnum motors -- These motors are super strong and have a lifetime warranty. They run off of two 6 volt batteries - $250 each
• Hanging bail from Texas Direct Hunting products - $40 each
• Galvanized Metal Lid from Texas Direct Hunting products - $30 each
