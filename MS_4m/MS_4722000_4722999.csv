The old 20 gauge has killed a lot of ducks, but some patterning has convinced me that I need better density. Pump action only, and must be threaded for choke tubes. Brand unimportant, just looking for something with working extractors and a barrel that isn't rusted out. Would prefer synthetic furniture. I'm a short guy, so youth models are also fine."

Was purchased at shoot straight at the beginning of summer. Less than 100 shells through it. Shotgun is like new, clean, oiled and ready to go. Only selling because I have found something else I want and am limited on funds (you know how that goes). Shotgun shoots flawlessly. 

Comes with the gun, case, cleaning rod, 100 shells of federal bird shot as well as 25 shells of Suprema buck shot. ""

*Note that the ammo box in the picture is NOT included in the sale. It is just currently      holding all of the bird shot. You will need to bring a container of your own.*

I am absolutely firm at $300 as the gun retails close to $400 from the shop alone and that wouldn't include the case, cleaning rod or ammo. A great deal for the right buyer.

I will ask for your ID to make sure you are of age to purchase. Local pick up with cash only please."

Made this gun last year and I've run into some auto trouble. I have no desire to sell but can't afford not to. It has about 500 rounds through it and has never had hiccup. It had a front site on the gas block but I've milled it down and reblued it.

Any questions please contact me through Text/Phone REDACTED). I need to sell ASAP. Not interested in trades unless it is considerably in my favor.

This is worth well more than the price tag especially with the optic and mount included. Please no low balls."

I ordered it back in April and paid between 650-675 after tax and everything. I didn't receive it until mid May so never got to hunt with it.  It was one of the ""I got to have it"" purchases. I grew up shooting 12ga pumps and always loved them. But this was going to be my first shot gun since I got injured in Iraq and now have 8 rods in my back. I wanted to get back into turkey hunting now that I have the time and thought it would be the perfect gun. And it really is. Really nice tight patterns. But the rods in my back can't take it and now I use a 20ga auto. I have only fired 2 shells through it and those 2 shells were enough. Anyway I am wanting to trade it for a deer rifle. Or sell it to get one. I'm not looking for anything fancy. I have my eye on a Remington 700 at Walmart. They are 377.00$ pluses tax and while I would hate to take that kind of loss I am losing more having it just sit. I would like something in 270 win, 7mm rem mag, 7mm-08, 308 win, or 300 win mag. I will trade it for one of the Walmart special rem 700 or another decent rifle. Or sell for 450obo but please don't offer 200$ this isn't a model 500 beater.

I do not know the round count, as I am at least the second owner.  I have personally probably put less than 200 rounds through it.  I do not have to sell this, but it is just sitting in my safe and I would much rather someone who has the time to shoot it own it.  You will see in the picture that it has a set of houge grips as well as the original smith and wesson checkered wood grips.  I unfortunately never had a box or manual with this gun, so I do not have that to offer.  Also, the sights appear to have been replaced.  

You are welcome to make a trade offer, but I'm not looking for much as I really do not have the time to shoot these days."

I have only seen a couple of these before but neither had the fit and finish this one does. Whoever the gunsmith was that built this one sure went the extra mile. The double and single action pull are as smooth or smoother than any gun the PC turns out today. The finish on the stainless looks wet no matter which way you turn the gun. Comes with all front sight blades it left S&W with plus case locking key still in factory envelope all housed in a beautiful Mahogany Case that's in mint condition as well. If you know anything about S&W 44s you know the Magna was the most accurate 44 S&W ever turned out. You want find a nicer Magna. Thanks for looking.

The SBE II features a rugged, weather-resistant composite stock, and is finished entirely in non-reflective black, making it an ideal all-round shotgun for hunters who use a wide range of shotgun ammunition. At the heart of the Super Black Eagle II is Benelli's ultra-reliable Inertia Driven™ operating system, consisting of just 3 main parts: the bolt body, an inertia spring, and a rotating bolt head. The Inertia Driven action cycles 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" shotgun shells interchangeably without adjustments. This super simple design does not use gas to cycle the action, allowing it to remain cleaner than a gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. The smaller mass of parts in the action, and no heavy gas operating components housed inside the forend, make the SBE II an extremely trim, and fast handling semi-automatic shotgun. The ComforTech® recoil reduction system tames recoil from magnum loads and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shots. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast. Benelli manufactures all Super Black Eagle barrels and choke tubes with their Crio® System, which creates an even-grained, slick surface that minimizes pellet deformation, and produce tight, uniform shot patterns that down birds at maximum shotgun range. A red-bar front sight and metal bead mid-sight, and 5 Crio choke tubes (C, IC,M, IM, F), give hunters versatility. Comes with integrated sling attachments and a hard case. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope base (not included). The Benelli Super Black Eagle II is a rugged, ultra-reliable Semi-Auto Shotgun that is ideal for hunting multiple species in varied habitats.Matte black for all-round useSimple and reliable inertia operationCycles 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" shellsComfor Tech recoil reduction systemCrio System barrel and choke tubesDrilled and tapped receiverComes with 5 choke tubes and hard case"

It is rare for several reasons: 

1.) It was made by Izhmash and imported prior to the ban; lots of guns look like these, but this is the real deal from the factory in Izhevsk. Do your homework, and you'll find that these are the best AK pattern shotguns ever made.

2.) It was converted in the USA, with top-of-the-line parts and fully reworked machanicals; broken in properly, with adjustable gas tuned perfectly for high and low brass by a friend who is a Russian veteran. I wanted a gun I could bet my life on, and this is it. It also shoots BOTH 2 3/4"" AND 3"" magnum slugs without complaint.

3.) No matter what anyone tells you, a short pull on one of these is not a good thing. These guns are just far tool powerful. Ridiculous, frankly, in rapid fire – unless you are facing down a rhino for some reason. Unlike most conversions or imitators that came afterward, this gun has the trigger in the stock position. That's important, because you can't use it as a Kushnapup (and shorten it beyond any SBR) with a relocated trigger.

3a.) That means it can be a standard AK-pattern combat shotgun, OR a Kushnapup bullpup WHENEVER YOU LIKE. The conversion takes just a few minutes because the tangs on the rear trunnion have never been cut; a serious rarity for Kushnapups. That makes it easy to reconfigure as you like. All parts for BOTH configurations are included. 

4.) It is priced to move. The Kushnapup alone with some of these upgrades is listed on Gunbroker for 2500.00. Unfortunately, this is a lean time and it feels silly to have so many guns, frankly. This is one of my favorite weapons, but I can only shoot so many at one time, and I don't have room for another shotgun. The gun is used but in great condition and with minimal wear. The pictures aren't very good, but I'm at work. The gun looks fantastic.

5. Some of you may currently have undead infestations, and may be dealing with a living room full of zombies. This will solve your problem lickety split. These guns are legendary for a reason. Personally, I have never owned a gun that came even close in terms of sheer destructive power, or a shotgun that was as accurate at longer distances. Below is a list of what comes with it.

Price is firm, no trades. I will only sell through FFL or to PA resident w/ valid state ID. No tire kickers or trolls, please. If you have the cash and want the gun, I will send you additional closeups that show it all clean and shiny. You know. The way weapons never are if you actually use them. My guess is that if you are in the market for one of these, you're smart enough to figure that part out. You will never see a truly legit one of these for less, I promise.

Browning’s most lasting innovations – the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge – into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern “pocket pistols”, that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved accuracy. The grip is compact, yet it is long and wide enough to allow the shotting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort.The 1911-380 is 85% of the size of the original 1911 45 ACP model. It’s ideal for concealed carry duty, and for fitting a wider variety of shooters.FEATURES:Frame: Composite.Slide: Machined steel. Matte black finish.Barrel: Rust resistant 4 1/4″, target crown.Action: Locked breech action. Single-action trigger.Grips: Composite.Features: Fixed comabt sights.

Our latest exclusive marries these two features into one sixgun that is easy to carry and can handle the heavy recoil from full power 44 Magnum loads. The stainless barrel features a pinned front sight that can be customized to your liking. The black laminate grips contrast well to the clean lines of the satin stainless steel construction.

I am the second owner and have done all the work myself. I am a certified Colt Armorer so the work, while not extensive, is legit. The rifle had a sub 500 round count when I bought it, and I've probably sent two thousand rounds through it myself.When I installed the Troy rail system, I re-profiled the original front sight/gas block so that it would fit under the rail system. I also coated the upper in Brownells Aluma-hyde II to match Magpuls FDE furniture. This upper is plenty accurate and is a pleasure to shoot. The PWS Comp takes all the recoil out and allows for accurate shot placement during rapid fire. It comes with an old school chrome BCG. This was the high speed option before NiB made the scene. The bolt face is good to go and free from any chips or cracks and the gas rings are new. The gas key is properly staked to the carrier and the receiver has correct ""M4"" cuts.

Wooden stock. Gun an easy 98%. I took off the butler creek stock it came with and the thing has clearly not been used much at all. It looks like a new gun internally just as the outside does. No signs of blueing wear off the parts of the trigger system that would get rubbed to heck after minimal use. I took several pics.

Rifle runs perfect as minis do. Bore and rifling look like new. The first person who holds and fires this is taking it home. Feel free to try it out. This is a ranch version with flip up rear sights and takes rings and a scope without any modifications.

620 Obo. I'll include the Butler Creek folding stock for 75 more and install it if buyer wants.

The Vzor 45, commonly known as CZ 45 is a compact blowback operated semi-automatic pistol chambered in .25 ACP . It was made in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic . Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by ÄŒeská zbrojovka Uherský Brod as the CZ-92.   In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine.   The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin.   When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear.   Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose.   The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger.    In 1992 the gun was slightly redesigned, given a magazine release behind the trigger and a futuristic grip, and is now sold as the CZ-92. Unfortunately, due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the gun can no longer be imported into the U.S., as it is too small. After the GCA blocked further importation, US Manufacturer Intratec started producing a near-exact clone called the Protec, though the build quality is somewhat lower.   CZ-45's are somewhat rare in the US resale market and go for about $250 in good condition and up to $750 in mint condition. CZ-92's are virtually non-existing in the US and go for higher prices, despite the limited applications of the .25 ACP as a self-defense round.   The CZ Custom Shop in the United States is planning to produce a limited run of US-made CZ 92's. A prototype was shown at the 2011 SHOT Show. CZ Custom aims to have the US-made CZ-92 included in the CZ Catalog at the 2012 SHOT Show. It is not confirmed if the chambering will remain .25ACP or possibly switch to .32 or .380.
