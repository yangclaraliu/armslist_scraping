Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. Has seen around 500rds. Supper smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. 

Quality 14.5"" or 18"" ar15. Bcm, spikes, colt etc. 

Other quality ak in 7.62 or 5.45 plus cash. (Mak90 an $475 cash) 

Glock 17 Or 19 plus cash 

Vtac 9mm plus cash

Vickers glock 19 plus cash

Keltec pmr 30 plus cash

Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr in 7.62 x 54R caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 23” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with two 5 round magazines, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit. Pictures are stock pictures taken from one Vepr in stock and wood grain and tint will vary from rifle to rifle.

The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr in 7.62 x 54R caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 23” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

All real Kobra's come with a acceptance certificate like the one in the picture. Kobra Military Red Dot AK 1S-03 Rifle Scope, Universal AK & SVD Side Mount. Kobra is an open collimator ""red dot"" combat optic using laser-generated ""heads-up display"" (HUD) technology to superimpose a reticle pattern onto a filtered lens which acts as an aiming device for the shooter. This system presents an unobstructed field of view, in 1x power which allows for extremely comfortable, ""both eyes open"" shooting. On average, most users will see a 1.5 times faster target acquisition and a 50% smaller shot group at 100 meters, in comparison to the iron sights. It is designed for engaging fast moving targets and targets appearing for a short period of time in close quarters and urban combat situations in various light conditions. It provides clear targeting from 104 lx to 10-2 lx (daylight, twilight and moonlight), one- or two-eye targeting, is very effective when shooting from moving vehicles, and allows for perfect kill shots on fast-moving, small and spontaneously appearing targets. It is a recipient of the prestigious Russian Gold Diploma. The Kobra offers a similar if heavier build-style to the SGC Quatro with an open, L-shaped frame with the lens at the front. And also offers similar features. First and most important is a choice of four aiming marks - single dot, open T, reversed chevron or reversed chevron with dot on top. All these can be selected by the simple push of a button, as opposed to having a dial them in. The ON/OFF is a rotary lever and the rheostat, a rocker switch, are all located on the bottom of right side of the body. At the rear top and left are the adjuster turrets. There's even a tool that allows you to re-zero the turrets if you run out of adjustment. It is a tough, well-built Red Dot with superior features at a fraction of the cost of other similar scopes. A definite Best Buy, the Kobra is currently used by the Russian armed forces, including the most elite units of the Russian Special Forces. It has also been seen in service over the last several years in Caucasus, and is a battle tested design which has proven worthy of the Russian military tradition of reliability, form, and function. It has elevation and windage adjustments, ballistic correction limits from 100-700m, is lightweight, shockproof, has a sealed body, and is for use in severe conditions. The 16-level digital brightness adjustment is an added plus. It has been proven that the Kobra tremendously improves aiming effectiveness, especially at nighttime, resulting in more target hits. The Kobra AK & SVD version is designed to fit all standard side mounting optics plates currently used on AK and SVD rifles. This includes the Saiga rifle and shotgun, all versions of the Romanian WUM, Romak, CUR, SAR variants, Vepr rifles, and many others. They will also fit the side plate of the Dragunov SVD and the Romanian PSL/FPK/Romak 3. These work on both milled and stamped receivers including on Chinese Polytech and Norinco stamped or milled receivers, Hungarian SA-85 and SA2000, Egyptian Maadi ARM/RPM/RML/Misr-90, etc. Comes with everything pictured - carry case, rubber sun hood, tool and manual.

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21SF delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 AUTO round with 10/13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21SF pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control—especially for shooters with smaller hands."

This is a Remington 700 5R in 308 winchester.
Stainless steel heavy barrel with the Mil-spec 5R rifling pattern.
The stock is an HS Precision Kevlar composite stock with an aluminum bedding chassis. 

This rifle sports an adjustable Jewell trigger that adjusts from 3 lbs down to about 2 ounces.  It's currently set at a little over 1 pound.  If you have never shot a Jewell trigger - they break like glass.  No factory trigger can touch one.

It's also wearing a Badger ordinance 20 moa 1-piece Steel picatinny base.  These bases are rock solid and don't shift around.  The 20 MOA gives you extra scope adjustment for shooting out to 1,000+ yards.

For me - the rifle consistently shoots under 3/4 MOA.

Interested?  Want to see more pics?  Questions?
Shoot me a message.

This rifle is for sale Face to face only in South Carolina."

These lowers are also clipped and pinned. Real clipped HK pins would fall out of the holes. These end pins are machined bar stock to mimic the HK pin ends but will not push through and are seated in the lower pin hole. 

The rear tang can be shortened so these will work on G3/91, 33/93, and MP5 weapons. These will not fit the ""K"" series. These will also work on .308 CETME if an HK style FCG is used.

NOTICE. Original steel lowers are designed internally to fit a 23mm FCG box. If your semi receiver-shelf is wider than .906 inches NO STEEL lower will fit it. 

As all clones are built differently, you may need some minor fitting to fit this on yours. These were designed to, and fit, the HK91’s that I use for measurements. 

UPDATE: These now include a brand new US manufactured Grip. By adding this unit to your weapon you either maintain your US parts count or increase it by one.

M620V Scout WeaponLight – White and IR Output - Black

The compact SureFire M620V Scout Weapon Light produces 150 lumens of brilliant white light or 120 milliwatts of invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the Surefire M620V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. And it comes with a momentary/constant-on pushbutton tailcap switch and a momentary-on pressure-activated tape switch with a 7"" cable that can be positioned where you choose. Also available are optional dual SR pushbutton/pressure pad switches. The Surefire M620V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 throw-lever rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission, the Surefire M620V is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-proven and built to withstand the rigors of combat. 

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.)

1 Brand New, Never Used, .223/5.56 Facing and Crowning Kit w/ brass pilots, these tools ($150 dollars on Brownells) would be used for facing and crowning your barrel after you cut it down to length as an SBR, this kit can also be used on any other firearms of the same caliber, and if you buy replacement pilots, it can be used on a variety of different firearms and calibers.

I will also be including a complete set of very good condition Russian red Krinkov furniture as well with the rifle with all the included hardware.

The rifle currently has a professionally installed Red Star Arms, Multi-Stage trigger system in it, this trigger allows you to adjust weight, length of trigger pull, reset, and it also allows you to switch between single stage and double stage.

The rifle also has a Stormwerkz ""Suchka"" rear sight rail professionally installed on the rear sight tang for the mounting of a small red dot.

$1450 for the package, the vast majority of which is new equipment, the idea when I originally purchased it was that I was saving a ton of money by making it myself over a factory SBR ($1900-$2200 dollars not including the cost of a tax stamp) which in the end for a bit of labor I was still saving 150-200 bucks minus all of the extra features (triggers and rails)

The rear is a folding variety that were quite popular. All markings such as serial number, barrel markings are correct and show well. The function and mechanics of this gun are flawless. The screws are all in nice shape. The bore on the rifle is excellent with distinct rifling. I have fired this rifle many times and it is an accurate shooter."
