SxS, Break-over Shotgun. This model was manufactured in Belgium, and sold in Breslau, Germany between 1893 and 1968. Liegeoise was the largest manufacturer under Pieper and FN at that time. This gun appears to have been made sometime between 1898 and 1924, serial#: 46XXX. This gun is in great condition for its age. It is outfitted with a 29.5"" blued SxS barrel, with bead sight on a matte, textured center strip. The barrel is marked on the top with a few dainty engraved details, and ""R. Schadt Braunschweig"" is lightly engraved in the plaque portion on the center strip. There are a few tiny spots in the finish where it has just started to turn a patina color. This gun does have the double triggers on it. The frame and trigger guard are highly decorated with intricate, hand engraved details depicting hunting scenes, and scroll work designs. Even the screws are engraved with details. There are several smith marks on the bottom of the barrel, and on the frame under where the barrel attaches as well; there is a crown with the letters 'ML' below it, and another is a crown with 'E' & 'LG' below it. It has an 'E' inspector's mark on it, and the 'EL' provisional proof mark also. The gorgeous high gloss, heavily checkered, monte carlo style pistol grip stock and forearm are in great condition. The pistol grip cap is the old, rounded style end, and the forearm has ebony wood details integrated in it. There are a few minor surface marks in the wood located on the bottom of the stock, and there is one small, visible knick in the stock on one side. There are sling loops installed on the bottom of the stock and underneath the barrel as well. This gun retains the original buttplate with the crown and 'ML' emblem molded into it. This is a beautiful gun in great condition, making an excellent display piece or collection addition.

I've been the sole owner since around Christmas. It's had roughly 150 rounds through it and has been a range gun only; there's little to zero wear. Because it's only been a range gun and I can't get out as much as I'd like, I can't justify keeping it.

Features:
- Steel frame
- Two 18-round magazines
- Fixed Tru-dot night sights
- Ambidextrous decocker

Also comes with original carrying case, all included accessories, and all paperwork.

Join us April 18th!,"outside of, Mankato, Minnesota",$ 20,"Listed On: Saturday, April 11, 2015",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Do you enjoy shooting? Or are you new to the sport and want help getting started?  Hi! My name is Cody and we are looking for people of all ages and skill levels to join us for a day of shooting fun.  You may remember our ads from last year- we are RAC FRAG, or Responsible Armed Citizens, Fun Run And Gun.  Check out our website and see us in action.  http://rac-frag.weebly.com/

I encourage you to call or text me @ REDACTED if you have any questions or concerns, or even just want to introduce yourself and give us a little info on you or your group.  Apparently Armslist email has issues, so if you answered this ad and did not get a response, please call or text me. You could also register on the home page of our website if you are interested in partaking in this opportunity.  We are only asking for $20 per shooter for the whole day.

This won't be a run and gun event, but an open range day to allow people to shoot however they want.  Pistol, rifle, bb gun, short range drills, long range shooting out to 500 yards- we do it all at FRAG!  Want to practice drawing from your holster and shooting?  Come on out! Most indoor ranges wont allow that.  Want to rapid fire or bumpfire?  Bring it on! 

We have a nice plate rack to shoot at with pistols, a dueling tree for pistols or rifles, and many steel targets that will be set up at various ranges out to 500 yards.  Or if you want to shoot tiny groups on paper, you are welcome to bring your own targets.  

We will be making sure everyone in attendance understands how to safely handle their weapons.  We have an excellent safety record and strive to keep it that way. A safety briefing is held before any shooting starts and we require a waiver to be signed by everyone who joins us.  

This is a rain or shine event. We have a barn that we set up our tables in so we can hide from unfavorable weather.  

If you are an inexperienced shooter, please don't be shy- you won't be judged. None of us are super Navy SEAL tactical operator warrior ninjas.  We all just like to shoot, train and hang out with other firearms enthusiasts.   So bring your friends, neighbors, co workers or family to this fun event!  You will likely see a better selection of firearms and optics at our events than you have ever seen at any store.  I think I speak for all of our members when I say you are welcome to shoot any of our weapons for free as long as you pay for the ammo.  It is really a good opportunity to see what you may or may not like and learn about some of the different firearms out there.  

My number again is REDACTED.  We hope to hear from you soon! Thanks, Cody"

extremely hard to find Smith & Wesson 329 Night Guard. This powerful light weight scandium revolver is carries 6 rounds of .44 magnum! This revolver was a factory demo gun and has some light handling wear, however has not been fired since leaving the factory. Any handling wear is detailed in the pictures. It is equipped with a 2.5 inch barrel and an XS Tritium 24/7 front sight. The black fixed position rear sight helps pick up the bright front sight with lightning quick speed.

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too.

Note my real world velocities (below) from real world pistols, not laboratory test barrels.

No other product from a Connecticut Company commands more respect here in the Mid South than Colt. Ajax polymer grips have just the right combination of strength and flexibility to fit perfectly and survive well, even under steady diets of high velocity ammunition in a person’s Single Action Army. Here is Ajax’s number 01-IP, smooth imitation ivory finish, that will fit Colt Single Action Army Revolvers made since 1976. These will only fit a Single Action revolver whose grip frame is identical in every way with a modern post 1975 production Colt factory made Single Action Army. We do not recommend non-gunsmiths attempting to fit these for any other revolvers, folk can ruin the right panel if they don’t know what they’re doing. Other than that, these are perfect fits for any Colt Single Action Army whose serial number is 73201SA or higher; or a Center Fire New Frontier revolver whose serial number is 7501NF or higher. Caliber of the pistol does not matter. Brass screw is included, fully threaded and oversize length so it can be easily fitted for different frame thicknesses. These will not fit a First or Second Generation Single Action Army; will not fit a rimfire New Frontier, will not fit any .22 caliber Colt, will not fit any Ruger Revolver, will not fit a Beretta Stampede, will not fit a Uberti, will not fit the door lever of a 1937 Dodge Blue Bird School Bus. They will only fit Colt Single Action Army or Center Fire caliber New Frontier Revolvers that were manufactured in 1976 or later. Serialization is readily available from proofhouse com. Manufacturer, of course, was Ajax Custom Grips of Dallas, Texas. These grips are old stock Texas production that we found in an old Southern warehouse; Ajax now makes its home in Seneca, Missouri. These grips have not been shown, installed, handled or even displayed until our photographer opened them. We’re offering the Ajax 01IP, Imitation Ivory Grips for Colt Single Action Army or Center Fire New Frontier revolvers only, the grips in the photos or a set of their identical mates for only $ 29.00.

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
