Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit. Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine. Made in U.S.A. Will Not Ship this item to the following states due to High Capacity Magazine Restrictions: CA, CO, HI, MD, MA, NJ or NY."

The rifle is modified to accept detachable magazines and comes with two 10 round magazines. The rifle is set up to be 1000 yard capable. It includes a 4x-14x Magnification Primary Arms Front Focal Plane Mil-Mil scope with a bubble level that's really nice. Front Focal Plane scopes are diffrent then normal scopes and needed to shoot long ranges with a variable power scope, and this scope uses mil dots with mil adjustments.) Scope is mounted to a solid steel 20 MOA rail base with high quality scope mounts. Swiviling adjustable bipod is also included. The rifle has a heavy barrel that's needed for sustained precision shooting. It also has a custom bolt handle that is great for speedy bolt reloads. I have done work on the rifles stock to get it down to tiny groups approx 1/2"" MOA (MOA= Minute of Angle or group sizes at 100 yards). This is a high value long range rifle that's set up for sustained fire, fast bolt and quick reloading via 10 round detachable magazines... This rifle is in perfect condition and only has approx 250 rounds of ammo fired threw it, all of that ammo was shot to work on accurizing the rifle to get the best possible groups out if it again this rifle is shooting 1/2"" groups at 100 yards, this rifle is also capable of getting extremely good groups at long ranges 700-1,000 yards. If you are looking for an affordable long range precision rifle that's capable of fast sustained fire and quick magazine reloads this rifle is exactly what you're looking for. Note: The detachable magazine kit with two magazines cost approx $350 uninstalled. This rifle is super accurate and capable of getting the following group sizes.. 1/2"" groups at 100 yards. 1"" groups at 200 yards. 1 1/2"" groups at 300 yards 2"" groups at 400 yards. 2 1/2"" groups at 500 yards 3"" groups at 600 yards 3 1/2"" groups at 700 yards 4"" groups at 800 yards 4 1/2"" groups at 900 yards 5"" groups at 1000 yards... This is same rifle that is used by many snipers in SWAT units, military units and compitition shooters. This rifles accuracy also makes it one of the best hunting rifles on the planet... Ever wound a bear or dear? Ever have to follow a blood trail for too long? Well extreme accuracy allows consistent heart shots and drops the animals in their tracks. Buy this rifle and don't ever wound another animal and/or waste time tracking their blood trails. Here is a description of the target pictured below. At 100yds, put 23 rounds of 168gr Federal Premium Gold Medal Match into the target with groups ranging from .35MOA (top left) to .65 MOA (bottom right). The four shot group in the bottom left measured in at a hair under .5 MOA. Got down to the last round and I couldn't resist pluggin the barcode... All laws apply! FFL Transfer only."

The letter of verification from Smith and Wesson will accompany the pistol. I've owned this pistol since the mid 1980's. At that time, counterfeiting of this model was uncommon as the value of the pistol did not justify the risk of felony charges for altering the serial number of a firearm. This revolver was examined within the past two years by a prominent gun dealer and collector in Atlanta, GA and determined by him to be authentic and in 90% condition. He has good basis for this judgement, as he has been in business since the 1970's at the same location and owns five Aircrewman pistols: two Smiths and three Colts. He does not give written appraisals, but I will give his name and the name of his business to the buyer upon completion of the sale, if the buyer wishes to verify this. The pistol will be shipped by UPS next day air in a Smith and Wesson carry case, along with the letter of verification from S&W. Buyer will be responsible for shipping charges. Payment in the form of a cashier's check or USPS money order will be accepted and the pistol will be shipped as soon as the funds clear my bank. Thanks, and good luck."

The only thing added are a set of VZ grips which really set off the look of the pistol in my humble opinion. The original grip come with the weapon as does the case and all of the original paper from the factory.

It's also sporting a Phase 5 Extended Bolt Release (V2) and an Ergo grip.  There are a few other hidden gems in this setup as well.  While it has a milspec trigger, the contact surfaces have been mirror polished and greased to provide a very smooth surface for the moving components. It also has a reduced power hammer spring and a special grip screw that contains inside it, another set screw that allows the overall trigger take up to be reduced and the trigger pull drops to a very respectable 4-4.5 lbs. The lower also includes a set screw with a small nylon buffer to tighten the tolerances between the upper and lower, thus allowing fewer moving parts and overall a more accurate gun. The upper receiver has a heavy 16"" barrel with target crown chambered in .223 Wylde (allows you to shoot 5.56x45 or .223 Remington).  The barrel is also free floated and the quad rail provides plenty of room for all of your accessories. A micro gas block is installed and is  necessary to squeeze between the large barrel and the handguard.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***

This isn't one of the recent mass produced, stainless models. This was produced near the beginning of the Sendero line, during a period known for exceptional accuracy, fit, and finish.

Gun is in excellent shape. Minor marks that are consistent with any rifle that has been to the range a few times, but clean and well cared for. One ding in the metal of the recessed crown that was there when I bought the gun, but it doesn't affect or touch the muzzle opening of the barrel, and thus is cosmetic only.

Ive used it to get my springfield xd mod 2 for under $450 (shipping, transfer, taxes, etc all included in less than $450 and I got all of the promos). It doesn't take away from the ma and pa stores too because you still need an FFL dealer to get it for you and most places charge $15 or so for it, so they still get something.
ALSO! I use ebates like the commercials show and its totally legit. You get a $10 bonus when you spend $25 or more (Just go sign up with this link so that I get a bonus too for referring http://www.ebates.com/rf.do?referrerid=UY54qsshKEwAKDTvnHYOQQ%3D%3D&eeid=28187) 
After you get signed up, search for a store and then click on it and it takes you to that stores website( I get ammo from basspro, stuff from Walmart, etc.). Spend your first $25 and usually within a week you will have a $10 check mailed to you or I think theyre also doing a $10 Walmart gift card, but not certain. You also accumulate cash back on all purchases, usually between 1-5%. The reason you get paid is simply because other stores pay them for bringing in buyers. No scam or anything.
