MORE PICS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST! Blackacre Arms has a fully custom Gen 4 Glock 26 for sale. This firearm has it all. It started out as a like new Gen 4 Glock, but has been transformed into the ultimate carry gun. First the slide and barrel were ported. This allows you to run 147 grain and +P out of this little gun, with absolutely no recoil! You have to shoot it to believe it! Extra forward slide serrations were also added for better functionality. We also did a complete overhaul on the frame. The finger grooves and the backstrap grooves were deleted. We also did a exaggerated undercut and 45 degree front cut on the trigger guard. This allows you to get full hand grip higher on the frame and gives you another support up front. We then wrapped the entire frame in a small dot stipple pattern that provides excellent grip without excessive snagging when carrying. This also includes stippling in front of the takedown buttons for added support for your offhand. The Pearce +2 grip extensions were also added, giving you a capacity of 12+1. They were also stippled and contoured to match the frame. The gun was then professionally cerakoted by Brandon Bailey of Bullets and Blades in a custom matte OD Green, that is offset with matte black barrel and frame. The gun was finished off with Goshen Hexsights, which provide one of the fastest sight acquisitions available. It also includes both magazines that now hold 12 rounds, plus factory box and documents. Approximate values are shown in the features above, but to recreate this build you would have at least $1400 invested. RIGHT NOW ONLY ASKING $950 CASH TOTAL OUT THE DOOR! We also accept credit cards, card use forfeits a 3.5% cash discount. All firearms trades will be evaluated. Blackacre Arms is a FFL licensed custom shop located in Stanfield, NC. All federal, state and local laws apply. Shipping to a local FFL is available, if necessary. For any questions on this firearm or any of our custom work, message me direct.

SOLD.

I sold a Bond .45 LC/.410, so I don’t need the ammo I have that it can shoot (mainly the .45 Long Colt).  I have three boxes (two complete) of 45 Long Colt and/or .410 shot shells:

Remington Ultimate Defense combo – 10 45 Long Colt rounds (230 Grain Bonded JHP) and 10 .410 shot shells.
Winchester SuperX .45 Long Colt Lead Flat Nose, 225 grain - 1 partial box - 29 rounds of 50 left, includes used brass. 
Winchester PDX1 .45 Long Colt Bonded JHP rounds, 225 grain – 20 rounds.

Always stored indoors in a cool, dark, humidity-controlled storage cabinet. 

Figuring out how to price it is a little complicated, but here goes.  New at Midway, the Remington Ultimate as shown here is $30, the PDX1 is $27, and the Winchester SuperX is $20 for a box of 20 ($1 per round, and I have 29 rounds).  This doesn't include shipping and use tax.  Hence, we have about $80 worth of ammo.  

I’ll let it go for $60 for all the ammo and casings listed/shown in this ad.

I will sell only to somebody 18 or over.  ID will be checked, unless you look older than me :-)."

The CW-9 is a slim carry gun that is concealable, comfortable, and easy to shoot. 

Features:

Stainless steel slide (right under 1 inch thick and super concealable)
Polymer frame 
Tritium Night Sights on rear sights
Dawson precision fiber optic front sight post
2 stainless steel magazines ($35 each)
Stoner Pro Carry Concealment holster IWB ($75)
Wolf Reduced power striker spring AND factory new full power striker spring
Factory New magazine release and magazine release spring (original will be included as well. The reduced power spring lightens the trigger pull a bit for a comfortable and smooth pull)

I clean all of my guns extensively after each time shooting. I've only put ~150 rounds through it. At just under 6"" and with the leather holster, it is super comfortable to conceal. The Wolf reduced power striker spring makes the smooth and consistent trigger just a bit lighter. It's a solid gun that has never given me any malfunctions.

Trades: I'm not very accurate with glock-type triggers so I'm looking to get a DA/SA gun instead. If you have something comparable, lets talk.

Left side of slide has been lettered in red.  This weapon comes with two 15 round magazines and everything that came with the weapon from the factory such as the lock, changeable backstraps, side panels, spent factory cartridge, decal, owners manual and case. I am also including an H&K Weapons Record Book, something I maintain for all my weapons.  
There is no scratches or abrasions on this weapon, just like the day I purchased it.  This is one of the very finest weapons you will ever fire. I carried a Glock 9MM for many years as a LEO, the H&K VP9 is far superior.  All controls are ambidextrous. Slide releases on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left or right handed shooters.  Has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The VP9 pistol is made in Heckler & Koch's Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. 
Would rather transfer person to person and buyer must be eligible to purchase, NC concealed weapons permit or letter of authorization from the Sheriff's Office.
I am firm on the price, you will not find a finer weapon with such a smooth trigger pull.  I live near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, NC."

About the Handgun:
The PT-940 is a medium frame pistol that relies on the modified SIG-type Colt-Browning tipping-barrel locking system. Although part of the Taurus 92 series, this more compact model features an enclosed slide, straight backstrap and frame mounted decocking lever.
About the Manufacturer:
This company was founded in 1939 to make Smith & Wesson-type revolvers and is now part of a group that makes products ranging from hand tools to sports equipment. In 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's Sao Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs. By the early 1990s the company was employing more than 3000 people in four factories in Brazil. In order to more effectively tap the U.S. market, the company created a subsidiary in 1984 stationed in Miami, Taurus International Manufacturing Incorporated, also known as Taurus USA.
About the Cartridge:
This cartridge was developed as a joint venture between Winchester and Smith & Wesson. It was an effort to to create a cartridge with the same power as the 10mm Norma round that the FBI had just started using, but in a shorter case. The shorter cartridge would facilitate accuracy and allow use of a smaller, more comfortable grip frame. The .40 S&W has become the cartridge of choice for many law enforcement agencies in the United States.

I have for sale a S&W M&P Pro 40SW 5 inch with the Apex Tactical FSS kit, 10-8 rear sight, Apex failure proof extractor and 5 magazines. The gun is very accurate, functions perfectly and looks nearly new. This gun comes with all original factory materials, manual, spent case, 5 magazines - three of which have slightly beat-up steel aftermarket base pads from hitting the ground, but are fine otherwise. They ALL function properly. The gun has the stock front fiber sight and a 10-8 rear sight ($50 option). It has a complete Apex Tactical Forward Set Sear and trigger kit installed ($165 option), as well as the Apex failure proof extractor ($45 option). It has an approximate trigger pull of about 3.25 pounds, but will still go bang with CCI ammo. I use CCI as the test because they are the hardest primers on the market. This is a turn-key solution to someone wanting to get into USPSA competition or just desiring a really nice 40SW set-up. All of this gear would cost nearly $900 if purchased new. My loss is your gain as I am asking only $675 FTF. I also have a brand new CompTac competition holster that is available separately for $50. PLEASE NOTE: the holster and mag pouches shown in the first picture is not included as I do not own them anymore. Trade interests include a Gen 4 G19 (no Gen 3s) and cash but I would prefer an all cash deal. I am also looking for a CZ SP-01, a CZ Kadet or possibly a no manual safety Shield 9mm. All laws followed to include a signed bill of sale. THIS MEANS YOU MUST HAVE A NC CHP or a NC PPP and provide positive NC Identification. I prefer FTF transaction but will ship on your dime to your FFL. keywords: Smith and Wesson, S&W, M&P Pro, 40SW, 5 inch, Apex tactical, 10-8, USPSA"

Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. These Hollow Point Boat Tail bullets have a small meplat to produce a higher ballistic coefficient. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. The 30 Caliber 168 Grain MatchKing was developed in the late 1950s. It provides extreme accuracy at medium to long ranges. This is not loaded ammunition.

   I am relatively new to the forum and the world of AKs. I recently purchased a couple VEPRs with goals in mind for all of them. Now it seems as if my tactical SVD build may not happen. I know of BHA's sketchy reputation but I was still going to give them a try. Now I have learned from another forum that Jerry has most likely gone out of business. So now i would say that I am in desperate need of the following items for my build.

(4) Versa-Pod install Kits - http://blackhorsearsenal.com/Black-Horse-Arsenal-Versa-Pod-Install-Kit_p_69.html

If anyone has any of these items and are looking to sell I am greatly interested. Or if you know of somewhere that has some of them, or of even a like item from another MFG I am all ears.

Thank you,

From FN Herstal's website:
Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Highly Accurate
The accuray and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m. Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.

High Capacity Magazine
The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine.

Extremely Light and Ergonomic
The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.

Fully Safe
The FN Five-seveN MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing.

This is a performance center revolver that has a hand tuned PC action. 7 shot 357 magnum, 3 inch barrel, compensated, trijicon night sight, and cut for moon clips. I love revolvers and have had many, but this one has been truly exceptional. will also come with a couple of moonclips and a triple K leather holster. Its in pretty good shape, but is not NIB perfect, its been carried and fired (about 500 rounds), so Id say its in 90-95 % condition. 

Love it, but I'm thinking of going back to a K frame revolver. Would be interested in a K frame S&W revolver in trade with a 3 or 4 inch barrel in 38 special, round butt highly preferred (Model 10, 13, 15, 64, 65, 19, 66, similar) plus cash or possibly other firearms depending on what you have. Trade value is $1000-1100 .

I would sell for $900 firm if you'd rather buy.
Feel free to contact me at three 16 six 19 nine 853 if interested, texts preferred, thanks!"

The gun has the Custom Shop blue box, the white sleeve, and all items and paperwork the gun was shipped with.   I have tried to add pictures of my actual gun but armslist seems to be having technical issues.   I can email them to a serious potential buyer.   These are seldom offered for sale and although I am saying the gun is worth what some people have asked, you will find listings online as high as $10,000.  Prefer a face-to-face sale in Central Ohio.  If I ship the gun to your FFL, the cost will be $75 because the box will be large (it will have the gun and display case in it) and the cost of insurance for full value will be high.  If the gun is sold locally, it must be cash only.  If I ship it, shipping will be delayed until the money order has been deposited for 5 business days.  Blame all the scammers for the short delay.

This version is hard to find in Massachusetts.  The safety can be removed if you don't like it but it's a nice feature.

This is a ""free state"" model with the better trigger, not the terrible Massachusetts trigger.  No need for APEX kit.

This is a police trade in and says the dept. name on the right side of the slide.  Like many police trade ins, it looks like it's been carried a lot and fired little.  There is minor holster wear on the slide and right side of the grip.  The grip, however, is now fully wrapped in a Talon Grip overlay, which both looks great and makes it impossible to slip in your hand.  The night sights work well but are not what I would call bright.

This is a great looking and shooting firearm.  I looked for over two years to find this model, and sadly, as soon as I got it and shot it the first time, I realized it was a little too big for my purposes.  I AM carrying it every day until I sell it, and it is quite concealable if that's what you want it for, with the right belt and holster.

This gun includes three new (only used one time at the range) 10 round magazines, the original plastic case, all three backstraps, talon grips, and whatever else is in the bag.  I will also include 50 rounds of Golden Saber +P hollow points to get you started.

All laws followed.  Must have LTC A.
