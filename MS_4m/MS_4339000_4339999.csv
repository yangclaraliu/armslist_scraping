I want to sell the bow bare. The bow has a D-loop and 1/4"" peep sight installed. I am asking $395.
If you want to buy the bow with a arrow rest and sight installed (ready to shoot) I can sell complete for $595
The sight is a Montana Black Gold Vengeance, 5 pin, all pins .019"", 6"" dovetail, 3 axis adjustments ($220 brand new) and a Trophytaker Smackdown Pro rest ($120 brand new). I bought the sight and arrow rest brand new and they both still look brand new.
I would like to sell the bow locally but I can also ship it if somebody is interested out of the area. Let me know if you have any interest and/or questions.

Bow Specifications:
IBO/ATA speed: 345-350 fps

Dark Earth Brown
The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter Battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required
Trijicon is the first to market with its unique dark earth brown color, a definite factor to concealment- directly contributing to the safety of the operator, who is often in harm's way
This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or RMR sight
With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand truly the best of both worlds.
No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

Nikon's BDC reticle offers shooters and hunters a revolution in accuracy and ease of use for long-range shooting. By incorporating small aiming circles into the reticle, the BDC allows shooters precise but unobtrusive aiming points. Each circle of the reticle allows three separate aiming points - top, bottom, or middle of the circle. By matching each load and each gun to these separate aiming points, the BDC reticle offers the ultimate in precision shooting. 

The standard Nikon BDC is designed to be used with most standard centerfire cartridges with typical bullet weights, providing aiming points out to 500 yards with a 100-yard sight-in. With magnum cartridges and typical bullet weights, the same scopes with BDC reticles offer aiming points out to 600 yards with a 200-yard sight-in. 

The BDC 250 is designed specifically for .50 caliber muzzleloaders using 150-grain powder charges and 250-grain bullets. When sighted in at 100 yards on the crosshair at 9x, the BDC 250 provides aiming-point circles at 150, 200, 225, and 250 yards. The BDC 200 is designed specifically for slug gun loads. When sighted in on the crosshair at 50 yards, the BDC 200 has two ballistic circles that represent 100-yard and 150-yard aiming points, and a lower reticle post that represents a 200-yard aiming point."

As you can see from the pictures, the original fore end and stock were replaced with ATI tactical replacements.  This was not done for any ego or silly reason of looks.  I originally bought this for my Son to hunt with and this made the weapon lighter and also allowed for the changing of lengths using the adjustable stock, so he could lengthen it as he grows bigger, but he just doesn't care much for hunting. I believe I have the originals if that were to be a needed component for the sale. I will just have to search some boxes to find them.  Included is also the padded shoulder strap you see on it, and a Bushnell Banner Dusk and Dawn 3-9x40 scope with a 6"" eye relief.  I will also include 25 of the .44 special bullets you see in the pictures, and if you're a reloader, will include 47 empty shells as well for you to reload.  Price is 280.00.  Have over 500.00 invested. Prefer texts at 574 three seven seven, 6314. thank you.  UPDATE: in an effort to clean weapon extra well for a potential buyer who was VERY anal about any single spec on it, I actually cleaned too much and took off some of the bluing on the barrel.  Obviously for those who know guns, this will not effect performance or even rusting chance if weapon is cleaned and oiled properly after each use.  Regardless, I know this will lessen value of weapon because buyer will most likely want to reblue it or have it reblued.  So I have lowered the price to 280.00.  Cash only, no trades, and local pick up.  No scammy ""send it to me and i'll pay you with paypal"" crap.  Thank you."

15 round tube magazine.  Open sights.  Very good condition, better than most.
Bought this for my nephew, but turns out he doesn't have the reach he needs for
fitting to the gun very well.  This is a good 22 rifle for parents wanting to train their
children, and for the adults.  LOP is 13 1/4 inches.  About 7 lbs. Trigger is solid and will fire every time.  You can buy newer rifles at Academy, but you can't buy this one.
A collector for sure. Parts are still available at Numrich's Gun Parts. For those concerned, you can still get NORMAL priced 22 ammo at Walmart.  Just get up at 6am and get in line.  Use Brass Badger to find where it will be. Lines are usually not longer than 4-6 people. WM has a 3-box limit, so you have a fair chance to get some.  I have.
Don't be a victim of scalpers.  $150 boxes of 22 is insane. Please, no trade offers.

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age 
of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items. 

I also offer transfers from any online retailer and or any other FFL dealer.

I bought a 12 gauge benelli nova as my first sporting clays gun to get into the sport. I since have gone a different route, but loved the nova so much it has become my home defense shotgun. With that said, a 28"" barrel doesn't exactly lend to swinging around corners all that stealthily. So I am parting ways with the old field equipment. Barrel has minor wear consistent with normal use. No rust or deep gouges. Barrel is still super shiny. I clean my guns EVERY time I shoot them. I never used the Full but maybe once, the Modified has very light use, and the IC clearly was used the most but in totally I probably put less than 150 rounds through the barrel. The 12 gauge barrel, chokes, and choke tool new from benelli are the same if not sometimes more than the cost of the whole gun so I am giving it to a new home at a much lower price. Looking for 250 but willing to take offers. Worst I can say is No, best I can say is Heck yeah, get over here and let's do this already!"

If you know anything about pistols this isn't a range gun so it does not have many rounds through it.

Stainless steel slide model, 2 magazines and it will come with 2 Galco holsters as well as 120 rounds or so of RN ammunition.  I have found the same gun new online for $239 plus shipping and FFL transfer fees.  I will take $220 and you'll get 2 nice holsters plus enough ammunition to wear your wrist out in a day.  I am located in 46531 zip. I have no interest in traveling very far for a sale unless you are wanting to trade for a Les Baer or Barrett."

That makes the 1911A1 .45 Martial Arms Pistol (Colonel Waldemar Broburg-Chief & Principal Ordnance Inspector) an early 1942 production and the Colt Service Model Ace .22 Conversion Unit was shipped from the Colt Factory to the United States Government/U.

(See included Colt Archive Letter) Both Colts are in very good condition with Proper Inspection Marks and the 1911A1 .45 Pistol has the matching serial number stamped on the Slide behind the Firing Pin Stop.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

The best AK Made! Carrying case, 1 x 30 shot and 1 x 5 shot clips. • System of operation - Gas, Semi-automatic fire only • Bolt type - Rotating • Weight (unloaded) - 7.6 lbs. • Length, barrel - 16.33 inches • Length, overall - 35.43 inches • Feed device - 5-30 round detachable box magazine or Drums (also accepts standard AK types) • Sights, front - Hooded post • Sights, rear - Tangent leaf, graduated from 100 to 800 meters • Cartridge - 7.62 x 39 Soviet M43 muzzle. The fit and finish of the SLR-95 is excellent. It has none of the burrs and poor finish that plague many SKS's. Unlike the MAK-90's and Maadi's, the SLR-95 is milled steel rather than stamped. The stock and handguard fit without any wobble or spaces (unlike some of the SKS's and MAK-90's I've encountered). All metal parts come with a black finish. The stock and handguard are black polymer a sling is also provided. Trigger pull is very crisp. The Bulgarian SLR 95 is one of the best post ban AK variant around. It is hard to find this type of quality. The Bulgarian SLR-95 is a milled AK variant that was imported into the United States from 1994 to 1998. It is a post ban version of the AK produced by Arsenal of Bulgaria. The new Arsenal rifles cannot hold a candle to the SLR-95. The new Arsenal rifles just aren't made as nicely. The action and the trigger are extremely slick. Only a few were built like this before they quit making them. The most accurate rifle I've ever fired!. About 500 rounds only! Almost excellent condition with slight wear."

Nice Browning Auto-5 Magnum Twenty. 28"" Modified Barrel. Vent Rib.  

Solid wood with nice pattern. Usual hunting scratches, nothing major.

Nice overall bluing. Some minor pitting on right lower side of receiver. Nice engraving. Solid action and everything is nice and tight. 1980 manufacture meaning Japanese and use can use steel shot unlike the Belgium Auto-5's.

These Auto-5 Magnum Twenties don't come up very often for sale as they are much sought after and people that have them usually keep them as they are great all around guns. 

Additionally, the 20 gauge shotgun (regardless of manufacturer) has grown tremendously in popularity the last 3 years.

FTF in Allendale (West of Grand Rapids) or will ship CONUS (except California. At least until I check into shipping laws there) for $40 insured and tracking. 

Thanks."
