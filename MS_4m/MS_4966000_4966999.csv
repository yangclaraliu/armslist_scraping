It's an incredibly light AR, probably one of the lightest you will ever hold without spending $3000. Haven't weighed it but I'd say around 6 pounds. Yes, for 1300 you could buy a Colt or a SIG, but they won't be as light, they won't be as easy to clean, they won't be as comfortable. This could easily be a performance rifle if you put the trigger work in and lose a little more weight(not that there's any to lose). I'll add pictures soon, just gauging the interest if there is any.

I picked up this Taurus a few months ago along with the Insight X2. I'm the original owner of both. It's had about 200rds of mixed FMJ/JHP (all brass) down the pipe without a single issue. The light has a total of ~10mins of use. It's been sitting in the safe since then and is in like new condition. We have a baby on the way and the wife insists I have ""too many"" guns. But having one less gun probably isn't a bad thing given her mood swings.

The original Taurus box was beat up when I got it, but I've saved the suede bags, accessories, and literature. The warranty card is still blank. I do have the original X2 box, literature, and extra (unused) bulb. The pistol also comes with 2 mags.

Price is firm at $260. Selling as a package for cash F2F with permit holders only (though I may entertain trades for large jars of pickles, bags of sour gummy worms, or Mexican restaurant gift certificates).

Up for sale is a new, as received from the factory, Remington M24 Rebuild SWS Sniper Rifle, with military issue optic and accessories.  It is chambered for the 7.62mm NATO cartridge and is a true M24.  It comes with a military target sling, and Remington manual, and original box. 

The M24R is both an authentic piece of American military history, and also a superbly accurate target rifle.  The M24 was the first dedicated sniper rifle system designed and developed for use by the US military.  It was selected over other rifle models from both Winchester and Steyr in 1987.  Since that time, over 15,000 have been built; seeing combat with the US military (and its Allies) in many environments and situations.  It is still in service today, though being slowly phased out in favor of more modern designs such as the XM2010 and M110. 

The M24 is based on Remington's time-proven Model 700 action, which itself was based on the legendary Mauser Model 98.  It is a manually operated bolt action, with an internal 5 round magazine.  It is fitted with a 24"" long extra-heavy barrel, featuring Remington's 5R rifling (very precisely cut and with slightly rounded edges for maximum bullet stability). Standard chamber is for the 7.62x51mm NATO round, though the M24's extended receiver does allow for longer and more powerful cartridges to be used if a different barrel is installed.  The weapon is extremely accurate, and has a range of 800+ yards.  This while remaining reliable in all climates, and as durable as an M1A1 tank.

During the M24E1/XM2010 proposal preparation process, the Remington team realized that essentially almost all of the parts of the M24 were going to be removed and discarded. In the past when Remington conducted M24 overhauls they were required by the government to De-militarize (destroy) all the serviceable system components that were removed.  However, during the reconfiguration to the XM2010 most of the M24 parts removed would be serviceable but would still have to be DE-militarized.  The proposal team recognized an opportunity and decided to offer the Government a contract price reduction for a complete set of serviceable parts if Remington would be allowed to resell these parts in the form of complete sniper systems on the commercial firearms & collector market. 

Remington was unsure if the Army could overcome the institutional and regulatory hurdles to agree to this part of their proposal.  After many months of work by the PM Soldier Weapons program office, in coordination with their legal counsel and the Army Materiel Command, approval was granted for the transfer of all serviceable M24 parts to Remington Arms in exchange for a reduced contract price on respective XM2010s. 

""Despite the long history and dedicated service of the M24 Sniper Weapon System, its end-of-service life has created an opportunity for the dedicated military collector and/or long range shooting enthusiast.  Remington has begun to convert these surplus parts into nearly new rifles.  Each rifle will have a new M24 profile heavy barrel, M24 action (marked with the original M24 designation and drilled and tapped for the receiver mounted open sights), and trigger.  Aside from these critical parts, all other system parts will be 100% serviceable surplus if at all possible (new parts may be substituted where needed). "" - from the Remington website.

Features Of The M24R Include: 
- M700 Long Action Receiver (convertible to fire .300 Win Mag) 
- 40X externally adjustable milspec trigger (from 2 lb to 8 lbs) 
- 24"" 416-R Stainless Barrel with 5R rifling with 1-11.25” twist rate 
- H-S Precision Kevlar Graphite composite stock with a full-length aluminum bedding block, adjustable length of pull, ambidextrous palm swell on grip, and a beaver-tail-type fore-end.

Remington's M-24 Sniper Weapon System is the finest long-range system available today. It delivers multiple-shot capacity with match rifle accuracy at extended ranges. In addition to the M24's unsurpassed accuracy, it also offers reliability and durability under the harshest conditions of combat use and transportation.

Designed for and used by the United States Military, the M24's popularity also stretches from SWAT teams nationwide to International Military and Government agencies. Based on Remington's legendary Model 700™ and 40-X™ rifles, famous for their ""out of the box"" accuracy, the M24 has quickly gained a reputation for precision among the sniper system community. An essential element in the M-24's accuracy is its heavy, hammer-forged, stainless steel, Rem-Tough powder-coated barrel. The barrel's unique 5-R rifling delivers combined advantages of reduced bullet deformation and metallic fouling, even pressure curves, higher bullet velocities and longer barrel accuracy life. The M-24's H-S Precision® aramid fiber-reinforced, fiberglass stock with an aluminum bedding block, is utilized for exceptional strength and dimensional stability in all weather conditions. Combined with its sophisticated sighting options, the M-24's Sniper Weapon System remains the standard against which all sniper systems are compared.

About 40 rounds down the pipe.  This pistol has a fantastic double-action trigger...very smooth.  Smaller than the PPK/S (James Bond had a PPK NOT a PPK/s), and even though it is all steel, it feels very light - like my Sig P232 alloy.  Includes the box, the papers that came with it, and two magazines.  One is a flat bottom, and the other has the pinky extension.  This pistol is very accurate - as accurate as my p232.  I decided to go all SIG, so I don't have to guess what action I have with me on any particular day.  So what happened to all the Walther PPK's?  I can't seem to find any for sale (some PPK/S's are advertised as PPK's), and apparently the blue model is really scarce.  I like this pistol, and don't really want to give it up, but alas, I have too many, so it must go.  If you have any questions or need any more pictures, feel free to make a request!  If you want to look at it, I and it are in Janesville WI.  

Requirements:  No Felons, No Illegals etc. - If you don't speak English, don't contact me.
You must be a U.S. Citizen, and have no criminal charges pending, particularly domestic disputes.  You can buy face to face if you are a Wisconsin Resident.  If you are a resident of another state, shipping will go through my FFL to your FFL - you pick up the extra charges.  I want any transactions to follow the law.

Trades?  I might consider a recent Sig P226 9mm with SRT and night sights or the current Navy model.  I also might consider a Ruger #1 in .35, .338 or 9.3x62  Anything else? - you can ask, but not likely.  Thanks for your consideration!"

I recently bought a few other firearms, and as much as it pains me, I need to make some room. I bought this originally a few years ago from one of my friends whose father carried it as a service pistol so to the best of my knowledge I am the only other owner. The gun has textured grip panels which make the grip slightly thinner and feels much better in the hands than the hard plastic grips you usually see on a p220. On top of this, the gun also has night sights which are still fairly bright. It is still in good shape and will come with one 8rd clip as well as a box of 50 shells. I do not need to sell this but I am open to reasonable offers so I look forward to hearing from you. I work in Duluth during the day but am located in Smyrna so if you need to meet during the day I can accommodate you around either areas.

A passion for precision describes the level of quality Swarovski incorporates into this 80mm, aluminum body spotting scope. From the razor-sharp images to the day-to-day functionality, customers love their Swarovski HD scope. The HD scopes have fluoride-containing lenses to minimize color fringing, offer sharp, high-contrast images, and benefit digiscoping results. Excellent light transmission is achieved with the fully multi-coated and Swarotop lens coatings. You'll find the Swaroclean coating keeps your view clear as it works to repel water and residue from external lenses. The excellent 16-foot close focus allows you to enjoy scoping in the backyard when you can't get out in the field. Swarovski provides a limited lifetime warranty for their spotting scopes."

It's got a 20"" barrel and the iron sights are pretty well dead on, it's shockingly accurate for an AK platform. It's a great rifle and like my other Saiga it's always functioned 100%. The only thing I've done was put a saw style grip on instead of the stock one and gave the original to my mother for her rifle. Comes with one steel 30rd East German Weiger magazine and 4 tapco 30rd mags. All magazines functioned perfectly when tested. I've also seen conversion kits to make this rifle accept AR15 magazines. Reason for selling, wife and I both got Tavors, so the Saiga 223 doesn't see much use anymore. Asking $700 OBO. Very very few trades considered. Really rather have cash. I DO NOT want your Hi-Point and Taurus collection especially though. 

I know it's not legally required but I'll want to peak at a permit to purchase/carry and a drivers license. We'll fill out a bill of sale (which I'll provide) with both of us receiving identical copies."

It has a full length stainless guide rod, a dual thumb safety and has ""Kensight"" brand Tritium Night Sights added (target style)(The sights alone sell for $160+s&h). The original Target sights are included.  It has a match barrel.  This is the Wide body-Para frame.  Very comfortable to hold, and the perception of recoil is less with this frame.  It's like holding a Browning Hi-Power.  Checkered front strap and mainspring housing.  The downside:  includes two 10-round Clinton Magazines.  The larger capacity (15/16 rounders) are available if you want them and you shop around.  Also, this was used as a nightstand gun, and the previous owner changed out the sights and left a couple of peen marks (very minor) while installing the new sights.  They aren't much, but they are there (mostly on the side of the rear sight).  This is a very nice pistol.  The limited pistols were about $1200 new.

Winchester combined richly colored and highly figured American walnut with deeply blued and gold plated metals to produce an heirloom collectible centered on the legendary Model 1894 lever action carbine chambered in the .30-30 caliber. The receiver features deep relief John Ulrich pattern engraving with game scenes on both sides of the receiver. The accompanying Winchester booklet states that the engraving is “a classic reproduction of one of the finest styles developed under John Ulrich at the start of the 20th century. American-style scroll-work and animal scenes became a recognition point of supreme quality.” The receiver, barrel band and lever are gold plated with a soft luster matte finish. The wonderful stocks are XXX fancy walnut with a fine, multi-point checkered walnut forearm and straight grip stock. The butt stock is graced with a smoothly curved crescent, steel buttplate. The 20 inch blued, round barrel is mounted with a ramped, adjustable buckhorn rear sight and a blade front sight. Two blued barrel bands hold the barrel to the forearm and to the cartridge tube magazine. The barrel is inscribed on the right rear side with “LIMITED EDITION BY WINCHESTER” in cursive script. This beautiful rifle comes with a fitted presentation case that appears to be walnut topped, with mahogany sides and bottom. The case interior is lined in wine colored fabric. Includes a covered compartment for a box of cartridges (not included) or accessories. Leather ""Winchester"" label on the inside of the top. The case has three brass latches with the center one incorporating a key lock. The bottom of the case is covered in green felt. Case dimensions are: length at 42 ½ inches; width at 10 3/8 inches; height at 3 1/8 inches. Papers include: Winchester Limited Edition booklet, serialized in hand to the rifle; a letter from Phil H. TBD, President of Olin Winchester Group indicating that this Winchester was manufactured on February 22, 1978; 13 cent address envelope to be used to order a custom brass name plate for the case; Winchester “Sporting Arms Purchase Card”. Complete with original box numbered to the rifle and sleeve, and case shipping box. Rifle Weight is approximately 6 pounds 5 ounces. LOP is approximately 13 ¼ inches. New in case, with only the slightest handling/storage marks overall. The case is excellent with a few scattered handling marks. This is one of the finest examples of this Limited Edition you can find. 

This was my grandfathers and was part of his collection, I don't want to get rid of it and have done the research and found others sold for around $2700 so my price is pretty firm at $2500. Gun has never been fired and is a collectors piece so I'd be looking for a buyer who views it as such.

I am left handed and and it kicks the first round of every clip in to my forehead, leaving a nice deep cut. I have fired 3 clips off and it has happened 3 times. 24 rounds have been fired through it with no issues other than me being repeatedly pinged with brass. Its really discouraging because i have wanted this rifle for years.. Got it, and spent another several months treating the stock wIth linseed oil. The stock looks amazing and the rifle cycles perfectly. If you check the cmp website, you can get additional info. It has a new criterion barrel and all the parts are original but have been repakerized. It has the hra action in the middle 5 million which puts it around the 1950s. Internals are a mix of springfield and hra.

I am very firm on the price since thats what i paid from the cmp, plus 50$ shipping, and a 6 month wait. I have some 147 grain .308 ammo i can include wIth it for an additional cost.

Comes wIth case, rifle, 3 enbloc clips, gi sling, and cmp certificate

You could always order your own from the cmp, but there are a lot of requirements to be able to order through them, as well as shipping. With this one, you get it immediately although it has had 24 entire rounds through it, plus two extra enbloc clips ( not expensive) and the momths of work that went in to the new stock to make it look right instead of pale brown. I can send more pictures by request, but it would be much better to meet in person and let you see it. I have heard about putting tape and foam around the deflector to stop brass from hitting in the face, but theres no way im going to bubba a garand. Nor am i going to let a rifle sit in the safe and not get used.

Will not trade for any shotguns or pistols ( with the possible exception on a s&w 500 long barrel)

This shotgun is ridiculous, it eats and cycles every type of ammo you can throw at it, from target loads all the way through rifled slugs...shoots as fast as you can pull the trigger.
