Have a very lightly used custom built mil-spec AR-15 for sale. Platform is based on a mil-spec forged aluminum Double-Star lower receiver. It has a laser etched ""zombie slayer"" graphic on the right side magwell. Cool if your into the zombie thing, but if not, hit it with a cheap ceracote or rustoleum paint (like 95% of the military) and you won't ever see it again. The left side has the cool looking double star dragon , which is actually stamped in to the forging. 

Features:
- Upper is Aero Precision M4,married to mil-spec M4 (Govt) profile barrel. 
- Barrel is wilson arms, and is chambered in 5.56 NATO (so you can shoot either .223 OR 5.56 NATO), with 1/9 twist. It comes with the standard A2 flash supressor.
- Semi-auto BCG and was built with a CMMG milspec lower parts kit. 
-Midwest industries free floated quad-rail. 
-Mil-Spec buffer tube, buffer, and black magpul CTR stock.
-Comes with a YHM Flip Up Sight (~$100). 
- Magpul moe+ rubberized grip.

This gun has only been through a thorough 200 round barrel break in process and it was very accurate out to 200 yards with the irons. Great starting platform, or battle ready as-is. fun gun to shoot, it is light and tite. The upper lower match-up is better than any I have seen (forged). Takedown and pivot pins still maintain smooth action, and are easily operated despite the great fit.

I am a responsible gun owner and I will only sell this weapon to other responsible gun owners. That said, the sale will be face to face, and will be backed by a bill of sale, and a copy of stateID/CHL(preferred). No trades at this time.

They're all much the same price at local dealers, so I reckon a straight-across-the-board swap should work for all concerned.

From Beretta:

Pico - The Most Concealable .380 for Personal Defense and Home Protection

At only 18mm wide, the Pico is the thinnest .380 semiauto handgun on the market, making it a best in class for concealed carry and home defense.
Besides being light, small and concealable, it offers easy use, adjustable sights, an ultra-reliable low-recoil mechanism and a tough, durable finish that--with proper care--will give you a virtual lifetime of service.

Comfortable to Conceal and Carry

Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.

Soft-recoiling and Absolutely Reliable

The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.

Easy to Disassemble and Customize, Loaded with Features, Made in USA

Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms."

All i get are low offers and quotes from auction sites and places like buds and cdnn.
 Funny how you people love to use some other website to personally label every gun value we have but if i do it to you then let the butthurt begin.  A certain idiot quoted me how cheap he can get at buds and i accepted it.  The next day he had it listed for 150 over what my original price was.  I had a buddy email him quoting buds price and he cursed out my friend.  Kinda hypocritical isnt it????
 Why dont we close all local gunshops and remove armslist and all facebook groups since everyone can get any gun so much less at buds and cdnn ?   
  And just because some moron needing his crack fix sells his 700 dollar gun for 300 on some site does NOT  make that price the new value of that gun. 
 How about you assholes start trading and selling like the old days when people done it for fun not as a career.  It has become easier to buy a new home than it is to buy a gun on here.  And whats with the 1 million questions?  If someone posts a rem 700 3006 in mint condition with scope than its what it says why ask who made the screws in scope mounts when was the buttpad mad and all the other stupid questions.   
 Are there any honest men on here anymore?  You need a job? Then go get a normal job and stop destroying the last good gun trading selling site we have for local transactions. 
 You want to buy from buds and cdnn?  FIne remove armslist from your computer so the rest of us can get back to making deals."

This gun, sn130853 made in 1931 is quite a different Sterlingworth in that it was shipped as a ""Deluxe Sterlingworth"" meaning it had double ivory beads and a factory pad. It is very hard to find a Sterlingworth with EJECTORS, as this one has, and even harder to find one with 99% factory case color and 97% factory blue. Balanced dead on the hinge pin and weighing just 7lbs. 3oz., it is a perfect field or clays guns at an affordable price. And with the extra features and condition, it is an investment that will grow in value as you enjoy its use. Shipped with 2 3/4"" chambers and nice shooting dimensions as well!

What do you have to trade?

Up for sale is a relatively rare motorcycle, a 1999 Moto Guzzi, and an even more rare model, the California Bassa V11, which was only offered in 1999 and 2000. The bike sat in storage most of its life. I purchased it in December 2012 knowing that the engine had not run since 2006. I parked it in my garage for another year. One year later I finally moved it unto the motorcycle lift and started working on it. 

It fired right up for the 1st time in 8 years after,
> cleaning out and sealing the fuel tank, 
> replacing the fuel lines, 
> filters, 
> pump, 
> injectors, 
> engine oil, 
> all air & oil filters 
> and the spark plugs.

Then I proceeded to restore and upgrade as the weeks and months went by, like
> replaced upper & lower forks with V1100 Jackal,
> replaced shocks with adjustable 1500 Kawasaki Nomad,
> replaced front blinkers with 1500 Kawasaki Nomad,
> replaced rear directional with 750 Kawasaki Vulcan,
> replaced mirrors with 750 Kawasaki Vulcan,
> factory exhaust with flow through glass packs,
> custom paint here and there like on the valve covers, etc.

Also during that time my health changed to where I cannot ride a motorcycle any longer. So reluctantly I am looking for a new owner for the Bassa. Hopefully someone who knows what a great motorcycle that those Italians at the Moto Guzzi plant know how to manufacture! The few times I did get to drive it, people would go out of their way to tell me what a very nice motorcycle that I had because it looks aharp and its not just another Harley or Honda! It's truly different!

Everything works as it should but there are several things still lacking that I just cannot get around to finish on the bike:
> The fuel tank needs finishing touches of paint up underneth at the edges - nothing major.
> It needs a new rectifier, which is mounted onto the frame and easy to get to - eBay has them for $80.
> I have a few spokes I ordered for the wheels where they broke in a couple of places (wheels do not have to be removed to install the spokes).
> The clutch slips under very hard acceleration, but is fine otherwise. But that would need to be fixed before any serious riding.
> Has a very small oil leak noticable after a ride - not enough to worry about damaging the engine, but annoying because it leaves a small oil spot where it is parked.

Sorta lost track of the time and money which I have put into it, but I am guestimating around $6,500. With its first exposure to the public, I am asking only $3,500.

2 summers ago the entire front end was replaced including ball joints, tie rods, wheel hubs, cv joints, rear axle oil changed, transfer case flushed/changed, and brakes/rotors all around.   Last summer the engine was redone with head gaskets, intake gaskets, rebuilt heads, plugs, coils, exhaust manifolds, alternator, belt, power steering pump and hoses, thermostat, etc. The only thing that could be done to it at this time is replacing the windshield. It cracked last fall and I just haven't had it replaced yet.

I am selling my beautiful,  excellent condition Sig Sauer P226 SAS Gen 1 DAK trigger chamber in 40sw.  This gun is in superb condition, I can't find any blemish on it.  The gun has been fired, but in no way mistreated, 50 rounds down the pipe by me( unkown count before that, but doesn't look like it was fired that much).   It is a safe queen.  If u r reading this add, more than likely you know this configuration is no longer made or offered by Sig Sauer.  It is in my opinion a collectible piece.  Built in 2006 base on test fire case envelope date.  SAS gen 1 models are awesome, I wanted to collect all of them, but it has prooven difficult, the ones I found where either beat up, or up in the $1k + area.  Enough said, I will let the pictures speak for themselves, even though the gun looks more beautiful in person. 
Included: 
-P226 SAS chambered in 40sw with upgraded trijicon night sights($130 sights) 
-2 Factory mags in excellent condition 
-Factory box and accessories.  
I used the blue Sig Sticker, so that is not included. 
I will deal ftf in Melbourne, Space coast, and Miami Area only, but...  
 If someone wants to pay for actual shipping thru my FFL, I will be willing to do that, I am estimating an approximate cost of $40 to ship.  I will charge actual cost only, if is less/more than that, I will let you know. 
Price: $900 ftf or add shipping cost. 
Trade:  looking for a P226 xfive tactical older version or newer one.  In good condition, nothing beat up please.  I will add Cash.

None of the screws are buggered up (as is so often the case) This rifle was manufactured in 1907 (S/N 4540XX) . It looks great and functions perfectly , for a 108 year old gun !"

### Brief History
The Jericho 941 is a double action/single action semi-automatic pistol developed by Israel Military Industries. The Jericho 941 was modeled on the well-respected CZ-75 pistol designed and produced by Česká zbrojovka of Czech Republic and built using parts supplied by the Italian arms house Tanfoglio. The Jericho 941 features a polygonal barrel. Magazines for the CZ-75 and Tanfoglio T95 will function in the Jericho 941. One innovation by IMI was a new, much ""hotter"" cartridge, the .41 Action Express to go along with the Jericho 941. The difference between 9mm and .41 AE is the same as .44 Magnum and .50 AE. The AE bullets have rebated rims which are the same diameter as the less powerful rounds, but the casing is wider, providing more power. This allows these pairs of calibers to be used in the same firearm with only a change of barrel, recoil spring and magazine"

Most of the pouches had attaching rings on the sides for carrying straps, but early on in the war pouches were made to slide onto the USGI Web belt. They have a loop sewn onto the back with no rings or strap. They were usually carried singly or in pairs and many were marked with the manufacturers (most common were RUSCO). The unmarked pouches are harder to find as fewer were made.

This pouch is one of the rarer unmarked pouches, but is exactly the same color canvas and piping as a pair of RUSCO pouches I have (not for sale) so my guess is this pouch is RUSCO made but unmarked.

It was used and has small rust stains inside in the usual places, the canvas is a bit stretched around the snap but everything is still solid.
The only BAD spots are a small snag on the upper edge (about 10 o'clock) under the flap and a small (pencil-sized) hole around 8 o'clock near the edge. The threads coud be ulled back into the weave with a hook and the area stabilized with a drop of super-glue but I'd leave that to the new owner....and it shows just fine as it is!

Unlike many other used pouches, this one has never been washed so is still in good shape and relatively clean....a nice original GI bringback pouch that will be a nice addition to your collection.

Look at the pics....I have more and can send more but only have two posted here.

Asking $125.00 local here in Minnesota or $130 shipped USPS conus.

Emphasis is on the safe handling of firearms at all times, the proper use of firearms for self-defense and the defense of others, and the lawful application of deadly force.

I traded for this pistol. It is like new with no signs of wear. The pistol has a test fire date of February 7, 2014. I installed the scope base. I bought and installed the sights you see in photos from shopruger.com. I also installed TandemCross Steel Hammer Bushing and Loaded Chamber Indicator Insert. The installation of these two items makes this an almost perfect pistol. The hammer bushing allows for easier takedown for cleaning and allows the pistol to be fired without the magazine inserted. The Loaded Chamber insert eliminates the ruger LCI which is plastic and decreases reliability and makes cleaning more difficult. I have all the original parts and they will go with this pistol. I have $80 in parts in this pistol. You will not be disappointed versus the stock version of this pistol. 

Also included in this sale/trade: (2) Ruger 10-round magazines, Ruger plastic case, Owners manual, decals, gun lock, pistol lock key.

.35 Whelen cartridge and features a 24-inch Douglas barrel of 
the “S” configuration for perfect weight and balance. 

In addition to its custom barrel, this Number One also features 
beautiful casehardening of the receiver, lever, and grip cap.

The beautiful stocks are original to the rifle and did not require
replacement to create this spectacular custom rifle. This also keeps
the cost for a Trophy Ruger No.1 at a reasonable price. Custom wood
for a Number One will generally add an additional $4000 to the price.

Also included with the rifle are loading dies, 100 new brass cases,
and both jacketed and lead bullets. 

All in all, this custom Ruger No.1 is a handsome Trophy Rifle that is 
capable of handling any game in North America with ease. And with
heavier bullets, most anything in Africa as well.

Because I rebuild Custom Ruger No.1s, another Number One may 
be considered as a bargaining chip in trade toward the purchase 
of this custom rifle. 

Additional detail photos are available to serious parties.
Will ship to your FFL dealer if you're outside of the Reno 
area. Price does not include shipping or any other costs

I was told that the original owner was a security guard, and that fits with the condition of the gun. Carried much more than it was used. Comes with a Blackhawk holster and two sets of grips; the original right handed target grips and a set of hard rubber grips off of a EAA Windicator.

This gun was imported by Excam from H. Weihrauch in Germany and branded as a Warrior. The same gun has been imported by several companies over the years and including Excam/ FIE/ Arminius and EAA. this gun is the forerunner of the current EAA windicator and many Windicator parts will fit it if ever needed. This gun has a steel frame, not the pot metal frame that the early Arminus revolvers used.

This is a full power 10MM load that is within SAAMI spec and is thus safe for use in ANY/ALL 10mm pistols. Loading this long-for-weight all copper bullet in the 10MM case, causes powder capacity limitations that we do not experience with shorter/heavier lead alloy bullets and thus our advertised 1500 fps velocity cannot be reached, regardless of how may internal ballistics charts tell us that we should be able to launch a 155gr. bullet @ 1500 fps from a 5 inch barrel, that long light weight bullet simply uses too much of the available case capacity to do so. See our below real world velocities fired from real world pistols, not extra long laboratory barrels, that give false high velocity readings. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll achieve the velocity reading we advertise in the real world where it matters when your life and the lives of your loved ones may hang in the balance.

1455 fps - Custom 1911 with Nowlin 5 inch barrel
1429 fps - Colt Delta Elite, 5 inch barrel
1401 fps - Glock Mod 20,  4.6 inch barrel
If you are firing this 10MM ammo from an auto loader and are experiencing high extreme velocity spreads, it is not the ammo. Full power 10MM ammunition has always generated enough pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun—this of course depends on many variables like your particular slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme velocity spreads. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads (in excess of 50 fps) simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This Colt, with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35 fps, with this load. I am happy with an ES of 35 fps, so I leave the Delta spring alone. My custom built Para Ordinance 1911, with a Nowlin barrel, runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps, so I installed a recoil spring that was roughly 4 lbs heavier and the extreme spread dropped to about 35 fps. (Wolff Gun Springs—REDACTED-- www.gunsprings.com ) My Glock mod 20 was running extreme spreads of nearly 100 fps, so I installed a 6 lb heavier recoil spring and brought the ES down to 50 fps. The folks at Wolff will tell you what the factory spring rating is for your particular pistol, so you’ll know where to start. I should note, these high ES #'s really don’t matter in the real world as they do not affect accuracy or reliability. The firearms industry fixed this ES problem by watering down 10MM ammo, to the point that most 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers is pretty weak, but it does not open your breech face early…... If weak ammo is the “fix” you want, most any 10MM ammo made by major manufacturers will do. If you wish to shoot our full power 10MM ammo, you can choose to live with the high ES (you’ll only know if you are getting high ES #’s if you use a chronograph) or you can install a stiffer recoil spring.

This load was accurate and reliable in our three test pistols."

We understand the needs, requirements and demands that both disciplines require.However, all to often some of the features found in a long range precision optic are un-necessarily left out of the optics designed for the Big Game Hunter.
