AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENTThe legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement todayâs shooters demand. The SIG SAUERÂ® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.
The Ancient Greek phrase Î¼Î¿Î»Ï`Î½ Î»Î±Î²ÎµÂ´ (moloÂ¯`n labeÂ´; reconstructed Ancient Greek pronunciation) means ""Come and take them"". It is a classical expression of defiance reportedly spoken by King Leonidas I in response to the Persian army's demand that the Spartans surrender their weapons at the Battle of Thermopylae."

I believe there were 'big intentions"" (that never materialized) because there are four extra mags for this piece that never were taken out of their packaging...and the other three mags are flawless.

Best Beast for the money by far!, December 15, 2014

I own a 10mm Hunter by eaa and it is a real joy to shoot. I highly recommend adding the eaa weaver rail they make for it from the factory (the eight drilled and tapped holes, four a sides, should clue you in) and park a red dot optics sighted in at 100 yards. This makes it a 200+ yard deer or hog gun all day long (with the right hunting rounds) as long as you have your optics sighted in property. It even knocks bull elk down without more than a step as well under 150 yards easy too. This pistol is tack-driving accurate, with just under twice the energy of a strong .45apc.....especially at range. Don't scoff at this marvel of hunting genus.

10mm witness hunter, August 22, 2014

I have 3 Differant 10mm. I like them all. I shoot so many differant Guns and calibers. I have killed all kinds of game. This 10mm hunter is very accurate. The Only thing is eaa is full of it.I have never been able to get 15 rounds in clip. You can get 14 but not 15. Everytime i got to my ranch friends want me to bring my eaa 10mm hunter. I have Killed Many hogs from 25yrds all the way out to 115 yards. other Problem with this gun is it is very hard to get one. it took me two years to get.

Doesn't get any Better, June 03, 2014

Balanced , finished , accurate , and a trigger that is the best I've ever squeezed . Shot the Colt and Kimber and this is better , just not as pretty . It's all business ! Downside is no rail and sights while very good are hard to see in dusk or dawn hunting . Had a holster built because I couldn't find one to fit . EAA has always had problems with their recoil springs being too light . Don't shoot without buying a 20 or 22# spring . Would I buy again ? Absolutely and I am , buying the 4 3/4"" Witness Match single action .

Forget about crisp 1911 Triggers, the Hunter has an extremely light pull, very crisp release, and short reset. 10mm has better long range ballistics over .45 acp. Plus it's a double stack...

So it comes with 2 magazines if after the 6th of June. The extra magazine isn't necessary though, just what's in the kit is fine also. The only thing necessary is the FCU trigger unit from a P320. These go for $399 from Sig, (the 9mm can't really be found anywhere else), but I had a discount and will sell for $325 just the kit, $365 with the extra magazine. I could be like the ^$)$Y who get kits with their discount and then during a dry period sell for full price. I just want to come out even and get the kit I want. You get the benefit of the 20% discount passed on to you for the kit. I will consider offers lower as well, but I'm pretty set on the prices I have listed. Frankly $325 is the lowest you will find anywhere, if they even have the 9mm, after shipping costs. Go on Gunbroker, $390 plus you pay shipping. Sig is $399. TopGunSupply is $299 plus enough to make it in 320's with shipping costs and they never have anything in stock other than a .357 sig here and there anyways. Any questions feel free to message me or give me a call at REDACTED. Thanks. Oh, should anyone have a .40 P320 kit or .357 SIG, as long as the shape is good (I mean practically new) I would possibly trade. Unlikely, but I thought I'd throw it out there.

How Walther SOFTCOIL â¢ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCPâs SOFTCOILâ¢ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.This is a used firearms, comes with orignal box & all accesories.

 *** This is not just a pretty face. I have fired this weapon at a local range. People stop what they are doing to watch. It is very accurate. I had a 5 shot group the size half dollar. The Range Master wanted me to sell it to him. The owner of Predator Hydrographics said, ""Everyone who saw it, wanted it"".

 I would like to trade for something in .308/.458 AR platform or cash. I have a number in mind for a cash deal. Trades, just shoot me an offer. All I can say is ""NO"". I do ask one thing, ""Please don't send B.S. Offer"". Don't insult me and I will show same courtesy. TEXT ME @ REDACTED 

If we can agree on a deal but are skeptical about buying something like this without shooting. We can take care of that to close the deal. We can meet somewhere we agree on and you can sling some lead down range. BUT, THIS HAS TO BE A DEAL CLOSER!!! I will not go to the range everyday for someone to have a free gun rental! Sorry but Lucid Red-Dot not included but can be negotiated."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nanoâs extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanoâs magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nanoâs sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.Please visit our online store at www.fnafirearms.com.

It shoots great and feels great in the hand, but just don't use it as much as I'd like. Comes with the original case and all of the accessories it came with from the factory. Looking to get $650 for everything or $550 for just the Handgun. The firearm has little to no wear marks on it, as I haven't shot it very much. If you're interested, or would like additional pictures, I can be reached through PM on here, or via text/voice at REDACTED. Thank you for looking.

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.
The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

Model M19A1 Dimensions: 10â³ x 6.5â³ x 3.5â³ Steel ammunition chest Rubber seal Lay flat carrying handle Hinged lid Latch closure (can be locked with additional parts) These cans are in very good condition and the seals on them are in excellent condition.Â  The ammo in these cans would have been recently shot such that the cans are still in near mint condition. These can be used for ammo storage or any other items you wish to store in an air, humidity, and water-tight manner. You can depend on the can and seal to last many years. The cans are available for sale at our store in Rio Rancho and for those on the south end of town, in Belen. They are reasonably priced at $10.00 each, tax included.Â  We can also quote shipping costs based on how many you want and where they will be shipped to. These cans are generally known as .30 cal cans as they were originally designed to hold belts of .30 caliber machine gun bullets. The 7.62X51mm NATO round was developed in the 1950s for the M14 rifle and the M60 machine gun.Â  Since these cartridges were on linked belts that means they were intended for machine gun use, not rifle use.Â  Very few of these are used in rifles any longer as the M14 rifle was superseded by the M16 which used the 5.56X45 NATO round.Â  However the 7.62mm round known in the civilian world as the .308 Winchester is still used in sniper rifles and for other special purposes in addition to machine gun use. It was discovered in Vietnam that the M14 rifle was too long and heavy for jungle warfare and the size and weight of the cartridges limited the number of rounds that could be carried.Â  The commies had the same issue with their AK-47 ammo but they never wised up and still carry the bigger, heavier cartridges.Â  This chart helps show the comparison in what a soldier could carry:    Rifle Cartridge Cartridge weight Weight of loaded magazine 10Â kg (22#) ammo load   M14 7.62Ã51mm 393 grains (25.5Â g) 20 rds @ 0.68Â kg 14 mags / 280 rds   M16 5.56Ã45mm 183 grains (11.9Â g) 20 rds @ 0.3Â kg 33 mags / 660 rds   AK-47 7.62Ã39mm 281 grains (18.2Â g) 30 rds @ 1.2Â kg* 8 mags / 240 rds    (*AK-47 magazines are much heavier than M14 and M16 magazines) The 7.62X51mm cartridge remained the main machine gun round well in to the 1990s but for light machine gun use, has been replaced by the 5.56X45 NATO round in widespread use of the M249 SAW.Â  The 7.62 is still used in the M60E4, the M240 and by the Germans in their HK21 and MG3.We have also just gotten in some 40mm cans at our Belen location on sale for $25 each.*********************************************************************"

Now for the Educational Segment of my post. This is a CZ 70 Pistol. Some folks call them ""VZ 70"" because, stamped on the slide, it says ""VZOR 70""... Sorry folks... VZOR is the Czech word for MODEL.

That was the Foreign Language Segment... Now Mathematics! .32 Automatic 71 Grain FMJ Privi Partizan Ammo is running an easy 30 Cents Per Round when you add in Shipping AND Find a Really Good Deal. That comes to a $450 in Ammo Value.

A Really Good Deal on NIB CZ 70's is $275... Before any Shipping and/or Sales Tax... 

That is a very conservative $725 valuation IF YOU FIND A SCREAMING DEAL ON ALL OF THIS STUFF. I have $625 into this and that is what I wanted for it... $625... Now Only $600!!!

Now for the Civics and Social Commentary Segment of today's lesson, class... All Colorado Laws... NO MATTER HOW ASININE... Will Be Followed! I like ARK Tactical or Rapid Fire Bunker for the BG & FFL FOOLISHNESS. You Pay Your BG & Transfer TAXES and I Pay Mine.

You may come and see all of this stuff at my shop in Sheridan before we head over to the FFL Holder for the Transfer.

The photos show a Pair of these Pistolas.  I have one that has about 50 Rounds through it & comes with 1,450 Rounds of Ammo at $550 and one that is UNFIRED & comes with 1,500 Rounds of Ammo at $600. You can get them BOTH for Only $1100!! One of the Holsters in the photos has been oiled and one has not.  First purchaser gets to take his pick."

Front gas block can accommodate a flip sight or if requested I can include a front sight gas block. Comes with extended charge handle and heavy duty scope rings. Walmart carries front and rear flip sights. I also have a used 308 quad rail (12"") with extra pieces. It has a few scratches from being a used item. You'll just need to add on a low pro gas block to use it. 

2 metal magazines 15 rounds each. Also throwing in an upgrade MOE buttstock for it. 

This weapon has exactly 40 rounds through it so the wear on it is what's to be expected. Hardly any. A little brass on the deflector from the 40 rounds. 

Price is firm. I have optics and canted iron sights. If that's something you'd want just ask for pictures and price."

I built this rifle from the ground up. I started with a Wilson Combat Matched Billet upper and lower and hand selected all the parts. The upper and lower fit together like a glove. It has a Primary Arms 4-14x44 FFP Scope with the ACSS reticle and Primary Arms Deluxe Scope Mount. This is my favorite scope. I have put maybe 20 rounds through the rifle. I took it to the indoor range to sight in the scope. This should me sub MOA accurate. I have $2500 into her but I know I will not get it all back. You can't build it for the price I am offering it for so I am pretty firm on the price. I will also include two 30 round Magpul Pmags.

I am not desperate to sell. I have another AR I built so I don't need this one.

This is a custom AR pistol that has received CIV tactical blueprinting service making it an extremely accurate for its 10.5 inch barrel length. Blueprinting means that they perfectly align the barrel extensions to the receiver face enhancing the overall accuracy, function, and reliability of the AR. The bolt has been properly headspaced to the chamber by Dustin at CIV TAC. The CIV barrel has been cut and crowned specifically to the barrel's specification and M4 feed ramps have been hand polished. This is a $199 service alone. There has been about 80 rounds fired thru this AR pistol. i was planning on SBRing it but no longer have the desire to. It is currently in ""pistol"" form, as pictured, which makes it legal in most states which is desirable for people crossing state lines. Would make an awesome sbr project as well if you choose to do so. Lots of cool likable features on this pistol and high quality, low use firearm. Here are the specs:

***NOTE- This is not a Rifle even though it is listed in the rifle category. It is classified as a pistol since it does not have a rifle stock, making it still in pistol form. You will be required to SBR it thru the ATF (GAY-TF) if you want to put a stock on it."

Internal components look great and the finish is outstanding for a gun of this age.  I have OCD and this weapon does not match my C&R collection and therefore must go.

I am leasing 1692 acres near Folkston Ga. Bordering the Okefenokee Swamp to the west.This is awesome hunting land. It has virgin pine, planted short pine, hardwood, swamps. Power line runs (east-west)through entire bottom half of property. Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
This is a new venture so you will be in on the ground floor. We will develop as we go. Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
10 members will be $1000 each. If we decide to go with less hunters, the price goes up accordingly. I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only, Georgia State rules for now. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly. This should go quickly, so dont put off making the contact.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience. 
If you are interested, please contact me by email and we can set up a time for viewing. I am retired so any day of the week is good for me.
Please only respond 1) if you are serious hunter and want to be part of something fun and 2)if you can afford this. I am not carrying any payment plan."

This innovative Ultravid HD series symbolizes the manufacturerâs commitment to high standards. This binocular reaches an unparalleled image brightness and contrast thanks to Leicaâs Fluorite-Ion lenses. Leica goes beyond the realm of normal expectations in order to satisfy the requirements of fastidious enthusiasts.

These highly developed lenses further reduce chromatic aberrations and produce high color fidelity. Its specially coated prisms increase light transmission thus making it brighter than the predecessor. This improvement translates into better twilight performance to discern fine details in any low light situation. The 8x50 Ultravid HD benefits significantly from the Leicaâs âAqua Duraâ Hydrophobic lens coating to meet the high demands of âGo anywhere at any time useâ. This enhancement repels water from the optics and facilitates easier cleaning..

Bordering the Okefenokee Swamp to the west.This is awesome hunting land. It has virgin pine, planted short pine, hardwood, swamps. Power line runs (east-west)through entire bottom half of property. Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
This is a new venture so you will be in on the ground floor. We will develop as we go. Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
10 members will be $1000 each. If we decide to go with less hunters, the price goes up accordingly. I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only, Georgia State rules for now. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly. This should go quickly, so dont put off making the contact.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience. 
If you are interested, please contact me by email and we can set up a time for viewing. I am retired so any day of the week is good for me.
Please only respond 1) if you are serious hunter and want to be part of something fun and 2)if you can afford this. I am not carrying any payment plan."

Looking to sell my Yugoslavian N-PAP m70 ak-47 (7.62x39) The Yugo AK's are regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world and this rifle is no exception. 
Extremely well made with very tight tolerances. It will feed, function and fire flawlessly for thousands and thousands of rounds. Not in a rush to sell, but if the right offer comes along ill part ways with it. Ive put around $500 of extras on it including:
-Tapco slotted muzzlebrake (amazing muzzlebrake that controls muzzle rise and recoil)
-Hogue forend that can accept rails on the bottom and sides
-Model 4/15 Polymer Angled Forend
-Tapco 10/30 magazine (California compliant but can be modified to hold 20 or 30 rounds if you move out of state)
-Ak47 side rail thats high enough to enable iron sight use
-Barska 2x30 5moa red dot sight (hold zero fantasticly)
-AGR-47 pistol grip (extremely comfortable and isreali made)
-Tapco yugo buttstock adapter.
-Fab Defense Mako GL-Shock ButStock Recoil Reducing Shock Absorber and Extendable Cheekpiece with Battery Storage Compartment (completely gets rid of ""cheek slap"")
-Internal recoil buffer on buffer spring
-California compliant bullet button (can be removed once out of state)
-Original wood furniture included if you want to switch the classic look, mix it up a little bit.
-Polished internals

Great gun almost flawless condition. Less than 500 rounds through it, eats any ammo you throw at it. Email for more pictures or questions. Asking $1000 considering buying a even the cheapest Ak47 with transfer fees, taxes, shipping, ect. will cost you about $800"
