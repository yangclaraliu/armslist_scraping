This is cheaper than any of those options, USA made, is all metal, and a proven reliable design. The DMG has a fully machined aluminum lower (NOT STAMPED STEEL).  Search YouTube for the MPA factory tour, it's pretty impressive on their quality, and what pretty much sold me plus the glock mag angled grip update. It is an awesome candidate for an SBR if you decide later to do so. 

Before I ordered, I knew I liked the the smaller 930DMG, but wanted it a bit larger, so I swapped a few emails with the owner of MPA (Phil) and asked for a semi custom setup. It's now on their site now as a 935DMG. I wanted a longer functional barrel instead of a faux suppressor, the short hand guard, and tungsten cerakote. 

This also has a one off custom hand made Helical spiral steel compensator from Madmacs Tactical ($120).  And a $80 Seahorse (Pelican) case custom cut for the MPA935DMG and 4 mags.  Included will be (1) factory 30rd Glock, (2) factory 17rd Glock, (1) Korean 17rd Glock magazine.  (3) Spare buffer pads.  Only 1 range visit and 100 flawless rounds through it.

Complete rifles may also be considered, depending on what you have. Do us both a favor and don't ask if I'm interested in trading for anything else.

For those not familiar with this platform, it is sweet! Lighter than a AK47, milled receiver, last round bolt hold open, the list gose on. What you get, the rifle which has been fitted with a nice surplus Czech wood kit, original surplus wood handle bayonet with scabbard, CNC Warrior brake, the original bever barf furniture (top handguard fitted to surplus gray metal), original folding stock, cleaning kit, two mags, and black sling. I was fortunate enough to find fixed stock metal that matches the original finish perfect! Another nice feature I did was tabbed the bolt carrier. While there has been debate lately for the need of this on newer CAI builds, I figured it to be cheap insurance. Research VZ58 trigger gremlin and you will see why this modification is very important. Round count at this point is 0! I will be putting 20 rounds down range with it to test the carrier before it leaves my possession, that's it. I like to make sure there is no problem with the work I do. I would also recommend shooting it with the included bever barf upper handguard in place to preserve the wood one. I'm asking 750.00 for everything. Any questions please ask! Bipod not included. JG Sales has a few of these rifles left in stock. They are asking 1299.00 for them and you don't get the extra furniture or bayonet."

Manual has been lost.

I am the original owner, and I would rate this piece on the NRA scale as ""very good"" condition, except that it does have a spot on the slide where the bluing was rubbed off by wearing it all day on a tractor when the polymer holster was not fully tightened.  (See pic.)

This pistol has fewer than 300 rounds through it.

Private seller.  Price is firm at $440.  Cash only, please.  Email me for more pictures.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Separate from the pistol and kit, I have these other related items.  These cost EXTRA:

I also have two extra 13-rd mags available--authentic Springfield mags.  They retail from $33 to $36 each when new--PLUS shipping.  Will add them both in for $50 together.  I also have 450 rounds of 230 gr. FMJ that I'll sell.  (Mostly Winchester bought at Walmart.)  Retail value of ammo is $171. I will sell it for $110.

The pistol and kit ($440), the extra mags ($50), and the ammo ($110) all together total at $600.  (I will sell the pistol/kit without the other items, but I will not sell the other items at these prices without also selling the pistol.)  To buy all this new at the store would cost you about $793, plus all the hassle of the purchase process.

In this case, I'm happy to say the finish on this one looks extremely nice and no marks or scratches anywhere.  You won't find one nicer, unless it's new in the box.  In the pics the slide serrations look dirty, but I assure you they are clean, it's just the way they are cut.  The Norinco 1911 is also only one of a handful, including Colt, that Clark Custom Guns deemed suitable for the .460 Rowland  conversion.

$760 cash.  Lots of interest and offers so far, but nothing yet I would rather have over the Norinco and no rush to get rid of this piece.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trade, so I'll be picky and if the value is not there, I will not be interested.  If wanting a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I will consder trades if it makes sense on my end, otherwise I will pass on trades and wait for cash. 

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped is fine as I would replace any Mil-Spec FCG in the lowers.  Other parts like BCG, rails etc.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 & 7.62x54.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, maybe other makes and models) 1911's(even Taurus models, Rock Island, Para etc. depending on your value), but may consider other calibers and models, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams

Maybe quality optics like Vortex(others?) 4-16x(mid level models) or greater power range, maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

	Hey all, I have available for trade/sale an awesome home defense/slug gun setup. This is a Mossberg 500 12 gauge with a factory 9 round capacity (8+1) with the 20 inch barrel. These aren’t very common in this configuration locally and as a factory setup. I have installed a Blackhawk collapsible pistol gripped stock, but it will come with the factory stock and aftermarket forearm as well. It also has had a Picatinny rail installed on the top of the receiver with a BSA red dot sight installed as well. I have also installed a green fiber optic front sight/bead and a magazine tube ti-picatinny rail. Currently, it has a micro flashlight and a laser installed on this rail that are included with it. 
	I bought this a while back with the intention of turning it into the ultimate home defense/hog gun, but have since gone a different direction. I haven’t ever even gotten to fire it and it is still in good condition overall. I will also include any other extra parts from the build that i have (if i can find them) in the deal. 
	I would also consider trades for AK-47s, a lever action 357/38, 458 socom ammunition, Cetme in 308, and others. Honestly, I’m pretty open, just shoot me a offer and the worst i can say is no. Although, i really do not have any interest in shotguns or 22s unless it is heavily in my favor (i already have plenty haha). Some trades will require boot on my end, some will on your end. I also have a substantial amount of ammunition that I could add in for extra. Need to meet up in Norman on this. Please TEXT ONLY REDACTED
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

The receiver is machined stainless steel mated to a Feddersen barrel. The barrel is threaded into the receiver for increased accuracy. If desired the barrel can be removed and replaced with a typical slip fit barrel. The back of the receiver is fitted with an additional screw to securely mount the stock. There is also a cleaning opening in the rear of the receiver so the barrel may be cleaned from the chamber. The rifle is mated to a specially modified Bell & Carlson thumbhole stock. The trigger is a fully adjustable Kidd trigger. I'm not sure of the manufacturer of the bolt but was told the only thing Ruger on this rifle was the magazine. These receivers are very hard to find and are not in current production. The scope and rings are NOT included. I'm interested in a variety of firearms but I'm partial to lever guns or Smith & Wesson and Colt revolvers. I can ship if necessary but prefer face to face transactions.

  I have a Superior Arms manufactured 20"" barrel AR-15. It's a heavy barrel, so it weighs a little more than a carbine length gun, but man, the accuracy. Hitting at target at 150-200 yards is child's play, and it'll easily go out longer than that if you can find a place with long sight lines. The gun comes with the standard carry handle, but I can throw in my Redfield Battlezone 3x-9x scope and Burris Pepr mount for an extra 120 (paid $270).

I'm looking to sell it because I simply don't get out enough to shoot it. Never had an issue with this gun. Since it's a full rifle-size AR, the recoil is much smoother than a carbine-length gun and I've never had a single failure in around 500 rounds. 

I can meet at 311 Tactical Solutions, and only on Tuesdays right now. Sorry. You pay transfer and any other fees. We can discuss when you email me. Asking 650, which is way less than I paid for this guy. I'll take 50 bucks off if you want the original A2 stock and mil-spec handguard instead of the Magpul furniture. You won't regret this gun for a moment. Email with any questions."

Designed for inexpensive, high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid-fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern defensive pistol practice at the range. The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a 4.375"" threaded, match barrel, an extremely crisp, 4-lb. single-action trigger and a windage-adjustable rear sight. The M22 pistol from ISSC has five safety features: safety decocker, loaded chamber indicator, trigger safety tab, magazine disconnect, and an external key-lock.
