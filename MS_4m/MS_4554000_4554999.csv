USA Centerfire Rifle Cartridges

5.56 NATO, M855, 62 Grain, Steel Core Full Metal Jacket, Green Tipped

This ammo is from a fresh factory run of ammunition that did not meet spec for a military contract. The cases of the ammo may be dented or otherwise not 100% uniform in a way that does not affect performance.

The two most common 5.56 rounds are the 55gr M193 and the 62gr “green tip” M855, both of which are used by the US military. The US made M855 is painted with a green tip to distinguish it from M193, so that troops do not shoot M855 in their 1 turn every 12 inch twist barreled M16's that would fail to properly stabilize the heavier and much longer bullet (length being a primary factor in bullet stabilization). The NATO SS109 62gr steel core “penetrator” bullet is used in the M855 round. The steel penetrator makes it more effective at penetrating hard targets and such.

5.56 ammunition is only to be used in rifles labeled 5.56mm, and must NOT be used in those rifles labeled .223.

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

 I am listing this for a buddy that wants to sale or possibly trade. This scope is like the Trijicon Accupoint TR25-C-200090 and is capable of both eyes open at a fraction of the price. The brighter the sun light the brighter the tip is. In really low light situations you will have a completely black tip. It is extremely clear and has excellent eye relief. It has a 30mm one piece tube and is great for quick on target because of the triangle tip. It is the perfect height for the AR platform. It is mounted on a LaRue Tactical quick detach mount. It has been mounted but nothing more. I don't know anything about it so if you have questions please let me know and I will ask him.

This is one one of the very sought after ones where Century Arms was still hand engraving their importer info, from back when they were still getting and bringing in the 'good stuff'. Email me for more detailed photos. 

This is NOT a cheapo $500.00 WASR recent import that has been jacked around with and converted from single-stack to double stack. This is the real deal (minus full-auto) as this weapon has the bayonet lugs, Romanian side-folder stock, Ak-47 metal ferrule lower handguard, oval receiver dimples on both sides of the mag well, etc. 

NO THIS IS NOT FULL AUTO (someone is going to ask me). 

Someone (many actually) are going to email me and tell me about how they can get a Romanian ""AK-47"" for $500.00 and they're right and those are great guns. This is not one of those guns. If you want a $500.00 AK then you should buy one of those and you'll likely never be sorry. This is a collector's /investor's piece. It is not pretty. It is worn and faded and dinged and beautiful with all its real-world character. The trigger on this thing is amazing and the action feels and sounds like they used to sound 'back in the day'.

314,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4554314,"For Sale:  Finest H&R Topper 58 Single-Shot 410 3"" Great Gift! 26 Inch Skeet/Hunt Beginner/Expert","Davie, Broward, South Florida",$ 184,"Listed On: Monday, July 27, 2015",Shotguns,H&R                                                                                ,410                                                                                ,Break Open                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is probably the finest condition H&R single-shot outside of one brand new in the box. Checking over Gunbroker + Armslist listings, I find a couple on the low end at $135 to $145 but they need refinishing, have cracks, are in average condition or have other issues. Even at the $175 to $199 level you find missing sight beads or some in very decent shape at a listed 85% condition. Nothing close to this. This is the perfect shotgun for the younger shooter or newcomer to trap. I shoot only single-shots, from 100 year old Iver Johnsons to several H&R models. This was supposed to be for my daughter, but she went with the 20 gauge I had. At 16, she is not a beginner and she wanted some extra payload in the lead shot. This is why 410 is so perfect for learning and experts, it is the easiest to manage and also requires practice and skill to shoot high scores, both due to its smaller size. This has a 3 inch chamber which gives you the option of using 2.5 inch or 3 inch as there is a difference in recoil and shot payload between the two. The much lower recoil makes all the difference to younger or new shooters, as it is easy to get turned off to shooting with a bruised shoulder. Two or 3 rounds of trap, and even the 410 starts leaving its presence behind for a few days. (I bought PAST shoulder pads for all the kids). The much smaller size is what makes this perfect for everyone, as it is far easier to learn the proper technique when recoil and blast are not excessive and if you learn on a 410, when you step up to a larger size, your hit percentage will fly up as you are now tossing double the amount of pellets. Many women who are smaller statured, also do very well with this caliber (410 is a caliber not a gauge) and size shotgun. For the expert, the 410 is actually the hardest of all to score the highest scores with as it sends a much smaller pellet cloud downrange. It is like shooting at the clay discs with a 22 rifle in my opinion. The model is a Topper 58 and I have a full set of photos available if you ask. Every inch of the metal is deep blued and shiny with no faded areas, scratches or anything but perfect blued steel. The bore is a mirror. The finish on the metal is far superior to many current discount or entry level shotguns as the $220 to $250 range new shotguns are great, but of course they save on finishing. The barrel is 26 inches and the bead is present at the end (several others listed are missing it). The receiver is a case colored finish with a nice range of hues and colors. This is not faded or worn away either as handling over time will do. The action is slick and smooth with NO looseness at all. Releasing the lever results in a crisp click and the barrel lowers from gravity, but does not drop. It is almost like hydraulics as it opens slower. The forend is gloss finished wood and perfect. Perfect as in perfect. The buttstock is 99% condition as there is a mark less than an inch long and a dot nearby that is .25mm and it shows in the photo that I took close-up. It is hard to see for a reason, it is extremely minor. I have bought brand new firearms with more marks on them just from the store putting them together and customers handling them. You can find a decent one for about $30 less if you look, but for that extra $30 you get a shotgun that is truly beautiful and worthy of a gift. I sold a similar condition single action 22 revolver to a guy to be given to his fiancee as a wedding present. You can have a name or date engraved or branded onto the stock pretty inexpensively and make a gift that will be passed down through generations. Teach your child the rules, the safety and the fun of shooting sports, and they will have the pride of owning their own. With pride of ownership comes responsibility and the kind of lessons you can not learn in school. If small game hunting is your thing, a 410 is again, the perfect choice. Lighter to carry in the field and a box of shells is 1/3 the size and weight as 12 gauge. Choked full and that is how the barrel is made, with the choke integrated into the design. No replaceable chokes on this one and at full, it really is like shooting a 22 at the clays. Save enough over a new one to pay for 4 boxes of shells and a couple of trips to the skeet/trap range for you and whoever is lucky enough to receive this gift. I can tell you from experience, the $30 or so you may save getting a lower priced one, will bug you for years, every time you open the case and see faded bluing, scratches in the wood, cracks or any of the imperfections and damage that the others all seem to have. If you are going to keep this or pass it down, or make a gift from it, that little bit you saved over many years is nothing. Ships Fedex Ground,unless USPS Priority is the same or less. Your location will determine that. Local face-to-face sales are the best deal as no shipping, no FFL fees. I will meet you from Boca to Miami if you are local. Shipping will be $28. If Paypal is used for payment, it must be discrete (no mention of firearms) and add $5 which is PART of their fees. I'll take care of the difference"

715,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4554715,For Sale/Trade:  2013 V6 Mustang Premium - With Mods,"Dover Crossing, Clarksville, Tennessee","$ 20,500","Listed On: Monday, July 27, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling my year 2013 V6 Mustang Premium. It is Black, and from the factory it came with the Tech and Performance Package that included alloy wheels, Shaker audio system, Microsoft SYNC/Bluetooth. Upgraded springs, sway bars and panhard bar. Leather seats, garage opener, leather buckets in the rear.

That is just to include some of the stock stuff - the mods I have added so far are:
 - AirAid Synthetic Oiled Cold Air Intake
 - BBK Throttle Body with new wiring harness
 - BBK Chrome Long-Tube Headers with O2 extensions
 - BBK Chrome Offroad (no cats) X-Pipe with O2 extensions
 - Bama Performance X4 Tuner - tuned to turn off O2 sensors, for the transmission to NOT skip from 1st to 4th gear and modified the shift points and F/A ratio; I will include the tuner and holder for it; Bama provides free tunes for life if you ever add anymore mods.

I dyno'ed it at 349 RWHP - that is more than a Stock 2011-2014 5.0 Mustang. The only other modifications needed are a custom Cat-Back exhaust and steeper gears - it is still sitting on the original diff and 2.73 gears.

It has minor body dings from road travel - gravel paint chips. The only noticeable tweaks are that the far left side of the bumper slightly sticks out from where it is supposed to seat in the fender and there is a small scratch and dent from backing into a concrete pole. It adds character - didn't bother having that fixed.

It is black gloss paint, it is fully tinted except for the windshield - it only has the ""sunshade"" tint. The wheels are stainless steel - they will look better plasti-dipped to black.

Text or email me for specific pictures and the VIN. I will not go any lower unless you trade against the value with weapons.

I can include a brand new Vortex Spitfire 1x Prism scope (MSRP $399) for $200 more if you're interested in a quality optic to go with the rifle, or one brand new Magpul PMag for $12 more.

The barrel has a Silencerco Trifecta flash hider pinned to the end making it a non-NFA item.

I'm selling this because I have too many 5.56 ARs right now and I need to make room for an SR25.

The rifle is completely stock, except that I added the BCM BCG and BCM Mod 3 CH -- as it did not come with a BCG or CH.

I have also added an EOTech 552, Inforce WML, and Magpul MBUS PRO front and rear.

Round count is around 800 rounds, with about 40-50% of that being suppressed. Only quality brass ammo was fired through it and proper maintenance and cleaning procedures were always followed.

Hodge Defense upper and lower receiver
Hodge/DD CHF 14.5"" midlength barrel

Here is D.P.M.S.’s A-15 Oracle rifle in .223 Remington / 5.56 NATO Caliber. It is identical to the standard Oracle, we bought it and its mates on a distributor liquidation. It shipped as a California Compliant variant, and we replaced its bullet button magazine release with a DPMS factory standard release, and replaced its 10 shot DPMS Magazine with a Colt factory 30 rounder SP62328.

The Lower Receiver is made of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum and features a serrated Forward Bolt Assist, semi-auto trigger group, aluminum trigger guard, and an aluminum magazine release button. The stock is DPMS Pardus Carbine Stock. The handguards are Glacier Guards oval carbine length with aluminum Delta Ring. Neither the receiver top, as the photos show, nor the gas block front sight area have sights; instead, there is a a 12 slot Picatinny or Weaver type base on the receiver and a 3 slotter on the gas block front sight area, either capable of securely anchoring a detachable sight or any appropriate optical accessory.
