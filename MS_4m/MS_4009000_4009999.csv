It was removed from the box and temporarily mounted on a M1a and turned on for function testing. It was then returned to the box where it has remained until it was removed again to take the photographs.

 The manufacturer states, ""Model 512 is our most popular holographic weapon sight. It’s ideal when you need the best in speed and versatility, without night vision compatibility."" This sight is complete with the mount that is compatible with either Picatinny or Weaver rails.

 You can mount the EOTech in about a minute with the enclosed Allen wrench and be ready to zero it. EOTech claims that you can remove it and replace it and expect it to retain zero within 1 MOA.

 It is powered with two AA batteries rather than some oddball battery selection. EOTech claims that alkaline batteries will provide 600 hours of continuous operation. They also claim that it is submersible up to 10 feet in water without harm.

 The lowest price listed on Amazon.com is $427.95 including shipping."

It was removed from the box and temporarily mounted on a M1a and turned on for function testing. It was then returned to the box where it has remained until it was removed again to take the photographs.

 The manufacturer states, ""Model 512 is our most popular holographic weapon sight. It’s ideal when you need the best in speed and versatility, without night vision compatibility."" This sight is complete with the mount that is compatible with either Picatinny or Weaver rails.

 You can mount the EOTech in about a minute with the enclosed Allen wrench and be ready to zero it. EOTech claims that you can remove it and replace it and expect it to retain zero within 1 MOA.

 It is powered with two AA batteries rather than some oddball battery selection. EOTech claims that alkaline batteries will provide 600 hours of continuous operation. They also claim that it is submersible up to 10 feet in water without harm.

And this Citori Grade VI is exactly what we many of us were dreaming about. With its extended sideplates and exquisite Grade VI stock and forearm it is a fine example of everything the Citori represents. As a part of the Browning High Grade Program it has all the characteristics you want -- plus, did I mention, the receiver and sideplates, and other metal hardware, are beautifully case colored. This brings out the elegance and interest of the Engraving and gold highlights in a unique way that is hard to find anywhere else.

As if this is not enough, the Citori Grade VI has all the strength you expect like a full width locking lug that wears in over time, instead of wearing out. And the proven Invector Plus choke system (with back bored barrels) that has long been recognized as one of the most reliable, clean and consistently performing of all choke tube designs ever. Every Citori has an exceptional amount of hand fitting before they are ready to be sent to your dealer. And this Citori has even more. You can actually see it. Be sure to review all the photographs provided above to get a detailed look at what a fine Browning really looks like. This is not a cheap gun. It is expensive and absolutely worth it if you love the legacy of the finest Browning over and unders."

Comes with (2) 17 rd. OEM Mags. NO BOX. There is a cut in the frame where a previous owner had installed an aftermarket thumb safety, but it does not affect the function of the gun in any way. Picked this up a couple weeks ago and after putting 300 flawless rounds thorugh it, realized it just isnt for me. After doing some research on the gun it has a frame recall that has never been taken care of. I called Glock with the serial number and they said indeed it was eligible for a free frame. They said they will also replace any worn internal parts for free as well as include a free factory extended slide release and free factory extended mag release. (GLock always throws in a couple free mags as well)You just have to overnight it back to Glock via FEDEX. Called FEDEX and the total cost to overnight gun back to Glock would be $25-$30 bucks. So for basically the cost of the gun plus $30, you will have a brand new gun in a model that they dont make anymore. Turnaround time per Glock is approx 2 weeks to replace the frame.

My Police Discount is your discount on these Awesome rings. 


The Force Recon Tactical Rings feature a built in level housed into the lower portion of the rear scope ring. Having the level in the base of the ring assures that it is always perfectly parallel to the top of the picatinny rail which is essential for long range shooting. A perfectly plumb scope and rifle are essential for the bullet to follow a true vertical line throughout the projectile's path to the target. 
These precision, long range rings offer precise mounting for your optics onto the picatinny base and will not allow the scope to move under any recoil scenario. Our wide .875 mounting platform offers a stable interface with the pic rail while the 2 cross slot bolts provide awesome clamping power. We go one step further by installing a pair of steel guide rails that press into the ring base. The ring base clamp rides on these rails to keep the clamp perfectly aligned as the 2 cross slot bolts are drawn tight against the pic mount. 

The ring cap has 6 Torx bolts providing evenly distributed force onto the top of the scope.The rings and caps have a .030 radius on both sides of the scope bore to eliminate any marring or sharp contact points on your scope. 

All of these features add up to the best scope mounting system you can buy at any price."

Comes with (2) 17 rd. OEM Mags. NO BOX. There is a cut in the frame where a previous owner had installed an aftermarket thumb safety, but it does not affect the function of the gun in any way. Picked this up a couple weeks ago and after putting 300 flawless rounds thorugh it, realized it just isnt for me. After doing some research on the gun it has a frame recall that has never been taken care of. I called Glock with the serial number and they said indeed it was eligible for a free frame. They said they will also replace any worn internal parts for free as well as include a free factory extended slide release and free factory extended mag release. (GLock always throws in a couple free mags as well)You just have to overnight it back to Glock via FEDEX. Called FEDEX and the total cost to overnight gun back to Glock would be $25-$30 bucks. So for basically the cost of the gun plus $30, you will have a brand new gun in a model that they dont make anymore. Turnaround time per Glock is approx 2 weeks to replace the frame. 


***Priced for a quick sale.  If the gun is not sold/traded by this Tuesday, it will be going back to Glock for the recall and I will be keeping it****

This is the hard-to-find law enforcement model (309601u) with THREE magazines, THREE differently-sized backstraps, and S&W Night Sights. 

I have added a fantastic trigger-job. The trigger job includes the Apex Tactical Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit (retail $129.95 (https://store.apextactical.com/WebDirect/Products/Details/191816) reduces trigger pull to 4 pounds, shortens the trigger take-up, shortens the trigger reset, and makes the trigger-break much sharper. It also includes an assortment of Wolff's's Striker Springs (two 5# and two 4#, and a 4# striker spring is installed). It also includes an assortment of Wolff's Reduced-Weight Plunger Springs (2.5#, 3.0#, 3.5#, and a 4.0# plunger spring is installed). These springs will allow you to further tailor trigger pull to your personal desires! All the assorted springs retain for about $55. 

As you may know, the complete break-down and modification of an M&P is a good deal more complex than some other pistols, so an average cost for a gunsmith to make the installations would be $110. That's $180 worth of upgrades plus $110 gunsmithing. All the original parts are included.

I have a used, but very good condition S&W M&P .45ACP 4.5 inch barrel full size pistol. It is the hard to find Flat Dark Earth version. It has had exactly 110 rounds fired through it. Throughly cleaned after every range day. I've had it for two weeks, but I'm missing my Glock 21 and I would like to go back to Glock. I had Trijicon HD night sights installed, however the gun smith accidentally used the wrong punch and left a dent on the rear and front sight as pictured. Sights are aligned and shoot great however, just a cosmetic issue. Comes with 2 10rd magazines. Also the manual safety was removed, but is included.  I am either looking to sell outright or trade out right for a Gen 4 Glock 21 with night sights preferably but I'm open to cash offers as well.  Willing to meet face to face.

Also, I will not separate the stockpile into individual boxes. Text or call 913*219/4060. All purchased within last 2 years.  Will not travel/meet outside the Gardner/Olathe area. Only trade I would consider is for a Glock 27 Gen 3 in like new condition (I can add cash to trade). Ammo includes everything you see in picture. The breakdown is as follows:
•18 boxes (50 rounds per box) of Aguila 9mm Luger 125 gr. target ammo = 900 rounds
•12 boxes (50 rounds ea.) of Federal Champion 9mm Luger 115 gr. = 600 rounds
•2 boxes (50 ea.) of Federal Classis 9mm Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) Hi Shok personal defense = 100 rounds
•2 boxes (20 ea.) of Winchester Bonded PDX1 9mm personal defense = 40 rounds

Troy FDE flip up back up iron sights are installed and laser zeroed. A 15"" BCM Key Mod Rail (KMR) free floats the barrel and protects the BCM low profile gas block.  The KMR is the lightest rail I've ever felt.  It's made of alluminium and magnesium making it super light and strong.  The mil - spec forged lower reciever is from Spikes Tactical and demonstrates excellent fit and finish.  Outfitted with an ALG ACT trigger tuned by Geissele as well as a Magpul trigger guard and BCM GUNFIGHTER MOD 1 pistol grip. A Daniel Defense mil spec lower parts kit was used to insure proper fit and durability. A VLTOR exclusive A5 mil spec diameter buffer  kit was used wich tames recoil and smooths out the travel of the bcg eliminating premature wear on the firing group. The combination of the A5 buffer and mid length gas system with BCM comp leaves a riffle that eats anything and shoots flat and soft like a .22 it's incredible. The stock is a VLTOR IMOD mil spec. The riffle is in like new condition and absolutely beautiful. Included is a Magpul MS3 sling and 2 Magpul PMAGS"

I bought a rifle that had a troy alpha 308 rail on it. It is 15"" in length and fits a dpms high profile rifle. My rifle is a dpms low profile so it works but isn't ideal. The rails don't line up perfectly. 

Previous owner painted it od green. I repainted it black. Other than that it is in great shape. No issues. Includes all mounting bolts and such.

I will include my smith and wesson factory barrel nut so that you have one you know will work.  The alpha is supposed to work with factory barrel nuts iirc but the replacement rail I am planning includes it's own so y ou can have this one if you want.

I was going to dismantle this rifle for the receiver, but I was told it is actually an uncommon rifle. So I am putting this up here for a collector or historian to use. The rifle is in 7.65x53 Mauser. It is not chambered in a standard Mauser caliber. The receiver has the crest of a Turkish Sultan on the top.

There is some rust and staining on this rifle. The bore of this rifle is very dark, but it has very strong rifling. I don't really know much else about the gun. I was told it is missing a switch that would hold the ammo in reserve, like on a Krag. It is also missing the follower.

Price is $500. I would like to ship this rifle for $25. However, I will only accept USPS money orders as payment. Please do no ask about using other forms of payment. I have pictures, please ask for them."

This is Wolf MATCH EXTRA 22lr.... meaning match 22lr quality ammo. If you want to test the limits of you or your rimfire rifle, this is the ""caliber"" of ammunition you need to use. To shoot small groups in a centerfire you need high quality ammo correct? Same thing with rimfire. 

***Wolf rimfire ammo is not the same Russian centerfire crap people are used to seeing. It is a high end round made in the same German plant on the same line as Lapua SK Standard... same ammo in a different box.

The barrel is attached to a 1918 Tula receiver. The bore is very smooth and very shiny. It has very strong and crisp rilfling to the end of the muzzle. The crown and muzzle are near perfect with no imperfections. This rifle sits in its original wartime stock which has rounded finger joints and a crisp and clear Sako cartouche. The barrel and bolt match. The floorplate does not match and the buttplate has no numbers. The cocking knob also has a Sako stamp. The bolt has alot of unique and various stamps.  The wood on this rifle is in very good shape with no cracks or deep gouges. It does have the regular bumps and bruises associated with storage, handling and field use. The blueing on the rifle is a beautiful patina and I would rate at 50-60% and is even across the entire exposed metal surfaces. There is some very light pitting on the barrel under the wood line as shown in the photos. This rifle shoots very well and is very accurate which is typical of the M39's

The box label does not match the pistol serial number having gotten mixed up years ago at a LE Training Center who was the original recipient. I acquired this pistol from them in 2005 and when it arrived it only had two of the factory magazines included with the pistol. I have included a brand new Italian manufactured Beretta/MDS (Meccanica Del Sarca) 15-rd magazine to bring the total magazine count to three. Pistol has a very pleasing 2-tone finish (Black Slide / Gray Frame) which may mave been refinished after if left Beretta in 1999 as they record this as a Black on Black Police Special pistol. These 92FS pistols are outstanding shooters and are extremely reliable. They are the standard issue pistol for many Law Enforcement Agencies and Military forces around the world and have achieved a legendary reputation for reliability and durability in service.

All vz. rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped. Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47. 
The bolt of the vz. stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. 
The vz. can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle. 
The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz.. 
The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 
The vz. gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
The alloy magazine of the vz. is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. 
The vz.  is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure. -"

Kel Tec stopped making these a few years ago because, quite simply, they're a bitch to manage. Think PF9 but with a .40 cal load. Very light and very thin.

 This gun is very, very concealable and holds 9+1. I've put a belt clip on the slide and I can literally wear this gun in the summer with gym shorts and no shirt, and no one knows it's there. 

 This has been my CCW gun during the warm summer months when I don't wear the clothes to properly conceal a full size gun. 

 It's like all the Kel Tec pistols; reliable as the day is long and a really long travel DA trigger. The trigger takes some getting used to, but once accustomed to it, it seems perfectly natural.

 This gun does have a bit of finish wear from being carried but functions perfectly.

 Magazine are about as rare as the gun itself, and a bit costly. This gun will come with three magazines.

 The P40 is running $350 - $400 on line, with no spare mags, plus shipping. I think I'm fair in pricing this at $390 including the magazines."

Excellent Condition

$90.00 FIRM!
 
This Mosin Nagant 91/30 (Soviet) Original Barrel has had less than 800 rounds fired through it.

This barrel is COMPLETELY FREE of any kind of cosmoline, fouling or powder residue. 

Barrel spent 24 hours in a “State of The Art” Hot Tank, and then was hand lapped and polished to perfection. 

The lands and grooves are in excellent condition; so, you can expect to get the remainder of it’s complete barrel life.  

For those of you wanting improved accuracy, and or extended barrel life, there is a company called 300 below. They offer something known as cryogenic treatments. 
These treatments relieve stresses in the metal created from the manufacturing process of barrel rifling, that is usually created when the rifling has been pushed, pulled or broached (NOT CUT). The end result is improved accuracy, extended barrel life, and enabling a bullet to travel at roughly 100+ fps faster than a similar untreated barrel. 

I believe 300 below charges $50 for this service, and IMO, worth every single penny of it. 
*****BARREL HAS NOT BEEN CRYO TREATED*****

This has never been taken out of the packaging.  It's Brown
Here's a description from the packaging. 
Our handcrafted Outfitter Cobra Sling is a finely detailed piece with the perfect combination of luxury and usefulness. Each and every one of these slings is assembled by hand over the course of several days. It's a true classic.

We take great pride in crafting every sling we make by hand. USA craftsmanship lives on at Crosstac. This is a 1"" sling, yet it carries a wide shoulder pad (which is also removable to revert to a 1"" straight sling should you desire). The pad is 1 3/4"" wide, to spread the load of a heavy rifle across your shoulder. If features a suede leather liner, edge stitching and a hand-molded tunnel for a beautiful presentation. The detail work takes time, but it's worth it. For example, the edge stitching is hand hammered to be flush with the surface of leather. Then the ""tunnel"" is wet molded by hand to accept the sling. In the end, you get a very high quality, fine leather sling.

All Outfitter Slings use our infinitely adjustable buckle. Smarter because there are no holes and it adjusts quickly to any length."

The scope has handling marks (stuff happens, it's huge and seems to bump into everything else when taking it in and out of the safe), but they are only cosmetic. 

The Stevens has everything needed in a good bolt-action hunting rifle. First of all, it has the time-tested Savage 110 action, that is known for reliability and safety. 

The trigger is crisp, and by adjusting the trigger tension spring screw, the pull weight can be adjusted to (3) three pounds (I have not adjusted it). 

The barrel on the Model 200 is free-floated its entire length, and the barreled action is pillar bedded into the stock.

The gray synthetic stock wears a rubber buttplate and comes equipped with sling swivel studs; the combination of the black metal action and gray stock with the mounted silver colored scope makes for a really good-looking rifle."

This is chambered in 223 / 5.56 NATO.  Rifle currently made and issued to the S. Korean Military as well as being used by other Countries.  They took the best of both rifles, an AK upper and a M16 lower.  Back in the 90's this rifle was listed as the second best military rifle in service, beating out the M16 and falling second behind the AK.

I have two of these rifles and both are set up with Quad rails.  These are fantastic shooters.  A company was specially making the quad rails for these rifles back in the 90's,.  this one is NEW in the original box and comes with one GI mag still in a wrapper.  Also has a Daewoo scope rail.  I still have the original plastic fore grip for it but the price is still the same.  I have no use for the quad rail as it will only fit this rifle.  

If you want one with  folding stock, warning, if it is not a K2 model you are probably in violation of AFT rules - FYI - so watch yourself

I am asking $1350 and considering these sell used for $1000 I think is a fair price as the scope rail will set you back $100, the quad rail anther $300, and muzzle break another $100.  And the fact that it is NEW.  If you do not want the muzzle break I will take it off and replace with original birdcage and drop price by $75 

I will get pictures up in a few days - thanks for looking"

I don't find any pitting, a couple of tiny scratches and the hammer has some discoloration on each side (he shot it almost exclusively single action).
