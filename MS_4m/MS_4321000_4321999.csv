I have a 1994 SKS-M paratrooper deal that I have not shot in 4 or 5 years. I bought it new at an estate auction about a decade ago, and shot exactly 1000 (+/- 40 hunting rounds) rounds through it - I only know that because I bought 1000 round case for $160 and have never purchased more except for the several years I took it deer hunting. Looks like these are worth about $500-800, and I did use it so probably more towards the $500 mark but, with the timbersmith and tech sites (really a great gun - I was shooting 100 yard 3"" groups with the irons with my much younger eyeballs) I think it is trade value at about $650. Original thumb rest stock with modification for the sights will be included. Rarest of the sKs- imported to get around the California ""list"" of banned guns.

Really want to get into an AR upper in 9mm or 7.62X39 but open to anything. I also have a dozen or so mags and brand new drum that I might be persuaded to throw in.

The frame and slide are forged steel, and are parkerized. The 3"" bull barrel is fully supported and ramped, and is also parkerized. Parkerizing gives the pistol a finish that's much tougher than anodizing.

The sights on the pistol are original G.I. style, with a low profile notched rear sight and low rounded front sight blade.

The grip safety is flat, just like the old G.I. 1911's, as is the trigger. Trigger pull on the Micro Compact G.I. is five to six pounds, which is a good pull weight for a carry pistol.

The Micro Compact G.I. 1911 is a pistol with a lot of character, and one that can fit in the palm of your hand. It comes with a lifetime warranty that's good even if you're not the original purchaser.

Has less than 50 rounds fired!

EASY TO CONCEAL- The SIG P938 SAS - is a carry pistol of the highest caliber. Inspired by the 1911, this lightweight handgun offers leading accuracy and durability, delivering total confidence when called upon.

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380 ACP counterpart, the P938 packs seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. 

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-sized SigLite Night Sights means the P938 handles like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release, and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Comes with one 7 round (flush) magazine and is equipped with SigLite Night Sights. 
SAS stands for Sig Anti Snag. 
The pistol has been dehorned ('melted') making it smooth and easier to conceal/draw.

This is a great ‘curry gun’  It has had some work done, I do not know how much, other than a cleaning I have not done anything to it.  
   Description:  
The Parkerization is nearly 100%.  I understand these guns were painted when in service.  I see some small bits of black paint on the receiver and rear sight where the paint is still present, someone did a good job removing most of the paint without damaging the finish under it.  
   The wood is in very good shape.  It is dark and has a few dings, there are no cracks or damage.  The butt plate is a little worn and has many small scratches, but is secure and in as good as can be expected for a 50 year old gun.  The butt-stock storage lid/hatch/cover operates perfectly.   
   The sights are the 2A version and are marked out to 2000.  The sling is not correct, someone told me it is to a mosin-nagant. The rifle is stamped with what looks like an Indian crest, and then Rifle 7.62mm, R.F.I. 1965.

I rate the gun’s condition at approx. 96% to 98% and its value is approx: $700.00. I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $465.00. 

This is a great example of an SMLE in a more modern, more common, and less expensive 308 round.

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired. In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.

Electric Airsoft Rifles use batteries as their power source and they shoot very fast. Some Electric Airsoft Rifles come with semi-automatic fire. That means that when you pull the trigger only 1 BB will come out at a time. Other Electric Airsoft Rifles come with full-automatic fire. This means that when you pull the trigger multiple BBs will come out at a time. The longer you hold the trigger down the more BBs come out. Check the description above to see which kind of gun this is and if it is right for you. Electric Airsoft Rifles don't require any pumping or cocking, just simply point and shoot. This is a High End Electric Airsoft Gun. Please only use .20 gram high quality BBs with this item in order to keep it in proper working order. Using anything else as ammunition for this gun will void the warranty and may cause it to jam. Also, to keep your Electric Airsoft Gun working properly, do not fire the gun when there are no BBs in it as it may cause damage to your gun. You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase this Airsoft gun."

The gun came from the s&w performance center with the ported polished barrel (which makes a huge difference in felt recoil!). I then added a Trijicon RMR dual illuminated sight with the 9 MOA green dot, Taran tactical magazine extensions (2 magazines) which increase your capacity to 22+1, an apex tactical aluminum action enhancement trigger, and a speed shooter specialties beveled magazine well, custom stippling, and also an apex tactical failure resistant extractor. Gun comes with everything mentioned plus boxes for both gun and trijicon sight, 2 extra grips (small and large) mediums are installed, tool and plate kit from s&w (for changing out holographic/red dot sights), and also an apex tactical armorers block for tinkering purposes. Gun is amazing but so is money and I need it. Asking $1000 cash deal no trades please. Thank you!"

All the Harley guys take notice, alot come over to check it out, admire the show room condition and compliment it, it's looks, it's sound, it's nostalgia !
There won't be another like it in the parking lot, no, most of them look like my other Harley, it's black with alot of chrome. Just like everyone else's. Not this one ....... 

1997 Harley Davidson Heritage Springer FLSTS

I have 2 Harleys and I'm looking to trade the museum piece Harley for a boat !!! Would even consider a convertible sports car for my wife since that's on the list also. I

Museum quality !!!

The sound....oh, the sound.......that Evolution V-twin ( EVO ) is normally aspirated and the sound all Harley owners want, but they can't get it with the modern fuel injected engines, tho' they try.

Do notice the original fishtail pipes !!!

Truly a collectors dream !!! This bike is a time capsule !!! You would search a very long time to find another 1997 OLD BOY with such low original miles!

Since this bike is completely original, you could call it a blank canvas. All Harley riders/owners add options and accessories to ""make it their own"", to allow their personality to show in their bike. This bike has been left near stock, even the tires are original and are mint. Not a crack anywhere! Only added Harley OEM options are the backrests. And they cost me a fortune a few months ago!!! OOooopppps, also added the light visors up front, EVERY classic needs them !

This bike sits as it did when it came off the showroom floor, sans the above aforementioned !!!

2,821 miles. That is NOT a misprint.

This bike should be shown and win every show it's entered in. How often do you see an all original 17 year old bike with 2,821 miles?

Unmolested, untouched as it came off the showroom floor. 

Fresh full synthetic oil.
New Harley battery.

This bike was owned by a 74 year old gentleman that didn't ride it, obviously.

This bike had been on my bucket list a LONG time and I'm not desperate to trade it, I will keep it if I don't get enough cash or a trade of equal value. I've had it awhile and it's time to let it go, I'm positioning for a move and can't take everything with me.

This ""Old Boy"" is an attention magnet !!! 

I'll continue to ride it a little until it's gone.

Everybody loves it, it's so classic and stylish. 

The history of the 1997 Heritage Springer is that it was designed after the 1948 Panhead. Those in the bike world refer to this as the ""Old Boy"", after the '48 Panhead.


Please don't waste my time or yours with idiotic offers, price is FIRM !!!  It's a 17 year old brand new bike. Go find another with 2,821 miles and in this condition. One thing is for sure, the value of this bike will only go up, never down. If you buy a brand new 2014 Harley today, 5 years from now it's worth $12,000.00?
What will this be worth in 5 years, over $20,000.00 for sure. 
There is a guy in New Jersey with a twin to this bike, his only has 1,000 miles, but he's asking OVER $30,000.00 !!! Ridiculous !

NO RIDES WITHOUT ALL THE CASH IN MY HAND !

Will also trade for Leer jet. Will need flying lessons.

If what you are offering on trade isn't worth $19,500.00 to you, it isn't worth it to me either. You know what you have, you know what it's worth, and I'm not stupid or easy to pull one over on, so let's keep it straight, please.

ALSO..............the truck in the barn is NOT mine, just a place to shoot a pic. It's NOT for sale.

THANKS !!!!!!!

DEALERS NOT WELCOME !!!    WILL NOT SHIP ANYWHERE <>< NOT EVEN IN THE STATES <>< !!!"

The ignition power comes from a patented* Clean-Fire primer that contains no lead, barium, or antimony. Lawman Clean-Fire leaves the range air and your firearm cleaner. Fired cases don't show the usual soot coating you see in most regular ammunition.

Anyone that knows me knows that I'm a bit of a CZ nut. Any anyone that's shot with my has probably seen this CZ-97, which has been one of my most well used and loved CZs. That said, there is a once in a blue moon opportunity to pick up a gun my collection needs, and I don't have the cash for it. While this gun has been great, it is replacable. So, reluctantly, I have to turn it into cash quickly to get this collectible before the auction expires. 

I HAVE to sell this - no trades, though I typically love trades. I'm pricing for sale because I need to move it in the next two days. If I don't have enough cash by Tuesday, my fairy princess slips out of my hands forever. And I have to get $600. I am happy to ship on your dime, which ought to be only about $30. I'm only selling to raise enough cash for the auction, and if I lose on Tuesday, then I'm going to hold on to it. Need a firm buyer by Tuesday, but I don't have to meet by then - I will need to meet or get cash by Friday though, which is when I'll expect to have to send payment. Please plan accordingly when messaging me. I'm in Leesburg, but work in Sterling. 

The gun has the factory wood grips on it, and has two Mec-gar 10 round mags that go with it. Unlike most CZs, this one likes lead bullets, as you can see, it eats a regular diet of my SWC match loads. Fair warning - the slide stop catches on some .45 rounds that are close to max .45 COAL. If you shoot factory ammo, shop around to find one that it likes. If you reload, load short. 

EDIT: Probably ought to talk about the gun a little. The CZ-97 is a .45acp - slide moves inside the frame, like other CZ's. There is a removable screw in barrel bushing, similar to a 1911. The mag is a double stack, 10 round mag, though I believe there are after market mags. The two that come with it have finger rests, though the gun itself is pretty large - comparable to most double stack .45's, plus maybe even a little, because the grips are rounded. The finish is parked, though I've kept it well oiled. There is no aftermarket hardware on it - its like you would get one from the factory. This is also a B, not a BD - no decocker on this model. It was manufactured in 2003."

Purchased this stock kit for a build I'm working on but before it arrived I found a different kit I liked better.  As it is this kit is brand new and unused and ready to be installed. Comes with the buffer tube, spring, buffer, castle nut, and a mil spec carbine stock. Buffer tube is mil spec in dimension and the positions are laser engraved so you can see what position your stock is in by just looking at it.  Great choice if you're working on a build right now and it will screw into any lower receiver with standard threads.

I have no use for it so I'd like to sell it for $50, just looking to get what I have in it back out.  Would also consider trades for AR mags or partial trade for quality optics of some kind.
