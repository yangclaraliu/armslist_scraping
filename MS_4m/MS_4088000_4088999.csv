3,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4088003,"For Sale:  Flare Pistol Outfit - Polish M78, 26.5mm","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 225,"Listed On: Sunday, March 22, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Polish Model 78 flare pistol that fires 26.5mm flare & smoke rounds. The M78 was made by Radom Arsenal as evidenced by the Circle 11 stamp on top of the barrel. It is a licensed copy of the HK P2A1. 

I've laid this pistol next to a P2A1 that I own and they appear identical except for the stampings on the frame and barrel. Although I haven't tried it appears that many if not all parts would interchange.

I can only describe this pistol as excellent with 98%+ of it's original finish. Mechanical function is perfect and bore looks new. I don't think that this particular pistol has been fired.

 It comes with a  green rope lanyard, a military flap style holster with shoulder strap that is in very good shape which is made of a a weatherproof woven vinyl in an OD green color. The holster has room for the pistol, a supply of flare cartridges and miscellaneous items.

Also included is an adapter that allows you to fire any .22LR, Long or Short ammunition turning this pistol into an excellent emergency self defense/survival tool for your ""bug out"" bag. Plus there is another adapter for firing the less expensive 12 gauge flares that are commonly available.

Finally there is a complete cleaning kit that has a stiff nylon brush for normal cleaning. A brass bristle brush for really heavy duty cleaning and a felt tipped rod that fits the bore snuggly eliminating the need for cleaning patches.

$225.00 with pickup in the Brandon area, or I can ship to places where this is legal for $15.
I will not ship to NY, CT, CA, HI, AK or IL without a current FOID card. Buyer must be at least 21 (because of .22 adapter) and I will check.

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects. Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

Provides a great armor platform to wear a chest rig over. (Does not fit Paraclete RAV armor inserts).

With the inertia drive system the recoil from a 2 3/4, 3, or 3 1/2"" shell is great because this Gun was made to hunt and hunt hard!

This is a gun that has the benefits from the engineering teams at Big Brothers Benelli and Beretta without their price tag, and you don't have to be as worried about actually using it to hunt. This gun is only two hunting seasons old but had put a lot of Waterfowl in the freezer! 

Comes with big Orange fiber optic sight fire ready target pick up, original box, paperwork, all 5 original chokes, and. 1 season old rubber gripping sling. Located in Wichita, KS $600 msg me any offers.

If you are looking to get into waterfowl hunting or just looking to beef up what you have I can also sell a dozen flambu mallard decoys Texas rigged, and a jet asked for hauling gear into the far back places where no one else is for an extra $120.

The SS109 bullet has a hardened steel penetrator and a mostly lead core.  This Swedish ammo has a 62gr. bullet with a hardened steel penetrator at the tip and a mild steel core - ALL STEEL core.  No lead at all, hence the ""non-toxic"" designation.  I guess it's a bit like the M855A1 ammo.

The unique bullet used in this ammo is longer than the green tipped SS109 and is very similar in length to the 77 Sierra Match king bullets (see photo - MK left, Carl Gustaff center, SS109 right).  It's supposed to provide 2MOA or better accuracy and also outperforms the M855 in penetration performance.

Made is 1967 so it is almost 50 years old, Long 26"" octagon barrel in 30-30 caliber. Receiver Engraved with Maple Leaves, Gold filled. The Forearm Cap and butt plate are Black Chrome.
This gun has been a ""Safe Queen"" in my collection for over 25 years. It has been shot , but looks better than many others that claim not to be shoot. The original box and papers are not available. Winchester made a lot of this model so it's not rare, just a pretty gun you can shoot. Priced below market value at $595. This is a clean honest gun, looks better in person than the photos represent.

Stoeger 8000 Cougar Pistols: Champions of Tactical Reliability

The new Stoeger 8000 Cougar semi-auto pistols inherit the reputation of the original Beretta 8000 as reliable, durable and powerful. First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy. The original Beretta Cougar was NATO qualified and boasted a long service-life of more than 30,000 9mm rounds. In its new incarnation, Beretta has developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the new Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail."

I guarantee there is not one to be had cheaper, legally. I have had it for some time now and really need to get it out of the house (my cat wants to play on it, so I have to shut the entire upstairs of the house off) I am open to reasonable offers and trades. it would be great in a man cave, gun room, trophy room, or lodge, or appropriate period home.

the other animals in the photos are a civet cat, a caracal, and an African wild cat that were taken not too much later than the polar bear. the large cats are $750 each, the small cat is $400, again reasonable offers or trades accepted. they have held up very well over the years. buy the polar bear and get the cats for free. the zebra rug is already sold."

Leupold Integrated Scope Base and 30mm Rings 
Great condition, Safe Kept and Dehumidified,  Less Than 100 Rounds (I am not the original owner, I am going off what I was told upon purchasing the rifle and adding the total of 40 rounds I shot through it to come to this conclusion).
Wood Furniture in excellent condition 
Gun was used to hunt with and has been in the woods before, there are VERY slight blemishes associated with general use such as tiny discoloration specks here and there in blueing and slight indentation around rear sling swivel from use. These are things that I can't even get a clear picture of, if you are a SERIOUS buyer I will do my best to capture some kind of pictures of any blemishes, this gun is in excellent condition and I only feel the need to make mention of such things to insure 100% buyer satisfaction and to acknowledge the fact that this is not a BRAND NEW firearm. Pictures shown here are of the condition of the firearm TODAY 03/01/2015.

Face to Face Cash Sales Preferred. Will travel within reasonable distance of Jackson, MI to meet buyer. Willing to ship at buyer's expense. Paypal plus fees and USPS money orders are acceptable for non-local sales.

It has only had 60 rounds through it for breaking in the barrel and sighting in the scope. It will easily shoot sub MOA at 100 and 300 yards. My local range does not go out any further but I have read multiple reviews of folks getting sub 3"" at 500 yards. This is an excellent rifle based on the classic Mauser action but updated by the masters at CZ.

The scope and mount that is currently on the rifle is a Nikon Monarch 3 5-20x44 with duplex reticle. Scope is like new with box and paperwork and this is the only rifle is has been mounted on. If you would like the scope and rings with the rifle, will sell complete for $1050 and include the Harris bipod.

The two models are identical in all other aspects of specifications and performance. Both are available in low-glare, heavy-duty black nitride or natural stainless steel finishes.
