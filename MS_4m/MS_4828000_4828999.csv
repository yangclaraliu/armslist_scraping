Beretta PX4 Storm 9mm,"Statesville, Winston Salem, North Carolina",$ 429,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 2, 2015",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm.  The Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The slide and barrel are steel and the light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

If wanting to trade, please be specific on what exactly you are offering, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  If the trade is not a good deal, I will pass.    

Trades considered:

About the only want I can think of right now is a Sig P938.  I've seen a couple models that sell new in the low $500's, so one of those would be perfect.  Let me know how much cash you need on top or other?  Also, could use a nice AR-10, something like the DPMS Recon G2 would work.  Let me know how much cash you need on top or other firearm maybe?

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Super Condition all around.  This is a one-owner vehicle; I bought it new from Honda Carland in Roswell GA in May 2008.  It has been my daily driver ever since.  I work in Atlanta, so I commute 40 miles one-way everyday from Canton, five days a week (down 575, 75 and then 285).  This car is extremely comfortable and drives very smoothly.  It is no wonder that Edmunds rates the vehicle as 5 stars out of 5 overall.  The reliability Index from Identifix reports the 2008 Accord as 4.5 stars out of 5 as well.  This is my third Accord, so I obviously love the vehicle and trust it.  This car is loaded.  Please feel free to ask me any questions or come take it for a test ride.  I have nearly all service records; Napa handled the oil changes every 5,000 miles like clockwork; Tires were purchased from Discount Tire; and Honda Carland performed all other services/checks etc."

 If you are hunting for a lightweight bow, the Mini Max is your answer. The Mini Max is just a little over 3 lbs and equipped with the legendary S-2 Cam. This shorty has been at the gym pumping weights! Not only is he lifting, he is power lifting! The ultra lightweight and short length of the Mini Max makes it ideal when using tree stands or ground blind hunting. This short sweet bow is accurate and consistent. Don't let the lightweight of the Mini Max fool you, it's a true force to be reckoned with.

 S-2 Cam - The High Performance S-2 Cam is a smooth drawing, highly efficient solo cam. The heart of the S-2 Cam is the flexible adjustment of the draw length and let-off. The adjustments are made with a simple turn of an allen wrench, with no bow press needed. Adjustable let-off 65-80%.

 I paid right at $1000.00 for this bow new with all of the accessories.

	Hey all, 
I have a used but in great condition classic Stainless 45 ACP pistol for sale. This is a Smith and Wesson 4506-1 45 ACP. This pistol has been used in service all over and are about as accurate as they come! I would keep this, but i prefer double stack 45s and really don’t need an additional 45 at the moment. This will also come with the magazine, Hogue Grips installed, and a drop leg holster for it as well. It does have the “glow” front sight, but it is very dim and doesn’t hold a “charge” long. I have not shot this myself, but the previous owner said it shot fine. I also have plenty of ammo available for an extra cost if you would like. 
	I would also consider trades on this, but mainly am looking for cash on it. No Blackpowders, bows, 40s, or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Some trades will need boot on your end, and certain trades i would consider adding on my side, but it needs to be a really good trade. Just like every used firearm, this is as-is, but you will have the opportunity to check it out before hand. Need to meet up in Norman on this. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting, 
JB"

	Hey all, I have a used but great shape Rossi 357 Magnum revolver. This is in a stainless finish and comes with a holster, 40 rounds of Winchester Defense Ammo, and has some great Rossi grips installed. This is in good shape and is a fantastic sidearm for deer season or for your nightstand in general. This is a classic wheelgun and will make someone a great sidearm. i would keep it, but I prefer Rugers.
	I would also consider trades on this, but mainly am looking for cash on it. No Blackpowders, bows, 40s, or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Some trades will need boot on your end, and certain trades i would consider adding on my side, but it needs to be a really good trade. Need to meet up in Norman on this.

Sealed tin box in bulk wood crate.  

Ideal for use in an SKS or AK-47 pattern rifle, these bargain 7.62x39 rounds are surplus Yugoslavian ammunition from the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike some Eastern Bloc ammo, these cartridges are non-magnetic and safe to use indoors. The 123 grain full metal jacket bullet delivers typical 7.62x39 ballistics. Each box in this case of 1,260 contains 15 rounds, which use corrosive Berdan primers and brass cases. Although this ammo is corrosive, it won't harm your rifle if you clean it after every range session. A chrome lined bore will provide even greater protection and make the cleaning process significantly easier."

 This car runs and drives good, the motor and transmission were replaced at 200,000 with salvage units that had around 38,000. This one hasn't been modded, it still has stock air intake, exhaust and wheels etc. It has a flat black paint job to cover multiple colored fenders that have been replaced (no body filler) due to a wintery road mishap. Everything works, it has decent tires the emergency brake is weak, and it could use an alignment in the future but drives fine like it is. The interior is clean, although has a few small burn holes in the seats and there is a rip in the passenger seatback. This would make a good first car, work car, 2nd car, etc. I had it inspected on 10-22 and it passed both safety and emissions, inspections are good for 60 days so if purchased within 60 days the inspection papers will come with it and you wont need to do it. I am asking $1100

The trades I will consider are for a decent cruiser style street bike 650cc or bigger or an atv of equal value -no junk or projects. possible partial trade for firearms

Info from Sig Sauer....
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Scorpion, features a flat dark earth frame, and slide, Hogue Extreme G-10 grips and mainspring cover.

Put about 75rds thru it last night without a hiccup. very sweet shooting gun. 
I have been wanting a double stack full size Para 1911 ever since they came out with them, finally got the chance to buy one recently but at the same time I bought something else I'd been looking for.. a Sig 10mm... Unfortunately for the Para, I am completely hooked on the 10mm & really don't have a reason to have both. Other than that, I love this thing.
won't let this go for less than $900, not worth it to me & I waited way too long to get one to let it go for less.
   Ammo in pics NOT included
Alot of these Para's on gunbroker . com currently but all but 2 last I checked were the single stack 8rd models, which are quite a bit cheaper.
Looking for CASH ONLY unless you have a Sig P220 R5 Elite 10mm with ammo, that is the ONLY trade I am interested in."

These were made in the first half of 1956 in China under Russian watch, Russia had sent a team of advisor's to China to show them how to manufacture the SKS Carbine. The S/N is to the left of the Arsenal 26 (Jianshe) mark and has a weird letter before the 4 digit S/N, that's how to tell this is a Sino Soviet. It has the correct Russian rear sight and uses a blade bayonet. It's a real true Type 56 Military SKS.

Someone has ground the bayonet lug off and the cleaning rod lug off as well. Was gonna keep it and put a new front sight block on it so I can take it back to it's Military form but I've decided to part with it. This SKS functions flawlessly, it's numbers matching except the magazine and stock, which is common with these. Bore is nice and bright with sharp rifling!

The SKS being sold is the one on the top in the pics, the lighter of the two with the sling and without the bayonet, the bottom one(my numbers matching Romanian)IS NOT FOR SALE!

Need the cash.. $325, which is a steal as this is easily a $450+ SKS
