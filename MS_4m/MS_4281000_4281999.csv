I'm selling this beauty to fund a much more expensive knife project. First $360 takes it!

Features:

Large Hollow Grind Technology—the first blade to feature this new grind that blends the best of hollow and flat grinds.

Shaped phosphor bronze washer on the lock side brings additional stability to that side of the blade.

One-eighth inch ceramic ball acts as the interface between the lock bar and the blade, and doubles to drop into the detent, ensuring the blade stays in place when closed.

Larger perforations in the washers reduce friction, store more lubricant and offer space for small dirt particles to move away from the blade/washer interface, helping to prevent blade action from becoming ""sticky"".

416 Heat treated stainless steel stop pin is interference fit into the lock side of the handle.

Asymmetrical pattern thumb serrations on a curved thumb ramp of the blade give excellent purchase.

At 0.140” (3.56mm), the blade is more robust blade than previous Sebenza models.

The glass is crystal clear, and it makes shooting a joy.  The coolest feature is the custom elevation turret.  Instead of being marked in MOA or MIL increments, the turret is marked with the proper bullet drop for a 5.56 or .223 round.  The one that is on there is matched for green tip ammo, but if you shoot a different load, you can get a free turret custom made from Burris that is ballistically matched to your exact load.  I have not redeemed my free turret code, so you would be able to get it made.

Chips are drawn off through a vacuum manifold that clamps to the outside of the special size/trim die. (Vacuum cleaner and hose not included.) Outside diameter of manifold as 1.250"" You will need to purchase the correct trim die for the rifle caliber your trimming.

This gun shoots great and has functioned flawlessly through the 300 or so rounds I've shot with it. The lower is a Spikes Calico Jack receiver with Spikes LPK, pistol buffer tube and Sig Brace. The trigger in this kit is very nice and feels better than my Colt trigger imho. The upper is a 10.5"" Barnes Precision with quad rail and Noveske Pig replica muzzle device. Includes 2 pmags. Optic not included. This gun could very nearly pass for new. I have enjoyed shooting it but it's time for something new in my life. I'd trade towards a Tavor with cash on my end but otherwise it's for sale only. I will meet serious buyers at a local range if you'd like to shoot it before purchasing but must have cash in hand.

History;
Assembled in 1989 as a Bush Rifle from SAI, it came with USGI Parts and had roughly 200 rounds when [U]it was put into the previous owner’s safe in 1990[/U]. It sat there until I bought it 3 years ago when the owner’s son was tasked with selling what was in the safe. I put 140 rounds through it one day and it sat for 3 years until I had the money to do the build. I have had it sitting since the build and have not fired it yet. It was only test fired as the final step of the build.
** Will include Ammo with Asking Price (Roughly 350 Rounds)"

When I received it, it had a bright-colored custom paint job, which I sanded to a smooth finish and applied two coats of black matte.  The new finish is good and looks quite decent, but there are some very tiny (easy to ignore) blemishes where I didn't apply quite enough thickness.

This would make a great gun for relaxation at the range, varmint, or however else you would normally use a fine .22 LR with professional quality scope.

It is the Compact Medium model.  I purchased it as a 9mm with 2 9mm 15 round magazines.  I then purchased, directly from Sig, the 357 Sig updrade.  The upgrade includes a new slide, barrel, Compact Medium frame and 1 13 round 40/357 magazine. Both slides have night sights!!! 

What makes the P320 special?  It is an upgrade to the P250 from a few years ago.  The pistol frame is not serialized, it is the trigger pack.  The trigger pack can be put into any of the P320 frames and their slides.  Please look up all the combo's on Sig's website.  The biggest thing about that, you can have ANY combo, but once you own the trigger pack, you can add any frame, slide, and barrel withough having to go through a dealer.

The swap between the two calibers is simple, especially since the 9mm and 357 slide use the same frame, you can litterally change calibers in seconds.  Simply lock the slide to the rear, turn the takedown lever downward, release the slide and remove it.  Take the new slide, put it on, and lock it to the rear.  Rotate the takedown lever to the original position, insert the new magazine, and let the slide lock forward.

I have about 150 rounds through both calibers.  I even worked up a custom load for both 9mm and 357 SIG.  I love this pistol.  It is incredibly accurate, recoil is very managable, even with the kick-happy 357 round.  The 357 workup was pushing 125g Hornady XTPs at almost 1500 fps.  The most accurate load is a little slower at 1440 fps.  

Now, the question would probably be....why get rid of it?  Well, for me, I am just not sure where it fits in.  I thought about waiting for the 45 slide and barrel or getting a sub-combact frame/slide.  I sure don't want to go anything smaller than this with a 357.  I have a M&P Shield 9mm, and a Wilson-ized Beretta M9.

2x Sig Sauer Plastic Cases
2x Sig Polymer Compact Medium Frames
1x Sig Serialized Trigger pack (Custom polished trigger group for smoother pull and lower pull weight)

622,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4281622,For Sale/Trade:  Springfield Armory 1911 EMP® 9mm,"Coventry, Rhode Island, United States",$ 900,"Listed On: Monday, June 22, 2015",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Spent a lot of time searching for and researching this pistol online before making the leap. And even though the specs and reviews told me that this was a compact carry, it didn't matter as I was already sold on the review, construction, and very cool looks of this piece. So, I went ahead and bought it even though I had never had my hands on one.

Wasn't disappointed when it arrived and it without a doubt is the nicest pistol I own. It came with the Cocobolo wood grips (I ordered two pairs of VGRIP replacements - G10 in the pics - makes the grip slightly meatier - and another black pair because I just couldn't decide because they both were pretty cool) 

The trigger is crisp and it comes right up into sight picture with a feel that makes you think it is actually a full size pistol. (no dangling pinky) ... It's one of those pieces that you pick up and it just fits your hand and instantly feels like an extension.

There are only two hundred rounds through it, if that. Not a single failure. If I thought for a second that I had any chance of getting a carry permit, this gun would not be up for sale. I bough it in February, took it to the range twice, showed me why people love 1911s with the nice groups I put together, and cleaned it twice.

But that brings me to my reason for selling it.  It's just not what I was looking for and I can't justify having this much money tied up in a gun that I just will never get a chance to put into the kind of service it was designed for. 

-It comes with three 9 round mags
-The usual holster and mag holders you get with Springfield products.
-Also comes with three pairs of grips. (the original and the two VZ grip sets I added)

 Now on to the good stuff. I'm considering trading my S&W mil-spec M&P 15 M-4 carbine. It's in excellent condition and always been very well cared for. Under 500 rounds layed down. It has the following upgrades, aluminum quad rail, vertical grip, bsa acog clone with built in laser, 45° offset back up sites, hogue grip, shark muzzle break, polished trigger group, and S&W blue color fill. I also have 10 polymer mags (all full of m193) and a total of 940 rounds of ammo.  I also have all the original parts and for the right deal a TLR1 light. If the offer is really nice I can include the pelican case she sleeps in now.
 This rifle is an absolute tack driver and has never once had a misfeed, fte, ftf, stove pipe, not a hick up ever. This is not the cheap sporter you can get for $600 at Walmart, this is a top shelf rifle. I'm not going to BS you with a list of prices on all the upgrades and ammo. Most of you guys already know as well as I do what they would cost. I'm not desperate to trade this off so I expect reasonable offers. Low ball offers will be ignored. I will not break up this package, it's an all or nothing proposition."

I love this gun, but... The barel is too long, I want a 454 I can hike with. This is a hunting revolver, super accurate and controllable. I've personally shot man sized steel out to 200 yards with this 5 for 5 rounds. Has a fantastic single action.
    If you want a big bore hunting handgun the 454 caliber is the best one with all things considered. This gun has about 100 rounds through it and is super smooth. I have been hesitant to sell or trade because I feel like I got a ""good one"" but it's too big for hiking, so I end up never using it. 

Includes:
Revolver
1 nylon chest holster
1 custom leather holster made in Alaska that can be a chest holster or worn on a belt
2 really nice speed loaders (not cheap)

These rifle were produced in a limited number. I purchased this rifle New In Box and it has never been fired. No dents or scratches . . . NIB in very way. 
24"" Bbl, Original SS Scope Rings, box and paper work. LC (Light & Crisp) trigger is outstanding and is Ruger's very best. I rate this edition as one of Ruger's all time best rifles. The green/gray/black laminate stock has the checkering found only on those limited rifles. 
This rifle configuration will completely withstand adverse weather conditions and never fail you with its stainless steel, Laminated stock and robust controlled round feed action.
I also have a matching 338 Win Mag in this same rifle (not Consecutive serial number) listed. 
These rifles are no longer available and you would be hard pressed to ever find them ""New In Box"" again. Shipping: $35.00 ... prefer face to face sale. All ATF rules apply.
