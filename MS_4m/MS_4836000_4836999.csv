However, a factor that really insured the success of the 1873 Winchester rifles was that Colt quickly offered its Peacemaker chambered in .44-40, as well. A cowboy could have both a lever-action rifle and his six shooter, and needed only one cartridge belt for both. Most Texas Rangers and every old West cowboy worth his salt carried 1873 rifles. Chappo, the son of Apache war chief Geronimo, packed an 1873. And Buffalo Bill carried an 1873 lever-action rifle along with a pair of .44-40 Colts in 1876 when he worked as an Army scout.

Description:
Serial #8355, 9mm Para., 4” barrel with a fine, bright bore that has very faint traces of freckling within the grooves. This is a 1919 dated pistol that has all matching numbers (except for the unnumbered grips) and the metal retaining 80-85% of the original blue finish that has silvered along the exposed edges and surfaces. Additionally, there is some pinprick pitting at the muzzle (which exhibits some cleaning as well) and on the left sides of the take-down lever, trigger, and safety lever. The trigger and take-down lever have lots of original straw color remaining on the right side, as do the magazine release and ejector. The checkered wooden grips are in very good shape with light flattening of the points on either side as well as some slightly heavier wear at the butt. The pistol comes with a single matching numbered wood base magazine and is a very good-fine example of a World War I Luger overall. must sign firearms bill of sale  thanks"

Bought it brand new from Amazon. Shot it in the backyard of my subdivision some and took care of quite a few starlings nesting in the BBQ grill. It's plenty quiet. You can hear the twang of the spring and the pellet hitting but it's not real loud. Doesn't sound like a gun, just a clack/twang kinda sound. Idk. That's why I bought it. Set up a nice backstop in the backyard and never had any complaints or even rousing any suspicion. Haven't shot in about 2 months but Took it out yesterday and it still works perfect. I can hit a penny across my backyard, which is 23 yards. That's accurate enough for me! Longest shot was 45 yards on a starling in my neighbors tree. With a cheap Centerpoint scope from Walmart, you'll be in great shape. Anyway, if you have any questions let me know! Thanks!"

The model K226 is suitable for ladies, youths or indeed most adult shooters as this particular model is of standard dimensions and not intended for smaller youths. 

Construction is based upon a design typical of guns from the Brescia region of Italy, featuring two large hardened steel trunnions set into the receiver’s front inner side walls upon which the barrels hinge for opening and closing. A full-width locking bolt is set into the bottom of the standing breech face and this engages with a locking wedge recess machined into the monobloc breech below the bottom barrel; a conventional top lever operates the bolt. This arrangement is well established as being sound, efficient and reliable and Turkish maker Khan has adopted the system well.

Barrels are built using the monobloc method, the breech block sides nicely jewel-finished, and chambers bored for 3-inch cartridges. The two tubes are joined by ventilated side ribs for lighter weight, improved balance and heat dispersion; they have been polished before being well blacked. A brass front sight is also fitted.

Description:
Serial #8355, 9mm Para., 4” barrel with a fine, bright bore that has very faint traces of freckling within the grooves. This is a 1919 dated pistol that has all matching numbers (except for the unnumbered grips) and the metal retaining 80-85% of the original blue finish that has silvered along the exposed edges and surfaces. Additionally, there is some pinprick pitting at the muzzle (which exhibits some cleaning as well) and on the left sides of the take-down lever, trigger, and safety lever. The trigger and take-down lever have lots of original straw color remaining on the right side, as do the magazine release and ejector. The checkered wooden grips are in very good shape with light flattening of the points on either side as well as some slightly heavier wear at the butt. The pistol comes with a single matching numbered wood base magazine and is a very good-fine example of a World War I Luger overall. must sign firearms bill of sale  thanks"

I harvested what i wanted, replaced with brand new parts ( barrel nut, delta ring,hand guard cap, hand guards, fire control group).I rebuilt the bolt with new gas rings (more of a tune up than anything). The rifle has lots of finish wear. You can't get this kind of patina, it has to be earned. Lower is marked ""Restricted - Law Enforcement / Government Use Only"". I bought this from a licensed dealer on a form 4473, so no concerns about it being legal to own. It has a rear single point sling attachment point,collapsible stock, 16"" medium profile barrel, bayonet lug, 30 round magazine,No sights (acog not included,unless you want to spend $700 on it).Does not look to have been shot alot, just carried alot, little internal wear. If you want a rifle with battle wear, this is it.Not interested in trades unless heavily weighted in my favor to justify selling said trades, mainly trying to recoup some of the money spent on it. $500 .John REDACTED"

The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms. Features:Caliber: 380 ACPCapacity: 6 plus an extended magazineBarrel Length: 2.7""Finish: 2-Tone silver slide, black frameAction: semi-automaticGrip width: 18Height: 4""Length: 5.1""Width: .725""Sight Radius: 3.3""Weight: 11.5 ozSnag Free DesignSimple Disassembly3-Dot SystemStorage CaseStainless Steel MagazinesTwo Size Magazine sizes includedAmbidextrous Magazine Release"

The short action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore. The actions lugs have also been squared and trued. The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared. All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.

A brand new Shilen, match grade, chrome barrel was used for this build. The contour is a #4 contour (classic sporter), 8 twist and finished at 26"" - can be cut to any length you prefer. The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown. The barrel has only 3 rounds through her... I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was caustic blued but can always be customized to your needs... Maybe add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; Jewell trigger, ect.

The barreled action in a quality stock will easily shoot 3/4 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/2 MOA or better using hand loaded ammo. I have a few HS precision stocks and a few Bell and Carlson stocks to offer with this build.  The pics enclosed is of a Bell and Carlson Sporter stock - green with black web.

I can offer the barreled action for 1200 or the complete rifle with the Bell and Carlson stock and BDL bottom metal for 1600.   

I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s available as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note... I probably have it or can build it.

Will ship to your FFL if needed."

The short action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore. The actions lugs have also been squared and trued. The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared. All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.

A brand new Shilen, match grade, chrome barrel was used for this build. The contour is a sendero contour (Remington varmint), 12 twist and finished at 26"". The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown. The barrel has only 3 rounds through her... I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was caustic blued but can always be customized to your needs... Maybe add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; Jewell trigger, ect.

The barreled action in a quality stock will easily shoot 3/4 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/2 MOA or better using hand loaded ammo. I have a few HS precision stocks and a few Bell and Carlson stocks to offer with this build.

The barreled action is sitting in an HS precision 'police' stock - tan with black web.  The complete rifle also comes with an Accuracy Internal detachable mag.  The AI mag is a 10 round mag.

I can offer just the barreled action for 1200 or I can offer the complete rifle with the AI detachable mag/trigger guard and the HS precision stock for 1650. If you like the rifle - make a reasonable offer...

I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s available as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note... I probably have it or can build it.

Will ship to your FFL."

Both chamberings offered in the Carbine are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage and the availability of surplus ammunition.Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo.

This Sino-Soviet rifle comes from the Jianshe Arsenal Factory and is dated to the year 1956, the FIRST year Jianshe arsenal started building SKS's for China. This SKS is all numbers matching except for the stock (I don't believe the Chinese stamped their stocks) and is in excellent condition (Beautiful metal, deep rifling, good bore, etc) The Serial number is also pretty cool (211122) and increases the collectability because of the use of only two numbers! This firearm was dated using http://www.yooperj.com/SKS-24.htm so please double check and see that this is legitimate. This SKS would be an AWESOME addition to gun collectors and history buffs alike! $600If you have any questions please feel free to call or text 52zero-86one-7seven3one I normally would not sell this because I love sks's but I have some other projects I am working on. Some people might say that is a crazy price because AK's are $500 and an AR can be built for $350, but they are not building SKS's. This has increased their value because the market is flooding with ""modern"" firearms. SKS shoot the same rounds as an AK, while also retaining collector value. Get the best of both worlds today with this great piece of firearms history!"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ's corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.Item #: 91152UPC_Code: REDACTED26Description: CZU CZ75 SP-01 9MM DA 18RD NSManufacturer: CZ-USAModel #: CZ 75 SP-01Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Black PolycoatStock: Black Rubber Grips, Extended BeavertailSights: Tritium Night SightsBarrel: 4.61Overall Length: 8.15Weight: 38.4 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 18+1Action: Double Action# of Mags: 2 Packaging: Plastic Case with Cable LockReceiver: Steel, Integral 1913 Accessory RailFeatures: Checkered Front & Back StrapsWe strive to provide correct and accurate information.

The biggest, highest capacity (with factory parts) .45acp handgun. That's right, and FN FNP 45 pistol. Only 2 magazines through it, and it is in perfect condition with box and everything. Want to be ready to go out and take care of business? No problem, because along with this bad @&% pistol, you get:
-Blackpoint OWB Holster 
-Blackpoint Dual Mag holder 
-100 rounds of FMJ 
-1 box Hornady Critical Defense 
-2x 15 round FN factory mags

You want all that? Fine, you get that package ($850 value) for $700.

There is more though. You can also get a Ruger Blackhawk beast of a .45. Very low use and with all the Ruger goodies it came with. Still need more? You got it. This revolver not only has a cylinder chambered in .45acp (that's right, no moon clips needed), it also comes with a cylinder chambered in the proven and powerful .45colt. It literally takes 7 seconds to change the two cylinders. You want this revolver? You got it. $600 value for only $500. 

You want something even better? You talked me into it. You pick them both up, and only $1050. You heard me. Another $150 off. That's because you rock, and you deserve something awesome. Now, send me an email or text me at REDACTED and it's all yours."
