The original build was as follows:

•M15SA lower receiver (LRB ARMS) made from aircraft grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging same as currently used by US military, with 16"" inch M4 contour barrel and A3 Upper receiver

•M4 Feed Ramp barrel extension

•1-9"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand twist

•5.56mm chamber (shoot either 5.56mm or .223)

•11595E Barrel steel Manganese Phosphate finish barrel

•This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer

•The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break

•It sports M4 contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function

•The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32

•The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel

•This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection

•These barrels are of Mil-spec M4 contour (.750 under the front sight base) complete with the M203 groove in the front

•This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy

•The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist

•The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights

•The barrel is mounted on a A3 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW, with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec

•This upper has the newest Mil-spec A3 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable elevation to 800 meters and more than 30 minutes of windage adjustment at 1/2 MOA per click

•The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover

•The buttstock tube is the mil spec thickness (1.145"" OD) M4 buttstock (not the cheaper carbine buttstock)

•This buttstock features 6 positions for maximum shooter comfort, reinforced design for heavy duty use, and the correct M4 lock nut"

The good-
Has HID headlights, CD player, starts right up and runs very well. Does not slip in any of the gears, power is very consistent and smooth, suspension is in great shape, and the tires and wheels are in good shape.

It's got red plasti-dip on three of the tires which comes off easily, some minor interior issues, probably needs a battery, has a very small amount of rust on the front quarter panel, it does have a ""rebuilt"" Wyoming title (can easily be registered in Colorado), it is leaking oil (not sure from where or how bad it is, not much of a car guy)

Minus the oil leaking, this is a very solid driveable car. No tranny or major motor issues are apparent at all. Let me know if you have any other questions

In case you need more clarification on why this gun is $800: Stock Glocks at any gun store sell for $550-$600.  This is NOT a normal Glock.  It came with the Vickers Tactical extended mag release, extended slide stop, tactical sights and magazine base plates. Only 5000 of these were made with the LAV serial number.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the M1A™ SOCOM 16's unique design.

The M1A™ Socom 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the M1A™ SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.

If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the M1A™ SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™.

When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.

The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.

You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

This gun is the most accurate AK I have ever handled. The chrome-lined barrel makes shooting long strings possible without any barrel damage. This gun has barley been shot and has a perfect bore and rifling. The fit and finish on this Norinco is excellent (This is not your average WASR AK).

This is the P380, NOT a CW380. The P models are more expensive and worth it.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings.

CASH and CCW preferred."

Enter the M1A™ SOCOM II. It brings you all the compact power, performance and reliability of the M1A™ SOCOM 16 with the added capability of a rail system.

The M1A™ SOCOM II has a quad-rail that will allow you to mount whatever accessories your application requires. Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The M1A™ SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the M1A™ SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the M1A™ SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

I put another 50 rounds through it when it came back just to make sure it functioned properly, which it did. I need to make room in my safe for something new, so something old has to go.
