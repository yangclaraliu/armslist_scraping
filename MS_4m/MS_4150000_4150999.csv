Maybe 130-150 rounds thru it (variety of Federal and PMC 230 grain FMJ, Barnes 185 grain +P TAC-XPD, Federal HST, and Hornady Critical Duty 220 grain +p). Might not be that many though.
All shot flawlessly with the Barnes, Federal HST, and Hornady being very accurate (obviously, those a premium self defense rounds. Like my 36 better (Just personal preference). 
Looking to trade for Glock 19 with night sights or Ruger LC9s or Pro version plus boot. Trade needs to be LNIB, NIB or dang close. Includes 50 or 60 rounds  of Federal 230 grain ball ammo, 15 rounds of the Barnes rounds listed above, 15 rounds of Federal 230 Grain HST (I believe), almost a whole 50 round box of LEO marked Federal Tactical HST 230 Grain +P, and a full box of the Hornady Critical Duty listed above. I need to check but I believe I have some more fmj ammo. Comes with (2) 10 round magazines, case, everything from the factory plus a 27 round magazine and a IWB holster. I also added a Pierce base plate that is like another finger groove to one of the 10 round magazines. Comes with a new spare recoil guide rod assembly.
 Cash offer can be made, but mainly looking for something in 9mm like a Glock 19 or Ruger LC9s or LC9s Pro. Would like night sights.

I am selling this rifle because I need more distance out of my 7.62 precision gas gun. 
I have less than 1000 rounds through this rifle, all have been with 168-175gr factory match grade ammo. It does have some minor scuff markings from wear and tear but is truly in great condition. 
It has performed at the level to be expected from a Larue gun. It is a .5-.75 MOA gun all day long, accurate to approx. 900 yds, depending on shooter skills and load. The scope on this gun was designed by David Tubb and has an outstanding reticle (DTR V2), which is designed for holdovers, essentially not ever having to dial on this scope. 
I liked the scope so much I took it with me on a deployment to Afghanistan and traded it in for a new scope when I returned. It is a fast reticle, but will take practice to learn how to effectively use it. The scope will come with the manual. 

Cashier's check, money order and/or cash only. 

**I will add two 6 hour days of of one on one marksmanship training for whoever purchases this rifle system. I am a military trained Sniper with over 15 years of experience. This would normally be between $1,000-$2,000 for two days of training, and is included with the price of the system.**"

Factory nickel receiver
Forend, barrel, and receiver numbers match

Buttstock is not original: purchased from Gunstocks.com and still requires some fitting. Originally came with a pistol grip, filed to make it a straight English stock.

Comes with an extra barrel that was cut down to 24"", is missing the bead, and the rib is loose and needs to be repaired. Note: because it was cut, the bores are cyl/cyl.

*** This is a project gun, and here's why ***

I bought it about a year ago. It will fire both barrels, but it will also fire both sometimes, at the same time. The hammer/sear interface on the left barrel is not sound. Sometimes the hammers do not cock soundly. Currently there is a safety block installed so that the triggers cannot move. This is easily removable once the innards are repaired.

335's are older guns, but the nickel receiver is rare, and the condition of the nickel is exceptional. If a person wanted to look for new internals, and finish the stock, this would be a very attractive and sound gun. I'm not up for it right now, so I am passing it of to someone else I hope.

Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

Comes with mount, bag, battery, manual and blank registration.
It's a really low time unit, I've taken it out hunting twice and a couple times around the house getting used to it.
I've accumulated less than 12hrs of use.
One image shows the accessories on the table in low light conditions (complete darkness minus a computer screen in the next room)
The other was taken on a moonless night with a few streetlights about 200yds or more away, the bright spot on the barn is roughly 25yds away being illuminated by a DBAL.
I'm not very good at getting nice pictures through the scope with a phone, they look far better in person (you're welcome to take it for a test drive).
For some reason the auto-focus would go straight past a clear image in favor of blurry shots.
Prices are all over the place for these scopes, from $1,800 new down to $800 for worn out surplus bringbacks.
This is essentially a new scope and shows virtually no signs of use other than the head band cushion is starting to come unglued.
Two tiny blems at 7:00 and 8:00 close to the edge, FPN (honeycomb pattern) visible with enough ambient light...overall it's a pretty clean tube.
Plenty of accessories out there for this unit, like higher magnification lenses and helmet mounts.

The development of the self-contained, pinfire cartridge by Casimir Lefaucheux in 1836 would dramatically affect the popularity of the pepperbox in coming decades. 

The success of the cartridge system and the revolver spawned hundreds of variations, copies, improvements and outright patent infringements on the Lefaucheux design throughout Europe, especially in France and Belgium.

Everything appears to be mechanically sound and firearm locks up correctly when hammer is let down. Frame and cylinder construction appears to be of either brass or bronze alloy, hammer and trigger are steel. Grips are of a European Burlwood and show rich grain, appears to still have the original finish intact on 80%+. Original fired casing ""ejector rod"" is threaded into the bottom of the grip.

It features a beautiful case hardened and blued finish and hand checkered wood grips.  It is of course single action only and is beautiful.  I paid $650 for just the pistol after taxes at Buds but I'm only looking for $500 for everything.  I also have 2 boxes (100 rounds) of 45 Long Colt and a leather cross draw holster that I'll throw in for free.  The ammo cost me $30 a box and the holster was $45.

The National Championships are in Friendship Indianna at the NMLRA (National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association) headquarters on their range. The program or course of fire closely imitates the conventioal bullseye program. A 25 yard slow fire target And a 25 yard timed fire target and a 50 yard slow fire target make up an agg for the caplock pistol and that course of fire is also fired with a flintlock pistol. The percusion revolver is the same with an additional 25 meter international target at 25 yards. This makes up a 1000 point match. Ammunition and components are cheaper than conventional pistol and easier to find. Give blackpowder bullseye pistol some thought. Contact me with questions. Local competition could be available with enough interest. At least call or email me and you could test fire my guns. That might give you more insight to the sport.

I bought it new a few weeks ago and have only put 120rds through it. I've realized is rather have another Glock or build another AR since then.

Anyway, the ak will come in its original box with 2 30rd mags (1tapco and 1 magpul) with a sling and cleaning kit. I've also added a magpul moe + ak grip to the ak for a better feel over the stock girly-man commie grip. I'll include the original too. This WASR is a 2014 production gun, meaning that the wood and attention to detail on it are much better than previous models. It is unfired and has only been racked and disassembled a few times.

I prefer a cash sale and I would be looking for $525 for this one. You'll need a valid NCDL and I want to see a ccw or original pistol permit for my peace of mind. Seeing a permit is a for a long gun is not an NC requirement, but it is one of mine, no exceptions.

We both get a bill of sale. FTF meetings in the matthews/southeast clt area only.

In trade, I'd be open to the following, but cash talks much louder:

-a gen 4 g19 with night sights and all factory goodies
-an s&w 642 no lock model plus $250
-a factory assembled PSA AR lower plus $300

I have additional steel and magpul mags as well as 600rds of 7.62x39 that could be added or sold in addition to the ak. The pic below is not of the actual WASR for sale, but mine looks exactly like it"

Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have..... 

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright. I can acid test it in front of you to show purity

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. 

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment, night vision.

ok guys and gals.

I thought I would list this service and see the interest.


I do image artwork of your firearm or any image really that you would like. Since I have done some for others I thought I would list this for the group 
The size of the image has to be of a size that will work. Phone pictures sometime work, but not always. Most times we get together and discuss your needs and wats and come to a price agree.

These are all done just for you and for sharing as you want . They make great gifts of your special gun.

email me with interest.

I have done many and people have always loved them. I can provide image artwork for you of many things not limited to firearms.

Depending on the work and scope needed barter can be done i would think. 

I just placed a fifty price for a place holder. Depending on what yiu want it could be less or a lot more. Each individual wants and needs different items.  

Attached are two for your review and enjoyment
I hope to get an email from you soon to discuss
