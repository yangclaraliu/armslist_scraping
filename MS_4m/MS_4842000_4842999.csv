12 gauge 
18"" security barrel
ATI adjustable stock (doesn't come with adjustable cheek riser, didnt work well so I didnt keep it)

I will be honest, this is a very experience shotgun, it has been shot alot, cared for well, and it killed many ducks. This has been my duck hunting shotgun for many years as well as my personal defense weapon. I thought I would like hunting with the stock but it raised my head too high so I couldn't naturally see the beads. So I got a second Mossberg 500 with the security barrel and swapped barrels. The barrel has only had 3 rounds fired through it. 
I finally turned 21 so obviously I bought a pistol and prefer the pistol over the shotgun.

This is the last sig in my stash hate to sell it but well I can’t enjoy it as much as I should so I will sell it to someone else it has a small blemish on the slide it has been fired 400 times and is a commercial model not a police trade it comes with four magazines one zipper back two regular and one eight round pro mag absolutely phenomenal pistol 
It has the old school KKote and early style spur hammer also has early style plastic grips the date code is KC(1992) when you rack the slide it feels as smooth as glass trigger pull is great a little take up but crisp like breaking a glass rod it’s a dream to shoot better than any one I have ever handled judge for yourself from the pictures

This gun currently has a Burris Fastfire II mounted on it. I would prefer to sell the combo. However you could make an offer for just the rifle and I will consider it. This rifle was carefully and properly assembled. The trigger has had a lot of work done to it and is fantastic. Light and crisp. The gun was sprayed with white Duracoat and it has held up fine, besides a few marks where the ejected brass hits the upper receiver. This rifle has ~150 rounds through it and works great. It will come with the Magpul 40 rd mag which was also duracoated. Price is $975 obo for the rifle with the optic. (404)Three zero eight - 520nine. Please only text as I am working most of the day. Valid ptp or ccp is required unless you can prove it isn't necessary."

A crisp 4.5 – 5lb National Match tuned two-stage trigger will ensure you can place your shots exactly where and when you intend. The .0595” hooded rear aperture sight gives precise ½ MOA adjustments for both windage and elevation. The rear sight combined with the .062” front sight blade gives the shooter precise target acquisition capability. A National Match recoil spring guide and match-tuned gas cylinder ensure that the rifle will operate with reliable accuracy.

Wood is new Boyd's replacement from the CMP that I stripped off another gun that I restored for personal collection. The wood receiver fit is super. Barrel is replacement 1955 dated, but gauges 1 or less on the throat and muzzle, bore 9+/10. Most of the parts are period correct for this Garand other then: OpRod, Barrel, Wood, Hammer and follower spring arm. The rear sight is a Type II Lockbar. Comes with 2 enbloc clips. 

Asking $SPF FTF (shipped on your dime) for what is basically a CMP special grade with superior USGI barrel and most of the correct era parts. I was going to finish off with more correct parts and barrel, but this one shot well after the build I didn't want to go any further, maybe you can swap the rest of the parts out if that's you're preference. Or find the correct stock and have both a shooter and a  showpiece.

Springfield Armory A.R.T. IV, 1-inch 3x9 variable power riflescope

ART IV Scope Background: 
. The A.R.T. IV is a superior quality variable power telescopic sighting system commercially manufactured by Buris and sold by Springfield Armory in the mid to late 1980s. 
. It is specifically applicable to all M1 Garand, M14 and M1A, BM59 and BM62, Valmet M76 and M78, SIG 510-4 and AMT, FAL, LAR, StG 58, L1A1, SAR 48, SAR 4800, SAR 8, HK91, and other rifles using the 7.62x51mm NATO/.308 Win., .30-06, and similar cartridges. 

Features: 
. Automatic range finding. 
. Automatic compensating reticle crosshair plex to maintain bullet-impact zero. 
. Calibrated for .308 Win., 168-grain bullets at 2600 fps and compensates for bullet-drop from 200 to 550 yards. 

How to Use: 
. Zero the rifle at 200 yards. 
. The two stadia lines at the bottom represent 18 inches at any distance. 
. Dial magnification until 18 inches of target fits into the two stadia lines. 
. The center horizontal crosshair splits and begins to separate. If shooting at 200 yards (at any magnification between 3x and 9x), use the top crosshair. If shooting at an unknown distance and have dialed in your stadia lines, use the bottom crosshair as it is compensating for holdover at the dialed in range."

I sell based on weight (so I don't have to count individual cases)
Price per bag:
Bag weighs 2lb 9oz (that is approximately 250 cases) : $10
I can ship or do face to face:
$6 shipping for one bag.
$13 shipping for two to eight bags.
Specifics:
This is tumbled range brass
It is possible some 9mm brass might be embedded in the .40 cal brass so I throw in a half a dozen extra cases to compensate.
My scale is brand new, but I can't vouch that its measurements are super accurate. But it is pretty repeatable, so its reading of 2lb 9oz consistently produces around 250 cases."

This pistol is in excellent condition and has only had about 600 rounds fired through it, flawlessly.  Picked up something slightly smaller for concealed carry and so the wife can shoot at the range otherwise I'd keep this pistol and it has an excellent trigger.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.4 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.6"", and the same slim 1.3"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.4"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.  It takes 9mm rounds.

So in summary you're getting... a Ruger SR9c with 10 round magazine with flat bottom and pinky grip extension and a 17 round magaine with full grap adapter.  Additionally, the manual, gun lock, and everything that was originally purchased with the weapon is included per the pictures.  This will go fast so please call me directly if you're interested.  Do not text.  Phone number is REDACTED.  No trades and I will not budge much on the price as the weapon is practically new and priced fair.  Also I will only sell to those with their FL CCW License so if you don't have one, don't call as I will require it for purchase."

The bear measures 5 feet 5 inches from nose to back claws.  The head on the bear is enormous!  The bear rug was professionally done by a taxidermist and the quality is excellent.  The rug has always been over our pool table and am now selling the pool table.  The rug comes from a non-smoking home with no animals.  I am asking $1,000 for the rug.  Rugs online are going for $2,000 (see link below).  Even if you were fortunate enough to harvest a bear and do all the work to get it to a taxidermist it would still cost over $1,000.  McLagan’s Taxidermy in Bend charges $200 a linear foot which alone puts the bear over $1,000.  The bear rug looks great on the wall, in the den, on the pool table, on the floor or above the fireplace.  I am a bit torn about selling it and in no hurry to do so and think I priced it fairly at $1,000 so please no low ball offers.  This rug is an excellent addition to any Central Oregon home!
I would also be interested in trading the bear for a nice firearm or a firearm + cash depending on the value.  I am looking for a nice revolver and would prefer a Smith & Wesson .500 magnum.  I would also be interested in a .44, .454, or .460.  I may be interested in other guns just let me know what you have.  Thanks.
