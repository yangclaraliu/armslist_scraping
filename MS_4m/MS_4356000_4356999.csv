Sig Arms resurrected a close clone, but the Sig competitor is, well, a fat boy. The Sig 232’s slide was never finished anything like the Colt; it was square and boxy. Here, after a 16 year hiatus, is the classic Colt Mustang Pocketlite, product code O6891tl. This variant issued with a laser, but we removed it for separate sale to keep the price down. Manufacturer is Colt Industries of Hartford, CT. Type is single action only compact semi automatic locked breech pocket pistol, descendant of John M. Browning’s 1911. Construction is stainless steel barrel, slide, and internal parts fitted into a lightweight alloy frame. Finish is brushed stainless laterals, and matte stainless or coated verticals. Chambering is .380 ACP Caliber, or 9mm Kurz in the German Language. Magazine capacity is 6 rounds, so 6+1 fully loaded. Barrel is 2 3/4 inch, six groove right hand 1:16 rifling. Slide is one piece stainless with lateral rear serrations, .762 thick at the port. Sight is slide integral serrated ramp front, with black anodized dovetailed rear that is drift adjustable only for windage. Trigger is .240 serrated face alloy, with a 6 pound vicinity pull. Safety system consists of a left side safety lever that will engage with the hammer down, and with the hammer back, cocked and locked. Measurements are grip screw thickness 1.07 at the top screw; overall length 5 1/2 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut; height 3 7/8 inches from the grip frame butt to the top of the rear sight. Weight empty is less than 16 ounces. Each Pocket Lite comes with a total of two factory 6 shot magazines, and 8 shot .380 Government magazines are compatible. Colt's .380 Mustang Pocketlite, writes the factory, boasts enhanced durability, reliability and accuracy, and with a loaded magazine, this handgun weighs less than one pound! The precise machining process, use of high quality materials and design improvements make Colt s .380 Mustang Pocketlite one of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the market. It measures 5.5 inches long with a 2.75-inch barrel. Combined with the short single action trigger and firing pin safety block, this firearm is a compact dynamo ideal for personal protection. Each Mustang Pocketlite comes in its blue plastic factory case with warning tag, instruction manual, total of two magazines, and factory registration papers. For buyers who want a laser, we will include a factory issue Colt Laser Max system, Colt number W2079, for only $50.00 while supply lasts.

Savage has made its Law Enforcement Series even more versatile by adding a 10-round detachable box magazine to its new 10 FCP-SR rifles. These rifles are chambered in .308 Win and feature a threaded muzzle that’s compatible with most suppressors. The platform is built around Savage’s classic, duty-proven 110 action, and uses a floating bolt head, zero-tolerance headspacing and precision button rifling to provide outstanding accuracy and consistency. The adjustable Accutrigger lets the shooter set the trigger to their individual preferences for a light, crisp pull, while the Accustock bedding system engages the action three-dimensionally along its entire length, further enhancing accuracy.

Up for trade is an excellent condition Desert Eagle Mark I, made in Israel, and functions perfectly with hot ammo with a muzzle velocity over 1180fps. Pistol is well maintained and the feed ramp is polished. All parts show very little wear, and there is only small surface scratches on the gun. I rate this gun a 9.7/10.

This gun can be converted to .357 with a slide/magazine change. Mark I models cannot fire .50AE. Which is a novelty caliber anyway.

This comes with 6 factory magazines (some have light rust but function perfectly) and one promag. I also can add ammo depending on your trade. I have Horandy, Magtech, and Privi Partizan ammo. Approximately 200 rounds.

I love this gun, its easily one of my favorites. Reliable accurate, powerful, and a hell of a lot of fun! People at the range always say ""Holy s*** s that a Desert Eagle!?"" I don't have to get rid of this gun, I just want to see if there is anything out there worth trading it for.

You must be willing to meet within 15 miles of Kettering, Ohio. I will not travel halfway across the state to meet you. We will meet at a gun shop, where we can look over our trades before we go forward."

I LOVE this rifle and hate to get rid of it, but I ordered this sight unseen and didn't realize that once I added an optic, that it would be heavier than I'd prefer.  I've had rotator cuff surgery and for me, I'd prefer something alittle lighter.

MSRP is $1129 but I will sell this for $950.  It's new, flawless and comes just as it arrived.  It includes (1) PMAG, Lock, Box and Owners Manual.

It is an awesome pistol, very little recoil due to the all steel frame.  I bought it for my wife but it is a bit too much for her.  She has decided to stick to a slightly smaller polymer frame.  I picked it up from the gun store, she shot less than 1 magazine through it, and told me she didn't like it.  I put it back in the case and it has been there ever since.  I paid 730 plus a $25 FFL and a 2 week wait to get it here.  A local Raleigh shop sells this gun for 750 plus tax, so you're going to spend 775-800 to get one new.  I'll let this go for 600 just so I can go get her something else.

Either that or it was made by a Reinhard Kern in the 17 or 1800s but I think more likely it was Bob Kern in the 1960's - 1980's.  Pistol is smoothbore in .36 caliber and I have shot it several times with .350 round balls/.01 patches. I can't remember what powder charge (BLACK POWDER ONLY) that I used but I believe it was in the neighborhood of 20 grains.  The lock is functional but does not throw sparks which seems to be either a frizzen or mainspring issue.  Either way it's a pretty easy fix.  This pistol has no markings/serial numbers except for ""R (or B) Kern Ligonier PA"" on the inside of the lock retaining plate. See pictures.  Ramrod is a simple hardwood dowel.  Bore is shiny with no pitting.

Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.CALIBER/SYSTEM :9x19 / Safe ActionDIMENSIONS:Length: 159 mm / 6.26 in.Width: 26 mm / 1.02 in.Length Between Sights: 132 mm / 5.20 inHeight:108 mm / 4.25 in.Barrel Length: 86 mm / 3.39 in.WEIGHTS:Unloaded: 509 g / 17.95 oz.Loaded: 634 g / 22.36 oz.TRIGGER PULL/TRAVEL:Trigger Pull: ~2.5 kg / ~5.5 lbs.Trigger Travel: ~12.5 mm / ~0.49 in.BARREL RIFLING/ LENGTH OF TWIST:Barrel Rifling: right hand, hexagonalLength of Twist: 250 mm / 9.84 in.Magazine Capacity: standard: 6"

It came in original box and packaging with accessories and manual.  Serial number includes 93 so I'm assuming it's a 1993 version.  One new original 5 round magazine (should be three but previous owner lost two).  Other accessories are included and unused - cleaning rod, sling, cleaning kit, etc.  It's a sporter model with thumbhole stock.  Slant cut receiver.  I've changed the furniture to personal preference (pictured) but there are no permanent modifications so you can have both the original configuration and the modernized configuration.  You'll get everything that came with the gun in original configuration including the original box and packaging.  The modernized version has Desert Fox Outfitters M4 stock adaptor with Magpul MOE stock, Magpul K+ grip, and Strike Industries hand guard, Krebs safety lever and retaining plate (original parts included as well). Forward grip is a generic grip but fits and feels great.  I also have .25 and .75 cheek risers that attach to the MOE stock.  The red dot is Bushnell TRS-25.  Also included is 3 FDE Tapco mags and 4 European bolt hold open surplus mags.  Rifle is a sweet shooter and very accurate.   Not interested in any trades at this time.  $900 OBO.  Thanks."

Bond Arms Texas Defender .45/410 caliber 
All-American Pistol Supporting Team USA!


The Bond Arms Texas Defender is a double-barrelled personal-defense pistol ideal for carry in a pocket, purse, tackle box or pack. The barrels are interchangeable with other calibers available from Bond Arms. Automatic extractors facilitate quick reloading, rebounding hammers allow fast follow-up shots, and retracting firing pins and crossbolt safeties add peace of mind. The Texas Defender also features blade front and fixed rear sights. 

Bond Arms was incorporated in 1995 with the idea that the Remington Model 95 over-under, single-action derringer could be converted from an Old West anachronism into a modern defensive handgun. The barrel and frame were redesigned to safely fire modern calibers. The beefed-up double barrels and frames are constructed completely from stainless steel, and shaped with modern manufacturing processes. This makes for a pistol that’s both strong and durable. They’re also one of a few manufacturers that still builds exclusively in the U.S. and uses American-made parts for all their handguns. Even their grips and holsters are made in the U.S.A.—this pistol is as all-American as your USA Shooting Team!"

As far as I can tell all the numbers match from the numbers I see. I know the bayonet wasn't on the rifle when I got but I got one for it. I don't know much about it since I got it in a trade. I have only put 5 rounds through it when I traded to make sure it worked. It doesn't have a sling but does have a cleaning kit in the stock. I have 3 30 round metal magazines that go with it. I bought the magazines but have never used them because I didn't feel like taking the rifle apart since I didn't shoot it. I would say the rifle is in good condition. There some nicks in the stock and some surface rust on the factory magazine but no rust anywhere else. I don't have any pictures that I can post right now but will try to get some posted soon. I would like to get $400.00 or best offer for the rifle and magazines. Email me if your interested. LOCAL CASH ONLY LEGAL TRANSACTION. I DO NOT SHIP. Thanks for looking.

This is a factory fresh, unfired, unmolested, 0-owner, Kel-Tec KSG 12GA shotgun and it needs a new home, prefrebly your home. The KSG shotgun has a twin magazine setup, shoot all the ammunition from one magazine tube then, with the flip of a switch, begin shooting the ammo from the other tube. Depending on the size of shotgun shells you're using you can have 12+1rds of ammo all the way to 24+1rds of ammo.  This is an awesome shotgun and one hell of a home defense weapon. The KSG is the same shotgun used by Keanu Reeves the movie John Wick. The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Come check this shotgun out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

FACTORY SPECS and DESCRIPTION

This Special Edition Kel Tec P3AT FREEDOM edition is brought to you by Kel-Tec & Michael Savage with the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that is unlike any other. The Kel-Tec P3AT Freedom limited edition is engraved with the word ‘FREEDOM’ and is dated December 15, 1791, the ratification of the Bill of Rights...honoring the 2nd Amendment. Each firearm is individually numbered (# 1099) to ensure the integrity of the series. And only 5000 numbered copies plus proof will be available. This is a very limited once in a lifetime series and once they are gone it will not be repeated again. 

The Limited Edition FREEDOM P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 ACP cal. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. 

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The FREEDOM P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.

This Core30 features a 16"" 416R Stainless Steel barrel with a matte bead blasted finish. The 1:10"" twist rate effectively stabilizes the heavier and longer bullets preferred for long distance shooting and defense purposes, while also adequately stabilizing lighter, shorter bullets at shorter ranges. A mid-length gas system reduces heat related wear to critical internal componentry and reduces felt recoil. The muzzle is threaded and a SureFire muzzle brake/suppressor adapter is installed.

The upper receiver is expertly machined from 7075-T6 Billet Aluminum alloy, and boasts a top mounted Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. It also has M4-style feed ramps for flawless cycling, and hard coat anodized finish. The lower receiver is also machined from 7075-T6 Billet Aluminum alloy and hard coat anodized. It has a bevelled magazine well for quicker, more confident magazine changes and an integrated winter trigger guard. A Core30 V3 Billet charging handle is equipped for improved strength and improved reliability over conventional mil spec and surplus style charging handles. An attractive and practical Olive Drab Green Magpul MOE pistol grip and ACS adjustable butt stock with storage space are equipped. A Samson 13.2"" quad rail hand guard is installed, offering plenty of space for mounting a bipod, rangefinder, and other accessories. One 20 round PMAG is included.

The M.O.S. has a cutout on top of the slide that allows for the mounting of various holographic sight options. This G41 Gen. 4 M.OS. is a 10rd version and comes with three ten round magazines. The GLOCK 41 Gen4 is a practical/tactical .45 AUTO caliber pistol designed with the superior engineering of GLOCK to maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. The longer barrel and slide help to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil while the longer sight radius provides better accuracy for competition or duty use. Also available in MOS configuration.Polymer FrameThe GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life—all while reducing weight by a full 90%. Stronger than most metals, polymer is temperature neutral, requires less maintenance, and most users report substantially less felt recoil than with metal frames.“Safe Action”® SystemThe GLOCK “Safe Action”® System is made up of 3 independent, automatic safeties designed to ensure the pistol cannot fire unintentionally due to inertia or any impact. The trigger must be moved completely to the rear to deactivate these safeties. Once released, all 3 safety features reengage and the pistol is automatically secured again.Barrel DesignGLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.Nitrite TreatmentAll GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.MagazineOften overlooked, the magazine is one of the most critical components of a pistol. The GLOCK precision-made, stagger-column, high-capacity device is designed to reliably feed all ammunition types. Lightweight and strong, with a polymer shell enclosing a metal liner, this easy to disassemble magazine insert is engineered to be a strong and secure unit for years of outstanding performance.Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.
