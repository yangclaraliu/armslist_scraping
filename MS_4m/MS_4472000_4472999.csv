M16 Full Auto Style for increased mass and lock time (also compatible with Semi-Auto AR15s).The Lantac E-BCG is precision machined from 8620 Steel with a shot peened bolt manufactured from Carpenter 158 and Magnetically Particle Inspected. The entire carrier assembly is NiB, Electroless Nickel Boron coated with the patented, advanced UCT EXO process, unlike standard NiB coatings. This offers extreme lubricity with a friction coefficent of .02 and surface hardness of 82-85 Rockwell C. The carriers patent pending design features unique shrouded and FORWARD FACING gas ports that have also been re sized so that gas is vented differently to a standard carrier. This results in a system that runs flatter with a smoother energy pulse. In addition the system also runs cooler and cleaner, there is also less pressurization of the upper receiver when running a suppressed barrel. The flared boss at the tail of the carrier enhances the BCG's lock position within the upper and makes it more consistent, resulting in an accuracy improvement."

Pistol has had < 100rds through it and has been meticulously cared for.  It comes with one flush fit mag, 1 mag with extended finger rest, zipper carry case, lock, and original box and manual.  

This pistol is a true double action hammer-fired pistol with second strike capability.  This is the thinnest micro .380 on the market and I believe it is the only hammer fired DA micro .380 currently available from any manufacturer.  This is a perfect pocket pistol and appears to be purpose built for that role.  The entire frame and slide are contoured and snag free.  The sights are excellent, 3 dot design that are also snag free.  The paddle style mag release virtually guarantees that the mag will not be released accidentally if the pistol is bumped while in the pocket.  

The Pico has the modular frame design which allows that frame to be swapped for different colors or for frames equipped with either laser or high intensity flashlight.

Link to Beretta Pico product specs:
http://www.beretta.com/en-us/pico/#Features

I will add 93rds of 100gr flat point ammo to the first offer at or above asking price.

I hate to let this one go.  I am moving away from pocket pistols and going toward small AIWB carry guns, the Pico is much better suited for pocket carry. 

Cash FTF sales only.  Must be willing to provide ODL or Oregon CHL.

I bought this handgun brand new about 4 years ago, and it is all original without mods. Included is the original Glock case and factory book, one 15 round Glock magazine, one 17 round Glock magazine which I used for backup, and one Glock magazine loading assist tool. The trigger is broken in nicely on this firearm, very clean break and not too light............ The only way to get a trigger to feel this good on a Glock is to use it. I have put somewhere around 1,500 plus rounds through this pistol and it is still tight yet smoother than new. I don't believe any other brand of handgun in the model 19's catagory holds up this well. This gun will probably outlast the next owner and still be working great after 30,000 plus rounds are ran through it, just my opinion after my experience with so many Glock handguns. I have used it for target shooting as well as used it in a combat training course which it ran superbly...... If I were to take a training course right now I would prefer to run this broken in gun (far from worn out) over a brand new one due to it's smoothness. Gun's finish rated by me to be perhaps 98% or better. On the soft corners of the slide you can only ever so slightly see signs of finish wear from using a kydex holster. Was carried and practiced with using a Dale Fricke Archangel Kydex Holster. There is one tiny spot of more severe finish wear noted in the photo where a pencil points directly at the spot on the slide corner near the muzzle. May never be noticed if I didn't point it out....................... I point this out because I want the buyer to know 100% what they are bidding on. I noticed the minor blemish after I closely inspected the gun. This gun has been cleaned/lubed after each use and the gun's action is in perfect condition. Overall the gun is very, very nice. Please look closely at all photos and ask questions if you like. This is a firearm worthy of carrying daily for self defense or duty use. I work in law enforcement and have seen many Glocks survive heavy abuse on the concrete lanes at our gun range. This handgun has never been used for any duty carry, but it has been used as my regualar off duty carry. I trust it completely.....................................................To the winning bidder: I must receive payment within 5 ""business days"" of auction ending in the form of a ""USPS"" money order, only purchased from a US Post Office. I am open to receiving the payment through a Walmart to Walmart money transfer but the buyer is responsible for the Walmart transaction fee if they choose to use it, about $9.00 is the Walmart money transfer cost. A Walmart funds transfer guarantees the money will not get dealyed in the mail and the gun will ship faster, ""if that is important to the buyer"" (Just another option for the buyer, not necassarily prefered by me)...................................Respectfully, if you cannot pay for the gun, please do not bid...... Non paying bidder has happened to me before on a Gunbroker auction and it is very frustrating. I will have no choice but to leave negative feedback if this happens as it is required as part of requesting a credit of fees from Gunbroker for a non paying bidder..................Shipping charge is $25.00 and is added to the winning bid amount. Gun must ship to an FFL licensed holder only from my local FFL dealer.....Ammunition in photo ""not included"" in this sale. Thanks for looking and happy bidding.............."

REDACTED

The bullet engineered with the competitive shooter in mind. Hornady began with a bullet legendary in its accuracy - the Hornady XTP - and redesigned it as the perfect competition projectile. While the XTP uses folds and a cannelure to aid in expansion and increase terminal performance, expansion is meaningless in competition. So, the folds and cannelure are gone from the HAP (Hornady Action Pistol) bullet. 

Because jamming can cost a competitive shooter the match, Hornady placed the HAP's pure lead core inside a copper jacket that protects the nose, ensuring smooth feeding. And like the XTP, the core of the HAP bullet is cold swaged from pure lead to give it amazing consistence, balance and stability in flight. This is not loaded ammunition."

The gun comes with box papers and everything it comes with from the factory, and 5 50rd mags (which are hard to get these days). I got the gun finished in Kryptek Typhoon finish, which is the sickest color i've seen on a P90. Extremely light and compact due its polymer construction and bullpup design, and has huge capacity with 50 round mag, perfect gun for inside home or vehicle defense. 
Also comes with Urban ERT sling harness, for sling attachment, can be easily taken off.

Taking a huge loss and selling it for $1000 for everything, the mags along would cost over $200 so you are practically paying for a brand new P90 for under $800. Need to sell it to buy a Scar, so I'm taking no trades unless you have a Scar 16 FDE in 556.

From Brownell's:
Precision, match grade triggers are fully adjustable for sear engagement, overtravel, and weight-of-pull to help ensure a crisp, light trigger pull and the best possible accuracy from your rifle or silhouette pistol. Allen head setscrews allow precise adjustments; hex nuts lock the screws in place and hold tight even under heavy recoil. Heat-treated steel internal components and polished sear surfaces reduce drag and provide a smooth, consistent trigger pull. Simple drop-in fit replaces factory trigger assembly without alterations. Standard trigger is adjustable from 1½ to 3 lb. for weight-of-pull. Requires original factory safety. Current production rifles with the Mark X pro trigger the customer will need 767-000-858 and 758-000-011 as the factory Remington safety will not fit. Competition trigger is adjustable from 2 to 6 oz. for weight-of-pull. No provision for safety installation."

Buyers, however, may take any number of additional pins we may have at the same per-pin price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is the part most often lost from the good little RG14S Revolvers manufactured in Miami by RG Industries during the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturer is one of our friendly local machine shop here in West Tennessee. Construction is entirely steel, with blued finish. It is designed to fit through the frame and cylinder of an RG14S revolver, and be retained by the cylinder’s internal detent spring, showing in one of our photos right through the center of the cylinder assembly. RG14S Revolvers were manufactured in the late 1970s until the late 1980s, when RG Industries shut down. These will NOT fit an RG14, the earlier models, because the older RG14 had threads on its pin, as the photos show. Any RG14S revolvers will be marked with the S on the left side of their frames, next to the left grip panel, as the photos show. No other RG parts or papers are included. Our pins are machined tighter than the originals. They require a bit more force to insert and remove, but they’re much less likely to fall out from recoil. We’re offering these new and improved steel pins, each for only $ 19.00.
