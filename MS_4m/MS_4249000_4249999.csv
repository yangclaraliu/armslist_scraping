Very Patriotic and unique. Another unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip. The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.

The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning.Manufacturer: RugerModel: LCPCaliber: .380Barrel: 2.75"""

This rifle is very clean overall though the rifling has some light pitting in areas (possibly cased when wet?). MSRP for the rifle is $1199 so we do have it priced accordingly with the bore wear. Ultra light but strong synthetic stock finished with the Dura Touch Armor Coating in Carbon Fiber pattern. Top of receiver is marked Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and may have been a special edition run or banquet gun. Bolt is smooth as it gets with a crisp adjustable trigger. 26"" barrel has nice bluing intact and oddly shows no signs of exterior rust. More info from Browning: Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides positive gripping surface that is both comfortable and easy to hold onto during all weather conditions Button-Rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform. Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass."" Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact. 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion. Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change. Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged. Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.

Carefully research what some unscrupulous people are valuing at $400 to $500.  This person admits his Pedersoli Howda (""Shotgun / Pistol - Double Barrel"") is used but insists his used piece (After shooting nails and rock salt thru it?!) with no box nor invoice is somehow worth almost the same price as the exact same thing being sold by Navy Arms brand new in the box and with a warranty for only $599 just because he claims to have paid more somewhere else for his.

I think that's wrong but will let you all make up your mind if you think so.

I say we run off those who would prey on others since that's exactly why we carry firearms is it not?   

You may also wish to ask yourself: ""Do I really want to deal with someone who is so unstable as to respond with profanity and verbal threats when they are politely confronted with the above facts?""    Those of you who are as yet undecided may want to do a Google search for the name of Adam Myjer in the news of your local area before meeting with this unstable person.  

Saddest part is that I had to rein-in one of my own brothers of the Corps who went astray and will now rest unless the lad is foolish enough to rear his criminal little lance cooly head again then...  

I recently got mine in the mail from Navy Arms only 2-days after ordering it and love it.  Don't fall for some greedy person trying to take advantage of an unsuspecting buyer.  Do your homework and buy smart.

The barrel, receiver, bolt, and butt plate match. The floor plate of the magazine has been force matched at the arsenal. This version of the rifle is highly coveted for its unique barrel markings (translated as Foremost Ordnance Factory of the USSR at Tula) and the hex receivers are sought after for higher level of quality control during this manufacturing period. In addition. this rifle has the sought after brass cap upper handguards, a matching original sling with hammer and sickle markings, and a very unique appearing stock. The stock is in excellent condition with no cracks or warps. It has been expertly restored and does not have a drop of cosmoline on it. It does not have any rust. It has been sighted in via iron sights at 50 yards and shoots fantastically. The bolt is smooth, and the barrel has strong rifling without being counterbored. This rifle is both a great shooter and very collectable. With the ban on Russian imports, Mosin Nagant rifles have become harder and harder to locate!

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines."

More photographs available on request to serious buyers!

Unfortunately, ""fun money"" is tight right now, and if I want a new toy, I have to get rid of one.

This is a rare bird - a metric FAL made for Springfield under contract by Imbel on the original Belgian tooling, with a Springfield match grade barrel rather than the original mil spec.

The log book shows approximately 300 rounds through it. The gun is in overall excellent condition, with little to no wear on the internals, a mirror bore, and only handling marks on the exterior - NRA ""Excellent"" condition or better, if you're familiar with that grading system.

They were brought in in a few configurations over the years; this is one of the later models that were caught in limbo during the Federal AWB in 1994. Very few made it into the country.

I'm the second owner, having purchased it from a friend in 2008. The only modification to the rifle is the removal of the original thumbhole stock, and the addition of a receiver mounted rail - itself extremely hard to find these days, as the company that made them no longer exists, and the mounts themselves haven't been available in years.

The rifle comes with a hard case and three 20 round magazines. One of them is pretty banged up. If you really want it, I can also throw in a cheapie adjustable scope.

I'm only interested in some very specific trades - I'm looking for either:
- a complete A3 upper including BCG, plus the difference in cash or a nice piece of glass;
- or a straight across swap for an LE6920."

The features are as follows:

it's slim single stack 8 round magazine is very lightweight, smaller and thinner than the other 9mm pistols.

The coolest fact of this little gun is that it used a delayed gas blowback system by use of gas piston. 
This makes the gun slide super easy to pull back, it also reduces muzzle rise and recoil by 30%. 

It has typical Walther quality. It has a factory ceracoated finish that is highly corrosion and wear resistant. 

It comes with 2 - 8 round stainless mags, with pinky extensions. Factory molded case, takedown tool, manuals, lock, etc.

This gun was selected as Ducks Unlimited Gun of the Year 2004-2005. Winchester took the proven gas-operating system of the Browning Gold and put it inside a gun with the lines of the classic Super X1. The result was the Super X2, which proved to be every bit as reliable and soft-recoiling as its predecessor. Winchester marketed this as one of the fastest shotguns. It can expend all of its rounds in less than 1 second.

With a sleek, low-luster black finish under a tough Dura-Touch® coating on a composite stock and forearm, the Super X2 3"" Magnum Composite is the original workhorse that started the SX2 revolution.

There is a Pachmayr 6-Shell holder on the right side of the Sure-Grip stock that matches the SureGrip Forearm.  Reloading from the right side of the stock is much faster than loading from the left side of the receiver.

The heat shield is a glass-reinforced polymer Police model made for this 18 1/2"" barreled Moss. 500.  With all this tactical equipment, the gun still weighs in at barely over 8 pounds.  I've handled home defense guns that seemed like they weighed over 12!

All the gear is from either LA Police Gear, Brownell's or Optics Planet and is quality gear.
All the metal was Black Satin Cerakoted 2 years ago and still looks like new.  This weapon has been cleaned after every firing and at least every couple months.  When I fired a box of 25 through it this week, it functioned flawlessly without a hitch!  (And yes--I cleaned it afterwards.)  I would keep it myself, but I have my eye on a Benelli M2 scattergun.

The new Mossberg tacticals now cost about $500, but we'll call this used one..$250
Ultra-Fire 320 Lm Light w/ HD Mount & Tri Rail List $79.....................................40
Weaver Brand Saddle Rail  List $49...................................................................25
6 Shell Holder  List $29 ....................................................................................15

3-Point Multi-Mission Sling  List $39 ..................................................................20
Hard Gun Case  List $79...................................................................................40

Let's just say that this weapon at half-value used price is worth over $580, but it will be yours, with everything except the optic, case and sling, for $400 Firm.  But everything else is model specific and I will not further separate items.

If you really must have the optics, the sling and the case, we'll make it an even $500 Firm.  I can't do trades at this time. I need the money for another gun.  Call or text REDACTED.

Walther PPS Centerfire Pistol
• Slim profile and ergonomic design
• Come with large and small backstraps
• Multiple safety features
• Loaded chamber and cocking indicators
• Ambidextrous magazine release

The Police Pistol Slim (PPS) packs Walther innovation into an unbelievable 1.04""-wide profile. Available in 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS has several notable features aimed at better fit and safe performance in its narrow dimensions. From your choice of perfect-fitting backstrap (small or large) to the patented QuickSafe™ innovation, the PPS sets the bar high for competing designs. Ambidextrous magazine release is easily located by right-and left-handed shooters. Loaded chamber and cocking indicators show when a round is chambered and the pistol is ready to fire. Three safety systems ensure peace of mind. A trigger safety and internal striker safety prevent accidental discharge. Simply remove the QuickSafe™ backstrap when storing the pistol to prevent the PPS from firing. The 9mm caliber comes with a seven-round magazine. A six-round magazine is included with the .40S&W model.

Must have concealed carry permit, NCDL, and be willing to complete a bill of sale.  I am not interested in trades as I am raising cash for another purchase."

This beautiful Colt USMC 1911 is part of a 'Complete Package' including the desirable Pelican Case w/ outer cardboard shipping box, (2) Magazines, Cleaning Kit, Owners Manuals, Test Target, Colt Lock & Hang Tag! As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!"

Here is an excerpt from Kel-Tec describing the p11:

""The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members."""

The History... The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.
Today...I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position."
