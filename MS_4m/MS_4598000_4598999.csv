This is not a lend-lease model, it's in its original chambering of .38 S&W Special, it is U.S. Made, U.S. issued and U.S. stamped. Condition wise its in good shape other than what you'd expect from a milsurp pistol, it has wear from being carried, but not much from being shot, believe it or not it barely had a drag mark on the cylinder when I bought it, unfortunately it is missing the lanyard loop...fortunately they're only $15, easy to install, and in no short supply. The trigger weights are 3.5lbs for the single action and about 8lbs for the double action and it's super smooth, what isn't case hardened in the guts is mirror smooth literally you can see yourself in it, this is a very accurate revolver to the point of surprising me.
I'm selling it because I'm short on cash and really only wanted a normal Model 10 or 13...as nice as it is I'd rather have someone appreciate it for what it is.
I will try to get nice pictures of what I think you would want to see but if you want to see something else let me know and I'll get back to you with the pictures ASAP, same goes for any questions or offers.

Have you even seen a plain edge original Civilian with carbon fiber handles?
You know they're rare when less than 200 plain edge were made.
This knife is a queen of my collection and so hard to let go.
This knife is in immaculate condition and is a must have for any real Spyderco collector; the card is still attached to the knife saying ""Notice! This knife was not designed to be used as a utility knife"", meaning it's a beast! The blade is ATS-55 stainless with a standard edge curved point slashing blade with thumb hole pull. CARBON FIBER HANDLES. Black coated steel pocket clip. Original zipper storage pouch with Spyderco logo and label. The Civilian was developed for a prestigious branch of US law enforcement. The patented reverse ""S"" blade shape evolved to fulfill the back-up needs of undercover agents with little or no training in self defense. With its paper thin tip, the Civilian is specifically designed for law enforcement personnel and not designed for general utility or everyday use. G-10 handle material makes the folder lightweight and a black pocket clip is situated for tip-down pocket carry. One of the most specialized CLIPITS in the Spyderco line-up, the Civilian is available in very limited quantities. Blade is hollow-ground.

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $500 firm

This pistol comes with 1 8rd magazine. This gun has a 6"" Barrel.
The Weaver style accessory rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics. The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. Safety The safety is ambidextrous â it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel."

This pistol comes with 1 8rd magazine. This gun has a 6"" Barrel.
The Weaver style accessory rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics. The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. Safety The safety is ambidextrous â it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

This is the only one I have actually laid eyes on. It shoots fantastically, light perceived recoil and very accurate. Also the forward ejecting brass is just kinda cool. its dressed with back up sights and a 1-4x Firefield illuminated scope on a QD mount. It also is dressed with QD mounting plates for a sling and a modified AFG on the front and a titanium boron bCG. This is a whole lot of firepower in a very little package. Why am I selling such a great weapon? easy.... I can only carry 5.56 on duty and 7.62x51 (.308) is basically a toy for me. Just time to find a new toy to play with. The third photo is for comparison, shown with my SCAR 16 with a 10.5"" barrel. Even with an 18"" barrel the RFB is still shorter (I will not however say lighter). Also comes with 4 20 round magazines. I will only trade Looking for a SCAR 17, a precision rifle plush cash or other weapon, .50BMG rifles or something outstanding.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL â¢ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL â¢ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCPâs SOFTCOILâ¢ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL â¢ Technology1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.Size & FeaturesWith an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new modelâs barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.The CCP comes in stylish stainless or CerakoteÂ® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Waltherâs line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

This one is a T8(1968) model in excellent condition. I am not an expert on these by no means but I do know that they are made in Belgium, they are not a very common pistol, and rare collectors item. I have the display case with the Browning seal and felt inside in good condition. The outside is in fair shape with wear on the corners. The latch on the lock and the brass plate are in good shape.   It also has the three different weights along with the block they thread into, the ammo block, an extra grip, an extra barrel( looks modified but has Browning markings) and four factory magazines.  I have seen the mags going for $50-$100 each online. I do not have the tool, the manual, or the forearm piece for the front of the trigger ring. The forearm piece comes off to put the weights on which is how I bought it.  The parts to make the set complete are available but are very expensive if you can find them.  I am asking $850.  Other gun websites have this gun going $1000-$1300 for the pistol alone with one magazine and much more for the case and accessories. Feel free to contact me to arrange to look at it, questions, or any other information on it that I can provide. I can also send additional pictures upon request.  I am open to trades that are of equal value such an AR10(PSA, Armalite, etc.), AR15, or some really nice pistols. $1000 trade value. I can add boot if needed.  Thanks for looking."

I have a mk13 mod 5 rifle that comes with a knight armament mk11 suppressor used by american operators with paperwork to back it up and a night force 5.5-22x56 scope which is new. The reason that I had to pull pictures off the internet is because I'm out of town for a few weeks and only had the one of the rifle itself. I will upload more as soon as i get home.  This is the real thing. The suppressor was used by actual operators in Afghanistan. The suppressor of course will need a class 3 dealer to complete a transfer plus a form 4. But other than that, the transfer of the rifle is as easy as a standard transfer. Yes the price is set high for how rare the rifle is an will only accept trades listed below. Please don't message me unless you're serious. If you're into rare rifles that are part of fighting the war on terror. This is what you're looking for. Good luck creating a clone of this rifle because all the parts have been discontinued. The mars rail, mk11 suppressor, Iilja mk13 barrel and accuracy international chassis system are now moon rocks.

From the manufacturer:
The LWRC International UCIW (Ultra-Compact Individual Weapon) stock system shortens the overall length of the firearm by a full inch, as compared to a standard AR. The stock kit includes the stock, receiver extension, index plate, buffer, recoil spring and castle nut. The systemâs components were designed to work together and should be installed together for reliable performance. The stock is lightweight and features integral sling attachment points, easy one-hand adjustments and excellent cheekweld. The rubber buttpad prevents slippage during firing. The receiver extension has four positions to adjust the length of pull. Derived from our UCIW project, it is a great option for shortening the overall length of your rifle."

For them, SIG SAUER offers the Extreme series, one of our most popular models tricked out with all the features a shooter could want, from front cocking serrations to custom grips and more.

This p220 is a great pistol, I just have half a dozen Sigs and don't intend to use a suppressor at any point. I would imagine that I have 300 rounds through it but it could be closer to 400. I have taken it to the range 3 times since I bought it. I keep excellent care of my firearms. I took it to the range on 3 trips and I clean every weapon between every range trip out of habit. Slide has slight wear which can be expected with a Sig slide that has see a few rounds. 

I have a half a dozen pictures available, just ask!! I will email them. There is a 3 picture limit (not to mention 4 mb) and I can only get 2 up.

It comes with the 1 extended magazine, 6 standard ""flush"" magazines (all metal), original case, original accessories. 

The extra magazines themselves are not cheap at all.
