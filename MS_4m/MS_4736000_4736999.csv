It is a Star model CO with nickle plate and engraving.  Magazine holds 7 rounds and it is safe to carry with one in the chamber giving it an 8 round capacity.  Pistol has been testfired and cleaned, functions perfectly.  These CO series pistols were hand fitted and comparable in quality to a Colt.  Pistol has an external hammer with a half-cock notch as well as an external safety which does not need to be utilized for pocket carry.  This type of pistol is typically carried hammer down, safety off.  Some time ago the original Pearlite grips cracked and were replaced with top quality reproductions from vintagegungrips.com for $50 (I know because I replaced them for her).  Original nickle finish is 90%.  Excellent overall condition, less than 50 rounds down the pipe (rounds included are from the original box purchased with the gun).  Steel frame and slide makes it durable enough to fire hot loads from Winchester and Cor-Bon.  This pistol was manufactured and imported in 1955 which means it is over 50 years old and exempt from the background check requirement and does not require transfer at an FFL, however I reserve the right not to sell this to anyone I do not like.

I am asking $350 cash for this pistol.  Comes with a full magazine and a padded carrying case.  Very compact, smaller than an LCP or a KelTec, carries well in a size 2 pocket holster.  I can meet anywhere in the greater Denver metro area, from Lakewood to Aurora, at a time and place of mutual convenience.  Prefer not to ship, but could do so if you are willing to pay via PayPal gift with an additional $30 to cover shipping from my FFL to yours.  Not interested in any trades, unless it's a J-frame (S&W, Charter Arms, Taurus).  Please reply with a phone number and general location.  Microtech in photo was recently sold and is no longer available.  Thanks."

If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.

The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.

The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function"".

A cowboy could have both a lever-action rifle and his six shooter, and needed only one cartridge belt for both. Most Texas Rangers and every old West cowboy worth his salt carried 1873 rifles. Chappo, the son of Apache war chief Geronimo, packed an 1873. And Buffalo Bill carried an 1873 lever-action rifle along with a pair of .44-40 Colts in 1876 when he worked as an Army scout.

- have a new rod and reel combo. The rod is a Shimano Convergence 10'6""  rod made for Salmon/ Steelhead but would work fine for trout. Is new and unused and in perfect condition. 

Attached to it is a Shimano Symetre 2500 Fl new and unused with fresh 6 lb test. Both are new, completely unused and great for the silvers starting to run now, or next year's trout. $80 for the combo.

- have 200+ new dry flies in a new float watertight box. I don't fly fish and have no use for them, but they are brand new never used.

Most of these go for $1 or so new so I'm asking $100 for everything

I have assorted trout gear, new in package gamagatsu hooks, several differnt 4-8 lb test line packages, a few heavier at 10-12 lb test as well, all unopened, powerbait, sealed, assorted lures, plugs, etc as pictured. All trout tackle going for $50, won't split it up.

Only trade I'd entertain is a smaller pocket pistol, Ruger Lcp, Keltec, etc with possibly a little cash on my end depending on what you're offering. Keep in mind that new right now on amazon the rod and reel are over $150, the flies at cabellas are over $200 , so without even listing the trout tackle I'm at $350 in value, but this is a used market, so please make realistic offers...

The bad news is the rust , which is significant.  There might be some original blueing left on the buttplate, but finish is pretty rough with the barrel being the worst.  Rifling is still visible in the bore, and the gun could be cleaned up; I have too many projects.  
The other good news is the price, at $300 a fraction of what it would  be worth restored.

I am traveling up and down I-5 today on other business, and could meet interested parties along that route today only.  Please give me a call if you are interested.  My phone number is REDACTED.  I do not have texting on my phone.

I can e-mail more pictures; AL only lets me list one now for some reason.

I might be interested in trade, mostly older stuff in steel and wood.  I might also be interested in a Ruger LCP or S&W Bodyguard (I can add cash for the S&W if needed)

Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

This Wingmaster riot gun has the Remington elevated bead sight on the barrel, Remington ShurShot stock with SuperCell recoil pad and a Butler Creek Tactical forearm.  With the shotgun equipped with the ShurShot stock SuperCell recoil pad, it greatly reduces the felt recoil and you are able to control the shotgun much easier.  The Butler Creek Tactical forearm allows a person to hold the forearm in a normal or a pistol grip fashion and keeps your hand protected from going to far back on the forearm so you don't smash your hand between the forearm and the receiver as you cycle rounds.  This isn't a cheap Wal-Mart 870 Express shotgun, but a Wingmaster which cost $800+ retail.  The new butt stock, recoil pad and forearm cost $140.00 alone.

It started out life as a  state of the art French Muzzle-loading musket in the 1850's, when France ruled more of the world than any other nation! It was converted to .577 breech loading rifle when the muzzle loading firearms became obsolete, probably in 1864.  Since .577 is very close to 12-gauge, the rifle were later converted again to 12-gauge by reaming out the rifling.  It shoots standard 2 3/4"" 12-gauge shot shells.  I had a couple of gun smiths look it over, and they agreed it would be safe to shoot with light target loads.  I have fired it with such loads (7 1/2 Federals), and it works as it should.  It is actually fun to shoot!

The snider conversion was a unique system that employs a block that hinges over to allow access to the breech.  after firing, the block is hinged open, then pulled back to eject the spent cartridge.  The hammer, trigger and lock mechanism, butt plate and all the screws  appear to all be original 1853 French Musket.  

The stock is very beautiful, with excellent grain and contrast.   It's very elegantly shaped, with classic lines.  There are no cracks or damage that I can see.  The bluing on the iron parts is in quite good condition, and all work as they should.   It has obviously been used, but is in great condition considering it's over 160 years old!   The front sight is a brass bead.
The barrel is about 35"" long.

I can e-mail more pictures; AL only lets me list one now for some reason.  It looks beautiful in person; the picture is grainy on AL.  I can send better, more clear pictures.

Since this was manufactured (and converted) before 1898, it can be sold without going through an FFL - so no transfer fee or tax.  I will need to see ID for my records, but no additional fees.  I may be interested in trades, but most likely only old firearms with wood furniture/ grips.

Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

Just a little historical tidbit. As for condition, it is in very good nearing excellent shape. The bore is crisp and rifling is sharp. It has all matching serial numbers and a non-defaced imperial Tula factory mfg. mark. Unfortunately the Bolsheviks stamped over the double eagle, but this is common due to the state sanctioned eradication of things from the czarist era. The cylinder has a nice and tight lockup. This pistol has many markings including ones from arsenal refurb. Included with the M1895 is the holster and cleaning rod. Asking $275 for this fine example of Russian small arms history.

I purchased this, never fired it. It looks pretty slick, just never get out to use it. It has been in my closet since day one. Great gift for the holidays! Awesome as a plinker, learning to shoot, small game, etc. Price for new gun is 250, for the stock mod it was 160. Very reasonably priced for a ""used"" gun. The gun is in great condition. I only have the smaller 10/22 stock mag (still looking for my 10rd Archangel and a 2nd smaller stock mag). I have original wood stock if wanted. If you want to take off the Archangel, all the pieces are still there. Instructions, not so much. Plenty of videos on youtube if you need. Just looking to sell to get some extra Christmas money for the kids. It seems they get more expensive every year ;)

I am not a trap shooter so I have very little use for it. It is a 12 gauge SKB 85TSS with a trap combo that includes two barrel kits (one 34"" unsingle barrel with adjustable rib, and the other being a 32"" over and under ventilated rib barrel ). In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. 
The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!
This shotgun is rare and hard to get these days since it is no longer made and most people hang on to theirs because of its high quality. SKB is well known for its great costumer service and quality products; my grandfather has always talked this gun up, you're getting a great premium package here!

These modern versions rely on the classic straight pull bolt action design to chamber each cartridge fed from a 10 round rotary box Double Helix magazine. The T-Bolts three-lever trigger offers a light, crisp break, and every barrel is free floating. Those of you who are serious about rimfire accuracy will appreciate the T-Bolt Target/Varmint model. It features a walnut stock with raised Monte Carlo comb and a heavy varmint barrel designed to provide pinpoint accuracy that rivals many custom rimfires costing much more."

 FROM THE TAURUS WEBSITE:
 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going. Also comes with (3) back straps and magazine loader..

Haven't bothered to call ruger about this. I am done with 357 and sticking to my autos.  I don't have the time or desire to deal with any repairs ruger wants to make, so if you want a cheap 357 with an extremely low round count (100) than this would work for you. I bet it would shoot 38 perfectly and has worked perfectly with quality american ammo. Just doesn't seem to like the cheap foreign 357 stuff but I am sure it can be fixed.

It does have a few minor handling marks and has been fired. Nothing serious. The wood is beautiful, really. I'm the second owner. I fired 2 rounds through it, cleaned it and put it back away.  More expensive and worth it. This will make someone very happy."
