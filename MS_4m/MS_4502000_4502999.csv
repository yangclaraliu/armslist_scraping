• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection. 

• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift. 

• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality. 

• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function. 

• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs. 

• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds. 

• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety. 

• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. 

• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends. 

• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty. 

• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization. 

• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing. 

• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system. 

• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing. 

• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.

MODEL: Law Enforcement LE 870P (24407) 
COLOR: Black 
CALIBER: 12 ga 
ROUNDS: 6+1 
Like new, only 14 rounds fired through it.
• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection. 

• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift. 

• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality. 

• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function. 

• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs. 

• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds. 

• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety. 

• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. 

• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends. 

• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty. 

• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization. 

• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing. 

• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system. 

• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing. 

• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.

Comes with triple ""k"" leather belt and double holsters with ammo loops. Being 357 magnum means you can shoot 38 special and 38+p along with 357. Makes it a very versatile revolver. And they're very accurate. I've put three full cylinders of ammo through each one, which was a mix of 38 and 38+p. This is right around $2000(retail) for the whole set with the belt. Will not split the set up. Its all or no deal. Interested in a decent 30 caliber rifle of some kind. Nothing bolt action other than a stainless Ruger scout in 308. I've been wanting to get a couple of the century arms c39v2 ak47s. Also been looking for a cz75 sp-01 tactical 9mm. Main interest is a Springfield socom 16 or socom 2. Also have a thing for commander size stainless 1911 pistols in 45, especially a Springfield v12 and v10. Make me a trade offer. Worst I can say is no. email me for more pics if interested. Or check out my Valdosta man cave listing to see pics. Local only. Will not ship. Don't message me saying you saw it in gun broker for this or that amount. Everyone who tried to trade with me tries to say their used gun is worth more than what they paid. So I do retail for retail. Then no one on either side can jack up the price for their used gun."

Heckler & Koch Brings .40 Caliber Power to its New VP Striker Fired Pistol Line

Columbus, Georgia — Heckler & Koch added a .40 caliber model to its new VP striker fired pistol line. The VP40 (Caliber .40 S&W) joins the 9 mm VP9 that was introduced to the U.S. commercial and law enforcement markets in June of 2014.

“Just a year after launching the VP series pistol with the 9 mm VP9, we are thrilled to have a .40 caliber model join the line-up,” said Michael Holley, HK-USA Vice President for Commercial and Law Enforcement Sales. “Last year the VP9 took the market by storm and the VP40 promises to live up to its birthright. For civilian shooters and law enforcement agencies looking for a little more power to go with the VP’s well-recognized superior quality — this is it. Once again it shows Heckler & Koch’s commitment to the U.S. market and American shooters.”

The VP pistol line has been in development for more than four years and its debut marked the return of HK to striker-fired models. Heckler & Koch pioneered striker fired handgun designs with the HK VP70 and P7 pistols more than 35 years ago and was also the first company to produce polymer frame models. The 9 mm VP9 has been one of Heckler & Koch’s most successful products — selling widely — and receiving positive reviews from civilian and law enforcement shooters throughout the U.S.

Wayne Weber, President of HK-USA stated, “Like the 9 mm VP9, the VP40 has been through just about every test and challenge possible. Heckler & Koch’s strict company testing program put the VP40 through just about every trial imaginable; NATO and U.S. NIJ drop tests, water, dust, mud, and sand tests worst that the most extreme environmental conditions in the world.”

VP40 function and abuse tests included firing thousands of rounds of a wide variety of ammunition types through several test pistols. Unlike some manufacturers, Heckler & Koch test fires every VP40 pistol for accuracy and function.

The VP40 has the same excellent, precise trigger that debuted on the VP9. And the VP40 grip can be customized to fit any shooter by using a mix of three interchangeable backstraps and six grip panels.

The charging supports — a feature introduced on the first VP models is present on the VP40 as well. These small, removable wings on the rear of the slide make cocking and manipulating the pistol much easier than other handgun designs. VP pistols also have a safer and easier disassembly process than many competing models.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the VP40 is designed and manufactured in Oberndorf, Germany with HK’s famous long-term durability. The VP40 is value priced with a suggested retail cost of $719. A law enforcement configuration VP40 with tritium night sights and three magazines is also available for $819 SRP. VP40 pistols are shipping now (June 2015).

The Ultra lightweight profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.

My best group (surprisingly ((shockingly even!)) is with American eagle xm855 penetrators. I put three rounds in a row in the same hole @ 100yds. I didn't believe my spotter, but when I went to my target, he was telling the truth. All five of my shots were within .4"" which is damned impressive. It is the barrel and my matched and head spaced nickel boron bolt that made the difference. I was also bench rest shooting which makes a difference."

From Beretta,

Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart.

The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.

Ambidextrous Controls

A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.

Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options

This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.

Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down.

The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Because there is no increase in pressure, regardless of the caliber, there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. Plus, Superformance Varmint loads are versatile and will perform flawlessly in all rifles, including semi-autos. Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles.

I am selling my like new Beretta CX4 Storm 9mm Carbine. It's been great for what little use it's seen, perfect performance and very accurate with only the iron sights. They are adjustable for short or long range, and also fold flat for use with optics, including the front post. There is also a rail that can extend from inside the gun for mounting of lights/lasers, in addition to the included rail. It also has original case with added Beretta graphics, and all included cleaning tools, manual etc. 

I bought this carbine new in 2014, and it has seen little use - under 150 rounds total. Always cleaned after any use and stored in a humidity controlled safe. This includes the two original Beretta magazines that came with the CX4, only one was ever used at the range. I also purchased 6 additional 17rd Beretta magazines at $45 each. These are all the new more reliable version, PX4 magazines.  They are still new in package. I also had a Noveske QD mount professionally installed into the rear of the stock for a quick detach sling point for $125, as well as the name and logo filled on the CX4. In addition, I added an additional Beretta charging handle for $40, so that function is now ambidextrous along with everything else. All said and done I have just under $1,500 invested in the CX4 since it was purchased last year. I am asking $875 or best offer for everything included. Feel free to email, text or call with any questions.

The box is in good condition. The gun is almost mint. NBF. To this day, the SA93 is considered one of the most desireable of the AK imports, especially for collectors of Bulgarian Kalashnikovs. This is because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikov with a milled receiver and had the classic features of the original Bulgarian Type 3 AK-47 (AKK), which include a heavier/thicker barrel, as well as a 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube. Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver. The gun is in Logan WV during the week and Beckley WV on weekends. Please text me at REDACTED"

The stock has a solidly repaired (glued) crack in the stock at the left rear of receiver. It has held perfectly during my use of this SKS.

The stock and handguard colors may not be coming through perfectly but the stock is a beautiful deep brown with a reddish hue.

Visible numbers on the bolt, bolt carrier, receiver, and receiver cover match.The trigger guard has a very faint electropenciled serial number, 68644 is my best guess. It is too faint to capture in photos. The stock SN is 95402.

The bore is dark and frosted with strong but slightly rounded lands/grooves. This carbine gives good groups in my hands (this is not an endorsement of safe firing).
Look at the pictures. I tried to show everything clearly.

This is a used military surplus rifle! The decision to fire a used firearm is solely the responsibility of the buyer and this decision is best made with the input of a professional gunsmith.

For WA buyers. The transfer (NICS check) fee is your responsibility. I can recommend FFL-01 holders in the Tri-cities but will work with one of your choosing.
