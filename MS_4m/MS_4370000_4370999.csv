Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting."

I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 9 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 130 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order.

There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

*We are the only ones who offer to sell to the public. Anyone else who proclaims to sell them are not being honest with you and or are ignorant in what they are selling. Our Armor is certified, tested by the Military. Tested by us and are legitimate. We take pride in the quality of the craftsmanship of our products* The armor fit majority of plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. You are only cheating yourself if you are someone just wasting my time. Anti-Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request. Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 5. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

*We are the only ones who offer to sell to the public. Anyone else who proclaims to sell them are not being honest with you and or are ignorant in what they are selling. Our Armor is certified, tested by the Military. Tested by us and are legitimate. We take pride in the quality of the craftsmanship of our products* The armor fit majority of plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. You are only cheating yourself if you are someone just wasting my time. Anti-Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request. Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 5. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

318,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4370318,For Sale:  Remington 12 gauge Shotgun Magazine Extension +1 TacCap 870 1100 with Detent Type Lug,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Sunday, April 17, 2016",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Seller Stock #: XMTC NO MAGAZINE SALES INTO NEW YORK CITY. CONNECTICUT RESIDENTS MUST FURNISH US A COPY OF YOUR CT ELIGIBILITY PERMIT OR AMMUNITION CERTIFICATE. Here is one of the best shotgun accessories on the market, but not the best known. This part replaces a standard magazine cap on older model Remingtons, or current production 870P and recent production 1100P Police Shotguns. This is the Tac-Cap Magazine Cap for above mentioned Remington 12 gauge Shotguns. It is simple to install; a person carefully removes the magazine cap from your Remington, holding it so that the spring doesn’t launch it; then remove the magazine spring retainer if any with a similarly careful approach, depress the spring back into the magazine tube, and screw on the Tac-Cap until you hear it ratchet into place. Overall length is only 2 1/2 inches. Manufacturer and warrantor is Precision Gun Specialties from Sheridan, MI. Construction is lightweight aluminum alloy, with checkered nurling and end cross cuts. Weight is only 1 1/2 ounces, less than the factory cap and retainer. It will fit old model Remington 12 gauge pump and semi auto shotgun manufactured prior to 1986 with no modification, including models Sportsman 12 pump and auto; 870 Wingmaster, 870 Police, and the venerable 1100. This tube extension will readily fit standard old model Remington 12 gauge shotguns with detent balls embedded into their barrel lugs; and whose magazine tubes hold 4 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells. This replacement cap will bring magazine tube capacity up from 4 to 5 each 2 3/4 inch shells, and give a Remington a 5+1 capacity instead of 4 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch. It will yield similar results on 3 inch shells, from 3+1 up to 4+1, but very few of the older Remingtons were even made for 3 inch shells. It will not fit a Model 11, or a 31, or a 48, or a 58. Remington Shotguns with dimpled magazine tubes and magazine spring retainers that rotate into place must have their dimples removed and their main tubes modified. See the photos for the difference. The newer manufactured post 1985, 870s and 11-87s will require modification to their magazine tubes, since there are dimples inside the new shotguns' tubes that hold the spring retainer in place. The way we do it is simply Dremel down the two dimples and make sure the inside of the tube is smooth so that the shells will move along smoothly in the tube. Once a person does that, he cannot go back to the old shorter style; it permanently modifies the magazine tube of the shotgun itself. Carrying more than two shells in a magazine tube for hunting Federal status Migratory birds – doves, ducks, and crows – is a violation of federal law. In some states more than two shells hunting anything is a violation of state law. Installing one of these on an imported shotgun is also a violation of Federal Law if it makes the magazine capable of holding more than 5 shells.

The RDS-Series™ is the apex of form and function. Rigid Industries® RDS-Series™ is another first for the LED lighting industry and has been in testing and pre-production for the last two years and was first tested by BJ Baldwin as seen on his trophy truck at Parker 300 in January 2012. Since that time, Rigid Industries’ engineering team has been through numerous design changes, incorporating multiple patent pending utility and design features. The RDS LED light bar transforms the rectangular light bar Rigid Industries created, which became a phenomenon in 2006, to give this futuristic design sleekness and offer its customers an increased light spread.

About the Rifle: Realtree AP

The Pro Hunter FX features a Weather Shield break-open action and fluted 26"" barrel and includes the QLA Muzzle System for easy loading. The Speed Breech 3 hand-removable breech plug makes cleaning just as easy, and adjustable Williams Fiber Optics come standard as well.  This triple lead thread design on the Speed Breech 3 gives more area between the threads to help prevent breech plug seizing from powder corrosion.

The FX's Reversible Swing Hammer allows for easier access under mounted scopes for both left and right-handed shooters. And the FX comes pre drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting.  Features the tough-as-nails Weather Shield coating in Stainless Steel color, making the FX incredibly corrosion-resistant and the price is sure to please every hunter.  The Pro Hunter FX comes standard with the FlexTech recoil-reducing stock in both black composite and Realtree AP camo finishes.  For Thompson/Center hunters, the hunt doesn’t stop when weather conditions change. From early mornings watching the sun rise to snowy days when you’re listening for your prey to move through icy ground, Weather Shield technology is designed to keep up. This innovative coating has been tested to be 50 times more corrosion resistant than stainless steel.

After 350 hours of exposure to the elements, stainless steel showed wear and rust while Weather Shield coating remained impervious. T/C’s Weather Shield provides tough-as-nails protection that keeps your Pro Hunter FX performing at its best on every hunt.

This gun is like new. Not a mark on it. Comes with 2 mags. The serial numbers on the P250's began 20-Dec-07 with EAU00023xx. The serial number on my P250 begins with EAK0023xx which was manufactured 30-Jun-09. The known bugs in the P250's affected the early production run when the US factory first began manufacturing these guns. Those bugs were addressed and later production Gen 1 guns were unaffected and solid. The gun I have for sale is a Later Production Gen 1, manufactured a year and a half after the first run.Additional InfoThe Sig Sauer P250 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9mm, .357 SIG, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. The P250 has a modular design, so it basically snaps together and apart. Not just the slide to the frame—everything. That’s what makes the P250 so interesting. Everything on the pistol is interchangeable except for the action, or the mechanism that actually strikes the round. Shooters can swap out the frame and turn it into a compact or sub-compact pistol. They can adjust the grips for comfort and ease-of-use. Or, change the caliber with an easy-to-use conversion kit, which replaces the slide, barrel and magazine.Make an OfferCall MikeWe Pay the Sales Tax and Backround Check Fee for All:- Military (Active and Honorably Discharged Veterans)- LEO- Fire- EMSThank you for your service"

 I sent him a message yesterday with a very polite heads-up, and he's ignored it. This rifle clearly fails to conform to usc922r, which requires a certain number of US-made parts to replace the foreign-made parts, before converting to accept high capacity magazines (this is very well known and widely discussed on nearly every gun forum, for years now). 
 This rifle obviously hasn't had any trigger replacement, or stock replacement, and has a foreign 30-rd mag installed.
His price is well below market value, so I'm personally very suspicious, and would be very reluctant to take possesion of it.
Though it's probably unlikely, I wouldn't be surprised if it was some kind of sting operation. Coincidentally, there was a virtually identical rifle out of Atlanta last week, on TheOutdoorsTrader. I mentioned it to that guy also, and he basically flipped me off, and now the rifle's gone, but then one just like it appears down here.
Take it for what it's worth.

Grip Peg allows a variety of grip styles to be installed, leaving ample room for recoil cushioning. Standard model has a Hogue® Tamer™ grip, which is highly effective at reducing felt recoil - LCR also available with Crimson Trace® Lasergrips®.
High-Strength stainless steel cylinder is extensively fluted (reducing weight) and features an Ionbond Diamondblack™ finish for excellent durability.
LCRx™ models feature an external hammer that allows it to be fired in single-action mode.

From the Lipsey website:  After the success of the Mark II Backpacker model, we saw that there was a market for 4"" bull barrel Mark II pistols.  With the steel frame, the 4"" bull barrel balances very well and is not as nose heavy as the longer barrel models.  We wanted to dress it up some with nicer grips and the smooth rosewood did the trick.  Someone asked about a gold trigger, so Ruger anodized several for us to look at.  The gold trigger contrasted well with the blue steel and dark grips and made the gun stand out in a dealer's display case.  The Mark II Deluxe really started the trend to add different grips and accessories to the MKII pistols."

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.$449 Plus tax, no trades.Dealer Sale.
