These were produced on only six different days. Each gun has an ""A"" prefix with the register number. The Plymouth Model No,107 Trombone Action gun is a difficult gun to find.

This 500-shot gun is 36 inches long. It cocks by sliding the pump handle straight back. It has a ramp front sight and a V-notch rear sight. The stock has the standard checkering and there is a gold silk-screen design on the receiver. The name 'DAISY' appears in raised metal letters on the slide.""

Metalwork has our rich, deep bluing for beauty and protection. The Model 700 BDL features a hinged magazine floorplate, sling swivel studs, hooded ramp front sight, and adjustable rear sight.

I couldn't get it to hold groups either, obviously, I am doing something wrong.  I'm not going to use it as I had hoped, so I just don't have a need for it and it has sat in its box for months.

Also know as the .38 Military & Police Special Stainless. Dates to approx 1994. Great balance. Rare to find this revolver in such good condition and even harder yet to find with three inch barrel. With the round butted grip frame and shorter barrel is practical as a concealed carry revolver. No box or papers.

I am NOT interested in trades, thank you. Low ballers and flippers, don't bother. This gun is looking for a good home.

Shoots 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. It has rifle sights and I polished the bolt while it was out. This is an actual police gun used by a police department that I bought and completely disassembled and refinished. I replaced the synthetic furniture with wingmaster wood but the original set is included with the gun. This gun was made to work and it functions as it should, you will not find a better gun for home defense. I added a list below of some of the major differences between the police and express guns just to give those of you who dont know why the police versions are more desirable.


The 870 Police has:
 - An aluminum trigger group (vs plastic on the 870 express).
 - Old style magazine retention system (you can add mag extension w/o modification) 
 - The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts.
 - A military-grade parkerized finish.
 - A polished bore.
 - A one piece barrel.
 - A short police-length fore end. 
- The Remington “R3” super recoil pad that reduces felt recoil by 30%.
 - Sling swivels.
 - Heavy-duty magazine spring to ensure positive shell feeding.
 - Heavy-duty trigger-sear spring. to reduce the chance of accidental fire
 - Heavy-duty shell lifter spring which also improves positive feeding.
 - No use of MIM parts, the extractor is milled
 - Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
- The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
 - High visibility follower."

This knife has been lightly carried, but the blade has never been used to cut anything. The knife is in excellent, but not mint condition. It is important to see the detail of the photos that can be enlarged for viewing. The blade lockup is perfect. In the photos I tried to catch the line where you can see where the edge meets the core. This knife takes an amazing edge and is razor sharp.
From SOG’s description: a mirror polished San Mai (VG-10 core laminated with 420J2 stainless steel) exotic blade moves smooth as silk and mechanically effortless thanks to SOG’s very special arc-lock and abalone jewelled thumb stud. Safety: spring-action securely retains the blade closed. The titanium bolsters meet old school jigged bone handles in a rare and beautiful combination. The color of the jigged bone handles vary in color from a deep maroon, each knife a unique piece. The arc-lock far surpasses conventional lock strength, tested at over 1000 lbs of force measured at the lock in an independent lab test.  This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty from SOG that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.

Trying real hard to like 1911's, but again, no luck.  This thing is beautiful though and does shoot great if you like 1911's.  It's chambered in .45 and is less than two months old.  I do have copies of receipt from where I purchased it.  Paid around $1550 plus tax, shot about ten to fifteen rounds through the magazines to try it and just felt too much like Sig 1911's.   It was very accurate though and considered one of the best 1911's on the market.  Please no trades and no haggling.  So it is basically brand new and available for inspection prior to purchase. I have every thing it came with and it is all unused.  Also, I was actually selling it to a friend but he wouldn't show id.  This has happened a couple times to me already with past guns I have sold.  IF you can't own a gun, don't try and get this one.  I will need to see ID and exchange all required info with a bill of sale or some kind of statement for both parties.  Here's the specs

I would like to get $550 for it, but don't hesitate to make me an offer. I'm willing to trade for a CZ 75 SP-01 or a Smith & Wesson M&P Pro. Please text Sean at (2four8) 2zero2-28six2 with any questions or for more pics. Thanks!"

I used 6.8 for blackbear hunting and works awesome, dropped mine DRT

4150 CMV 6.8 barrel Has the accurate ARP chamber and Hybrid 5R rifling 11.25 twist . 
M4 feed ramps, mid length gas system, .800 under the guard, .750 gas block dia. .700 dia from gas block to muzzle. 5/8-24 thread muzzle.
Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels and are more accurate.
These barrels are very accurate, many report 1/2"" groups at 100yds 
The 4150 11595E steel Melonite(QPQ) treated barrels we sell will last twice as long as stainless barrels-60 rockwell VS 28-30 of the stainless. The final finish meets or exceeds stainless steel corrosion resistance. 
The 6.8 was developed as an improved CQB cartridge by the 5th Group Special Forces. The devastating performance combined with the AR15 makes it the #1 choice of hog and deer hunters . It has apx 80% of the performance of the 308 in a much lighter platform. Also more power than 30-30 and 300 BO and 6.5 Grendal
We have designed a 5 groove hybrid rifling similar to 5R with a low land to groove ratio to increase the bore area and lessen bullet deformation which leads to better accuracy. We have found that our 5R Melonite QPQ barrels consistently produce 60-90fps more than most SPCII 10 and 11 twist 4 groove barrels with the same loads. Hornady's 110gr HPBTs reach 2600fps from our 16"" barrels and normally shoot under 3/4"" groups at 100yds. With better shooters groups are near 1/2"" so they shoot better than some high dollar stainless barrels and most match grade 5.56s . Hornady's 120gr SST and Federal's Fusion 115gr work very well on deer and hogs. With handloads it is possible to push a 100gr Nosler over 2900fps from a 18"" barrel, nothing else comes close to the performance of a 6.8.
The 6.8SPCII and 6.8x43 ARP chamber we use shoot the same ammo including SSAs Tac loads and Wilson Combats ammo uses the same size dies, only the throat in the chamber is different. The chamber was designed to increase accuracy.
The only things needed to switch any 223/556 over to 6.8 is a barrel and bolt and magazine.

A few modifications I made to this gun
1. modified the bolt so the magazine can be inserted  with the bolt closed 
2. made a small feed ramp so the gun can accept hollowpoints and improve feeding

- the trigger sometimes does not reset when the bolt is hand operated. A very light pull in the trigger and releasing  it will reset the trigger. Once the gun is in operation (bolt operated by the firing action), the trigger resets fine."

870 SPECS-
•	Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective, black matte metalwork and a no-frills, satin-finish hardwood stock and forend. This 20-gauge model is offered with a 28"" vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem Choke and single bead sight.

Works perfectly fine, good eye relief for a 5.56 weapon and 5x magnification is much better than just a 3x imo. Parting ways because I'm selling the eotech/magnifier setup to finance a 4x to 12x scope since most of my shooting is long range and it doesn't make sense to have such an expensive set up just sitting in my spare parts drawer, otherwise I'd keep them both. Price is firm since this item sells for 200$ and I bought it for a bit more. If you have any other questions just ask. Will work with any holographic sight or red dot set to the same height."

SPECS----  
Beretta –
Designed and manufactured in the USA, the new U22 Neos is a single-action .22 LR caliber plinking semiauto pistol.
U22-Neos-intro
Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.
Ideal-for-training Cool, Futuristic Design
Even while designing a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor of renown Italian designer Giugiaro--the same mind behind several of our most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eye
 Fully-Modular Construction Fully-Modular
The Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (""Inox""), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.
Easy-to-Use High Performance
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless-steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look--it won't fail to surpass your expectations.

Whether you are shooting light or heavy ammo, carrier can be adjusted to give you the best performance possible. Integrally machined gas key removes any chance of key loosening during firing. Improved gas flow eliminates carbon build up which can cause your carrier to freeze. Maximized carrier key dimension reduces gas tube contact wear. Carrier offers reduced recoil, allowing you quicker target acquisition and follow up shots. Durable LifeCoat finish delivers superior lubricity, with resistance to both corrosion and carbon.
