This rifle has an import mark on one side of the receiver and the 1939 date on top. It is a round receiver model. I have fired less than ten rounds through it and was amazed at how accurate it was. My wife said it's too nice for me to take the pipe cutter and Dremel tool to. So I would like to trade it for a Chinese Type 53. Not looking for a perfect rifle since most T53s are a little rough to begin with. I do have the long toothpick looking bayonet with this rifle as well as a really greasy oil bottle and cleaning too. However I didn't get a sling with it. It has the usual scuffs and scratches in the stock. It will look good with a refinish job. Looking for an even trade or very close. And the Type 53 is really my only trade interest at this time. Although I would gladly trade even for an M44 even though I don't expect anyone to do that. Message me here for more details or pics. I can remove the paracord wrap or leave it on. That's up to the buyer.Thanks for looking.

Photos are generic, but buyer will receive a virtually identical rifle from the dozen odd specimens we got on this deal. Dealers, agencies, and collectors may take any virtually identical rifles we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no extra shipping charges. Here is a Talo Special Edition Sporter version or Mossberg’s 715T. Manufacturer is CBC of Ribeirão Pires, Brazil, the company that brought us the excellent Nylon 66 clones back in the 1980s.  Importer and warrantor is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, Texas. Exclusive distributor was Talo Inc. of Framingham, MA. Type is blowback action rimfire semi automatic. Chambering is .22 Long Rifle caliber, high velocity ammunition. Construction is steel one piece barrel, bolt, trigger, hammer, and internal parts built into a lightweight alloy main receiver. Stock is one piece schnabel type black polymer. Barrel is 16 inch medium .635 outside diameter, 1:16 six groove right hand bore. Muzzle is threaded with an A2 type cage muzzle brake attached with crush washer, and brings the barrel length out to 17 1/2 inches. Sighting system relies on the 4 1/2 inch, 3/8 inch grooves integral to the receiver, that accept Tip Off or grooved receiver optics mounts. Bolt operating handle is extended serrated face with lock position. Trigger is .230 smooth faced steel two stage, pulls at 5 pound vicinity with moderate felt movement and overtravel. Safety is push button type, forward of the trigger for a right handed shooter, non reversable. Magazine release is in front of the trigger guard, 715T type. Magazine furnished is a steel 10 rounder, but this 715T variant will accept both 702 and 715 Magazines. Stock is Plinkster style, one piece factory issue schnabel type, with cherkered surface laterals on the forend and pistol grip areas; and with a length of pull of 14 1/4 inches. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and a full 3 inches at the butt. Finish is matte blued and black anodized and black polymers.  Overall length is  37 1/2 inches. Weight empty is 3 pounds 11 ounces, with center of gravity at the operating handle. This 715T and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, likely from showgirl duty with their sales force. The factory stamped their letter U beside its serial number. Apart from that, surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only faint operation buffing on the bolt surfaces. We rate each rifle as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Each 715T comes in a relabeled Mossberg factory box with lock, protective papers, safety flyers, and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. Its manual package and magazine were factory sealed when we got it. Chamber, bore, and mechanism are all bright and clean. If this rifle has been fired at all, we estimate it was fewer than 100 rounds. Replacement pricing on similar rifles from competitors Remington, Ruger, and Marlin approach $300 apiece. We’re offering the Mossberg 715T in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates, each     for only           $ 129.00.  Not transferable to civilian residents of Chicago, California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,  New York, or any jurisdiction where rifles with threaded barrels or muzzle brakes are restricted to law enforcement.

Got it in a trade, got the hardware for the original handguard and had it checked out by a gunsmith. The firing pin was replaced with an actual galil pin too.

The upturned cocking handle is notorious for breaking off. This one was replaced with a shell casing. Any ak bolt carrier drops in if you don't like the look, though i'd recommend using the galil gas piston if you do.

It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.Features:Caliber: 40 S&WCapacity: 14Barrel Length: 16.6"" Finish: BlackAction: SingleOverall Height: 7.5""Overall length: 29.7""Overall Width: 2.5""Sight Radius: 12.9""Weight: 90.8 oz."

If you guys dont know what this is, do yourself a favor and look it up. Its a blast to shoot and an innovative firearm all the way around. Holds 14 rounds of 12ga in the dual magazine tubes with 1 in the chamber. Thats with 2 3/4 in shells, Aguila and RIO make shorter shells in buckshot and I can fit 22 of those in it with 1 in the chamber. Thats 23 rounds of buckshot without having to reload.

Anyways, I enjoy this firearm but I am downsizing, and to be honest for just hunting applications my Remington 870 with a 28"" barrel fills a better role.

Accessories Included:
Magpul Foregrip (aids in pump action)
Troy Fixed FDE Battle Sights (chose this for a better more precise sight picture)

That’s why Magtech developed the Clean Range series of ammunition for indoor range use. In contrast to traditional full metal jacket ammunition, which has an exposed lead base, Clean Range bullets are fully covered in copper. This prevents lead release when the round is discharged, protecting you from inhaling potentially harmful airborne particles.The light 115 grain bullet in this 9mm Parabellum load achieves a muzzle velocity of 1135 feet per second. As a standard pressure round, it offers solid performance without excessive recoil in compact carry pistols such as the Glock 26, Sig P938, and Colt New Agent. Each box holds 50 cartridges in reloadable Boxer-primed brass cases.Magtech ammo is developed by the Companhia Brasileira de Cartuchos, or CBC, which roughly translates to “Brazilian Cartridge Company.” BCC is one of the largest ammo manufacturers in the world and operates from a massive production complex and headquarters in Ribeirao Pires, a city in the state of Sao Paulo. The 500-acre Ribeirao Pires plant features state of the art automated assembly lines for ammo as well as satellite plants to produce components such as propellant and primers. Magtech’s US offices and distribution center are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota."

All three guns have exactly one box of ammo through them. All shot on one range visit. All guns perform flawlessly. I took the Beretta to a gunsmith after a fail to feed on the first clip. He polished the ramp and feed muzzle and I took it back to the range the same day. No problems.

Will sell each for $450. Will discount for more than one purchase, but not much.

Will also trade 1, 2, or 3 of them for a QUALITY electric guitar. American or Japanese preferred. No Floyd Rose tremolo's or the like... prefer hard tail with 2 humbuckers. Guitars must be of equal trade value. Trade value of all guns will be considered at $500 per.

Will also consider trades for other firearms. If it's something I'm not interested in I will politely decline, but it never hurts to try.

The sale or trade of the guns must take place at Gander Mountain FFL in Aurora. I will pay the $10 transfer fee, you will pay the $7 background check fee.  If you prefer another FFL you will pay all fees.

All three guns come with factory boxes and the clips that came with them. The Springfield XD does not have the holsters and XD equipment you can get with some of them. Also, the Springfield will come with 2 disassembled 17 round parts kits for clips.
