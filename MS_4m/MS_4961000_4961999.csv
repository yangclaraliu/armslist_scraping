This has the built in Crimson Trace laser. I bought it less than 6 months ago to be my conceal carry pistol and just decided that I want something else instead. I've taken it to the range twice and have fired less than 100 rounds. It will come with the remainder of the ammunition, the three S&W magazines (3 -6 round magazines), the box and S&W range bag pictured. I have an Alien Gear in the waist band holster I can throw in for the right price. It's been a good gun with no issues but I just want something different. Don't need to sell so please no low balling.

These will firmly hold both full size and officers/compact 1911 grips.

The jig features brass pins that will not damage your sanding belt or disk and will not create a spark. I have the height set at .275 to .285. This will allow you to sand to the pins and be just thicker than the .250 - .270 final thickness. (Standard Grips)

Also includes a grip screw locating and profile jig for Government, Commander and Officer 1911's.  After you cut your grip blanks, simply insert them on either side of the jig and check for the correct angle. Then, use a 1/8th drill bit to mark the exact location of your bushing and screw holes. 

(Hole location and profile jig is based on VZ Brand grip size and shape.)

With your purchase, I include information of what drill bit I have found work best for boring your final grip screw and bushing holes with little or no tear out.  Bits are available at any Lowes or Home Depot.  I also include tips and ""tricks of the trade"".

Includes three (3) free sets of grip blanks to get you started, Walnut, Cherry and Maple.  One set of each is included with your purchase.  All Cabinet Grade materials!

I am not a trap shooter so I have very little use for it. It is a 12 gauge SKB 85TSS with a trap combo that includes two barrel kits (one 34"" unsingle barrel with adjustable rib, and the other being a 32"" over and under ventilated rib barrel ). In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. 
The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!
This shotgun is rare and hard to get these days since it is no longer made and most people hang on to theirs because of its high quality. SKB is well known for its great costumer service and quality products; my grandfather has always talked this gun up, you're getting a great premium package here!

This is the 2015 NRA Gun of the Year - Kimber Pro Carry II.

This is not one of those 'gimmicky, maybe collectible guns'. To the contrary, it is a collectible as there are only 1050 available and when looking at the gun's serial number, it actually starts with 'NRA'

Besides the fact that it is a Kimber, and thus renowned quality being built in, here are some other features that this gun includes:
First and foremost, it is made in the USA
24k Gold plated and etched decorative scroll work on both sides of the slide
Custom Crimson Trace Master Series laser grips
Match Grade bushingless 4' bull barrel

This is gun is a really nice piece and is new in the box as I cannot bring myself to shoot it.
This is the sole purpose for selling this gun, as I am a shooter, not a collector.

I am a reasonable person and I will entertain reasonable cash offers and trades plus cash for the difference.

It should go without saying, but I will say it anyway. If you are not able to legally own or posses a firearm, do not contact me. As it stands now, if you have a current CCW AND Drivers License, we can do a bill of sale. If I have any reason to suspect that you are not honest and up front about this, I will ask that this be done through an FFL where you will have to pass an NICS background check

Asking price shown above but will listen to cash offers.
If you have a high quality gently used Savage, or something similar, I would be interested in trading as I want to build an F-Class rifle."

These rifles were used to train Marine Corps snipers. They are easily identified by the factory stamp ""U.S.M.C. Property"" on the receiver. 

After the Marines finished with them, many were sent out to schools with shooting programs and eventually returned to the government. Depending on when they were returned, many were destroyed. Over the years a quantity were released through a government agency to promote shooting (the CMP). As you can imagine they were in rough shape and the demand far outweighed supply. You entered a lottery for a chance to purchase one and condition was not guaranteed. The CMP removed all the bolts and inspected the rifles then headspaced each rifle without regard to matching the bolts. 

Non-matching bolt. This rifle is in very nice condition. I had my choice of several and picked the best one. It is unrestored and with some TLC could be the highlight of your collection.

Two years ago the USMC 40X rifles sold for 1100, Last year they were 1300 and recent sales have been in the 1600 range. Excellent examples bring in close to 2000. It is collectible and will continue to increase in value. As an investment, its hard to beat this particular rifle.

I'm not interested in any offers or trades for this rifle. If you know what this is, you will happily pay the full asking price and feel very good about it knowing it will continue to increase in value.

It's a good shooter. This rifle is used and has dings in the stock. It needs a good cleaning. There are worn spots in the bluing. The scope and mounts are not included.

It has night sights however they are pretty dim. The front sight does glow slightly more than the rear but still dim. It's been shot VERY little, check out the photo of the barrel. There is barely any wear at all. The grip does show some scrapes. Doesn't affect feel in the hand so it never bothered me.
Included in the sale is 3 magazines (two standard G19 15+1s and one Gen1 G17 18+1), grip plug, original case.
