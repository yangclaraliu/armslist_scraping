The carrier is still sealed in the bag but the gas block was removed so I could check that the adjustment screw works correctly, which it does. I also removed the op rod to make sure it is straight, which it is. This is the newer version that bleeds off excess gas as opposed to just blocking off the gas port. It will even fit under a BCM KMR rail. This is a very nicely made kit. The only reason I am not using it is I decided to go a different route. I was gonna keep it for another build but the wife said one at a time.  They are listed for $299.95. Keep in mind I also paid sales tax because they are a Florida company, but I am not charging for that. So you are saving on shipping and tax also. I will ship for no extra charge if needed. Plus I have it in hand so you don't have to worry about ""In-Stock"". Thanks for looking and Happy Holidays!!!"

It’s all “first-world” production, not third-world stuff. It consists of the following:

1) SOLD - 11 unopened boxes (20 rounds each) of Lake City/Frankford Arsenal M118 Match ammo. My understanding is that this is considered the most accurate 7.62x51 ammo you can get. Bullet weight is 173 grains. Six boxes are Frankford Arsenal, and five boxes are Lake City.

2) SOLD - 2 unopened boxes (20 rounds each) of Lake City M118 ammo. Bullet weight is 173 grains.

3) 3 bandoliers (60 rounds in a bandolier) of Winchester (WRA headstamp) M80 ammo, manufactured in 1968, on 5-round stripper clips. Bullet weight is 147 grains.

I also have some of this ammo in loose 5-round stripper clips and loose cartridges, as shown.

4) 7 plastic containers (50 rounds each) of Radway Green (British) ammo, manufactured in 1984/1985. I’ve shot this and find that it’s very accurate. Bullet weight is 147 grains.

5) 2 boxes (20 rounds each) of German DAG Patrone AB 22 ammo.  This is the German equivalent of the U.S. M80 round. Bullet weight is 147 grains.

Got it for Christmas and love it! It's amazing. But, and I know I'll regret this later, I don't have any firearms in .308 and don't plan on buying another caliber of ammo... Man, this thing is incredible though. 

I sent 80 rounds through it and it's smooth, accurate. The bolt cycles so smoothly, it's incredible, has an awesome trigger (accu-trigger) and has surprisingly little kick, likely due to the muzzle break and butt pad (we also shot a new Sig .308 AR another guy at the range was shooting,.. it actually kicked more!). 

Also comes with 2 boxes of Winchester Whitebox ammo.. whatever I have on hand. I bought a few boxes, shot 4 boxes and decided I just can't add another caliber right now. Man,.. I know I'll kick myself later.. 

I AM looking for a bolt action.. just not in .308. If you have a new NEW/newer CZ 527 in 7.62x39 let's talk. Otherwise you're is getting a killer deal on a gun that is really hard to find right now.

After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

I have kept it around, mostly for nostalgia, and well, I just dont use it.  

I have a couple speedloaders for it, but apparently the box is gone.  I have a Kimber box for some reason, and no kimber, so, I guess it can go in there for you.  I honestly have no idea where the box went, over the years.  I know the ""no box"" thing affects collectors value, but it doesnt drop it down to being a Rossi or Windicator.  Just sayin....."

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

It is clean, and accurate. We brought it to the range Christmas day for my son to shoot, and he does not like how it loads and would rather have a lever action or a detachable magazine rifle. He also does not like how the safety works..........he is 14, so being a good dad, I gave him another rifle I just bought and this one is up for sale. It comes with the scope (Tasco) all sighted in and about 15 rounds of ammo that we did not shoot. I may be open to trades for other firearms. I have it priced at $250 firm. Not going to haggle about price, because anything less I will just keep it. Its a great rifle which I thought he would like, but obviously not."

Compatible with most any M1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

•Mounts to MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny and NATO STANAG 4694 rails (min. of ~4"" recommended)
