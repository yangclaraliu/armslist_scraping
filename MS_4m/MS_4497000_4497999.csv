The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling.

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

This pistol has been retooled from previous models to make it one of the best compact concealed carry handguns on the market.  For the 12+1 capacity, it is extremely compact and conceals well even while wearing light clothing. It fits nicely in the hand and is comfortable to shoot all day at the range. The sights are adjustable, and the trigger is fantastic.  VERY little distance to reset after each shot, allowing for fast follow-up shots.

This pistol shows some minor holster wear on the left side, but make no mistake this firearm is practically new.  I have broken this pistol in for you, and with exactly zero failures to eject or feed, have taken any guess-work out of the deal. You can be confident this is a reliable, quality firearm.

This sale includes the pistol, one 12-round magazine, hex key for the integral lock, and the original box and paperwork.

I found 1 listed on Cabelas gun library for $679 so I figure it is around a $550-$600 firearm (as those guys generally seem high to me). I am asking $500. The only trades I would consider would be for a good quality rifle scope.  Leupold, NF, ect. It will be going on a 30-378 so I would like fairly high magnification. Let me know what ya got. If you come to me in Cinebar, I will pay the transfer fee, otherwise on you. Thanks for looking."

I originally purchased this as a follow up piece to my P99 in 9mm and just simply haven't seen the need to fire it. Includes 1 factory mag, additional backstraps, manual, etc. 

As you will see in the pics it has the german proof marks and visible oil residue. I left the oil on it as it came from the factory. 

These are excellent weapons and while the AS trigger isn't for everyone its a great bonus after you adjust to it. It also features a decocker and loaded chamber indicator which spoils you . I've had the above mentioned 9mm version for 20 years now and make no plans on selling it anytime soon. This is simply taking up space and it's time for someone else to enjoy it.

It was my duty gun for 2 years before they were replaced by Gen4's and was issued to me new. About 1000 rds through it and slide has minor holster wear. Grip has been chopped down to accept Glock 23 mags, but the slide retains the longer sight radius of the G22. For IWB carry, barrel length is negligible but shorter grips help keep from ""printing"" under you shirt.

876,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4497876,"For Sale:  .458 SOCOM AR Pistol 10.5"" Barrel","Metro, Tucson, Arizona",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, July 31, 2015",Rifles,High Standard                                                                                ,458 SOCOM                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The .458 SOCOM was created, based on requirements by the Special Operations Command (SOCOM), for Task Force Ranger and some elements of Delta and Seals, that were operating in Somalia (Mogadishu) in the late 90's early 2000's. These special ops soldiers were asking for a better ""knock down, one shot, one kill"" ability because their M4's, calibred in 5.56, were not effective as a CQB take down round (they needed multiple shots to knock down and/or kill the Somali's). The requirement also required the upgraded caliber to be compatible with the current M4 platform. The end result was... (1) a .458 caliber bullet fired from a different barrel that was used in the current M4 upper receiver,...(2) development of a different bolt because of the size of the .458 round, but, maintain the same bolt carrier, and...(3) the ejection port on the current M4 upper receiver would have to be enlarged for the ejection of the larger piece of brass. These three items are the only difference between a standard AR 15 and the .458 SOCOM. The standard M16 / AR15 lower receiver is to be used with this upper, and was not changed at all. 

Place this upper receiver next to a 5.56 upper receiver and visually there is no difference. The difference becomes apparent only when you squeeze the trigger. At that time all hell breaks loose as you unleash a 300gr bullet, with a muzzle velocity of 1840 fps and 2100 ft lbs of energy towards that feral pig that has been bothering your farm animals. This round, with that much energy, will stop a 300lb feral pig in its tracks. 

***Preferably, I would like to sell this complete pistol set to a Arizona CCW holder, but, whomever the buyer is he / she must be willing to sign a bill of sale for the serial numbered lower receiver with both of our information on it, which is a ""CYA"" for the two of us***

The price for every item in picture # 1 is $1550.....I will consider all reasonable offers with the keyword being ""reasonable"". Please be respectful of the build process, prices, and, comparable brick and mortar prices for these types of pistols. Sold separately the complete SOCOM upper, with sight, no lower, is $720. The 5.56 upper, with sight, no lower, is $580. The lower is not for sale separately but if you purchase just one of the uppers and want the lower with it, add $350 to whichever upper you choose.

***If the uppers are sold separately then the 4 mags with bullets ARE NOT a part of the sale. The mags and bullets only apply if the entire kit is purchased***

I may ship the upper receivers if requested (paypal only) but will ""ONLY"" sell the lower receiver in person, no exceptions.

***If you are interested in purchasing this pistol combination please email to receive more pictures as ArmsList only allows me 3 pictures***

Any AR 15 lower receiver will attach to, and fire, this .458 SOCOM upper, and 5.56 upper. 

For the .458 SOCOM...The upper receiver, 10.5"" barrel, bolt, gas block, gas tube, is from Tromix. The barrel shroud is from Kineti-Tech. The nickel boron bolt carrier is from SAA. The hand guard is a Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) T-6061 anodized aluminum 9.6"" diamond version quad rail, which is very strong and light weight, and this is a full floating barrel. 

For the 5.56...The upper receiver is a overrun modular build from an un-named source who requested to be anonymous for a good reason. The 11"" barrel is the same type of overrun build from the same source and is chambered in 5.56 and is chrome lined. The BCG is nickel boron and is from SAA. The firing pin is titanium, The charging handle and ejection port cover are laser engraved with the 2nd Amendment and punisher graphics (must see) The handguard is 10"" T-6061 aluminum and is very strong and lightweight which makes the barrel a full floating build. The muzzle compensator is from Kineti-tech and direct the sound and flash forward.

The holographic sight on both of these uppers are a Sightmark SM 14002g (green reticles) and is night vision compatible.

The lower receiver is a aero precision with many upgrades...
1) A hyper fire EDT (enhanced duty trigger) with the 4.5lb pull trigger. It also has a 5.5lb trigger spring as well. The trigger and hammer pins have anti-rotation attachments.
2) The pistol grip is a magpul with a storage compartment.
3) The trigger guard is laser etched with a waving American flag and reads ""Freedom isn't Free""
4) The front pivot pin and rear take down pins are over sized for easy grip and are laser etched with the waving American flag.
5) The safety select lever is ambidextrous.
6) The lower receiver extension is a KAK Shockwave complete forearm brace purchased from KAK  industries. ***THIS IS NOT A SHOULDER STOCK AND IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE USED AS A SHOULDER STOCK***
7) The rear sling mount is a quick detach at the pistol grip.

These are very quality builds and they have been test fired to ensure all areas of functionality work as required.

The .458 SOCOM bullets will feed into regular AR magazines. A 30 round AR magazine will hold 10 .458 SOCOM rounds as a single stack. This pistol will come with the 4 magazines you see, loaded with 10 rounds each, as shown in the picture. The rounds are Hornady 300gr hollow points, or SBX inceptor 140gr hydro-dynamic (propeller) CQB defense round. Your choice. 

The 5.56 will come with the 4 magazines shown, each with 30 rounds of SS109 62gr purchased from LAX ammo.

Please no trades or low ball offers as the price is very reasonable. Please be respectful.

The price includes everything you see in the pictures.

Before I go into my little love fest about how the properties of this firearm, I'll post the pertinent information with regard to the sale.

---------
PRICE: $425
LOCATION: TALLAHASSEE (can travel, will be in Orlando on Saturday before driving back home along I-75 and I-10, so I can meet somewhere in that vicinity)
INCLUDED: Firearm, one 10-round S&W magazine, one 15-round factory P99 magazine, original box (with matching serial, but damaged hinge), test round, detailed manufacturer information, unfilled S&W lifetime warranty card, owner's manual, zippered handgun sleeve.
AVAILABLE EXTRAS (first refusal given to whomever purchases this firearm): 50 rounds of Federal HST 124gr +P, Gould and Goodrich Level 3 basketweave leather duty holster.
---------

The SW99 was a collaboration between Smith & Wesson and Walther, effectively ""cloning"" the Walther P99. Walther produced the frame, and Smith & Wesson produced the barrel and slide. It's identical to the P99 in structure and function, the only differences being aesthetics (primarily the lines on the slide and the rounded instead of squared trigger guard).

This particular model comes with the AS (Anti-Stress) trigger, which is unique in and of itself. When the striker is pre-cocked, the trigger has a pre-travel is taken up completely (and locked in place) when you pull the trigger to that point (without passing the break). From that point, the trigger pull is a crisp 4.5 pounds, with a very short reset. However, it can be carried in DA/SA mode with a pull weight of 7.8 pounds on the first pull by using the manual decocker.

Another distinct advantage is mag availability. It's fully compatible with magazines for the P99 as well as the PPQ M1 (just not M2, which are more expensive anyway), and Walther even makes a factory 20-round magazine for it. But unlike the Walther and it's 1-year warranty, S&W honors the warranty for the life of the firearm, not just the owner. It's perhaps for this reason the 9mm version is becoming harder and harder to find.

If you have any questions about it, I'd be happy to answer them. As you can certainly tell, I'm a dork about these things."

For sale/trade I have a 1942 K Kale Turk Mauser. Chambered in 8mm Mauser. Rifle is in okay condition, with a dark shootable bore. Bluing is in good condition. Stock is beaten up, with pieces that the ""factory"" has replaced. I stripped and refinished the stock in a soft linseed oil finish.

Rifle chambers, shoots, and extracts as you would expect of the Mauser action.

I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on the history of these types of Mausers, Im sure some of you out there know a lot more than I do. If you have any questions I'll do my best to answer them for you.

The deal includes the rifle, an original bayonet, and two bandoleers of surplus 8mm totaling in 130 rounds on stripper clips! (Google is telling me that's about $80 in ammo alone)

Valuing at $250 for the whole deal.

90 rounds were put through it yesterday at the range to test it out, worked great absolutely no issues. Ate both brass and aluminium cased ammo with no issues. 

I recently built this AR-15 using a ""Smith & Wesson Custom Upper Receiver""
