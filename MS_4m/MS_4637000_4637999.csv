I also have two spam cans of russian ammo which I'll sell for whatever you can find it for on the internet. But I just decided to set up a separate listing for that. 

Price is $225 and thats firm. I could sell it for more but to be honest, I'm probably just as angry as you are about how expensive these are getting. This price is cheaper than you'd pay on Classic firearms, and thats if they had them in stock."

Like new. Very few rounds shot through it, just under 200. I am the first owner. 

With the gun there are:
-Two-30 round magazines
-Factory case
-PMR 30 enhanced magazine loader
-5 extra recoil buffers
-34 rounds of CCI Maxi Mag 40 gr HP (recommended by Kel Tec for most reliable functioning)
-PMR 30 manual
-Does not include spent casing, but I still have the receipt

Fun to shoot. Very light recoil. 22 mag, so it's pretty loud. You have to pay attention to how you're loading the mags, but the enhanced loader makes loading easier. There have been zero FTF's, FTE's or misfires (primer strikes are strong and consistent). Trigger is AMAZING.

Price $1450 OBO

The Beretta® A400 Xplor Unico Semi-Auto Shotgun features several advanced recoil reduction systems, including Kick-Off™ hydraulic shock absorbers in the stock, and a Micro Core recoil pad. These features decrease felt recoil to the shooter by as much as 70%, as well as reducing abuse to the gun itself. The A400 Xplor Unico shoots 2.75"", 3"", and 3.5"" shells interchangeably without having to make adjustments, making it an extremely versatile hunting shotgun. The A400 functions equally well for upland bird hunting, duck hunting, sporting clays, or any type of shotgun shooting that involves speed and reliability. To aid hunters in shooting quick flying, multiple targets, the A400 semi-automatic shotgun has an action that cycles super fast—capable of shooting 4 shots in less than one second. The Beretta A400 Xplor Unico features very aesthetically pleasing lines with a classic, checkered walnut buttstock and forend, and a blued barrel with a contrasting-color receiver. The A400's action features a rotating bolt, and a self-cleaning piston to ensure the shotgun operates in all conditions and is low in maintenance. Under field conditions, the A400 easily disassembles with no tools in a matter of seconds. The crossbolt safety is positioned at the front of the trigger guard, where the hunter can find it instantaneously. The A400 comes with sling swivel studs and 3 Optima-Bore HP interchangeable, screw-in chokes. The Beretta A400 Xplor Unico Kick-Off is an elegant looking, highly practical Semi-Auto Shotgun that's versatile, rugged and reliable."

The Owner indicated the day he purchased the weapon and ammunition he fired the weapon emptying one cylinder (6) six rounds. The weapon has NOT been fired since.

I have free floated the stock, lapped the action, and added a adjustable Timney trigger ($150 cost) and have it adjusted to about 12 oz, as well as scope mounts and precision rings ($100). 

Look at the pictures, its pristine.  I have about 150 rounds through it, just broken in.  I was able to shoot 0.200"" 100 yard groups and 7/8"" 300 yard groups.  Its a phenomenally accurate rifle.  Scope rings and mounts shown are included with the gun.

I'm asking $600 for this awesome gun.  Purchase price for everything included was about $1000.  I'll even include about 50 rounds of ammo to get you started.

I'm mostly interested in cash, but if you have something to trade let me know.  I'd consider AR-15's, AR-10's, bolt actions chambered in 6.5 creedmoor, revolvers in 44 magnum, Thompson encore frames/barrels/complete guns.  Let me know what you have to trade, worst i can say is no!

First of all because they are not being produced any longer. Secondly because most of them were not built well. This rifle is one of the exceptions! It is built extremely well When I wanted to buy one I spent six month looking for just the right one and got lucky with this one. It is built well and everything checks out in spec. The folding stock is welded as well as the muzzle brake to comply with NJ law. You would have to look for a long time to find a Golani this nice.

I love this rifle and it is one of my favorite AK-47 AK47 variants. Unfortunate for me I am changing up my collection and making room for in the safe, this one just does not fit in the collection right any more. I'll probably regret selling it. For less than a thousand dollars there is no .223 AK rifle I know of now the the Russian VEPR rifles are no being brought in. The old Chinese and new Bulgarians are far more expensive. Plus, this can be easily converted to use AR15 pmags. My loss is your gain.

This rifle will come with one 30 round (pinned at 15 rounds per NJ law) and two 10 round IMI steel magazines. If you have any questions please feel free to email me."

This is from Midway's website:
The Weaver Tactical Grand Slam Rifle Scope offers fully multi-coated Japanese lenses that reduce glare and give you edge to edge clarity and exceptional low light performance with 94% light transmission. All Grand Slams feature a fast focus eyepiece adjustment ring, and sure-grip power ring that helps you adjust the variable power scopes even with heavy gloves on. Finally, the Grand Slam's solid, 1-piece tube construction makes them waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. This scope features resettable 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a Mil-dot reticle, this is also known as MIL/MIL. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the Mil-dot reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each dot is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 mils low the shooter needs to convert the Mils to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With a Mil/Mil rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 mils low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 mils or 15 clicks. The mil-dot reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is. These features are usually only found in very expensive scopes, but MidwayUSA has worked with Weaver to bring you this exclusive high quality scope at a very reasonable price. Covered by Weaver's Limited Lifetime Warranty.

I have for sale a Generation 3, Glock 23 RTF 2 with the ""fish gill"" slide serrations.  This pistol is like new in box.  Less than 250 rounds were fired when I purchased it new and it has been put away ever since.  Glock has since discontinued this pistol.  This frame and slide configuration is rare, with the model 19 being extremely difficult to find followed by the 23 and model 17.  The model 22 in this configuration is very common because of law enforcement purchases during time of production.

Keep in mind that the words ""Glock"" and ""rare"" typically do not exist in the same sentence.  If you love Glocks but don't want the same thing as the guy next to you at the range, this is a great buy!  I truly believe this is the best grip texture Glock has ever offered.

It comes with 5 factory magazines.  2 model 23 magazines and 3 G22 full size magazines.

I am not interested in trades at this time.  I will upload pictures this evening.

I have a Walther PPQ M2. I've taken great care of it. Roughly 500 rounds through it. This is the most comfortable grip on a handgun I've ever had the pleasure of holding. There are numerous reviews on the subject of ergonomics.

Turned out the factory stippling did not perform well enough for sweaty hands; I've stippled it and it came out great.

Comes with:
-TLR3 weapon light (batteries included. One installed with about 10min of usage, the other new and unused).
-Dawson Precision front fiber optic(green installed). I will include the factory plastic front sight as well.
-Kydex holster(Accelerated Solutions) IWB with sweat shield and slight forward cant for right hand
-kydex mag pouch
-two factory 15 rnd magazines
-all three backstraps


I will only sell this locally, in person, I will not ship. Be prepared to show Ohio I.D. and sign a private bill of sale, two copies, one for my personal records, one for yours. 

This is a good deal, if you bought all this stuff separately, it'd cost you pretty dang close to a thousand.
