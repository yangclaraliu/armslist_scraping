[I]""Pls join Moms Demand Action on Thursday 9/10 outside Sen Jeff Flake's Phx Office 2200 E Camelback Rd @ 11:30 as part of National Day Of Action""[/I]

Moms Demand Gun Safety kept the location under wraps until this morning. Previous rallies organized by the Bloomberg Bimbos had more pro than anti's showing up. Moms are attempting to keep pro 2nd demonstrators away by not revealing time and location until the last possible moment. The anti-gun rallies will be taking place in various locations across the country. Moms are getting national news coverage from the left leaning media coverage in their so called National Day of Action. 

Lets show Moms and the media what we think of their so called ""common sense"" tactics aimed at ending gun shows as we know them, restriction of magazine capacity and ultimately to confiscation. Starting with modern sporting semi-auto rifles.   

Please don't do anything foolish that will reflect badly on your fellow gun owners. Local and national news media will be attending and taking head count. Spread the message to your pro-gun acquaintances ASAP"

Included with the lower: the single piece, solid forged, non-removable, over sized for gloves trigger guard. A typical six position telescoping stock is standard, along with sling mounts allowing for single or double point sling attachment. There is even a bayonet lug just in case. All of the M&P15 Sport’s parts are interchangeable with the rest of their AR15 product line.The M&P15 Sport’s barrel isn’t an M4 cut. This cut in the barrel will allow to mount a M203 grenade launcher. This additional cut also does not help the harmonics of the barrel. We think this a advantage that will help accuracy but will ultimately come down to the ammo used. The Smith sports a full profile barrel of American 4140 Steel. The bolt carrier and gas key are chromed, and the barrel sports their Melonite coating. Smith claims that the bare bones approach has no effect on durability. There have been reviews with this rifle firing 85,000 rounds of various brands of ammunition without any visible damage to the Melonite finish. We have found this to be a very reliable platform and so have law enforcement and countless other agencies. The engineers at Smith and Wesson made a great call when deciding to reduce the cost of their AR15 by not including a forward assist most shooters don’t use forward assists often, and when they do, it can lead to a dangerous situation. When using a forward assist, there is a potential for an inexperienced shooter to use the forward assist to jam the bolt forward when it is not the right response to a jam. A forward assist on any AR15 could cause the cartridge to get super stuck in the rifle. The original Mil Spec on the AR-15 did not include the forward assist. Smith and Wesson made another good call deciding not adding a dust cover to their M&P Sport AR15. Most AR15 shooters have little or no need for a dust cover because they’re firing from safe and clean environments. The M&P Sport is mostly used at shooting ranges, hunting, etc. In this day and age everyone is looking for the best value out there and with out any doubt this is it, you are defiantly not paying for any unneccessary features on this model. 30 Round PMAG MagazineAdjustable Front and Rear Sights6-Position Telescopic Butt StockChrome-lined Gas Key and Bolt Carrier16"" Barrel 1 in 9” 4140 Steel 5.56 mm NATOReceiver 7075 T6 Aluminum Hard Coat Black AnodizedUPC: REDACTED63MFG: 811036"

The complete bolt and receiver where purchased at a Crown Point gun show sometime in 2006 or 2007.  I believe the stock (walnut, if I recall correctly) and trigger/sear parts were purchased online from Midway the same year.  I am basically looking to recover what was originally paid for the receiver/bolt alone: $250.00.  From what I can remember, the stock and trigger parts where another $200+.  Looking at walnut stock prices, and bolt+receiver prices around the net, I feel that $250 would be reasonably fair.

Also (from what I can tell in searching through online distributors offering 1903 parts), it should be fairly easy to purchase the items needed to complete the project (namely, a barrel, stock hardware such as bands/clips, sights, buttplate, and any required pins/screws/bolts).

Regarding selling this project: unfortunately I am not interested in trades at this time as I am making an effort to minimize items I will have to move with me.  Cash only, please.

I am located in Northwest Indiana (closest major intersection: Indianapolis Blvd. and Ridge Rd.) and anticipate a fair amount of flexibility in my schedule regarding making buying/purchasing arrangements. During the day can work, late evenings / early nights are preferable, and if need be I can try to swing meeting up in mornings. If buyer is not in the immediate Northwest IN area (e.g., Hammond, Munster, Highland, Dyer, Crown Point, Gary, Lake Station, etc), I may be able to meet half-way (within reason) depending on buyer's location.  Your email with your contact info will promptly receive a response with my contact info!

Thank you for your time in looking at this ad, and for your consideration!  Cheers & happy shooting/hunting!"

This is a recent production gun that has the updated rail and no hump in the middle of the trigger guard. This gun has had 500 rounds through it. Gun comes with factory box, paperwork, test target and two 15-round mags. I also have four more factory 15-round mags and four 20-round magazines. That's a total of 10! These beautiful, blued, reliable OEM mags were made by Mec-Gar for Walther.

The ""AS"" pistols give the shooter 3 trigger modes to choose from. They can be fully decocked into DA/SA mode (striker down). The gun can also be left pre-cocked after chambering, leaving the trigger in AS mode (SA trigger with light take up). The gun can also be placed in fully cocked mode for a short, crisp trigger pull with a light reset (think Glock, M&P, PPQ, etc.). It has adjustable sights and interchangeable backstraps. These guns were way ahead of their time, and in some ways they still are. These guns are triple proof marked and their build quality rivals that of H&K.

The P99s can usually be had for just under $600. There's close to $300 in additional mags here, which you can see for yourself if you shop around.

I'm looking to trade this pistol face-to-face in Tampa Bay."

First is a very fine revolver, serial #172XXX, with good bluing, only a little holster rub (1/4""x1/16"") on the left side, barely half that much on the right side) and a small dent on the left grip.The dent does not push through the stain. 

 No other nicks or scratches on the metal or the stocks, and no indications at all of rebluing, including no factory marks.

Sellers often throw around the 95% figure which is a high very bar, but this 29 is close to that. It has been fired in the past, judging by the recoil plate, but has been handled very carefully.

Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.Specifications:Caliber .40SWRecoil System Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSights Fiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat RearWeight (with Empty Magazine) 26 ozs. w/ Compact Mag, 27 ozs. w/ X-Tension™Height 4.75"" w/ Compact Mag, 5.5"" w/ X-Tension™Slide Forged Steel, Melonite® FinishBarrel 3"" Hammer ForgedLength 6.25""Grip Width 1.19""Frame Black PolymerMagazines 1 - 9 Round Compact, 1 - 12 Round w/ X-Tension™, Stainless SteelIs this firearm legal in your state?

IO inc Description from their site:
We are proud to present our classic, no nonsense, standard, true to its heritage, ALL US MADE rifle of our AK small arms family, all chambered for the popular and easy to acquire 7.62x39 cartridge!

These guns are built on original Polish blueprints, which present the Cadillac of Warsaw Pact small arms manufacturing! Guaranteed!! NO crooked sights and other inferior blemishes as you will find in equally priced imports of the competition! All our guns are proudly made on NEW machinery and not on worn out 60 year old “artifacts” on which the competition builds their guns!  

As the M247 rifle, the M247-C ( for “Classic) is equipped with bolt hold open, buffer, nitrated barrel and accepts all standard AK & RPK magazines from 30-75 rounds.

To keep it “classic” we built this one with nice to look at, laminated wood furniture. We also mounted a precision machined scope mount rail on the left side of the receiver to ensure it takes all of your gadgets!

These features, together with the rugged design of the AK system and the superior, unmatched US craftsmanship of our factory offer you a product which speaks for itself!"

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable.Sorry, not interested in trades.  Buyer pays exact shipping or sales tax.  All FFL rules and regs apply.www.copsgunshop.netLike us on Facebook at C.O.P.S.

""The Definitive Arms 5.56mm AK is one of the most exciting products we offer. The base rifle is a standard Molot VEPR 5.56mm AK rifle that features a Russian made cold hammer forged chrome lined barrel. Definitive Arms installs their patented AR15 magazine conversion on the rifle and refinishes it with their extremely durable Black Finish Treatment (7 process parkerized finish). The barrel is threaded and trued to the bore with a standard 1/2×28 thread making the rifle suppressor ready. The DA magazine conversion allows the rifle to use any standard 30 or 40 round magazine or Surefire 60 or 100 round magazines. With the DA conversion the bolt locks open on the last round fired and it features a bolt release for quick reloads. If you’re familiar with the AR15 you will find the controls of the DA conversion to be quite natural.

The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack from Springfield Armory® does exactly that. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack.The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack is a mid-sized single stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. The sub-compact frame extends to full size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine. Combined with the 4.0″ barrel, this gives you a pistol that’s ideal for a day at the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.But the strengths of the XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with a flush fitting magazine, and you’ll find that your range pistol has shrunk into something that carries so easily that you’ll forget it’s there.Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power or size. And you certainly don’t have to take a gun to the range that you’d rather not even shoot. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack  in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL Rules and Regs apply.  Buyer pays exact shipping or sales tax.Purchase ANY NEW Springfield Armory Firearm before 12-31-2015 to be eligible for the Gear Up and Go promotion.www.copsgunshop.net"

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.- See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-s-3-3-45-acp/#sthash.KkTJEKzk.dpufPurchase ANY NEW Springfield Armory firearm before 12-31-2015 and be eligible for the Gear Up and Go Promotion!www.copsgunshop.netLike us on Facebook at C.O.P.S.

The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment to radically dehorn the pistol. 

This package includes:
- 2 compact Sig 1911s (these have a commander-length slide and officer-size frame)
- 4 Sig 1911 7-rd magazines (stainless)
- 2 Wilson Combat 10-rd magazines (black)
- Leather IWB tuckable holster
- Blackhawk IWB mag holster
- All original boxes and paperwork.

Here are the features of these 1911s:
Bi-tone Nitron finish
Novak low-profile night sights
Checkered front strap (25-lpi)
Checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi)
Flared magwell
Slim profile custom G10 grips. 
Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

This pair was manufactured in July 2013, and the serial numbers end in -06 and -09.
MSRP on these bad boys is $1,170. My LGS--a preferred dealer--sold them to me at $924.99 apiece ($1,850+tax). Now asking just $1,600 for the pair (or $850 if only purchasing one). I put exactly 50 rounds (one box) through each.

Additionally, shortly after purchase I sent one of the pistols back to Sig Sauer for them to work it over. Their gunsmiths polished the feed ramp and installed a long ejector, then test fired an additional 50 rounds. I also have the receipt for this. That custom work, plus all the accessories, you will get for far less than the price of the pistols alone!

Face to face only; willing to travel reasonable distance in UT. I am active duty military, and come from a smoke-free home. Buyer must have good guy IDs and be willing to sign a bill of sale.
Thanks for looking. God bless."

The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government's need. The Daniel Defense RIS II M4A1 FSP feature a cut-out in the top rail to accommodate a standard front sight base on a carbine-length gas system.

This rifle is in original condition and came drilled/tapped for a scope and without open sites from the factory.

Yes, the rifle has some wear on the bluing and the action screws are a bit buggered up, however, you can get new action screws from Brownells for about $20 (it never bothered me as the rifle is just fine the way it is).

Rifle shoots well the first few shots, till it gets warm, and is zeroed with the Burris Fullfield II that it comes with.  Rifle comes with 80+ rounds of factory loaded 150 grain ammo.

I've had this rifle for a few years and hate to sell but need money.  I am firm at $400 as I have at least $600 into the package ($50 rings/base, $200 scope, $80 ammo).
