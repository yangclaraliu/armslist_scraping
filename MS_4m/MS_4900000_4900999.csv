This is NOT a black powder weapon, this shoots the cartridge 45 Long Colt. I hope someone will be able to enjoy it themselves or give it as a gift to someone who likes antique style weapons.

Had it professionally cleaned and cerakoted. All original parts minus the grips. All serial numbers match and proof marking visible! 
   Here's what I know, the reason this isn't a $2500 gun, is because the first few serial numbers on the slide were worn down. So in order to be sold it had to be re-stamped. This is also way I decided to have it cerakoted. As mentioned, it was in pretty rough shape. I spoke with several gunsmiths and the general consensus was the value had been reduced by the re-stamping, and having it cerakoted wouldn't reduce it any further. Its still a fully functioning Colt 1911. The estimated value I was given is in the $800-1000 range.

The gun was refinished before I bought it with a nice ""charcoal blue"" very similar to an older Colt blue..  Slide markings are clear, waffenampts are faint but visible, gun has some light pitting in the grooves of the bore.  Light pitting on the front strap and back strap and grip safety show patina. Numbers match on the frame and slide but the barrel is from another gun.

The gun functions perfectly.  I have never had a FTF or FTE with this gun.  Over the 20 years I have owned it I probably put 1000 rds through it.  Accuracy is perfectly acceptable for this type of handgun - 12"" plate at 25 yds is easy.

These guns are getting harder to find in any condition, and this is a chance to own an affordable piece of history that you won't be afraid to take to the range and shoot!

Talon grips which have yet to be installed.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.Features:Caliber: 9mmAction Type: DAOTrigger Pull DA: 5.5 - 6.5 lbsTrigger Pull SA: N/AOverall Length: 6.7 inOverall Height: 4.7 inOverall Width: 1.1 inBarrel Length: 3.6 inSight Radius: 5.5 inWeight w/Mag: 24.9 oz Mag Capacity: 12 RoundsNumber of Magazines: 2Sights: SIGLITE® Night SightsGrips: Interchangeable Polymer FrameFinish: Black PolymerSlide Finish: Nitron® AccessoryRail: NoOther Features: Interchangeable grip sizes and calibers"
