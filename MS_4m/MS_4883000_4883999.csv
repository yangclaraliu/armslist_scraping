I have an original World War II era Springfield Armory M1 Garand. This rifle is in amazing shape. It is chambered in 30.06 and the barrel gauge is 1, which is amazing. It has the walnut stock, which is in excellent condition for it's age. The serial number matches to a manufacture date of October 1943. I was told by the man I obtained it from that it was used by a 101st Airborne paratrooper on D-Day.

I have personally taken this rifle apart to inspect it and clean it. The stock has no internal cracks. The bolt, chamber, barrel, and internal parts all look amazing for the age of this rifle. I'm not sure why I can only post one picture, but I have more where you can clearly see that the stock has the proper ""P"" proof mark in the circle and the U.S. Military issue stamp on the side of the stock. 

I am debating selling this rifle, but other things in life are starting to come along (such as a possible wedding). I would be sad to see it go, because it really is an amazing piece of history. Imagine what this rifle has seen and done throughout it's lifetime. 

I am posting this to see if there is any real interest in my rifle at this point, and if I receive responses from seriously interested people, there certainly the chance it could be yours! Thanks for looking."

I have an original World War II era Springfield Armory M1 Garand. This rifle is in amazing shape. It is chambered in 30.06 and the barrel gauge is 1, which is amazing. It has the walnut stock, which is in excellent condition for it's age. The serial number matches to a manufacture date of October 1943. I was told by the man I obtained it from that it was used by a 101st Airborne paratrooper on D-Day.

 I have personally taken this rifle apart to inspect it and clean it. The stock has no internal cracks. The bolt, chamber, barrel, and internal parts all look amazing for the age of this rifle. The stock has the proper ""P"" proof mark in the circle and the U.S. Military issue stamp on the side of the stock. 

 I am debating selling this rifle, but other things in life are starting to come along (such as a possible wedding). I would be sad to see it go, because it really is an amazing piece of history. Imagine what this rifle has seen and done throughout it's lifetime. 

 I am posting this to see if there is any real interest in my rifle at this point, and if I receive responses from seriously interested people, there certainly the chance it could be yours! Thanks for looking."

These Mossberg tactical .22LR rifles, with the look and feel of AR-style rifles, are based on the proven 702 Plinkster® autoloader platform. The Mossberg 715T has quickly become one of the most popular tactical rimfire rifles on the market, since first introduced in 2010.
Unlike many other tactical .22s, Mossberg has differentiated themselves by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. The Mossberg 715T Tactical has A2 front and rear sights, and the carry handle includes a picatinny rail if you want to mount optics.

Most tactical .22s have a 16 inch barrel, but Mossberg decided to go with an 18 inch barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard, 6 position adjustable stock and a 25 round magazine.

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.

Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is. Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 LR version holds 16 rounds.  Both will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.

I just received an HK45 in trade and these nearly new sights had been installed on it not long ago according to the original owner.  They look pretty new and are bright in the dark, but have signs of wear from their installation and removal (I had WCA gunsmith change them out).  I prefer a different set of sights with larger rear dots so I swapped these out.  They are available on Amazon here (http://www.amazon.com/Trijicon-45mm-Front-Outline-Orange/dp/B00D9SGVE4/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-5&keywords=HK45+sights) - the front sight on mine, as you can see is yellow.

Product Info: 
One of the first things a GLOCK® owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV™ builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV's Adjustable Fulcrum® Drop-In Trigger Kit components were used to set a world record. The Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.
You will immediately notice these differences in your gun's performance after installation:
The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.
Because of ZEV's proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.
The trigger's crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user's ability to ride the reset to improve follow up shot speed and placement.
The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.
The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.
Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.
The Ultimate Kit has a Skeletonized Firing Pin, the benefit is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition.
Was installed fired, unistalled and polished.

Also, I have approximately 860 rounds of Federal premium ammo that can go with for the right deal. 

This rifle has under 500 rounds through it. Just not enough time to get to the range but this is a sweet shooting rifle. This one hurts to sell. There are a few handling marks but nothing serious.

The 300 blackout reticle with merged aiming points has been optimized for simplicity and efficiency. It allows the user to instantly switch between supersonic and subsonic ammunition without having to re-zero the optic. The supersonic BDC (out to 600 yds.) has been merged with the subsonic BDC (out to 200 yds.) to provide one set of aiming points for both types of ammunition. The reticle drops are based on an average of commonly available off-the-shelf subsonic and supersonic ammunition from a 16"" barrel. This BDC reticle is not limited to one or two specific bullets: a majority of commonly available ammunition will fall within the 2 MOA diamond aiming points. The 2 MOA diamonds offer a balance of speed and versatility based on the unique performance of the 300 Blackout caliber. The drops in MOA for each aiming point are provided for users who wish to develop their own handloads for use on firearms with a barrel of 16"" or shorter, or for those who wish to deviate from the recommended zero distances.Product Includes:- 1 Flattop Mount (TA51)- 1 3.5x35 Scopecoat (TA63)- 1 LENSPEN (TA56)- 1 Lanyard Assembly for Adjuster Caps (TA71E)- 1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15)- 1 ACOG ManualSpecifications:- Magnification: 3.5x- Objective Size: 35mm- Bullet Drop Compensator: Yes- Length: 8""- Weight: 14 oz without Mount- Illumination Source: Fiber Optics & Tritium- Reticle Pattern: Crosshair with Merged Aiming Points- Day Reticle Color: Green- Night Reticle Color: Green- Calibration: 300 BLK- Bindon Aiming Concept: Yes- Eye Relief: 2.39""- Exit Pupil: 10mm- Field of View (Degrees): 5.5- Field of View 100 yards: 28.9'- Adjustment 100 yards (clicks/in): 3""- Mount: TA51- Mount Comes With: TA51- Housing Material: Forged Aluminum  Check it out Here"

It has been sent to Wilson combat for custom work. It will come with 5 mags and 1200 rounds of ammo. I posted this several months ago. And it was flagged for being overpriced. I have taken the liberty of braking down the cost of everything below so please look at the cost before you think about flagging it. 1. Beretta 96A1 (50 rounds fired.) $600 2.Wilson combat basic carry package. The trigger is so smooth and so much lighter it must be felt to be appreciated.  Wilson fiber optic front sight. Wilson G10 grips. $460 3. two extra mags. 10 round and 12 round. $60 4.Beretta skeletonized hammer. Beretta metal extended mag release. $75 5. 900 rounds of Federal HST. 300 rounds of Federal Hydra Shok. 20 rounds of Federal Guard dog. $760. 6. A total value of $1955. That is taking into account it is technically a used gun. Also I have dropped the value on the magazines. I also left out shipping costs and sales tax. I am asking $1300. I believe this is more than a fair price. I may be willing to do a deal without the ammo. Buyer must have PTP or CCW. Email with any questions and thank you for your time.

I purchased the rifle and all the alterations listed were performed by myself. This is an amazing rifle if you have never had the opportunity to fire one. The M1 Garand was the primary rifle issued to infantry during WWII and the beginning of Vietnam. It was replaced by the COLT M16A1. These rifles are truly wonders of war and are considered by a variety of men and women, as well as myself, among the ranks of the top line firearms. I truly wish you enjoy the Garand; and for those who enjoy the relic they truly are, the full original walnut stock will accompany this rifle.

The Type I uses the same 6.5mm JAP round that the Type 38 rifles used, and is built with many similarities to the Type 38 long rifle, except that it never had a ""mum"" stamped them and that these rifles were outfitted with a ""carcano"" type bolt action.

I bought this gun used, so I can't speak for the round count for the entire life of the gun. As for myself, I've put about 200 rounds through it since I acquired it about a year and a half ago.

As far as I know, the person who I bought it from said the finish wear was done by him as he used to use it as his EDC gun, so it's just holster wear. It was NOT a duty weapon as the guy who I bought it from was the original owner and not a LEO. 

Aside from the wear on the slide and a few tiny blemishes that appear from it having been an EDC gun, I'd say that it's in pretty good shape for its age, IMHO.

That's pretty much all the information I can provide in regards to the history of the piece. 

The gun currently has the Hogue 93179 grips installed on it and will also come with the Farrar Beretta grips as shown in one of the pictures.

The gun has been properly maintained and functions as it should.

Gun has been shot maybe 20 times, it's ideal for anyone into big bore revolvers and great for hunting!  Comes with scope mount and two sets (medium and high) of fiber optic front sights that are interchangeable between red and green, plus the standard black ramp front sight too.

These are really nice guns, without question they're nicer than any Ruger single action.  From the factory it has a hand lapped barrel, recessed cylinders (it's a 5 shot), a free spinning cylinder, a locking base pin, drilled and tapped for scope use and has a good trigger on it too.  Recoil is there but due to it's size and heft, it's really not that bad.  Also shoots .45 Colt ammo, which through this gun is about like shooting a .22.

The gun is very nice, shoots extremely well and is practically brand new, I just don't shoot it, you could call it a safe queen. These run new at Buds for around $950 before tax and two extra front sights run over $50, but I'm asking $775 OBO for a practically new gun and a few extras.  Also comes with a soft MidwayUSA zip up case.

These triggers are back order only and only come in stock from time to time. 

The trigger bar is almost identical to a standard OEM bar but the shoe is where the magic is. Very short reset and a great curve to the front that allows IMO a much better trigger press. 

This trigger is very easy to install and fits majority of Glocks. The last picture posted shows all the models it will fit.
