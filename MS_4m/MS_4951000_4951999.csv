 I deployed to Japan years ago and left this pistol with my father to put in his safe. He did so, however he did not remove it from the crappy pistol carrier I had stored it in for traveling. When I returned I opened the case and some pitting had occurred (see pics). This pistol is no longer collectible, however it is still an excellent shooter and I have not shot it in years. It has roughly 150 rnds through it. I had planned on doing some hunting with it but never did. Deserves to go to someone who will use it and thought I'd post here prior to Armslist or Gunbroker.

It locks up tight and is a very accurate revolver.  Serial number 163xxx.  Currently I have Hogue grips on it, but it comes with the original wood grips.  There are minor wear marks on the barrel, with one noticeable ding right in front of the ejector rod.  Otherwise this gun is in great condition.

Great gun, the only problem I have ever had is that sometimes 357 casings are fairly hard to extract after firing.  I have cleaned all chambers, and have had no other problems with this gun."

It also includes the Colt manual and all the paperwork. I recently acquired this and although this is a outstanding weapon, I'd rather have a Super Match M1A. This weapon has been shot very little. Someone out there has a Super Match M1A sitting in a gun safe and would rather have a Colt snake gun. I will entertain other offers but please don't be offended if I am not interested in your offer. To save some time, I already have more AR15s than I need. I am also not interested in your black powder, crossbow, scooter, or magic beans.
