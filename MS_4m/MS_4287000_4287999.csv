For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  M6-22’s winning factor is the choice of materials: the whole structure is made of steel, but the weight of the stock has been almost eliminated. A metal caging encases a preformed polypropylene foam stock, with a very durable and thick weft, ensuring excellent comfort. By simply pressing a lever , the rifle can be bent in two, reaching a total length of 18.5 ” – that is, the length of the barrel – to be easily carried in a backpack. All the details are studied to obtain maximum flexibility and practicality. The stock is ergonomic and has a housing for ammunition and the maintenance/cleaning kit. The front sight is optical fiber and the rear sight is adjustable in elevation and windage to fit the gauge used. The gun is supplied with three picatinny quad rails which allow you to mount your favourite accessories.   We have 1 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $399 each.

This is the PPK, not the PPK/S. It's the model made from Interarms and comes with the original case, 2 magazines both with pinky extension, as well as the original manual. It does show some slight scratches but appears to be in overall good condition for its age. I got this gun at auction but have decided against it. The only thing that appears to be wrong with it is the decocker portion of the safety does not work. I'm sure this could be fixed by a gunsmith if need be. This type of thing appears to be a fairly common topic with these firearms. I'm open to trades and offers. It is chambered in .380 and is the stainless version. It would make an awesome collectible for anybody who is familiar with this firearm."

I'm asking $700 firm for the gun and all the upgrades to it. This is much less than what it cost to build. 

Would prefer a straight cash sale. Only trade I would be interested in is a Gen 4 Glock in 9mm plus the appropriate amount of cash. 

This gun is in excellent shape. The gun has been dura coated in OD Green. Here are some of the extras that are currently installed on it.

It's a Parker Hale Safari 30-06 out of the 70's. Has all original iron sights, action, stock, etc... The bluing and steel of the rifle is in excellent shape, the receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mount, rifling and chamber are in beautiful condition, there are a few character knocks on the wood of the stock, just a few light blemishes in the finish, but doesn't go as deep as into the wood, not nearly what you'd expect out of a 40 year old rifle though. There is a small chip out of the stock near the back of the receiver, and the factory butt pad is in ""roughish"" condition, but it has a brown slip on recoil reducer over it. Comes with soft case, mid-height scope rings, and a box of core lockt ammo. It's extremely nice rifle, but I'm not a hunter nor a collector of rifles. So I think someone else could appreciate it and put it to better use than I. $400 cash/trade, really looking for a carry pistol an m&p shield, ruger sr9c/sr40c, or something along those lines, but not really a fan of Taurus, but will look at all pistol offers.

(suspension front arm lower ball joint makes noises when you turn left). There was a toggle switch installed for the heat which works on high only. AC probably won't work for long if at all. Both front windows won't always roll back up. They roll down but half the time won't go back up. There are small dents and a scrape on the passenger side. The front driver's side wheel cover is missing. driver's side head light is out. I put a brand new battery in it right before my wife decided to buy a different car. it's got cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power steering, tilt wheel, dual air bags, am/fm with cassette deck, I'm sure there are most of the receipts for everything that she had done (down to the oil changes) in the glove compartment right next to the manual.

History;
Assembled in 1989 as a Bush Rifle from SAI, it came with USGI Parts and had roughly 200 rounds   when it was put into the previous owner’s safe in 1990. It sat there until I bought it 3 years ago when the owner’s son was tasked with selling what was in the safe. I put 140 rounds through it one day and it sat for 3 years until I had the money to do the build. I have had it sitting since the build and have not fired it yet. It was only test fired as the final step of the build."

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).
P938 Package Overview
Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.
X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser
The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz.

If some idiot wants to sell you a Wilson Combat, LB, EB, Nighthawk Custom...ect. For any amount for $1500 and under IT IS A SCAM!!!! Anyone who knows the least bit of information pertaining to custom/semi-custom 1911's will know that they will at the very least cost you $2500 or so used. Do not send these fools any money! 

Also, if the same idiot wants you to send him or her a check by money order and in turn he or she will send you the weapon , DONT DO IT!  It is a scam. If they insist that they are legit then have them send the prospective weapon to a FFL of your choice before you send your hard earned cash. The FFL will not release the weapon to you without authorization from the seller. Hence the seller will then need the money. That way you know that the weapon is legit, you are following the rules set by the state of MD and you will not get scammed. The sellers will rarely agree to this because they never had the weapon in the first place. SHOCKER!

We have all worked very hard to protect and defend our 2nd amendment and the last thing we need is some idiot trying to take advantage of it.

The second rifle is a AR-7 Industries Explorer Survival rifle. The AR-7 Explorer was designed by M-16 inventor Eugene Stoner witch I think is cool. These are not made anymore. AR-7 Industries model is made with solid steel barrels much heavier duty than the AR-7 barrels by Armalite, Charter or Henry. It comes with the factory 8 round magazine and a very hard to find expensive 15 round magazine.

I really would like to trade them more than sell them. Depending on the deal I also have a brick of 500 22LR bullets that could go with them. Also depending on the deal is who will pay for the transfer.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab. The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.  The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.FAMILY:PF-9 SeriesMODEL:PF-9TYPE:Semi-Auto PistolACTION:Double Action OnlyFINISH:BlueSTOCK/FRAME:Polymer FrameSTOCK/GRIPS:OD Green PolymerCALIBER/GAUGE:9mmCAPACITY:7+1# OF MAGS:1MAGAZINE DESC:7 RoundBARREL:3.1""CALL OR TEXT FOR INFO: REDACTEDSOUTHERN MISSOURI GUNWORKSGUNSMITH SERVICESCERAKOTE FINISHES APPLIEDNEW AND USED FIREARMSFFL TRANSFERSWE WILL SHIP TO YOUR FFLCREDIT CARDS GLADLY ACCEPTEDPRICE LISTED IS CASH PRICE / CC ADD 3%SALES TAX WILL BE ADDED TO IN STATE SALES"

Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch larger than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.FAMILY:XD SeriesMODEL:XD MOD.2 Sub-CompactTYPE:Semi-Auto PistolACTION:Double Action OnlyFINISH:BlackSTOCK/FRAME:Polymer FrameSTOCK/GRIPS:Black PolymerCALIBER/GAUGE:9mmAPACITY:13+1# OF MAGS:2MAGAZINE DESC:One 13 rd. & One 16 rd.BARREL:3""OVERALL LENGTH:6.25""SIGHTS:3-Dot SightsADDL INFO:Dbl Mag Pouch & Belt HolsterADDL INFO:Magazine LoaderADDL INFO:Cable LockCALL OR TEXT FOR INFO: REDACTEDSOUTHERN MISSOURI GUNWORKSGUNSMITH SERVICESCERAKOTE FINISHES APPLIEDNEW AND USED FIREARMSFFL TRANSFERSWE WILL SHIP TO YOUR FFLCREDIT CARDS GLADLY ACCEPTEDPRICE LISTED IS CASH PRICE / CC ADD 3%SALES TAX WILL BE ADDED TO IN STATE SALES"

-custom built, beautiful full rifle with select parts collected over years finally put together spring of 2014, with only the factory test rounds fired though the barrel at dpms. since then i cleaned, oiled and bag/stored it. Never fired it. doesn't have sights or scope. This is a bench gun/long distance tack driver. A real heavy weight with the barrel and ss lower. If serious please get a hold of me at REDACTED. no trades 

***dpms .223, 20'' super bull barrel, Recessed Target Crown for muzzle protection and superior accuracy, while its extra heavy 1.10"" Diameter Contour is ideal for bench rest shoors as it moves extra weight to the front end of the rifle for faster shot-to-shot recovery. 1x9 twist, Tefloned, The barrel required special aluminum gas block and straightening of gas tube. (stopped producing barrels and gas blocks after 2009)

***dpms stainless steel lower receiver. This lower is very strong (machined from milled stainless steel) and would make an ideal .50 caliber lower should you want to do add another caliber to the frame. Had it tefloned same time as barrel. the lower is stamped from Becker, mn. (pre-2004 before the move to st.cloud,mn shop, now there planing on going to Alabama soon) and with an awesome serial number for (1,000) its a collector for someone.
