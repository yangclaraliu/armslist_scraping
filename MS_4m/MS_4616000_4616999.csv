Kentucky Rifle/Hunter Flintlock kit model # KA706.  This is a nice octagonal 33.5 inch barrel that has never been shot.  Long story short my father received as a gift approx. in 1980/81 but my parents shortly divorced after receiving.  It was forgotten about for years tucked away in a closet til I inherited it a few years ago.  I built the kit but I never ""got into"" blackpowder shooting since I am only a modern firearms/military enthusiast.  It became a wall hanger only but need to make room and now I want to see it go to someone who will shoot and appreciate it.  From CVA this was a .45 caliber rifled barrel but shoots .440 ball ammo with a.015"" patch,  I guess you do not shoot conicals or sabot's with these rifles.  All CVA side lock kit blackpowder firearms were discontinued over 15 years ago.  Deer Creek and Dixie Gun Works and Track of the Wolf have blackpowder items as do major retailers like Cabela's or Gander Mountain.  With this type you can make ""fancier"" and you may need re-finishing to your liking.  I am including a 2nd edition Black Powder Guide from 1976 that is very informative for the shooter including blackpowder history, etc.  Rifle is complete.  You just need flint, leather or lead wrapping for the flint and the powder and balls to be ready to shoot.  Barrel #is 045699.  I am asking $200 cash because it has never been fired, all sales are final.  I am also throwing in a tube of ""Bore Butter"".  I can travel within 50 mile radius of Green Bay to an agreed upon public meeting site for any transactions.  At this point I am not interested in shipping it.  I may consider trades if you tell me what firearm or firearm accessories or ammunition you have that would be an approximate equivalent value trade."

It is a full choke in 12 ga that was manufactured a very very long time ago. 

It fires fine but there is an issue that you need to be aware of, the action arm brazing, being most likely over a century old, broke a while back and i have not used this shotgun since except to test the function after it broke. It works fine but the process of locating a new action arm is not something I am interested in. This shotgun has a dark patina is is not a collectors piece unless you appreciate the history that this gun has seen. 

The price is $350 but if you want to trade for partial cash or a pistol or something talk to me i'm sure we can work something out. I am open to trades but I am looking for cash to purchase my girlfriend a gift in the form of a pistol or semi-auto rifle so keep that in mind when you make offers.

Lee Precision Carbide .38 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), .38 Super 3-Die Pistol Set uses a solid carbide insert ground to a special contour that does not leave the objectional belt mark on the cases, common to the ordinary carbide dies. A Carbide Full Length Sizing Die is a must if you are reloading for more than one firearm or reloading cases that were fired in other firearms. No case lube is needed, and you don't have to clean your cases.

Taper crimp dies are used to correct problems caused by the improper expanding plug design or adjustment. They distort the bullet shank and reduce accuracy. The Powder Thru Expanding Die charges the case while expanding the mouth. All of the flare is removed with the Bullet Seating Die. Thus eliminating the need for a tapered crimp die."

MPW 16"" Inch Barrel URX III Rail 5.56x45 Nato Advanced Armament Corp. MPW 16"" Inch Barrel URX III Rail 5.56x45 Nato Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16” and 12.5” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included. The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.Caliber: 300 AAC BLACKOUTLength: 16"""

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

Desert Eagle.  She comes with four 9-round magazines, Hogue grips (installed), the original factory grips, and hard case.  This gun is great fun to shoot, I just find that I am favoring rifles more lately so it is time to free up some funds.  The recoil is really not bad because as we all know this is not a light gun.  Unlike its bigger brothers the 357 DE is very manageable, and I have found that with the right ammo this one cycles very well.  The best factory rounds I have run into are PMC 158 gr. She is in overall good condition though there are a few minor scratches, nothing that hurts functionality or overall appearance.  Being the only gas operated handgun out there, this gun is a great conversation starter at the range and makes an excellent addition to any collection.

It's Sig quality and runs like a top, has some holster wear but nothing unusual. Has night sights, 2 mags, a quantity of ammo, and some fitted holsters (SHTF IWB, Don Hume OWB, DeSantis ankle). The only thing ""wrong"" with it is that it comes with Hogue grips and I cut off the front finger grooves section because they did not fit my hand well, but new Hogue grips can be had for $15-20 on eBay and many other retailers.
I'm primarily interested in trading for a quality pocket gun, looking for a Sig P238, Colt Mustang, Glock 42, can also add a little cash for a P938. Would also be interested in quality snub wheelguns, a Walther PPS, and I also like CZ75 pattern stuff. Will entertain other reasonable offers though.
Otherwise will sell for $550, pretty firm on price, the holsters alone are a $100 value. FTF Wichita area, have CCL and can sign bill of sale if desired. Pm me or send me a txt to REDACTED"

There is an AR-style carrying handle with a slide-up rear notch sight, front assembly with a post sight. It’s also equipped with three Weaver rails on the gun to accommodate optics, lights, lasers, different grips and even a bipod, if you want.

The gun is a Black Rain Fallout 10 with a mega arms MA Ten match barrel 18"", swfa super sniper 10x42 scope of Nikon p series mounts, comes with a ten round pmag and a 25 Rd pmag. Only shot 50-75 rds through it, have to rezero with new mounts, shot very nice groups with federal gold metal match 168gr. Pics show old rings that are no longer on it.

I have around 120 rounds through it; just enough to finish my load testing. Story is I went to school in the U.P. When I graduated I moved down to the Detroit area for my job and well... shooting here is pretty damn difficult. 

Gun has a 10x56 IOR Valdada scope. This is a fixed scope and not the illuminated version. Has the sun shade. Information can be seen here: http://www.valdada.com/10x56-30mm-tactical-scope-standard-mp-8-reticule/

Gun uses Seekins Precision rings and to be honest I don't remember anything about the base. But it's a standard base, no rise.

Also included is a harris bipod in the tilit version and a Boyt hard case with wheels which is very handy cause this is a heavy setup. 

With my hand loads, which are in the standard range of powder load for the bullet, I can achieve under 1/3 MOA at 100 yrds using the bipod and a sweatshirt as a rear rest. I'm really not that good of a shot... They say you might get lucky with a factory barrel and i think it's safe to say i got lucky. And this is using used brass and a lee reloading set. Not high dollar stuff folks.

Haven't touched the gun in any way (modifications). Trigger is set to what it was when it came from the factory. Exterior of barrel is showing some very, very minor wear. Might be from the foam in the case? Stock is in great shape as well. 

Starting at $1,300. Over $2k invested.
