Turkey is one of the oldest gun makers around and their weapons are gaining popularity here in the US. CZ75 parts and mags can be used on this firearm. It comes with 2 17 round Mec-Gar mags who also make mags for Beretta and Sig. Also included is the original box, lock, manual, bore brush, and spent casing from the factory. I have put on smooth black pearl CZ75 grips which contrast nicely with the brushed stainless finish, and have the original grips that will be included as well. I have run about 400 or so rounds through it and it shoots fantastic! Accuracy is second to none and it is an all steel pistol so there is very minimal recoil so follow up shots are easy. 

I am only selling this pistol because i am switching away from 9mm to cut down on the variety of calibers I have to stock. That being said, i am including all my 9mm ammo. I have 25 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense rounds and 194 new remington factory loads.  Buds gunshop totally sold out of them as they are such a great deal compared to a CZ. I have shot this and a CZ and I would take this over the CZ even if the price was the same, but I am including over $150 in accessories and ammo.

While no parts are interchangeable with the M1911 platform, several parts â such as the slide, barrel, and recoil spring â are interchangeable with certain Glock models. While advertised to be chambered in three, separate calibers â .45 ACP , .40 S&W , and 9Ã19mm Parabellum â production models are only known to have been chambered in .45 ACP, with very few prototype models in .40 S&W. All models of the Spectre feature a match-grade 416 Stainless Steel barrel, 7075-T6 billet aluminum frame, and 20lpi scalloped slide serrations and grip contours.

The pistol was advertised as âthe safest pistol on the marketâ, due its five separate safety systems, four of which are in wide use by other firearm designs:

There is a frame mounted manual safetyâ¦a âhigh gripâ safety of the beavertail typeâ¦a drop safety that prevents the firing pin from disengaging until the trigger is fully depressedâ¦a firing pin block that disable the firing pin until external safeties are disengaged and the trigger is fully depressedâ¦

And one safety unique to the Spectre line of pistols:

â¦a âkeyed internal-locking deviceâ that is built into the bottom of the gripâ¦operated with a security key and renders the firearm completely inoperable when setâ¦to render the gun safe when stored and not in useâ¦

Despite its innovative features and âsafeâ design, the company which produced the pistol â Alchemy Arms, Co. â ran into financial troubles within a few yearsâ time and was abandoned, delaying further production and service to the Spectre line of pistols indefinitely.

When it was originally released, it was believed by many to be the true ""hybrid"" between a Glock and a 1911. In reality, it is entirely custom, but mimics the internals of a Glock (slide, barrel, bolt, take-down), with the feel and function of a 1911 (grip-safety, thumb-safety, slide release, trigger, magazine release). The magazine is a modified, 10-round EAA Witness mag. From what I can see, the only modification is a small v-shaped groove cut in the back of the top of the mag where the bolt picks up the next round.

Overall, I paid $845 for the pistol in its original box, with one magazine, instructions, and keys to unlock the integrated frame lock.The model I purchased has a titanium slide, stainless steel barrel, and anodized aluminum frame.super clean excellent condition with 1 mag, OE box and all the papers .. exceelnt gun shoots perfect super light recoil and a true collectors Item

Galco's Stinger Belt Holster is made to carry a small semi-automatic pistol behind the strongside hip. It has an open top and forward cant which will allow a fast, easy draw stroke. Safety, security, and stealth are all addressed with a covered trigger guard, deep molding, and a tunnel-style belt loop that takes up little belt space compared to a normal pancake-type holster. The Stinger is constructed of black premium saddle leather and fits belts up to 1.5 inches wide.

Comes with the 6"" pinned barrel and a six round recessed cylinder. The barrel ends are fantastic and there is very little holster wear and some slight freckling from storage. This gun has a serial number of S243XXX and has been researched to be manufactured in 1965. The gun is in very nice condition for being fifty years old. The Eagle target grips are relieved, and they come with silver medallions. They show very nicely and the rich wood contrasts beautifully with the bead blasted top strap and blue frame finish. The finish on all the model 28's top straps have been bead blasted to deflect any glare in bright conditions. The condition of the bluing is very well preserved with only the most limited signs of age. Smith & Wesson released this model as a lesser option variant of the 27 and quickly became a favorite among service personnel and those in the line of duty. This 28-2 also features the checkered semi Target Hammer with a serrated Trigger and both have been finished with distinctive case hardened coloring. If you ever had the desire to add one of these to your collection of fine iron, I got a 6"" for your consideration. All engineered mechanics on this model 28-2 function perfectly, and as with all Smith & Wesson revolvers of this generation, she comes pinned and recessed. This revolver carries a very rich tradition and has a strong following by those individuals that were looking for function over form. All business all day long. This highway Patrolman honors all those American servicemen and women who dedicated so much in the line of duty. $600"

I bought it used from the previous owner who had basically broke in the gun, but I'm unsure of how many rounds were fired previously.

It is definitely the most accurate handgun I own, and I really don't want to sell it but the honest truth is that its a shelf queen and that's not what it should be.

These are commonly sold for north of $1000. Its got a few cosmetic flaws but its a solid performer.

This does come with daylight cover and I will try to locate the eye shield(no promises on eye sheild). This pvs4 has seen some use and has nicks and dings but everything is funtional. Reticle is a standard m16/M203 but can be replaced by other reticle if you'd like. This optic is great for coyote or hog hunting in low lume conditions. Back this optic up with a long range IR light and you can shoot out to great distances. Not in a hurry to get rid of this thing, I may be interested in trades for a remington 870 or mossberg 590 WITH a (sub)compact revolver or  (sub)compact semi auto and cash. Will ship and only accept Paypal. Cash is king"

I intended to using the rifle for a series of hog hunting trips that never came about, so I re-purposed the rifle as a bench shooter. It's a great shooter, as you'd expect from LaRue. Unfortunately, since purchasing an LMT MWS, it doesn't do much but sit in my safe. 

This rifle does not come with the LaRue MBT, rather it comes a Geissele trigger. I purchased this rifle before LaRue introduced the MBT. Despite LaRue's picture, irons are not included with the rifle (they don't come with them NIB).

-A Bushnell TRS-25 red dot optic, which has been sighted in at 50 yards. Manual included.

-Eight 30 round magazines and two 42 round magazines.

-A Manticore Arms brass deflector. It can be easily snapped onto or removed from the rifle.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot âtwo-finger gripâ frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot âtwo-finger gripâ frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

The title says it, this is a carry package for sale/trade. What I have is a lightly used Glock 27 with several extras. First off, it comes with a lightly used Lone Wolf 9mm barrel which has run 100%. I also have the stock Glock barrel as well. As far as the add ons and extras, I have Truglo TFO night sights installed, pierce grips on the 9 round .40 magazines, a Glock 23 magazine and a Glock 22 magazine. In case you are wondering, the .40 mags WILL run 9mm ammo which is a huge plus. Truthfully the reason I am selling/ trading this package is due to wrist issues not allowing me to shoot as frequently as well as wanting to explore new avenues in shooting. I do welcome any serious offers or buyers/ trades. Ideally I would like to have a 9mm handgun. Again thank you for taking a look at this advertisement and I will respond either via email or phone and hope to be in touch with you soon. If interested, I can send more photos your way, so just ask. Thank you and have a nice day. REDACTED"

 This is a quick run down of the details of this rifle as I believe to be true:

 Now to the tough stuff, history and provenance. I know very little about these rifles but I do know some individuals that do, one in particular, that has knowledge of these rifles and I have his opinion of the rifle's origin.  I trust his word and he has spent a good bit of his time just to help me out in finding information based on markings and numbers.  In any case this is what I believe to be the history with this rifle.

It appears that it is a kit from a South African manufactured FAL that was issued to the Rhodesian Army. That is where the RA comes in one the bolt. They are a lot like the FN/Imbel. The Rhodesian FN FALs were popular rebuilds several years ago. Several companies were able to get the kits for a short while. Most of the ones you see have been painted to match the Rhodesian Army camouflage theme. It is rare that you see one that has not been painted. This is a fine example of one and whoever built it did this several years ago and it appears to be very well done."
