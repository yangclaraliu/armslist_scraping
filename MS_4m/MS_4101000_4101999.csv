Just picked up a P226 in .357 Sig so unfortunately this one has to go. I am more interested in selling than trading but will listen to offers. It has night sights, but they are starting to dim a little. Includes original box (not shiny either, but it's a box). Also comes with 3 12 round magazines, also well used but recently replaced springs and followers.

The TLS consists of a series of three connectors that allow a simple, tool-free method of switching stocks, fore-ends and recoil pads for any conceivable shotgun application. From a rugged tactical platform to a foul-weather hunting tool to a compact home defense gun, just one receiver does it all.Flex system stock options include a tactical pistol grip and three all-purpose synthetic stocks in black or a choice of two camo patterns, each with a different fixed length of pull. Plus, there’s a six-position tactical stock and even a hunting/sporting stock with an adjustable comb. They all lock securely to any Flex system M500 (or M590) receiver via a rigid, metal-to-metal, quick-detachable TLS interface. And you can further adjust the length of pull by choosing one of three different snap-on/snap-off Flex system recoil pads in three different thicknesses. This allows for even more custom fit depending on the shooting applications, the amount of outerwear and the shooter’s stature. These attach to the stock via the second of the three new TLS latching systems. Flex system synthetic fore-ends range from tactical railed design to standard field and hunting shapes in black and various camo patterns so you can configure your gun to any purpose—on the fly, without tools—using the third TLS mounting mechanism. Comes with everything in the box from the manufacture.For products under $520 final selling price, the buyer will pay for shipping , $20 for handguns shipped via FedEx 2nd day air, $30 for long guns shipped via FedEx Home Delivery standard ground shipping.

BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore.This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.

This has a 2.5 Lb professionally tuned trigger. The barrel has been shortened to 16.5 inches and threaded. It has a Fortis RED compensating brake that is removable to add a suppressor. Has had a full action and trigger job including an accurized polished bolt. The bore has been polished and the barrel has been hand lapped for accuracy. The stock is textured desert tan and black with sling swivels added. It currently has a Leupold 3-9x40 with Leupold rings and butler creek flip up caps on it. Comes with a set of new Hornady dies and 300 rounds of new brass. This rifle also accepts the 17 round RIA pistol magazines. If you haven't heard of the 22 TCM caliber Google it. The factory ammo will push a 40 grain 223 bullet at 2800 FPS from the rifle and 2100+ from the pistol. You can achieve much higher velocities reloading with LIL Gun or H110 powder. The 35 grain Vmax will do 3000 FPS. I have $1100 invested in the rifle and the scope and $100 for the dies plus $200 in brass and bullets that go with it. I also have 300 45 grain Hornady hollow point bullets and some 35 grain Vmax. Will sell without the scope and dies for $325 less. Will trade for firearms and I can take PayPal if you want to go that route or need to use a credit card. Call or text me at REDACTED.

$1039.00 (MSRP)  Average Weight (lbs.): 6.5lbs  Barrel Length (in.): 20"", Overall Length (in.): 39 1/4""  Twist: 1:10 The first time you carry it in the field, you’ll understand why it’s considered one of the finest dense-cover rifles in America. Lightning-fast in close quarters and superbly accurate for the long shot, the compact, short-action Model Seven™ has been a knock-down, drag-out leader in the woods since it was introduced in 1983. Its receiver and action design are based on the Model 700&reg;  and deliver the highest level of out-of-the-box accuracy, strength and reliability in a platform that’s 2 3/8"" shorter overall and weighs just 6 1/2 lbs. (standard calibers). When you match this handy design with some of the hardest-hitting calibers known to big game – the short action magnum cartridges – you need a longer barrel. Thus, Model Seven rifles in these chamberings have a 22"" magnum contour barrel. The Model Seven&reg; Cdl is the quintessential short-action hunting rifle featuring a classically styled American walnut CDL stock and a clean satin-finished barrel (except 350 Remington® Mag; 20"" magnum contour barrel with sights). It’s chambered in a broad range of calibers from 17 Remington® fireball up to short-action magnums, for everything from varmints to big game.Key Features:2 3/8"" shorter overall length than Model 700 counterparts makes the Model Seven perfectly sized for small-statured shooters and densecover hunting situationsCompact design for fast handling in dense-cover situations Features the same legendary strength as the Model 700 action: “Three-rings-of-steel” with the bolt face, barrel and receiver encasing the cartridge headCylindrical receiver design provides a consistent bedding area in the stockAvailable in Remington Short-Action Magnum and Winchester Short Magnum calibers for the ultimate in compact magnum performance Comes with everything in the box from the manufacture.For products under $520 final selling price, the buyer will pay for shipping , $20 for handguns shipped via FedEx 2nd day air, $30 for long guns shipped via FedEx Home Delivery standard ground shipping.

This is likely the most complete collection of 'correct' components that will ever be sold for the Mk 14 Mod 0/1 as a package, and many parts have been discontinued or are not easy to obtain.

Rifle itself is approximately a 1.5-2.0 MOA (168/175 gr. FGMM) LRB action, barreled with a SEI Mk14 18"" barrel.  Hand loads brought it down to ~1 MOA, but I would still call it a 1.5 MOA shooter.  When it arrived from SEI, many regular readers of the 'Modern M14' forum may know that it shot poorly.  It has been professionally re-crowned and the op-rod guide land has been knurled to bring it down from ~8 MOA to where it sits today.  I don't feel that it can be made more precise without a barrel change.

I have divided this package into 5 groups; barreled action, Mod 0 chassis, Mod 1 chassis, tools & spares, and original USGI stock.

Excellent bore and tight action. Gun is not perfect with very minor surface handling marks, but in very good condition over all.  The main cosmetic issue is a small amount of pitting near grip and it appears someone tried to scratch it off.  It does looks like it could be polished out with some work.  I have included a pic of this issue.  NO LOCK.  PRE-LOCK Model 7 shot.

These 686+ models without lock are pretty tough to find. If your just looking for a gun that goes bang this might not be the one for you. This is a fairly collectible piece as not all that many were made in this configuration, without the lock and 7 shot, because they were only produced for a couple of years I believe.

If you haven't read reviews on this rifle, take the time to do so. Its extremely accurate (1-1.5moa) and the stock folds for easy transport on ATVs. This thing is an hog anchor! 7.62x39 lays them out instantly, and with 30rds on tap, I hope you have a big freezer!

In addition to the factory 6rd mag I have added a 7rd extended mag (which was $40) with pinky rest which makes it much more comfortable at the range. This is a great pistol I have only put 150rds of 115g fmj and 40rds of Speer gold dot 147g jhp down the pipe. This pistol has been well maintained and has had zero non-staged malfunctions so 100% reliable thus far. Its a very nice compact pistol with a great single action trigger which makes it extremely accurate for such a small package.

Digital night vision riflescope Digisight N750 is designed for observation and shooting in twilight and in the nighttime. The riflescope uses a highly sensitive CCD array (with a range of operation illumination 0.00001 - 30000 lux); the image transmitted to the high resolution display OLED (640x480 pixels) is contrasting, crisp and saturated. Thanks to the OLED display, the riflescope can be used within a wide temperature range from -20 °С to +50 °С.

The Digisight N750 is a multifunctional device featuring a number of essential options for modern hunting. The screen displays information on operation status (running time, low battery indicator, active function etc.). The menu has additional functions for image settings: gradual brightness and contrast adjustment, SumLight™ signal processing program.   The SumLight™ program automatically increases CCD array sensitivity under low light conditions.

One of the remarkable features is the possibility of zeroing the riflescope not only in the traditional manner but also using a new “one shot zeroing” method. This makes the zeroing procedure significantly faster and more convenient. The Digisight N750 is equipped with a built-in laser / IR Illuminator (780 nm wavelength, safety class 1) which considerably increases viewing range. The Weaver rail on the side of the body allows an auxiliary IR Flashlight to be attached. Basic control functions (switching on/off the riflescope and the IR Illuminator, activation of digital zoom) can be performed with the help of the included wireless remote control. The riflescope features a video output to conduct video recording to external devices without the use of additional adapters and camera or camcorders. If necessary output video signal standard can be changed from PAL to NTSC.

The Digisight N750 has one pre-loaded reticle. But the user can also upload another optional reticle from a reticle base available on our website. Color of the reticle point can be switched from red to green. The Digisight N750 is resistant to bright light exposure and features excellent operational characteristics. The riflescope can be mounted on a wide range of hunting weapons including those of large calibers (shock resistance is guaranteed if cartridges with muzzle velocity not exceeding 6000 Joules are used). 

The riflescope operates on four rechargeable batteries but can also be powered with an external power supply. External power supplies such as EPS3 or EPS5 prolong riflescope’s operation time up to 9-20 hours. The IR laser illuminator in the Digisight N750 is fully compliant with US FDA Class 1 laser eye safety requirements. You may see, in certain circumstances, a slightly grainy, non-uniform pattern when the IR illuminator is activated. This is not a fault, it is a by-product of ensuring that the IR illuminator is 100% eye safe which is the manufacturer's prime concern.

If you aren't familiar with the P5, it is an updated version of the venerable P-38, which was used by the German Army in WWII.  The P5 is known for its reliability and smooth action.  James Bond was armed with the P5 in some of his movies such as Octopussy and Never Say Never Again.

My understanding is this particular pistol was a Swiss Border Patrol weapon.  It shows a good deal of external wear, but the internals are clean with little wear.  It appears to have been ""carried a lot and shot a little"" like many police guns.

The pistol comes with custom wood grips, original black plastic grips, and a spare magazine (which are somewhat difficult to find).  No box or papers included.

Prefer a face to face transaction in the northern Kentucky area. Must be 21 y.o. Kentucky resident with proper I.D. and eligible to purchase/possess a firearm. CCDW license holder preferred.  I am willing to ship out of state to an FFL if the buyer is willing to pay shipping costs.

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds.  Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that has made the 870 legendary.
Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability.  The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.  Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a wood stock and fore-end.  
Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and Remington’s continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded pump shotguns around.  Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.  In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.

Comes with case, cleaning brush, three 15 round mags, all three back straps, manual, fired case from factory, back strap tool, gun lock and 16 rounds of Remington HP ammo.

Gun has been fired once, at the factory and the spent brass comes with the case. I received the gun in a trade and actually need the money more than I need another handgun.

Willing to meet in the Bloomington area face to face. If outside of Bloomington, the gun will have to be shipped at buyer's expense. No return policy, sold as-is.
For more information on the Gen 4 Glock 22 go to:

http://us.glock.com/products/model/g22gen4

Or email and ask me your question. Will send more photos upon request. Will do my best to fulfill your specific photo request(s). 

Only looking to trade for a Glock 20SF or Glock 20 Gen 4.

Price is $500 o.b.o. and by that I mean if you're coming in below $500 you need to bring something else to the fight.  $500 is my lowest unless you bring $450 and 10mm ammo, or $450 and something else.  Surprise me.

Lastly, the website keeps forcing me to say it is a ""revolver"" when I select Glock and .40S&W.  I am not sure why (I blame Bill Gates) but it is.  I know it is an auto.  If it is not, it is the weirdest revolver ever."
