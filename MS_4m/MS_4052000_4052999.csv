Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

This gun has been fire less than 100 rounds and comes with extended magazine (easier to grip and holding 8 rounds).  This is listed ""as new"" in perfect condition.  Yes, only one mag and extra mags will cost you about $30.00 but this is priced to sell.  Here is a litte information about the Walther PPS:

Walther firearms has always stood for quality.  The design, function and fitting of parts are typical for quality German guns. Even though materials have changed over the years the quality is still there using modern design as well as modern materials. 

The PPS designation stands for “Police Pistol Slim” since this was initially a design made for the German police as well as other police agencies. 

As far as size the PPS was the smallest design to fire the potent 9MM +P round. Since that time the Kimber “Solo” is the only other high quality 9MM in this size range. In fact the PPS is about the same overall size as the .380 Walther PPK. Not only is the size very close the weight is also very similar. The Walther PPK comes in at 20 Oz. with the PPS at 19.4 Oz. The big difference is in caliber with the PPK being a .380 acp and the PPS a 9MM capable of firing +P.

Ergonomics of the PPS is very comfortable to grip and aim. One contributor is the interchangeable back straps. The PPS comes with a small and a large back strap. The grip is also high and much closer to the barrel centerline mitigating recoil and providing a more comfortable grip when firing the pistol. The recoil is much less than ever expected considering the size and light weight of this gun.   Part of this has to do with the great ergonomics and the dual recoil springs.

The magazine release is ambidextrous and unique in design. Both release levers are mounted even with the bottom of the trigger guard on both sides. The levers are hinged on the rear so that the shooter can use either finger to depress the selected lever and eject the magazine. They are very simple and easy to activate.

The PPS trigger pull is one of the best on the market although hard to believe considering it’s a polymer pistol that is striker fired. This trigger has a short takeup and short reset. The pull is very crisp and breaks at a listed 6.1 pounds but feels more like 5 pounds. The trigger is also setup as most striker pistols with a small safety lever built into the center of the trigger as a safety feature.

Description:
The MK216 RIFLE, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, and based on the SR25 platform, has been built from the ground up as a rifle for those requiring the venerable 7.62x51 in a compact package. Utilizing PWS'S proven long stroke piston system, the MK216 greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after.  The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK216 Rifle is perfect for those wanting to suppress their MK2 rifle. The MK216 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 800 meters with varying types of ammunition. 
-QPQ ISONITED BARRELS - Using only the highest quality barrel blanks turned in house, PWS barrels are designed for the precision shooter. Our barrels are designed with a heavier profile that increases longevity and accuracy, creating a balance between weight savings and sustained durability.
-ENHANCED BUFFER TUBE- Unwilling to settle for what the industry had to offer, we designed a buffer tube that’s sturdy, quick to install and controls carrier tilt.  Machined from one piece of 6061 aircraft-grade aluminum, PWS engineers were able to pack more features into the PWS buffer tube.   
 ENHANCED Keymod Rail - A lightweight, free-floated aluminum handguard features the almost universal KeyMod interface to eliminate unnecessary weight and allow for a wide range of accessory placement.

One of them was not stored in the safe and seems to of built up some rust as can be seen in the close up picture. Over a couple months ive fired over 100 rounds through each of them and only had a couple fail to feed with the rusted one.

Lothar Walther LW-19 Barrel CMV material, 1:8 twist, Melonite, NiB barrel extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube (stainless roll pin), Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider, and Nickel Boron coated Bolt Carrier Group. The upper is designed to chew through cheap surplus ammunition. While supplies last!

Sold new here: http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=xstu4260mls

I have fired exactly 90 rounds through this upper, using a factory built Palmetto State Armory lower with a Wolff extra power hammer spring to prevent light primer strikes on the surplus 7n6 ammo.  Upper was thoroughly cleaned after firing with hot soapy water and then oiled.  The upper is flawless.  It grouped very well with the 7n6 ammo.  

Included in the deal is 7 - C-products 5.45x39 magazines.  2 of them are still in the wrap.  Also included is 1 unopened can of 1080 7n6 ammo, and 990 rounds of 7n6 from another can.  Basically 2 full cans minus the 90 rounds fired.  I will include 2 of the extra power hammer springs as well.  

I have decided that I don't need so many AR15 calibers, so I'm cutting back a little bit.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell.

Federal and other manufacturers produce xm855 a.k.a. m855 5.56nato ammo using a steel core penetrating ss109 bullet. This is same ammo possibly with minor defects ammo that the military uses.  The important thing here is that bafte is banning this ammo. The ban has not yet gone into effect, but almost for certain will next month.  Please do an internet search to find more info on your own. Unfortunately most retailers are now either out of stock or have majorly increased their prices to gouge people like you and me. 
Strangely enough the cheapest place for the most part to find this ammo is on gunbroker.com where prices have quickly leveled out to about .50$ a round.  If you look at auctions that start out low and end at late night times are the best deals.
  To find the worst possible deal just look here on armslist as sellers are looking to get nearly $1 around! That is flipping crazy (pun intended). Do not support that. Support any retailers that have kept their prices normal (.40-.50$ a round). Or the non-secondary market sellers on gunbroker. The flipping idiots on gunbroker are easy to spot by their low feedback scores or the crappy pics of the items sitting on their couch/living room floor, etc.  Look for sellers with a several hundred or more feedbacks and of course decent prices.
  Please do your own research online. Our government is doing us another favor by banning another item related to our sport/hobby without any vote by the people. This is not new and is becoming the norm. If you like this ammo, you might want to look to purchase some now as it will be gone for good soon I am afraid. Your choice ammo/ shooting platform may be next so yes this is everyone's problem.
I don't need a bunch of emails telling me how right or wrong I am. Please do your own research to obtain your own opinion. The fact is this ammo still can be had for the 50 cent neighborhood. Don't support the douche that is asking a dollar a round telling you how cheap that is, you cant find it anywhere, etc. 
Good ammo hunting and safe shooting as always."

The CORE series is a competition ready pistol with elevated sights and the slide already cut to be optics ready. This particular pistol also has a stainless steel guide rod to go along with the stainless slide and barrel. This is the full size model with a 4.5 inch barrel and comes with all of the factory goodies including the original box/docs/lock, 3 back straps, and 2 17 round magazines. Since I intended to use this in competition, it also has an Apex sear in place, and the trigger bar has a nice slick polish job by a licensed gun smith. This makes the trigger break at a crisp 3.1 lbs as measured by their trigger gauge. I have personally put about 100 rounds through the pistol, but can no longer compete just yet as I will be moving soon. There is a small amount of holster wear on the slide that you can see in the picture, but that is merely from drawing practice. To make up for this, I'll keep the magazines fully loaded for you.

2.  He just created his Armslist account as of today which in my opinion shows he has never been a supporter of this forum but now wishes to reach out to the shooting  community through Armslist just to over charge people during a so called ammo scare.

People like this really hurt the shooting community.   Please take a stance against people like this.   Here is his listing below,

811,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4052811,"For Sale:  Scope with long eye relief, Mosin nagant Mount and scope rings.","Grant, AL, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 150,"Listed On: Friday, February 20, 2015",Optics,Rock Island Armory                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a scope mount for the Mosin Nagant 91/30, (designed only for the 91/30) and is CNC machined from solid 6061 aluminum bar stock then anodized with a matte black type II finish. I designed this mount to replace the rear sight assembly, and it has a tapered dovetail that matches the tapered mount on the barrel and 10-32 set screws to lock it to the barrel once it is installed. Installation only requires the removal of the rear sight base, then replace with this mount and tighten the set screws. I machine these to be tight on the barrel mount, and more than likely it will require a small block of wood placed on the front of the sight and a couple of taps with a hammer on the wood to drive it home into its final position. Some of the sight bases on the 91/30 are silver soldered on, and if you have one of these the solder left on the barrel mount will need to be filed off before installing this mount. The rifle in the pictures had the base soldered on, and it only took a couple of minutes with a flat file to get the solder off. If you want to see how to get the original sight base off do a search on You Tube and you will find the info you need.

 This mount attaches securely to the dovetail that is on the barrel under the rear sight base, and does not rely on 2 tiny screws through oversized holes in the mount or the ""Teeter Totter"" designs that utilize one small pin through the rear leaf mount that must take all the force of the recoil. This mount has almost 3"" of positive contact on each side of the mounting rail for a total of almost 6"" of secure mounting contact, along with 3 set screw locations that tighten against the top of the dovetail rail for even more holding power. Once installed this mount has a clean ""Factory"" look with smooth sides and no screws and bolts sticking out of the sides. I designed this mount and machine them ""In House"" in the USA on CNC equipment so I can control the quality, and nothing leaves the shop that I would not install on my own rifles.

This mount also has a machined rear sight built in so you can still use the iron sights along with the scope. If you look at the pictures close you can see a channel machined into the top of the mount and the rear ""U"" sight machined in the back. The rear sight is not adjustable and it is set the same as the lowest setting on the original sight base, which is 100 meters, or roughly 100 yards. One of the pictures shows looking through the iron sights, but the camera only focused on the rear and the front sight is hard to see and fuzzy in the photo but it lets you see how it looks. The scope base is a Weaver style with 8 mounting locations so you can use your own rings and adjust the position to where you desire. If you have a bent bolt you can shift the scope back farther or keep it forward with the standard straight bolt. This mount requires a long eye relief scope since it is mounted forward of the receiver. Since the rings are not machined in you can use whatever scope and ring (Weaver Ring) combination you choose, and if you ever want to change scopes you do not need to worry if it will fit the mount. With the scope forward on the mount you can still use stripper clips to load instead of loading single rounds as required with a full length scope mount, and you won't have the extra expense of having to get your bolt turned down like with a full length mount.
This scope mount simply replaces the rear sight base and mounts on the dovetail on the barrel, and installation instructions are included. This mount will not work on the M38, M44 or T53 carbines."
