Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety.

The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX™ and Ultragrip DX™ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

The PX4 Storm SD .45 ACP semiauto pistol was developed to meet the very demanding requirements issued by the US Special Forces Command (SOCOM) for their Joint Combat Pistol. They called for superior weather resistance, three magazines (one 9-round flush and two 10-round extended), dark earth frame, extended barrel for threading, tactical case and additional accessories. Beretta answered the call successfuly, not just by merely rechambering the PX4 Storm to .45 ACP--but rather by redesigning its internal components to meet and exceed all these requirements. The result is a pistol that satisfies not only SOCOM's requirements, but the most demanding shooter looking for the absolute best and most reliable for personal defense, competition or carry.
Special Duty (SD) Tactical Pistol
The “SD” denomination of this handgun stands for “Special Duty.” That means a pistol that will be reliable in the toughest and most demanding conditions. Military trials for the PX4 Storm SD have proven that it will keep performing in spite of salt, mud, water, rain, snow, sand or anything else you can throw at it. This is because every internal component was engineered, produced and treated to function in such extreme environments.
Low-Recoil, Powerful Super-Accurate
The PX4 Storm SD features a rotating barrel system. This means that under recoil, the barrel rotates, thereby dissipating momentum radially, which translates in much lower felt recoil and muzzle jump, even with hotter .45 ACP rounds. Furthermore, the extended cold-hammer forged barrel is 4.5” long and allows the power of the .45 to fully develop before exiting the muzzle. And the out-of-the-box accuracy of this handgun is as good as it gets in a tactical pistol.
Packed with Tactical Features The reversible mag-release, ambidextrous safety, drop-free magazine, commander-style hammer and easy-on-target 3-dot sights are only some of the tactical features of this Beretta .45. An integral Picatinny rail forward of the trigger guard enables easy mounting of tactical lights, laser aiming devices or other accessories. And like all best-quality military arms the PX4 Storm SD takes mere seconds to disassemble without any tools. When the impossible is expected, the PX4 Storm SD is the absolute best companion to have at hand.if"

- Novak Special Ops High Power package
- base gun MKII
- Spegel grip
- Novak extended safety
- sighted in
- the grip is hand matte, superior to checkering or stippling in my experience

I asked Novak to install 9mm match barrel but they told that the gun doesn't need match barrel because it's extraordinarily accurate.

Basically, it shoots like a bullseye gun but with combat reliability in a double stacked magazine.

The gun fits my hand more naturally than any other handgun I've shot and is easiest to shoot accurately with one, compared to anything else I've handled.

After it got back from Novak, it has never malfunctioned, not even once.

I consulted other MKII owners and the consensus was that I was lucky in finding MKII that was an extremely accurate gun to start off with.

It outshoots Wilson Combat and NightHawk I've handled in the past by a large margin, as well as semi-custom guns like STI.

Can ship to FFL only.  If face to face transaction in metro Atlanta, require FFL.

Lightning-fast in close quarters and superbly accurate for the long shot, the compact, short-action Model Seven has been a knock-down, drag-out leader in the woods since it was introduced in 1983. Its receiver and action design are based on the Model 700 and deliver the highest level of out-of-the-box accuracy, strength and reliability in a platform that's 2 3/8"" shorter overall and weighs just 6 1/2 lbs. (standard calibers). When you match this handy design with some of the hardest-hitting calibers known to big game the short action magnum cartridges you need a longer barrel. Thus, Model Seven rifles in these chamberings have a 22"" magnum contour barrel. A dream to handle, the compact Model Seven Predator is officially every predator and varmint's worst nightmare. The Model Seven Predator weighs in at 7 lbs. and is decked from butt to bore in Mossy Oak Brush camo to surpass your needs for mobility and concealment. Much like the legendary Model 700 action, the Model Seven platform will amaze you with its accuracy right out of the box. The Predator s fluted, magnum-contour 22"" barrel promotes awesome long-shot repeatability and cools quickly when the action heats up. Speaking of hot, the lineup of calibers, including the 17 Remington Fireball at 4,000 fps is sure to light'em up. The X-Mark Pro Trigger system delivers a level of shot control and crispness unrivaled by any other factory system."

This gun is from 1982(according to the S&W forums report on my serial#), has extremely comfortable Hogue wood grips(no originals sorry) and has been WELL taken care of. There is a slight turn ring but it isn't bad at all. I myself have fired less than 50 rounds through this gun(which is VERY accurate) but I am unsure how much previous owners have fired it.

Right now it is a safe queen and honestly too expensive for me to shoot on a regular basis. I do not NEED to sell this gun so please lowballers need not reply, HOWEVER I am willing to negotiate a FAIR price. Look this gun up on Armslist or Gunbroker and you will see my price is quite fair already but like I said.....I'm flexible.

This sale is for CCW and Wisconsin PICTURE ID!! NO EXCEPTIONS! If you don't know why, watch the news.

Buyers MUST! be 21 or older AND bring CASH ONLY(no checks sorry) and will also need to complete a Wisconsin Bill of Sale(I will have 2 copies, one for each of us).

Years ago a ""friend"" ""gave"" me a stainless Mini-14 Ranch Model & I bought this stock for it.  Also bought a Williams Micrometer Peep rear sight and an M14-style flash hider.  Also an extended magazine & quite a lot of ammo.  Took it out once & ran a box of ammo through it.  Later he became an ""Indian Giver"" and took it back, but I kept my stock & upgrade parts & ammo.

I'm not that interested in Mini-14s anymore so it's unlikely I'll ever use these parts.  I'd rather *you* use them & convert them into something useful.

The stock is old, it's wood (seems to be Walnut) it's clean and the steel mechanism works perfectly.  As far as I can tell, I'm the only person who's mounted a rifle in it.  It fits the Ranch Model *perfectly*, so I'm sure it would also fit the ""regular"" Mini-14 receiver as well.
The stainless extended flash hider slips over the sights & pins into place.  I liked the way it looked.
Peep sights aren't for everybody, but I like them; and this Williams unit is a big upgrade over the factory sights!  Plus it's very precisely adjustable.
There's an extended magazine but I don't know how many rounds it holds.  Also a good bit of ammo.

From what I've been able to Google, the stock alone seems to be worth what I'm asking, and the flash hider and peep sight would add another $100 or so, nevermind the ammo and spare magazine.  I'd consider trading for a .308 Bolt Action rifle or a Lever Action (.44Mag or .30-30) for deer hunting (not a collectors piece and I don't even mind if it needs repairs).  Or make me a reasonable offer & I'll consider it.

I'd be willing to consider other interesting trades, so feel free to ask.  If I don't reply right away, please be patient.  When the stock is gone, this ad will go too.

No brag, but this all looked pretty awesome on a Stainless Steel Mini-14 Ranch Rifle, and with the stock folded it stows much better.

Can you give them all a Good Home?  I'm open to suggestions here, but no lowballers or tire kickers please."

Pistol is all original with the Colt's mirror-bright factory finish rating about 99%. Difficult to find or to upgrade. Aside from the minor scratches/damage on the right side of the slide up front shown in photo, the finish is nearly flawless (no takedown scratch).  Front and rear grip straps are absolutely beautiful.  A nice addition to any Colt collection. This pistol is one of the last beautiful, hand-polished post-WWII chemically blued pistols. By about mid-1947, Colt's went to the non-glare matte blue finish on all but the flats of the slide and frame. This pistol is entirely high-polish, except for the top of the slide, rear of the slide, top sides of the grip tang radius that meet up to the rear of the slide done to provide a matched mating finish, see photo 4), and the top of the hammer.  The first post-WWII Colt Govt. Models came off the line in late 1946. The earliest pistols used surplus military parts leftover from WWII, until supplies were depleted. This pistol has a long 1911 checkered trigger. Other parts that MAY be surplus WWII military are: receiver, sights, magazine release, slide stop, hammer, thumb safety, grip safety, recoil spring, recoil spring guide, recoil spring plug, barrel bushing and various small internals. These parts were identical in the WWII pistols and the first post-WWII commercials. I know of no way to tell them apart. This slide  has the earliest post-WWII markings ""COLT'S PT. F.A. MFG. CO. HARTFORD, CT. U.S.A."" on the left side and COLT (beside) AUTOMATIC (over) CALIBRE .45 on the right side. These slide markings were only used in the first part of 1947, because Colt's changed their name to Colt's Manufacturing Company in early 1947...and changed their slide markings to reflect this. Perfectly struck VP and factory inspector 5  marked on left side of trigger guard. Perfectly struck factory assembler 4 mark on right side of trigger guard. GOVERNMENT MODEL (over) C222102 on right side of receiver. All markings perfectly struck to indicate original Colt's factory finish. No markings on top of the receiver by the disconnector, which is correct according to Clawson. Bright bullet feed ramp on receiver.  The barrel appears to be original to the pistol and is military P proofed on the left lug. Top of the chamber is Colt's factory prepared with the bright, unfinished surface there and on the crown of the muzzle. Bore is bright and flawless.

Flat shooting, one of the most accurate platforms that will also stop what you're shooting at.  Very moderate recoil so it's a great rifle for the recoil sensitive shooter.  Great for deer or simply looking good at the range poking holes in paper at long distances.  You'll be amazed at what this will do out to 200+ yards-and we ARE talking 1 MOA accuracy levels.

Synthetic stock.  Rifle is ALL matching; receiver, bolt, safety, ejector, bolt shroud, etc. which is what you want in a Mauser of any sort; means you don't have to worry about head spacing.

Leupold mount AND rings.  A nice, clear Tasco 3-9 power scope makes it perfect for Wisconsin usage.  Also has a sling.  All you ""need to add"" is the ammunition.

I live in the northwest suburbs of Milwaukee and I'm willing to drive up to 30 miles to meet you in an agreed upon public place.

Price is less than I have in this build so it's more than fair, and it IS firm.  

You'll be 18 years old or more, able to legally own a firearm in Wisconsin and have cash. We'll do a bill of sale for mutual benefit.

Email any questions  you might have or if you're interested in owning this accurate, practical package.  Thanks for looking."

This gun takes .223/5.56 ak mags. I love this gun, it is an extremely handy truck/hd/range/varmint hunting gun. I'm pretty on the fence about selling it, so lowballers will be ignored. It is accurate, begs for a red dot or low mag scope to see its potential. The only reason I'm thinking of selling or trading is I'm moving to Arizona and could use some cash, better optics, or guns to work on in school. This pistol comes with a 30 round steel mag, plastic 30 rounder, arsenal smoke/clear 20 round mag, hogue grip and original grip, and ak brace.
