Got the upper unfired as a friend was going to change stuff around first and took the flash hider off not realizing it was pinned and threads are messed up on the end but the YHM phantom aggressive flash hider stays on fine was going to send the barrel in to have it cut down and rethreaded to a 10.5 or 11.5 and put a KAK ind. flashcan on it for the ""honey badger"" look yes this is a range toy has seen about 2k rounds but still runs smooth so I decided I would wait until the barrel needed replaced to do it. 

so just making sure buyer knows this other than that issue and scuffs its a great gun just dumping more $ into 3gun setups. 

Due to all the political crap I will require the buyer to xfer this @ a ffl. If thats an issue please don't waste our time. You will pay the fee and I know a cheap place. $25 without ccw and $20 with ccw last time I did this.

five Black Dog metal feed lip 25 round mags.
One SIG factory 10 round mag.
One custom barrel nut for installing an AR style floating hand guard - not pictured.
One set of scope rings - not pictured.
One plastic gun case.

I bought this SIG 522 Heavy Barrel model a few yrs ago thinking it would be good to have two .22 rifles so family could go with me to the range. Reality: that is not working out, I still always go by myself and I have a custom ruger 10/22 I always take so this gun has been to the range once, had 150 rounds fired, then cleaned and sat in the case ever since.

It is a Heavy barrel SIG 522 model so it is more accurate then the regular SIG 522 models. One great thing about these Sig 522 guns, they eat any ammo without constantly jamming. You can research this with a google search [sig 522 reliability] - these SIG 522 guns really run trouble free with every type of ammo out there.

When I shot this gun at the range it ran perfect, no jams with cheap Remington golden bullet ammo. I ordered five black dog 25 round mags with the metal feed lips for it and these are included in the sale along with the factory 10 round mag.

You can load all these mags up and power through 125 rounds in under 60 seconds if you want to show off or take your time and drive tacks with this baby. No way you can shoot that fast with a finicky Ruger 10/22. If I did not already have so much invested in my custom Ruger 10/22 I would never sell this SIG 522, I love how it shoots so reliably and accurate.

I also have a custom barrel nut [not pictured] that allows a AR style floating hand guard to be installed, this barrel nut was never installed but is included in the sale. 

I have 1 set of medium height 30mm scope rings that will be included with this sale. If you want to use a 1"" scope you can get inserts to reduce the 30mm down to 1"". No pictures of the rings as this web site restricts you to only 3 photos if you are not a dealer. 

I have about 675.00 into it and it is almost brand new. I am selling to fund the purchase of a SA 1911 pistol.

I love the gun, I'm just not a revolver guy as much as I want to be. This gun is a work of art though. Sweet.... Anyways, I will trade for other pistols, semi auto only. Looking for 9mm mostly, will also take 40 S&W and will consider all but mouse gun calibers.
Would love a Beretta 92fs INOX compact, or 92A1 INOX Compact, or 92fs regular compact."

Fenton, MO - pickup w/background check or transfer only
 
The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably.  The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.
 
The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel.  This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.
 
Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology
 
It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.
Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.
Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.

And, instead of the traditional slug barrel that comes with a 24in Mossberg Rifled Slug barrel that has a scope mount, is ported for recoil reduction and quicker sight alignment after a shot, with a 1-in-36in twist on the rifling.
No scope mount is more accurate for a shotgun than one integrated with the barrel!
This has been my hunting shotgun for several years, but only used for deer hunting.  It does show some wear and tear.  A few scratches on the stock and there was some rust on the vented barrel that has been removed.  This is why there is a reduced price.
I've looked on Guns America and Gunbroker and set a price lower than any I could find on those websites or Armslist because of the wear and tear.
I've taken several bucks with heartshots using that rifled barrel and have yet to miss a shot taken in the field."

According to the serial number guide I found this is a mid-90s pistol (SN# SA23xxx) meaning it predates the decline in QC that the Sig product line saw in the 2000s. Pistol is in good shape overall and shoots great but has some finish wear on the barrel and sharp edges of the slide. Comes with five genuine Sig OEM magazines, blue SigArms plastic case, and a universal P-series manual.

This is a fantastic pistol for women or anyone else that has trouble properly gripping a fullsize double-stack. Don't get me wrong because I don't mean that in some dumb ""durr hurr wimmin cain't handle no real gun"" sort of way but rather that the frame size, slim grip, and control ergonomics are great for people with smaller hands. On top of that the all-metal construction gives it added heft and thus controllability when compared to similarly sized polymer-framed pistols, with the extra mass helping to soak up recoil. This was my wife's favorite pistol when she started shooting, and later on it was always the first centerfire pistol she handed to her friends when she brought them to their first range experience. 

At the same time since it's slightly larger than what's considered a compact frame by modern standard, it's also not too small for those with larger hands who'd prefer a slim and all-metal EDC."

The Sumatra 2500 is an easy-to-cock, lever-action repeater. This precharged pneumatic (PCP) has two built-in chambers (290cc total) that hold high-pressure air (3,000 psi) from a scuba tank (Included), hand pump or compressor.

It has a two-stage adjustable trigger. The sights are pretty unique, in that both the front and rear are adjustable. The front post can be adjusted for elevation by turning a small wheel under the post. The rear is a two-hole aperture that flips from a small to large hole and is adjustable for windage.

Accuracy is the name of the game when it comes to shooting, and the Sumatra 2500 excels in that area: 3/8"" ctc at 30 yds. with Eun Jin pellets. To get the most from this airgun, you'll want to mount a scope on the 11mm dovetails. The finely rifled (and 10x1mm threaded) steel barrel (1:18 RH twist) is fed by a 6-shot cylinder that makes for quick follow-up shots. The cylinder makes it easy to use longer pellets and even mix-and-match different pellet lengths and types.

The adjustable power wheel has 13 settings, making this one of the most versatile powerhouses on the market! You'll get about 11 shots on high power and 18 on medium.

Includes probe with 1/8"" BSPP male threads and 2 rotary clips. The high pressure connector and gauge is included to connect the gun to the scuba tank. A hard Plano rifle case (PL1502-01) is strongly suggested!

This gun has roughly 500+ .25 (6.3mm) Caliber - Beeman - Crow Magnum Hollow point with stability shock.

All original, unmolested ww2 mauser with all of it's original parts (though it is missing the cleaning rod). Serial number is stamped on just about every part. Made by Steyr in 1944. The bore is kinda dark but superb rifling. The finish has never been messed with and it's not perfect. The stock is duffel cut but all the original parts are there. Even the stock has the serial number on the inside. Serial number is 6660 which is kinda icky. A friend of mine (self proclaimed expert) says its an original ""SS"" rifle. Well, I read all kinds of crap online about this detail and that detail, and guess what, I quit caring if it was a ""Special Contract"" rifle. It's just a cool piece of history that I picked up at a yard sale and got to hear the old man tell his story. He was still a hardass. :) I have more pics on my phone if you need them REDACTED"

 I have a Smith&Wesson AR-15 .22 that is an awesome gun, had it about 3 years and put a lot of ammo threw it and never once jammed, upgraded the springs to reduce the trigger pull to 3 lbs and added a bump stock to make it like fully auto, with a little practice you can empty a 25 round mag in less then 3 seconds, I am asking $550 for the gun without the bump stock or $700 with it! I will part with the bump stock separate for $200! can be used with the delton also

This stuff is so much stronger than what you can get at wally world or bass pro. And the larger ones spray quite a distance up to 20 feet they are all stream spray but most do spray as a fog till the pressure in can is lowered by a few sprays.

711,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4269711,For Sale:  Daniel Defense back up fixed iron sights for AR-15/M16,"Macclenny, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 125,"Listed On: Thursday, April 23, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Mint condition. Got these for a build but never installed. The front/rear backup sight combo is sold out in many sites, forcing you to buy front and rear separate and spend more. Just trying to get back my initial investment.

Unfortunately no packaging is included, just the sights. Description from Daniel Defense website follows:

""Rail-Mount Fixed Front Sight Description

The lightweight, streamlined design makes it unobtrusive and snag-free. The one piece design makes it easy to install on any MIL-STD-1913 rail and it secures with a slotted fastener threaded into a self-locking stainless steel thread insert. Special attention was paid to facilitate the use of compact weapon lights forward of the sight, such as the X300, TLR-1, etc. The concave radius on either side of the sight is a great place to rest your thumb for easy, ambidextrous activation of the light.
Features

    One Piece Streamline Design
    Uses Standard AR15 Apertures
    Easy to use in conjunction with compact, pistol-type weapon lights
    Slotted Screws Attachment
    Light weight

A1.5 Fixed Rear Sight Description

The lightweight, streamlined design makes it the optimum back up iron sight for shooters using today’s most popular reflex optics. Its well thought out design does not impede the use of the charging handle on M4 type rifles. The one piece design makes it easy to install to any Military Specification flattop upper receiver and the sight is secured to the upper using a slotted fastener which is threaded into a self locking steel thread insert.
Fixed Sight Combo Materials & Construction

Precision CNC machined from Aircraft Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum and Military Specification Type III Hard Coat Anodized for a rock hard lasting finish. The Rail-Mount Fixed Front & Rear Sight combo weighs only 2.8 Ounces.

It comes with one (1) 25 round detachable magazine, removable sights and a soft case. She's a nice and accurate shooter. 25 rounds through her.  It also comes with a knock-off Trijicon (Paid 175 for scope) that has an RMR style reflex red dot sight on top for close in work. For a .22 scope, this works beautifully. It's a 4x scope and the reticle glows in low light. I have the box and manual for the scope. I gotta say, I'm impressed by the quality of this knock-off Trijicon. I wouldn't take it down range, but it would do well for zapping bunnies. Pictures shown are commercial pics, I'll post pics of the actual firearm and scope soon."

Lower 1/3rd height.

Will clamp onto any long gun with a top picatinny rail (sub-guns, AR15's, Shotguns etc). Holds zero perfectly when taking off and putting back on.
The mount is canted forward and pushed out past the upper receiver rail so you can fit a magnifier behind it on the top receiver rail while keeping your BUIS.
These are great mounts and hundreds of dollars cheaper than other mounts made of the same materials (Bobro, LaRue, etc). They retail for around $40 ... I'm asking $20, new in box.

Two mags and the cleaning rod included. Has original phosphate finish showing some handling marks, but still looks great. Internals in excellent condition. All the numbers match. Has original plastic grips in very good condition with no cracks. Gun has a decocker. This thing sounds like a 357 when you fire it. The rounds are going around 1600 fps muzzle velocity. It makes a great fireball too.  They bearing setup and balance of the gun make it have minimal recoil.  You can unload it as fast as you can pull the trigger, and never worry about a misfire or jam. Ammo is really cheap too.  Loud, incredibly powerful, reliable, breaks down in seconds, and cheap to shoot--its like a handheld AK.

I researched all the markings and came up with the following: the phosphate instead of blued finish indicates it wasn't a refurbished pistol. The crossed swords and number 53 indicate it is Czech Army and made in 53, the ""rid"" also incidates it was army production, not civilian. The circled T on the barrel inside the chamber indicates it passed military inspection for safety and the de-cocker passed. The various other marks are for the workers who might have assembled it and the circled vot or vor is probably the plant that did any refinishing or work on it before it was sent back out into the world.

There are no import marks that I can find. They should be on the bottom of the frame between the trigger guard and the end of the barrel. Oh well, it is simply a very nice looking and shooting pistol. Kinda looks like what the desert eagle might have been imagined to look like in the 50's for some sci-fi movie.

$275 and I'll throw in 100 rounds of ammo.

I will personally draft and customize your N.F.A.firearms trust for purchasing such Class 3 items. A Gun Trust is a revocable trust, which you may revoke, or amend whenever you wish. No additional charge for up to an hour in-office, or telephone, consultation. As I will not simply be inserting names into a template, the usual turnaround time for completion is four (4) business days.  If circumstances require, for no additional charge, I probably would be able expedite the process to as little as 24 hrs.   Owners of Class 3 items should avoid relying on boilerplate forms, trust software, or trusts that are not drafted by an attorney, because they may not comply with the unique issues involving suppressors, silencers, fully automatic rifles, SBRs, and other Title 2, or Class 3 weapons regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA). A N.F.A.Trust will allow you to: avoid Chief Law Enforcement officer sign offs; Avoid having to get finger printed; Avoid having to get photographs taken; Have the capability to file electronically; Allow more than 1 person to LEGALLY take possession and use your N.F.A.devices;and Streamline inheritance, and passing down of firearms to future generations. The majority of Gun Trusts are prepared for a total price of $219.00. Sure you can probably find an online $29.99 form, but having a trained chimp lawyer wannabee prepare your N.F.A. Gun Trust, if done improperly, can result in your firearms being confiscated by the ATF, a $250,000.00 fine, and your potential exposure to felony violations of the National Firearms Act. “Intent” is not a requirement for being convicted of a violation under the National Firearms Act. Contact Elliot Goldstein, Esq./J.& G.

Anyhow, I have read and they will fire a 380 safely (kinda like 556/223) if one couldn't find the ultra shells. Google ""Will a 380 fire safely in a 9x18 ultra chambered pistol"" and it comes up on several reputable sources. Or just order the ultra's. They aren't much more than 380's and one places were the same or a little less.

Functions really neat, you rack it, and as a safety, have to insert the mag to close the rack. Hammer is made bobbed and is flush with the back of the firearm.

I could only find one Ultra9mm and here's a link to it where it sold for 400 and wasn't NIB or unfired. So I'll price this one at: $370.

2. Gamo Whisper Silent Cat .177 Break-Action Rifle. This is one of the nicest Air Rifles for Pest Control/Small Game Hunting you can buy. It has a built on silencer that reduces 52% of noise (Legal on an Air Rifle), a Fluted barrel, Fiber Optic Iron Sights (green in rear/red in front), skelatanized stock, and recoil pad. It came with a cheap scope but I was at Academy one day and found a Display no-name scope I got them to sell me that is a 3x9x40 with BDC and finger turrets for $50 (they wanted $120) that is sighted in perfectly with the Benjamin pellets and is crystal clear. It has a scope riser to get above the iron sights as well I bought online. I also have several containers of high quality hunting ammo. I bought this for quiet pest control in my shop... it did well. This is in no way a BB gun toy, It is made for small game hunting and is more like a silent .22lr. It shoots 1200 fps with standard ammo and I believe 1400 fps with PBA pellets. I shoot regular because PBA goes supersonic (breaks the sound barrier) and makes the cracking sound the silencer cant help. It will come with some PBA ammo, but I use regular for the quietness and it is still very effective.

It comes in the factory case with 2 mags and manual. $500.00 out the door. REDACTED

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!
