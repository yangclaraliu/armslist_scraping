The Troy Micro BattleSight greatly enhances weapons such as the new IAR, the Sig Sauer 556® Pistol and Carbine, POF 416®, FN Scar®, Robinson Armament XCR®, Heckler & Koch 416® & 417® and other weapons with raised top rails. Troy Micro BattleSights are rugged, reliable and BattleReady™."

The internals of the gun have not been altered in anyway except for the feed ramp received a polish but no material was removed or anything else done with the way this gun would function. The slide work was all done professionally by customized creationz. The slide received a logo delete, a deeper side pocket cut, front serrations added, sig equinox finished added, grey cerakote to complete the finish. The barrel and slide were given a port job on the top of the slide which makes for a very sweet shooter. The sights were changed out with a pair of xs big dot tritium sights. Installed vz grips and wilson stainless grip screws, the grips allow for great control. I also had the mag released swapped out for a machined finish mag release. The factory manual and case along with both factory mags and one after market 7 round act mag, and a dual owb dual mag holder come with the gun. Over $1,700.00 invested in this setup. When i sent the gun in for the work i bought a carry glock shortly after and fell in love with it for carry so i dont see myself carrying this over the glock and have a few full size id rather use at the range so just kinda looking to see whats out there that i might let it go for.

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture.

I need a sidefolder AK74 in my life in a bad way, and the safe is getting crowded with 7.62 guns. 

I built this one a few months back with mostly Romanian and Egyptian surplus AKM parts on a McKay/NoDak receiver. Probably one of the smoothest AKs I've ever built. Note that this is not some pile of junk screwed/welded/nailed/glued together hillbilly rig. I rivet my builds together correctly with a 20-ton hydraulic press and test fire the hell out of them. No junk here.

Parts breakdown:
Gas block, front sight base and rear sight block, and gas tube are Romanian.
Trigger guard, top cover, selector, and rear trunnion are Egyptian.
Front trunnion and bolt are Hungarian
Bolt carrier is Polish.
All other parts are US made for 922r compliance (muzzle brake, trigger parts, receiver, nitrided barrel, and Magpul PMAG)

This is not an entry-level IO or WASR. In the unlikely event that you have an issue, I will fix it at no cost whatsoever.

EDIT: Someone emailed and asked if this was a serialized receiver or not. Yes, NoDak/McKay receivers are all serialized firearms."

The last year patent stamps were of 1896 on the handle butt. Gun is in great condition. It is tight and grips are in excellent  condition. There is what I believe is the serial number under the left handle and it is 4462. You can still see the patent numbers real well on the gun. Most I have found on net are like 20,000 + on up.

If the pictures are too big then open it with something where you can resize the image to about 70%. I have shot .38SW shorts in it ok before, but my research shows these were actually designed to shoot black powder in them until the 1909 models.

My grandfather was a big timber business man from Salem, MO and used to carry  this with him and a 410 shotgun pistol when he took his money to the bank on horseback in the pre-depression days. He was also a deputy sheriiff at one time and later in life became the pastor of the Pentecostal Church that he built in Salem, MO. He gave this gun to my father. It is the last firearm I have left to me by my father who died in 1998.

I originally got them with my CX4 carbine, but I converted the carbine to use 92 magazines instead, and I don't have a PX4 pistol, so I'm letting these go. These will work in a CX4 carbine if it's equipped with the PX4 magwell (which is interchangeable on the CX4).

These are new, unused 17-round 9mm magazines.

Checking prices, it looks like these go new for $30-35 a piece. I'd like to sell them all to one person as it would save me making multiple trips, so if you want all (5), I'll let them go for $100 ($20 each) That price is only if you buy all five.

If you really want just a few, I'll let them go at $25 a piece with a minimum purchase of 2 magazines.

Meeting will be FTF in the Portland Metro area. Vancouver residents, this is open for you too. And if you're way out of town, I'm willing to ship on your dime as long as you're not in a state that bans standard capacity magazines like these.

I have an RWS 54 Air King in .177, TO-5 trigger 
This rifle would probably suit someone who likes to shoot from a bench better than it does me. I shoot out back and the lay of the land prohibits bench shooting. 
Seated with my left arm resting on knee and right arm on chair arm rest I get  1/2"" at 25 yards out of this gun. I expect a bench would cut that in half and a different brand of pellets might get a person more out of it.
The wood is nice and metal is in good shape with a mark or two here and there. 
 It's a brute, and try as I may, I can't warm up to it. It is big, heavy and hard to cock compared to my three other air rifles.
Shoots Crossman Premiere  7.9grn  hollow points pretty good.
I have recently installed a HW50 spring bought new from Airguns of Arizona.
It slowed things down and is a lot more enjoyable to shoot
It ate the air rifle  scope in the pictures along with two others. No scope for now but good factory open sights and factory scope base.
I don't expect anymore scope damage with the HW50 spring.The HW spring is identical in dimension to the factory RWS spring with about an 1"" to 1 1/2"" less preload
Gun still has ample power for pest out to 40-50 yards.
Can be put back to a hard to cock, scope killer in a matter of minutes.
You are welcome to come shoot it.
Contact me for info or more pictures.

The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.

The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol. Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact. Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.

If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

AAC quick suppressor attach flash suppressor, I can't remember the barrel manufacturer or rail, but the barrel was $150 if I remember correctly, and the rail was $100. I've got right around $650-$700 into the upper alone

And the lower specs are : 

PSA lower PSA parts kit phase 5 buffer tube and (green) heavy buffer spring phase 5 ""w"" shaped trigger guard magpul grip heavier utg tungsten weighted buffer , possibly some other things that I cannot remember right now.

this thing is a beast it shoots like a dream I only have 163 rounds down the pipe on this complete gun however it does have an issue the bolt catch is not connected due to the spring and the little metal stud piece being stuck in the lower receiver that being said, it does not hold the bolt open on the last round. I have not had time to take this to a gunsmith it has not bothered me too much but it is something that I planned to get fixed other than that there are no issues..

I would also be open to trading for other things, so if you have something to trade, go ahead and ask. I am also open to doing a trade plus cash in either direction. I have a valid NC driver's license and CHL, and am willing to drive part way if you live further away.

If you would like to purchase the ammunition separately or with the rifle kit, I am asking $160 for the 500 rounds I have on hand. I will not sell in smaller quantities.

I have 3 15 round mags & one has a Glock +2 baseplate (the one with +2 baseplate is not pictured). All 3 mags run 100%. The recoil spring was replaced under the voluntary recall because this is a very early Gen 4. The original spring never gave an issue but I decided why not replace it. I do not have the additional back straps, they were lost by the previous owner (I am the second). I will compensate for replacement if it's a big deal.

M107A1 rifle systems are fed from a 10 round detachable box magazine and function on a recoil operated semi automatic design. Intended for use with a suppressor this one of a kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group design and a four-port muzzle brake engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor is key to making the rifle suppressor ready.

The Barrett M107’s lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The Barrett M107 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new recoil buffer system that is also optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Delivered with a Pelican case one 10-round magazine flip-up iron sights detachable adjustable lightweight bipod legs lightweight monopod sling attach points and owner’s manual.

A two-stage suppressor by Sionics, was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.

Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business. 

Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock. 

RPB Industries manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made, most were stamped ""sM10"" but a very few were made with the model stamped as ""sapM10"" (an abbreviation for semi auto pistol) These few are the only open bolt M10's which are not banned as assault weapons by the state of CA. This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol.

VIPER HS LR 6-24X50 RIFLESCOPE — First Focal Plane
Want to extend your effective shooting range at distances where bullet drop and wind drift become critical? Take a look at the Viper HS LR riflescope. The LR stands for long range — and we mean it. This riflescope features an exposed target-style elevation turret built for dialing elevation at extended ranges. The capped windage turret maintains the scope’s sleek lines and prevent it from hanging up on clothing, rifle cases or pack scabbards.
Viper HS LR riflescopes feature an advanced optical system highlighted with a 4x zoom range for magnification versatility. A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily. Built on an ultra-strong 30mm one-piece machined aluminum tube for increased windage and elevation travel and optimal adjustment."

Some Details on the DDM4V1

The DDM4v1, the original Daniel Defense Rifle, is built with a Cold Hammer Forged 16” M4 Profile barrel with a Carbine gas system.  It comes installed with our proprietary front sight base which is precision CNC machined from a solid billet of 4140 steel.  This FSB features a serrated curved design to minimize glare and is salt bath nitride treated minimizing corrosion and wear.  The DDM4 Rail 12.0™ FSP allows the operator to mount a weapon light or aiming device forward of the front sight for optimal ergonomics and a clear line of sight.  Quick disconnect attachment points are integrated to the front and back on both sides of the rail for fully ambidextrous sling attachment.  This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.
