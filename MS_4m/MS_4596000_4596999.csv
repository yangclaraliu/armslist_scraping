An amazing Saiga 12 gauge. I've put about 200 rounds through it and have never had a jam that people complain about(I'm very meticulous about cleaning it too) As close to new as you will get. Have all boxes and paper work. Even have my receipt where I paid $1000. This is what it comes with:
 *The IZ109 Saiga 12
 *5 round magazine
 *10 round promag
 *Around 100 rounds of birdshot(cant remember if I used any)
 *5 rounds of buckshot
I just was shown by a guy how much they really are now so I have come down. $850 and you pay the transfer fee($25)
**Buds gun shop has them for $895(a dealer will charge you $50-$75 to have it shipped to them) http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/81156/RWC+Group+IZ109+Saiga+Shotgun+5%2B1+12ga+19%22

I have had numerous people want to buy and NOT put it in their name. If I am selling my gun to you, its going in your name. No way around it so don't bother asking."

Through the years the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5"" long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It's chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that's coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. It's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.The receiver is also coated with Teflon for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in two finishes; Black and Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo Pattern. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.Features:Barrel Length: 20""Caliber: .22 LongCheckering: NoDetachable Magazine: YesHinged Floorplate: NoMagazine Capacity: 8Metal Finish: Mossy Oak Break-Up CamoOther Features: Round MagazinesReceiver is Teflon Coated16.5"" When Stowed AwayBreaks Down to Three PiecesAction and Magazine fits in the Water-Proof Floating StockCapable of FloatingNo Tools Needed.Overall Length: 35""Rate of Twist: 1:16""Recoil Pad YesSights: YesStock Finish: Mossy Oak Break-Up CamoStock Material: SyntheticSwivel Studs: NoType Action: Semi-Automatic"

I hate to let this one go, but it's just time. This is a 1943 Izhevsk sniper. It is import marked, but most of the mark is under the scope base and I can't read it. Don't particularly want to mess with the base, either. The receiver is clearly stamped for a scope, so this is/was a real sniper rifle (though the current scope does not match the number on the rifle). The bolt I don't know about; it's possible that it is a converted standard bolt, as it's unnumbered, but I can't say for sure. It's nicely done, in any case. The base, mount, and scope are all original pieces (though if you feel differently, please PM me and I'll double-check things for you. It is NOT my intention to mislead whatsoever). Bore is quite nice for a surplus Mosin Nagant. That said, I never shot this rifle, so the scope will need to be zeroed. There is one piece of debris inside the scope that could be cleaned out, but it's not in the way of the reticle, so I just left it alone.

The byf has had it's waffenamts defaced. Both have shootable bores; the rifling is good, but the bore is far from mirror. Typical milsurp ""shooter"" condition. These things aren't getting any cheaper! I am asking $SALE PENDING$ for the byf (SALE PENDING!) and $SOLD$ for the ce.

I am the original owner. The gun was purchased new last year prior to ban. It was the removable wood stock version. The barrel has been shortened to approximatley 14inches and threaded with the tromix monster brake permanently attached. This Vepr is 100% legal to own. The Cut and thread job, as well as the gas block/port work was done by a licensed armorer who works for Adams Arms.  He has over 10 years experience building Saiga and Vepr shotguns. It will reliably shoot heavy loads, but will need further tuning of the gas system to run cheap bulk pack bird shot.  The gun has more than enough US made parts for 922r. This is an awesome shotgun and would be a great candidate for a sbs stamp, since its already cut. I have fired about 400 rounds through it. It has roughly $1050 in upgraded parts(not counting labor). It will include one factory 5 round mag, one steel csspecs 8 round mag and 1 SGM 12 round mag. It will also come with factory trigger, guide rod, thread protector, and puc.

THE CORE WARRANTY SEE. SHOOT. BELIEVE.
A warranty. What else about a product says as much about how highly a maker values their own work? It’s a mark of integrity, an assurance that the person who built it believes in it enough to stand behind it. Lawyers, legalese and fine print have no place in it. And we feel ours both stands on its own and speaks for itself.
“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE Rifle Systems firearm has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one
of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”
That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe."

I am selling my Ruger Blackhawk .44 special. The revolver is in perfect condition. Purchased it August 1st 2015, shot six round through it and it just wasn't for me.  It was my first revolver and wanted something a bit different. Bought it from Gander Mountain new and they considered it used so they'd only take it back a fraction of the selling price.  So here I am trying to sell it.  I will throw in a box of the .44 special ammo  (50 rds minus the six I fired) at no extra charge as I do not have a use for it. The gun will come with everything that it did when I purchased it and the weapon itself is in new condition.  I will meet at an FFL and even pay for the background check myself so everything is legit and we are both covered. Thanks"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform.The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ 75 SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

I had only a head shot on a deer at 275 yards and hit it in the eye.  100 yards, should hit a quarter every time.  Great gun.  Now Browning makes the eclipse model as an X-Bolt and it is $1,069 just for the gun without a Boss barrel.  Add another $400+ for the scope and mounts, throw in the strap and case and you're at $1,500 easy.  Don't be swayed by the scope until you research it or review it.  It gets excellent reviews.  I did a lot of research before picking that scope, it is very good.  Also worth noting that you can't get a A-Bolt Eclipse any more and this was before the thumbhole stock."
