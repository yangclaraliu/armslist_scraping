It has the PVD finish, 3 mags, night sights, one IWB holster from SHTF GEAR and a duty holster from G-Code. I have the apex DCAEK with their improved trigger, but I have all the stock parts as well. This gun came stock with the performance center parts, so the reset was on part with Glock when it was stock. It's better now. The sear block housing and frame will accept a thumb safety if that's your thing. 

I want to move on from this because I am a DA/SA shooter. I just can't quite warm up to striker fired guns.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazines are also Zytel and holds 30 rounds (parts kits included), with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

645,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4331645,For Sale:  Mossberg 12 gauge model 835 Factory Barrel 3 1/2 inch 24 in Rifle Sights with Choate Steel 9 Shot Magazine Extension Kit Spring & Clamp all NIB,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 239,"Listed On: Sunday, April 17, 2016",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Seller Stock #: XMXB90800 This listing is for One Barrel and One Magazine Tube Extension Kit with clamp; Buyers, however, may take any number of additional kits we have on hand at the same per-kit price, and with no additional shipping charges. When the Mossberg Model 835 pump gun made its debut in our little store some 25 years ago, we noticed immediately the differences between it and the venerable Model 500. The biggest thing to us was, that it had a magazine cap a lot like a Remington 870, where the 500 did not. That configuration naturally called for a tube extension with a 24 inch barreled model 835, a configuration that our Tennessippi Turkey and Buckshot wielding Deer Hunters all learned to respect and then to love. This setup includes a Mossberg Factory 24 inch Blue Steel Barrel for the model 835, with factory Williams sights and 16 ports that help deaden both downrange noise and felt recoil. Mossberg factory number is 90800. This barrel has a uniform .727 diameter smooth bore, and the factory advertises it as a Slugster. Folk had best not try slugs in other 835 barrels, only this variant. Our Mississippi neighbors, who can legally deer hunt with Buckshot, love the Barrel and the Choate extension kit we are furnishing with it. Manufacturer on the extension kit is our old friends in Arkansas, Choate Machine Tool. Choate’s manufacturing experience outdates their competitors by at least a decade; these folks have been around a long time. Construction is all matte blue steel tube and swivel clamp, with black polymer tube end. The folks from Bald Knob even include a high visibility orange replacement shell follower and extended steel spring. Where a standard model 835 Pump Mossberg holds 4 each 2 3/4 inch shells in its factory magazine tube, attaching one of these ups that capacity to 8 in the pipe, yielding an 8+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. For 3 inch shells, make that 7+1; and on 3 1/2 inch shells, 6 + 1. The +1 means one in the chamber. With steel shot, then, the equivalent firepower on 3 1/2 inch shells is similar to 900 rounds of .22 caliber projectiles with a fully loaded shotgun; and about 500 round equivalent of #4 Buck, about .22 caliber, with lead loads. This apparatus will only fit Mossberg Models 835. Threads will match on some variants of the 590, but since the 590’s barrels are never 24 inches, this setup wouldn’t match the barrel length. It will not work on a 935; will certainly not work on a 500; will not work on a Remington; will not work on the door handle of a 1937 Dodge Blue Bird School bus. It will only work on a Mossberg 835 shotgun with 24 inch or longer barrel. Replacement pricing on this package is upwards of $400 in our neighborhood, and nobody keeps them but us.

Here is Mossberg’s 500 Special Purpose Military shotgun in a specialized Mag-Pul®  format. Manufacturer and warrantor is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of North Haven, CT. Stock and forend subcontractor is Mag-Pul Industries of Cheyenne, WY. Construction is steel barrel, magazine tube, bolt, slide arms, and internal parts, with lightweight alloy receiver. Safety button and trigger group assembly are high impact polymer. Forend and buttstock are graphite based synthetic. Finish is military parkerized steel and black anodized alloy. Barrel is 20 inch .732 Police Cylinder with .080 wall thickness at the muzzle. Sight is hex base brass bead. We have added a trench gun type black polymer heat shield. Chambering is 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch 12 gauge shells interchangeably, with a magazine capacity of 7+1 on 2 3/4 inch, and 6 + 1 on 3 inch. Magazine tube is full length steel. Factory issue Magpul SGA® buttstock has six removable spacers that allow a length of pull range of from 12 1/4 inches to 14 1/4 inches; and two interchangeable cheek pieces to allow comb adjustment from 1 1/2 inch to 2, to 2 1/2 inch drop at the comb. Buttstock is not canted laterally, so other than right side ejection, this shotgun is eminently southpaw friendly. Forend is MOE® Magpul. Note the factory issue sling plate and lanyard.

This shotgun has a 28 inch barrel, and like all other Super Vinci's it features a 3.5 inch chamber! The use of this gun was as a factory sample gun for our Benelli Rep. That means that our rep used this firearm as a show model and it was fired as a demo gun. Looking at the Bore and chamber, this gun was not fired more than a handful of times. Condition I would rate at 99%, including the factory case, manuals, and 5 Crio choke tubes. The fact that this shotgun was fired, takes my rating from 100% condition down to 99%. There is not a mark on the camouflage finish that I can find. Features include a 28 inch Crio barrel, 5 Crio choke tubes included, Red bead fiber optic front sight, mid sight bead, 3.5 inch chamber - This will shoot 2 3/4 3 and 3 1/2 inch shells, ComforTech recoil stock, Cushioned recoil pad, 3 rounds capacity, Manual safety, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The receiver was drilled and tapped from the factory to accept a scope base, and the holes are plugged from the factory. Message or call our store with any questions.

All parts I have added totals ~$450, add that to the price of the gun new ($1200) you get ~$1600. The forend is also stippled very well. On the left side of the gun is a removable velcro shell holder which works extremely well. The velco is very secure. Gun has had a total of ~120 rnds shot through it. 

Some things to be aware of: Gun doesn't like some light loads. If you install too much equipment on gun it won't cycle (pic. rail, red dot, etc.) That's something you'll have to experiment with.

It shows very little signs of use; functions perfectly, the bolt face is super clean, no internal wear & the bore is blinding bright. The bluing shines deep & rich, bright & shiny, the Belgium bluing back then was superb. There is only a little bluing loss, mostly limited to the bottom of the receiver from carry. There are no rust or pitting issues & only a couple of small handling marks. The stocks are walnut; reddish in color, striped grain with a glass-like finish, no cracks or repairs, just minor handling marks, most of which are in the finish, not the wood. The butt stock is fluted with a pistol grip & the forearm is grooved, both stocks have hand cut checkering that is still sharp. The wood fits proud to the metal, a factory fit. It has an engraved receiver, magazine shut-off, & a gold trigger. This is a beauty of a shotgun, high quality Belgium Browning workmanship of what I consider the best made semi-auto shotgun ever made. The Browning A-5 was designed by John Moses Browning & put into production in 1902 & was produced continuously for almost 100 years. The Light Twenty is very sought after by collectors & shooters; finding a nicer one will be a challenge. I will ship"

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories."
