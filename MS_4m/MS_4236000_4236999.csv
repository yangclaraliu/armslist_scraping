It is used but in excellent condition.  I don't have an exact round count.  There is a bit of finish wear on the barrel where it locks up with the slide, but not another mark on the gun.  Everything works correctly.

I will need to at least see a MN ID and a purchase/carry permit.  Photo copies of these are better.  I will provide a bill of sale.

If the buyer is interested, there is also ~750 rounds of 9mm ammo that can be included for an additional $200.  It's a mix of brands and FMJ and HP ammo.  This would make a package deal of $650 for the gun, accessories, and ammo.

No trades please.  Cash only.  Preference will be given to local face to face buyers so I don't have to mess with shipping.  The first person to get cash to me will take it.  I can ship, but buyer will have to pay full asking price plus shipping costs up front.  

I'm willing to meet you within 30 minutes of St Cloud if you can't make it all the way to me.

As a diehard SIG fan I purchased this firearm with high hopes but sadly do not want to spend the time to learn to shoot it considering just how different it is. I fired about 50 rounds through it on day 1 last week and decided that she’s not for me. Ergonomically beautiful and easily concealable I just do not like the operation or controls and don’t want to have to change the way I carry and shoot. Thought I’d love the CCP and unfortunately do not but I’m sure she can find a great home. As of now I am only interested in selling to someone in the Pensacola area , CCW Holders preferred. I’m sure this CCP will be great for someone, just doesn’t work for me.

The 100 ATR has everything you need to make the most of the season: pinpoint accuracy, smooth action and big-game calibers. Widely popular calibers and a free-floating, button-rifled barrel combine to deliver a high level of accuracy unheard of in a value-priced centerfire rifle. A side lever safety is utilized for convenience and safety afield, and the all-steel, machined receiver provides the 100 ATR with positive lock-up for consistent operation.

It is a bolt action rifle with a 3+1 built in magazine. It is perfect for long range, hunting, or just having fun in general. Only reason I am selling is because there are not many locations near where I live to shoot the ranges I would like. Rifle shoots flawlessly and looks great outside of minor scratches on the bottom magazine plate. Comes with camo form wrap already on it that was just to protect the laminate wood stock(this can easily be unwrapped and taken off). I am also including a swivel adjustable bi-pod, sling, butt stock ammo holder, 7mm cleaning brush attachment, and ammunition(16 rounds of fusion, 16 rounds of federal, and 14 rounds of Winchester). once sighted in this rifle is highly accurate, reliable, and if hunting..deadly. I am asking 750 for everything, remember this is coming with ammo, scope, bipod, etc...everything ready to shoot this is a great price. I am willing to travel throughout the state but if you are very far up in the north end I may add a small fee for gas, we can discuss this later. Please email or text/call devin at REDACTED..if there is no answer on the phone then please leave a message or email. thank you..

All metal is in excellent condition, and the stock and handguard are in very good condition, especially for a 73-year-old rifle.  I have considered refinishing the walnut stock and am certain that the rifle would be absolutely beautiful given the grain in the wood, but I have not been able to bring myself to permanently alter this historic weapon. 

For those who know K31s, they are exceedingly well made and are as, or more, accurate than the best rifles of the WWII period.  This one is no different.

I have a full case (480 rounds) of GP11 ammo which you can have for $250 if you would like. This is match-grade ammo and is only available from time to time through the major online retailers, or you can pay a lot kore for it at the Dixie show.  For the price, there is nothing better for the K31."

I bought this new last October and have competed with it the past several months. I just upgraded to a new competition gun, so I'm letting this go to help recoup some of the cost. It has approximately 600 rounds through it total. I have polished most of the internal parts, which results in a smoother trigger. It's got a couple marks in the finish (the worst are pictured) but is in fantastic mechanical shape.  This is NOT the version with the Omega trigger.

It comes with the factory box, paperwork, 2-16rnd mags(which have never been used), and the factory cleaning rod and brush.

The Apex Sigma Kit is installed on this gun.  

What it does:
The Apex Sigma Spring Kit is designed as a drop in spring kit for the S&W Sigma Series pistol. This kit was developed to reduce trigger pull weight while maintaining reliability. By installing our reduced weight striker block spring, the Sigma trigger pull is smoothed up and the reset becomes more pronounced. The reduced weight trigger return and striker springs allow for less uptake pressure to provide an easier trigger pull every time.

Expected results:
• Smoother trigger pull
• Smoother reset
• Trigger pull weight reduction by nearly 2lbs from factory pull weight"

This   cz52   was   professionally  finished   in   KG Industries Gun-Kote 2400 series after  beign  treated   with  4000 K-Phos  pretreatment ( rust and  corrosion  protection)   

I  have   the  original   barrel  assembly   alone   with   a  brand  new  barrel (only  100 rounds  of  non-corrosive ammo though  it to  ensure  funtion )  with  new  roller   cam  and  cam pin,  and  hardened  rollers  by  Harrington products (oringal   rollers  were   a  weak point,  hardened  rollers   solve  that  issue) 

Also   from  Harrington  products   i have  the   competition   firing  pin  set  installed, the kit  includes   the   firing  pin, firing pin return  spring, firing pin  detent,  and  detend  sping.  (I  have  the original   parts  to  go  with  it as  well)

Both  the  rollers  and   firing  pin kit  are  guaranteed for life   from Harrington  products

Also   installed    is    an  extra  power  recoil spring  from  Wolf   gun springs (oringal  spring  included  as well)

Also  have   a  handful  of   hard  to  find  full  military   sub  gun  rounds,  along  with 140  rounds  of   the  non-corrosive hard  to find  norinco  7.62 tok

The scope is an illuminated Bushnell 4-16x ($125).  The sling is a Quake Inc. 100% rubber ""Claw"" model ($25).

The stock has been custom duracoated in Desert Tan color.  Not a single chip or flake anywhere.

The rifle only has 14 rounds through it.  Shot 8 rounds of Remington 150 Core Lokt and 6 rounds of Hornady 150 SST.  Shot the Hornady rounds into a 1"" group at 91 yards (don't have enough room to get to 100 yards at my backyard range LOL).

I bought this rifle to go bear and deer hunting with my family back home in southwest PA and WV but lost interest in rifle hunting.  I've discovered I enjoy archery hunting much more -- warmer weather and more challenging.

Total investment is about $500.  Asking $320.  This is an outstanding rifle.  Not desperately trying to sell it  -- just hoping to find it a better home with someone who will actually shoot it!

Buyer must have current PA identification and sign a bill of sale -- FFL is not required for rifle transfers in PA.

Like no other pistol, GLOCK pistols permit almost unrestricted compatibility of the magazines within a caliber. Standard magazines, for instance, can also be used for backup weapons. Compact and subcompact GLOCK pistol model magazines can be loaded with a convincing number of rounds i.e. GLOCK 26: up to 33 rounds.

The innovative polymer frame of the GLOCK pistol does not require grip shells. As a result, it has considerably more space for the magazine body and enables double-row staggered cartridge configuration. For this reason, GLOCK pistols are superior in firepower to conventional pistol models of the same size.

GLOCK magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven GLOCK high-tech polymer. This resists deformation even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions."

This rifle has never been fired and is like new. Magazines have been loaded and used once. I wanted to see how they matched up to my MagPuls, they worked flawlessly.  

Purchased two years ago for $1497 plus tax. Springdale gunshops have them today for $1476.00 plus tax. 

Located in Bentonville.

I'm not interested in trades of any sort.

From the COLT website:
The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched.

The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Magpul MBUS backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, and a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.
