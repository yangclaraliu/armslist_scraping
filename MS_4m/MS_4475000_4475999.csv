Up for auction is a just a beautifully preserved 1983 Colt MKIV Series 70 Government Model 1911 chambered for .45 ACP cartridges. This classic pistol has been extremely well cared for throughout the last 34 years and still retains its factory new condition! Very little usage and limited signs of wear and handling are present on this masterful nickel plated 1911. A statement piece of rare quality. After decades, she is coming out into the light after decades of safe storage. This hand gun is in used Mint condition and such shines brilliantly - Estimated 150 rounds through her (recommend 250 for breakin so not entirely broken in yet!). She's a nickel plated Colt 1911. Only the slightest storage and handling wear is evident. I encourage you to review the hi-definition photos and judge for yourself. The high gloss hand finished nickel is a thing to behold, she glows with a liquid metal effect. Superior condition on this most rare 1911 Government mode. All mechanical actions are factory crisp. Trigger is light and action glassy smooth. The Coltwood sides are sweet, and when you put this semi-automatic 1911 in your hands you realize why she is so often imitated. If you're collecting, this is a prime example. The 1911 has seen just about every battlefield since its creation and proven itself to be the best handgun ever manufactured. Get a nickel variant of the legend for your developing Colt collection. There is a reason so many firearms are modeled after the 1911; for over 100 years, they just can't make anything better - Period. Colt Government Model Build Specifications Safety Lock: Standard Trigger: Short Steel Sights: Low Profile Ejection Port: Standard Hammer: Spur Action: Short Recoil Safety: Standard Grip Loaded Weight: 1,105gr Muzzle Velocity: 251m/s Muzzle Energy: 548 Joule Colt Government Model 1911 History From 1911 until 1970 there were virtually no significant changes to the basic design, but the year 1971 saw the first mechanical ""improvement"" to the 1911-type pistol. Colt redesigned the barrel bushing from a solid cylindrical type to a spring-steel, ""finger collet"" bushing that gripped the end of the barrel, which had also been slightly redesigned with a slight belled end to accommodate the collet bushing. The new ""Accurizor"" barrel and bushing was intended to improve the intrinsic accuracy of the new Colt Government Model pistols, which were then designated the MK IV/Series 70 to differentiate them from all prior variations of the Government Model. While not as capable of superb accuracy as a true hand-fit barrel and match bushing, the new setup nonetheless allowed the typical mass-produced Colt shoot better than the older military-spec pistols with their loosely fit solid bushings and straight barrels The history of the Colt Gov't / M1911 pistol began in early 1900s, when famous designer John M. Browning began to develop semi-automatic pistols for Colt company. In the 1906-1907 U.S. Army announced trials to replace its service revolvers with new, semi-automatic pistol. The army required the new pistol to have the caliber of .45 inch, so Browning designed its own cartridge that fired 230 grains (14.9 gram) bullet, and then, designed a new pistol. In 1911, after extensive testing, the new pistol and its cartridge, designed by Browning and manufactured by Colt, were adopted for U.S. Military service as the M1911. The commercial Colts of this design are known as Government Models Colt's Patent Firearms Mfg. Co. Is well known as the original and most recognized maker of 1911-type pistols. Ever since the design's military acceptance in march of 1911, and the beginning of production in January of 1912 Colt has never ceased manufacturing pistols based off the original 1911 design, known in commercial trim as simply the Government Model. However, in its 90-plus years of production the design has seen many slight evolutionary changes The legacy of the Colt Government Model® is well known. From the battlefields of Normandy, to the jungles of Vietnam, this combat proven firearm has tirelessly served our armed forces for more than a century. Colt pistols have long represented the gold standard in magazine-fed semi-automatic handguns. Modern semi-automatic pistols all trace their roots to the famed Colt M1911 pistol, designed by John Browning and the standard-issue U.S. military sidearm from 1911 to 1985. Colt 1911 pistols and their descendants were in the hands of confident World War I, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam-era servicemen.

The rifle started out as a $300 Mossberg 715T AR-15 style .22 semi-auto. I didn't like the look and feel of the upper and lower, so I removed the barrel, trigger group (these are integrated as a single unit, but can be disassembled for cleaning) and I added a $200 Archangel Marauder G36 Kit (the one designed for the Ruger 10/22) and fabricated the setup to marry to the Mossberg barrel and internals.

There isn't another G36 variant out there chambered in .22 that looks this cool. It gets a lot of attention at the range. 25 round magazine.  Serial Number visible and fully legal since the trigger, firing and barrel assembly have not been switched out and are a single unit.  The rest of the gun is technically furniture and aesthetics.  I'm a CWP holder and will only offer the gun to those who can provide a valid Idaho Driver's License and are able to legally own a firearm.  

I've got several other .22's and now that I completed this project, I'm moving on to the next one.

Offering this at a very good deal considering all the upgrades and work."

Widely recognized in the gun world as the best of the best It has been a decade since we have imported these rifles from Arsenal Co of Bulgaria. This milled receiver rifle sets the standard for superior accuracy and reliability. This modern sporting rifle will easily become the centerpiece of any collection and will be the one handed down from generation to generation. The quality comes from the original hot hammer forged and milled receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and trigger, the cold hammer forged and chrome lined barrel, and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience. All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4.

Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request for an additional $20.00 Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

As you can see in the photos this ammo is clean and loaded in brass cases. Bullets are FMJ and are highly magnetic indicating a steel jacket or a steel core or both. My dremel broke some time ago and it's just too much trouble to dissect a bullet with a hacksaw so I'm not sure of whether the jacket or core is steel or both. I just know the bullets are strongly attracted to a magnet.

I had two crates of this ammo and shot a good deal of it. I fired two Bandoleers full of it this past fall and had two misfires. One was just a dud, and the other fired on the second try. All in all not too bad at all for surplus ammo from the WWII era. Many confuse this Turkish ammo with the Persian surplus stuff that is seen from time to time which is somewhat unreliable. The ammo in this listing is Turkish and not Persian and it is loaded to full military power levels. It certainly seems a bit more potent than some of the modern commercial ammo I've used. Ammo is obviously corrosive primed so just do what I do and take 5 minutes to clean your rifle after use and you'll never have a problem. I've been shooting surplus ammo for over 40 years and have never lost a barrel yet.

REVIEW   ChuckHawk Review   The Savage Arms Model 93R series represents the Savage bolt action entry in the great rimfire rifle sweepstakes. The 93R17 series is chambered exclusively for the .17 HMR cartridge. These rifles represent the pinnacle of rimfire performance as interpreted by Savage Arms.

I have written extensively about the .17 HMR cartridge elsewhere on the Rimfire Guns and Ammo Page, so I will not repeat the whole story here. It is sufficient to say that with a 17 grain Hornady V-MAX bullet at a MV of 2550 fps, the .17 HMR is the flattest shooting, longest range rimfire cartridge on the market. It is the most accurate (factory loaded) small game and varmint cartridge I can remember testing. A good shot with a good rifle can usually shoot groups around 1.0 MOA at 100 yards. The precision with which .17 HMR ammo is manufactured is incredible!

The Savage 93R17 line of rifles is an extensive one. Included are models offering standard contour and heavy (varmint) barrels, and stocks of hardwood, laminated wood, black synthetic, and camo synthetic. Regardless of material, 93R17 series stocks come with detachable sling swivel bases.

All Model 93R17 rifles share the same basic Savage 93 action. This rear locking, cock on opening design features dual extractors and a fixed blade ejector. Cartridges are fed from a removable 5-round box magazine. The two-position safety (push forward for ""fire"") is located immediately behind the bolt handle at the right rear of the action. The ""bottom iron"" is blued sheet metal, and the trigger guard is plastic.

From 2006 onward all Savage Model 93R17 rifles have come with the Savage Accu-Trigger. This is the best rimfire rifle trigger that you will find short of the Olympics, and nothing else in the 93R17's price class even comes close."

For sale in the Roanoke Valley is a Remington 12-A pump action rifle chambered for .22 caliber (22 short, 22 long, 22 long rifle). Approximately 832,000 were made from 1909 to 1936. According to Remington Customer Service, this particular rifle was manufactured in 1921. The Remington model 12 is a slide-action, solid-breech, hammerless, takedown, tube fed, side ejection rifle. 

The butt plate/pad does have a piece missing (as seen in the following pictures). Just so happens Numrich gun parts has some new reproduction replacements in stock if that bothers you.
Here is the link: https://www.gunpartscorp.com/ad/99320.htm#99320A

Also, there is a Marbles R7 tang (peep) sight in nice shape currently attached to the rifle. Apparently the R7 sights are sought after and can be difficult to find from what I've read.



If you are at all serious about this rifle I highly encourage you to check out  the link below of ALL the pictures for this Remington. There are 16 total. Armslist limits the number I can add to this post, you should really see them all.
Here is a slideshow link to all the pictures of the Remington 12-A, you will probably have to copy/paste:

This is a later model, with a roller bearing in the striker channel for a smoother and more consistent trigger pull.  It is in excellent condition, and included are three 17 rd. magazines, the original case & papers, and keys for the built-in trigger lock.  Also included as a bonus is a stainless steel BT guide rod (not installed), which adds a little extra weight to the muzzle to further reduce the minimal muzzle flip this pistol has.

For those not familiar with the M9-A1, here are some facts and some comparisons with the ""Other Austrian Pistol"", the Glock 19:  The Steyr has a similar grip angle, but a smaller diameter and much more ergomonic grip shape. The Steyr has a 4mm lower bore axis, for less muzzle flip and less perceived recoil. The Steyr has a steel frame incorporating longer frame rails and the trigger / sear mechanism (very solid and precise).  This steel frame fits into the polymer grip as a module.  The glock uses its polymer grip as a frame to locate & hold the trigger mechanism, and the shorter frame rails are molded into the polymer grip. The Steyr uses unique fast acquisition trapezoidal / triangle combat sights which are made of steel (easily replaced if you prefer standard rectangular or night sights).  The glock has plastic sights. The Steyr has a shorter trigger pull, with a quicker reset. The Steyr has a two round greater standard magazine capacity (17 rds versus 15). The Steyr has a built-in keyed trigger lock as an additional safety feature. The Steyr was initially designed for the .40 S&W, and then adapted for the less powerful 9mm.  The Steyr's barrel  has a fully supported chamber, and standard rifling to allow use of non-jacketed bullets, while the glock's chamber is not fully supported, and their rifling requires jacketed bullets.  

My price for everything listed is $525.  I prefer to sell, but would consider trades for other firearms, specifically for a full-size 9MM pistol such as a stainless steel 1911, Browning Hi-Power, CZ 75 or SP-01, Canik clones, etc. +/- cash.  I will also consider other (mostly ""tactical"" type) firearms, but generally not hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, or antiques.  I am not desperate to sell.  Thank you."

The TA11MGO-M249 incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Built to exacting standards like our Fast-Attach® suppressors for centerfire calibers, the Ryder 22-A features a patented aerospace aluminum body with rounded ends and flutes to reduce weight with no sacrifice in strength, and is coated with a tough Mil-Spec hard-anodized black finish that resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. At just over three ounces in weight and only 5.4 inches long, the compact Ryder 22-A minimizes effects on your weapon’s weight and maneuverability. The Ryder 22-A features patented pig-nose baffles that provide superior sound attenuation and reduce muzzle blast by precisely directing the gas emitted from each fired round. Built-in spacers between the baffles help to reduce carbon buildup and keep the suppressor clean longer. The indexed, individually numbered baffles are easy to remove, disassemble, clean, and reassemble, and are coated in tough Mil-Spec red hard anodizing that makes cleaning them easier and helps prevent gas and particle erosion. Ryder 22-A’s stainless steel back plate contributes to overall durability. Single-point cut ½ X 28 threads provide secure and easy attachment to an appropriately threaded .22 caliber barrel, with no tools required. Simply screw the suppressor on until hand tight; unscrew it to remove. The Ryder 22-A comes standard with an included assembly/disassembly tool for removing the baffle stack and reassembling it after cleaning and a spud-extension tool that aids in pushing the baffle stack out of the body tube. Just like SureFire Fast-Attach suppressors, Ryder Series suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, helping to conceal an operator’s position and protect both the operator and any team members from permanent and temporary hearing loss while enhancing situational awareness and communication; they reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, helping to conceal an operator’s position and preserve night vision and unobstructed view; they reduce dust signature, again helping to conceal an operator’s position; and they reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. Features • Patented body design has rounded ends and flutes to reduce weight with no sacrifice in strength• Patented pig-nose baffles provide superior sound attenuation• Indexed baffles are numbered for foolproof reassembly; built-in spacers help reduce carbon buildup between baffles• Red Mil-Spec hard anodizing on baffles enables easy cleaning and helps prevent gas/particle erosion• Included assembly/disassembly tool and spud-extension tool for easy baffle-stack removal• Stainless steel back plate increases durability• Single-point cut ½-28 threads provide secure attachment• Tough, attractive Mil-Spec hard-anodized black finish"

It does not disappoint.MaintenanceCleaning the Kestrel .308 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors. With the Kestrel .308 full user servicability is truely a reality.The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to minimize lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to disassemble your silencer is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel .308 will allow up to four times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.SafetyThe Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.MSRP: $599.00Warranty Huntertown Arms warrants its suppressors for life against everything but stupid.  In addition, the Kestrel .308 has a lifetime cleanability guarantee. If at any time you are unable to clean your Kestrel .308, send it to Huntertown and they will clean it for free.Payment We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, money orders and cash. Out of State or Too Far to Drive?

All in a pink lockable case with replaceable and customizable pluck-foam. Everything is brand-new. I only fired five rounds through the revolver just to make sure it worked after I bought it and to sight-in the laser grips at 7 yards. Original box for the revolver is of course also included. The revolver alone cost me $390 from Bud's (not including tax and transfer fee). The laser grips another $189.  The knife, paddle holster, eye and ear protection and ammunition altogether cost me another $200.   So I have nearly $700 into this kit.   I'm only asking $585 Firm.

Anyway, just wanted to make you aware that this is a Non-Sf, hard to come by these days, Glock 21. It comes with 2 15 rd mags, 2 10 rd mags (Keep the libtards happy in libtard states), docs, and factory case. This Glock is truly like new and also has had the slide markings color filled in white. I also have the mags loaded and the 'carry clip' is loaded with Hornady Zombie Killers. LOL...NICE!

Also new to the Recce 7 (MOD 3) is a tuned, Patent Pending baffle system offering the apogee of multi-caliber sound performance. Elite tactical units requested minimal flash signature and Griffin responded by developing a low-profile flash reducer integral to the suppressor. The Recce 7 is CNC machined, and Tig fusion welded for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. Every component in the Recce 7 is manufactured from solid billets of strong, heat treated, high temperature corrosion resistant 17-4 Stainless Steel.
