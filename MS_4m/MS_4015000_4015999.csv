Amazingly accurate one hole groups at 100 yards. 1 1/4"" groups at 300 yards. 26"" air gaged target barrel tapered to .80""  at the muzzle 1:8 twist. Light crisp trigger, bedded, free floated tactical stock, Mueller 4 - 25 x 44 Mil-Dot scope. As shown with bi-pod and sling. 40 rounds of Norma reloads included. The 6.5 140 grain bullet pushes at just over 2700 fps. Very flat shooting. Sighted in at 300 yards it is 4"" high at 100 yards and 2"" high at 200 yards. 6.5 x 55 is well know for its accuracy and power, it is just more popular in Scandinavian countries than here in the U.S. Has more knock down power than a .308 at longer ranges. The tubular Savage Axis action does not flex as much as the model 10 action and is a lot less expensive. I built this one as an experiment to see how accurate the action would be, and I am impressed. I am selling this one , so I can build another one in 6.5 x 284.  I will be traveling a lot this month, so the rifle can be viewed and purchased at U.S Shooting Academy, 6500 East 66th Street North, Tulsa"

I have a like new, made in Russia Saiga AK-47 in 7.62x39mm only shot once just to make sure everything works, and it's perfect, reliable just like a AK should.

This AK has all the required US parts and furniture to comply for to be legal, it takes all standard AK-47 mags and drums, all professionally done.
It comes with a factory shark fin style hand guard, it has a factory side rail to install a scope mount, a front rail to attach a front grip , flash light or laser, on safety bolt hold open. It has a AK - 74 style muzzle break on a threaded barrel secured professionally .
 4 mags 30 rounders Croatian last round bolt hold open.

Even though I have never fired it, I have mounted optics and such. But, there are no discernible marks on the rails, etc. 

This is for the barreled upper/chassis only. No BCG, rails, etc. I will include enough GAP panels to cover the entire hand guard. I do have a set of LaRue Troy flip sights that I would add for $150. 

I also may be interested in selling the chassis sans the barrel. If someone is interested in the OBR Chassis (upper receiver and hand guard only), we can definitely talk about me keeping the barrel. 

$1500 gets the upper. Paypal 4% or USPS MO. If you want the chassis only, we can talk about price."

This gun is a blast to shot. I tested it with 60 rounds to make sure she would feed. I was in a indoor range and the percussion was crazy if a bad guy was in your room and you missed he would still go down because his ears would be busted. It's that loud. Fire balls!! With the sig brace it feels like a 74u and you can really connect no problem out to 50 yards. 100 yards is tricky with the irons but you can mount an aimpoint and you would have no problem tagging out to 150. Comes with two circle two Bulgarian mags ($50 a piece) and the sig brace ($140) and 240 rounds of 5.56.

It has about 70 rounds through it, all factory.  It comes with picatiny rail installed with a Vortex 2-7x32 Crossfire II with Vortex rings, the sling and factory ammo.  The ammo consists of 80 rounds of Winchester 300gr JHP, 20 of Federal 300gr JSP, and 116 rounds of 405gr Remington SP.  It shoots well and no issues with it at all.  There are a few minor scratches on the left side of the stock from hunting, but I could not get anything to show up in the pictures.

I am asking $1,000 for the total package. I am valuing the ammo at $30 a box, it is worth more than that.
I will sell the rifle without the scope and rings, I will leave the rail on with the ammo and sling, for $800.  Or with the scope and rings for $900.
I will sell the reloading supplies for $100 separately.

If you know Chinese SKSs then you know that they began making them in 1956 hence the name “type 56.” This rifle has a 5 digit serial # and does not have a factory/arsenal marking. A serial # of less than 6 digits is dated 1956 or earlier. Some SKS collectors call these “ghost” rifles and they are speculated to be some of the very first Chinese made SKS at the Jianshe Arsenal 26. The bluing has been worn off on the metal that is above wood probably from lots of cleaning and handling. Chrome lined bore looks excellent, no pitting. I cleaned off all the cosmoline and fired approx 100 rds. through it no problems. The serial numbers on receiver, bolt and trigger group all match. The receiver cover is a Russian Tula replacement cover. I bought this rifle back in 2013. It was speculated that this batch came from Albania. This is a very collectable early Chinese example.

The MSRP is $836.  It has just over 100 rounds through it.  From the factory is comes with a matte black Nitron coated stainless steel slide, night sights, hogue rubber wraparound grips, ambi safety, and a 7 round stainless magazine with the pinky extension.  You can also buy a 6 round flush-fitting mag for even greater concealability.  It is widely considered to be one of the very best concealed carry pistols, and makes a great little pocket piece.  It is great for a man or a woman.  The recoil spring is not terribly stiff, like many pocket pistols.  So it is not difficult to rack the slide and chamber the first round.  It doesn't have any of the annoying magazine disconnect features.  It functions more-or-less like a scaled down 1911.  Great pistol at a great price!  I have acquired the SAS variation, which I like just a little bit better than this one.  

My price is firm.  If the page is still active then you can safely assume that I still have it for sale.  I'm not looking to trade, unless I'm trading UP in value.

I have the box, it has the internal cardboard taken out, he got tired of having to fish the magazine out every time he stored the weapon. I've now bought him a Glock, he didn't really like the hinged trigger on the SD when he dry fired it.

Looking to trade straight across for an SKS, I know what my weapon sells for, I also know a standard Norinco SKS isn't worth $600. Will include 25 rounds of Hornady 124gr +P JHP self defense rounds only in trade, NOT included in my cash price!

VA, of Virginia into the United States from 1994 to 1998 only. It is a post ban version of the original Russian Type 3 Milled AK47, produced by Arsenal of Bulgaria. The SLR-95 is a 100% made-in-Bulgaria (unlike the SAM series of Arsenal rifles produced today). The barrel on the SLR-95 is a Steyr cold hammer forged, chrome lined barrel that per Arsenals website is serviceable until 15,000 rounds. 

The rifle is in very good condition, and the fit and finish are superb. There is absolutely ZERO sight canting (not many AKS are factory produced like this), the action and feel of the rifle is incredibly smooth (due to the milled receiver), and trigger pull is very crisp (due to the double hook trigger). The round count on the rifle is at 1,500. The barrel is only at 10% of its usable life, and the rifling is perfect. The rifle has been non permanently modified to accept a standard two tang buttstock in place of the thumbhole ""sporter"" stock it had originally came with. Installing the ""sporter"" buttstock that came on the rifle is as easy as removing the buttstock , lower tang, and pistol grip in its place. Then just insert and install said thumbhole stock. 

I have added a ""target sight"" front post (thinner to see more precise shots at greater distances), and a krebs safety selector (not pictured). This rifle hits a torso sized steel target at 300 yards all day. The rifle does come standard with the SLR series pinned on muzzle brake, which is very effective in mitigating muzzle rise and felt recoil.

Clean green OK title, tag good through March 2015. 65,000 miles and serviced regularly. Never wrecked, no damage of any kind except a few minor scratches from just riding and enjoying it. Tires are real good on it, full service was done less than 6 months ago including a new K&N air filter, valve adjustment, carbs cleaned and synced and new rear brake pads. It runs great and the miles are low for the year model. It handles excellent and very light and neutral but firmly planted feel to the front end. Small oil leak from the weep hole on the water pump because it needs two $5 o-rings replaced, coolant drained and reinstalled and that's it, doesn't affect anything except it drips a little oil. The bike is fantastic in every other way and ready to ride to California and back right now.

I can spend the $20 for the Orings and coolant and fix it myself in an hour and ask about $300 more for this bike or you can easily fix it and save the money.

Clean green OK title, tag good through March 2015. 65,000 miles and serviced regularly. Never wrecked, no damage of any kind except a few minor scratches from just riding and enjoying it. Tires are real good on it, full service was done less than 6 months ago including a new K&N air filter, valve adjustment, carbs cleaned and synced and new rear brake pads. It runs great and the miles are low for the year model. It handles excellent and very light and neutral but firmly planted feel to the front end. Small oil leak from the weep hole on the water pump because it needs two $5 o-rings replaced, coolant drained and reinstalled and that's it, doesn't affect anything except it drips a little oil. The bike is fantastic in every other way and ready to ride to California and back right now.

I can spend the $20 for the Orings and coolant and fix it myself in an hour and ask about $300 more for this bike or you can easily fix it and save the money.

It has several expensive accessories that have been added in the past.

Includes the factory luggage rack and matching painted tail section cover. Also includes a Large Givi Top Box that mounts on the rear and includes the hardware (no key for the box though, never received it from previous owner)

The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post. The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

I found this write-up online for those unfamiliar: 

Polymer frame. Weight: 24.0 oz., Barrel: 4.00"", Magazine: 15 rounds
The Walther P99 grips so good. It feels like it belongs in your hand. The P99 trigger is great for a striker fired gun and would get an 9 out of 10 rating. The trigger in SA mode is short and crisp like an 1911 combat pistol! At the range the Walther P99 feeds all ammo just great with no jams. The poly stock takes the recoil abuse and is good for all day shooting. You have 3 backstrap choices for hand fitment too. The P99 is the perfect police carry hangun, and shoots better than most 4"" barrel pistol on the market. At less than 24 ounces empty, the P99 could work well for concealed carry too. You get 2 mags, plus some extra front sights."

Midway Description: 

Loaded with Hornady's popular V-Max polymer tipped bullet, SUPERFORMANCE Varmint ammunition is filled with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings 100 to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. Because there is no increase in pressure, regardless of the caliber, there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. Plus, SUPERFORMANCE Varmint loads are versatile and will perform flawlessly in all rifles, including semi-autos.

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles.
