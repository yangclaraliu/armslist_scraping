Due to a few really annoying offers: people a brand new 870 WINGMASTER 20ga is selling for $750 at the fin and they do not have any etching engraving Murels etc so in 20 years it will not really be worth Much at all! Remington did not do many of these ESPECIALLY in 20ga the 20ga like this is less than 200 made making it very collectible especially in a few more years. They only offered this 20ga 870 WINGMASTER with the enhanced receiver engraving for 1 year which was 1999 they offered it from 99-04 on 12ga models and they had gold triggers which mine does not since it's the 99 only 20ga."

This things a beast. absolutely 0 blowbye. 4wd works great. I would drive this truck anywhere. it's just a tough ol 12 valve. transmition shifts smooth and it will pull anything you put behind it. it already has a flip up gooseneck ball in the bed ready to tow a gooseneck trailer and has a 2 inch receiver setup also. I've owned this truck for roughly 4 years. It does have some dents and dings as its a 96 model so as far as interior/exterior it's not brand new.has a crack in the winshield but it does perform great and these trucks will last forever. power windows/power mirrors. cruise control it has K&n air intake and a good sounding exhaust. 2 brand new batteries installed about a month ago. I have a clear title for it ready to be transfered to someone and tags are current and up to date. I just bought a 2010 cummins so listing this one for sale since I rarely use it.feel free to text anytime 405-388-695seven I also have a short video of it starting & idling. runs like a sewing machine."

Some room for negotiation in price, but not in any real rush to sell just looking to get rid of some items that don't get much use. Transfer would be at an FFL willing to travel a bit within reason for an interested party. Let me know if there any additional pictures that would be helpful.

Im the first owner of this gun (have original receipt to show everything such as name, date, serial number, price etc), bought it from Atlantic Firearms 2 months ago, which is one of the only two places that you can find this gun at I believe. This gun is absolutely brand new and unfired, which means there is no scratch/wear/marks on the gun of any kind. Comes with box papers and everything it co9mes with from the factory, I'll add 4 brand new HK mags on top of the 3 POF mags it comes with, the HK mags I'm adding are $75 a piece when bought new. This POF model is a ""reverse stretch"" model, which means it can take all mp5 stocks such as the telescopic stock and the folding stock etc if the owner wished so after obtaining proper paperwork.
Taking a loss and selling at $1200 for everything, the mags I'm adding are worth $300 alone so this is the cheapest you can find this gun anywhere, only selling because Im downsizing my collection for a new truck. Text me REDACTED, if the listing is up then the gun is still for sale.

Here is the opportunity to purchase a deluxe autoloader with all the features you need to have a reliable, successful day in the field. Its semi-humpback design, which refers to the pistol grip and rear of the receiver area, allows a sure grip for smaller hands. Additionally, the lightweight profile barrel helps pick up the ivory front sight bead very quickly. Shouldering, the grip, sight plane and weight are all critical factors when selecting any shotgun, either for youth and ladies or for adults. The Silver Hunter Micro Midas becomes the only real choice because of its compact and lightweight handling. The finely cut checkering on the grip and forearm also help to better control the gun.

Got good quality stuff from e-bay and started loading it. Did not like the way the parts fit so customized it in my machine shop.
The laser is very bright and the highest output I could find ( III-B ), it is pressure contact turned on when you grip the pistol stock and is in the rear area instead of the front to protect it and keep it on sight.
Laser makes it a grip, point and shoot from the hip capable..
The illuminated cross-hair sight is tucked in nicely next to the laser and is a natural alaignment with your eye. ( red or green selectable viewfinder ) Use it for slugs and longer distance shooting.
Metal cased flashlight on the nose that works well in the dark on targets.
6 clip side shell holder. ( Gun will hold m11 total : 2 3/4"" Shells.
Leather hand grip on the slide feels real secure and steadies the aim when running slugs. Imprinted with the nickname : death
Mounted a delrin custom machined nose which extends past the barrel so you can store it muzzle down nwithout the barrell touching the floor or ground,  Rubber pads on the sides so when you lay it down , the sights do not touch the table.
Adjustable shoulder strap on swivels.
Adjustable stock with standard rubber shoulder pad.
Back - up flip sights front and rear. ( 3 rd set if your batteries go dead )
Extra batteries for sights and allen keys store in grip handle base.

Why am I selling it. I am a small framed guy and with all the gizzmos it's a bit heavy for me to swing in the house ( home defence use ) A larger set guy or for general all use hunting it's good to go.
Only about maybe 50 rounds have gone through it.
weighs 9 1/2 lbs with 11 shells ( 5 in gun, 6 on clip )

Come with +/-200 rounds of mixed, slugs, buck and bird shot

This thing is seriously cool and nicely done..
Perfect shape, better in person.
Many of the parts are custom machined to fit for the most practical use.
Have all the origional stock parts if you want to revert it back occasionally.
Shoots perfect from the hip with the green laser beam sight.
I have many more pictures with good detail I can forward.
Nice piece of work that was fun to build.

My mindset for the build was that it had to have three very important qualities. It had to be lightweight, extremely reliable, and accurate at short to medium distances. 

What you get is a 16 inch DTI 1x9 mid-length lightweight chrome lined barrel with A1 front sight tower for maximum durability. A2 flash hider, lightweight hand guards with heat shield, A1 upper receiver with fewer moving parts than the A2 which saves weight and adds to the accuracy and durability, AR-15 bolt carrier assembly, standard charging handle, Spikes lower receiver, mil-spec buffer tube and adjustable stock. It's had 120 rounds through the barrel and upper receiver. All the other parts including the bolt assembly, and charging handle are new and unused. Includes two Magpul Pmags. Battlesight zero. 

So why sell a practically new rifle? Because I'm building another and need the cash to complete it. You can't go wrong with this rifle. You're getting an incredible rifle and an awesome price. Just in time for Christmas.
