85,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4558085,For Sale/Trade:  2013 V6 MUSTANG PREMIUM - WITH UPGRADES,"Clarksville, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 20,500","Listed On: Tuesday, July 28, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling my year 2013 V6 Mustang Premium. It is Black, and from the factory it came with the Tech and Performance Package that included alloy wheels, Shaker audio system, Microsoft SYNC/Bluetooth. Upgraded springs, sway bars and panhard bar. Leather seats, garage opener, leather buckets in the rear.

That is just to include some of the stock stuff - the mods I have added so far are:
- AirAid Synthetic Oiled Cold Air Intake
- BBK Throttle Body with new wiring harness
- BBK Chrome Long-Tube Headers with O2 extensions
- BBK Chrome Offroad (no cats) X-Pipe with O2 extensions
- Bama Performance X4 Tuner - tuned to turn off O2 sensors, for the transmission to NOT skip from 1st to 4th gear and modified the shift points and F/A ratio; I will include the tuner and holder for it; Bama provides free tunes for life if you ever add anymore mods.

I dyno'ed it at 349 RWHP - that is more than a Stock 2011-2014 5.0 Mustang. The only other modifications needed are a custom Cat-Back exhaust and steeper gears - it is still sitting on the original diff and 2.73 gears.

It has minor body dings from road travel - gravel paint chips. The only noticeable tweaks are that the far left side of the bumper slightly sticks out from where it is supposed to seat in the fender and there is a small scratch and dent from backing into a concrete pole. It adds character - didn't bother having that fixed.

It is black gloss paint, it is fully tinted except for the windshield - it only has the ""sunshade"" tint. The wheels are stainless steel - they will look better plasti-dipped to black.

Text or email me for specific pictures and the VIN. I will not go any lower unless you trade against the value with weapons.

It is Black, and from the factory it came with the Tech and Performance Package that included alloy wheels, Shaker audio system, Microsoft SYNC/Bluetooth. Upgraded springs, sway bars and panhard bar. Leather seats, garage opener, leather buckets in the rear.

That is just to include some of the stock stuff - the mods I have added so far are:
- AirAid Synthetic Oiled Cold Air Intake
- BBK Throttle Body with new wiring harness
- BBK Chrome Long-Tube Headers with O2 extensions
- BBK Chrome Offroad (no cats) X-Pipe with O2 extensions
- Bama Performance X4 Tuner - tuned to turn off O2 sensors, for the transmission to NOT skip from 1st to 4th gear and modified the shift points and F/A ratio; I will include the tuner and holder for it; Bama provides free tunes for life if you ever add anymore mods.

I dyno'ed it at 349 RWHP - that is more than a Stock 2011-2014 5.0 Mustang. The only other modifications needed are a custom Cat-Back exhaust and steeper gears - it is still sitting on the original diff and 2.73 gears.

It has minor body dings from road travel - gravel paint chips. The only noticeable tweaks are that the far left side of the bumper slightly sticks out from where it is supposed to seat in the fender and there is a small scratch and dent from backing into a concrete pole. It adds character - didn't bother having that fixed.

It is black gloss paint, it is fully tinted except for the windshield - it only has the ""sunshade"" tint. The wheels are stainless steel - they will look better plasti-dipped to black.

Text or email me for specific pictures and the VIN. I will not go any lower unless you trade against the value with weapons.

The new benchmark in bolt-action rifle design.
 The bolt-action rifle was forever changed with the introduction of the Browning X-Bolt. The X-Bolt builds on the proven successes of past Browning rifles, and adds numerous improvements that place the X-Bolt at the top of any side by side comparison. Most notable is an adjustable three-lever Feather Triggerâ¢ system that offers the best feel on any Browning rifle ever. A bolt unlock button works with the top-tang safety to offer enhanced safety while unloading. Styling features offer more compact dimensions for a smaller, quicker, sleeker look and feel, and also trims weight. To ensure the stability of optics, scope bases are attached to the receiver using four screws per base. Innovation is the Browning tradition, and the X-Bolt is just the latest example. INCLUDES 3 BOXES OF Federal Fusion AMMO!! price is firm."

 The bolt-action rifle was forever changed with the introduction of the Browning X-Bolt. The X-Bolt builds on the proven successes of past Browning rifles, and adds numerous improvements that place the X-Bolt at the top of any side by side comparison. Most notable is an adjustable three-lever Feather Triggerâ¢ system that offers the best feel on any Browning rifle ever. A bolt unlock button works with the top-tang safety to offer enhanced safety while unloading. Styling features offer more compact dimensions for a smaller, quicker, sleeker look and feel, and also trims weight. To ensure the stability of optics, scope bases are attached to the receiver using four screws per base. Innovation is the Browning tradition, and the X-Bolt is just the latest example. INCLUDES NIKON PRO STAFF 3x9x40 SCOPE & 3 BOXES OF  FEDERAL FUSION AMMO!!(no box or papers) price is firm."

I'm well aware the Hi Points are cheaper guns - they are big, bulky, don't shoot a ragged hole, and ugly ... but they are pretty reliable and perfectly accurate at defense range. Hi-points always go bang when you pull the trigger, and are very accurate. Please note that most Hi-Points don't include the factory hard case. So it won't win any beauty contests, but that's not a priority when the bad guys come a knockin.
It comes with lots of extras too - Mossy oak grips (installed) and the standard black grips, 3 magazines, ghost ring sights (if you donât like the factory 3 dot sights), nylon holster w/ extra magazine pouch, gun lock w/keys, hard case, and all associated manuals/papers/locks/etc., and a Lifetime Warranty. 
This would make a great gun to leave in your car, or maybe a nightstand gun for a wife/girlfriend who doesn't need the latest high speed / high dollar toy. Especially being a 380, these heavier guns really have no recoil and have nice thick grips to make them actually pretty comfortable to shoot... 

Bad for carry, great to leave sitting on a night stand for the recoil sensitive shooter.

Comes with 3 mags and all the tupperware. The guy I bought it from kept it in perfect condition, firing less than 500 rounds through it. I have not put any rounds through it. He also sanded between the finder grips to get a better grip. When He first took the original sights off, he nicked the rear sight with his tool. It is merely a cosmetic imperfection and would only be unoticed if you're looking for it.

(High Output) and 4""x8"" trailer combo willing to trade, partial trade +cash, or straight cash.

ATV runs great and has awesome power. It's lifted with a new 2,500lbs front mount winch, big tires with very little tread wear, maintenance free battery, and a big gun exhaust system. I currently have the exhaust baffled after the police were called on me as it was too loud and pissing locals off lol. Honestly it is very beastly sounding still. Body panels are beaten up some but still function just fine and don't look bad at all. Has been maintained and stored in closed garaged always!

Trailer is an expertly built all steel 4""x8"". Not sure on who built it but it was made to last for sure. Very heavy and rides smooth. Only issue at all is the passenger tire leaks a little bit of air, not much though. Haven't looked into it as it's never been a problem for me. Lights all work, just doesn't really have a great place to run the wires so it shows on the outside."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."
