Speer Gold Dot® Pistol Ammunition
• Preferred by law enforcement
• Engineered to prevent jacket separation
• Optimal expansion and penetration
• Decisive terminal performance
• Superior weight retention
• Reliable function and feeding

Speer Gold Dot® ammunition continues to dominate the law enforcement market. It's the first high-performance handgun ammunition to be loaded with true, bonded-core bullets. Speer Gold Dot uses an exclusive Uni-Cor® process where they bond the jacket to the core one molecule at a time. This virtually eliminates core-jacket separation, the leading cause of handgun bullet failures. Only the highest quality, nickel-plated brass cases are used for smooth feeding and corrosion-resistance. Famous CCI® primers and low-flash propellants are used for the best ballistic performance. Made in USA. Per 20.

The gun does still have the original night sights that are faint but still visible in the dark. On the inside, bottom of the trigger guard it looks like someone tried to reduce the size of the hump on the guard, it does not effect the way the gun functions, I actually think it feels better without the full hump inside the guard, I'll include a picture of the guard, it's hard to see in a picture.

It can shoot shells up to a 3"" magnum.

As you can see from the photo, it's got some kind of choke tube in it, and it has a padded butt plate and a camo sling.  The condition of the gun and the stock I would rate at 98% perfect...this has been a safe queen for as long as I've owned it (maybe 10 years?).

I am available to meet most days along I-459 from Trussville to Hoover. A bill of sale will be required and I will sell to Alabama residents only...and a carry permit will make things a lot easier for both of us....but is not required in this case.

This gun is utterly reliable, soft-shooting, and surprisingly accurate. It's no Kimber or STI, but it'll out perform a Rock Island (both in terms of accuracy and reliability) any day of the week. It features a grip safety, thumb safety, and a firing pin safety (similar to series 80, but disengaged by the grip safety instead of the trigger). Blued finish is at least 95% in tact. All parts are original factory parts. Price includes one 8-round magazine, one 7-round steel magazine, Plano hard case, and two boxes (88 rounds) of ammo.  I am the second owner.

About the manufacturer: Llama-Gabilondo y Cia S.A. was a Spanish firearms manufacturer founded in 1904. Although Llama produced several 1911 variants over the years, the Max-1 was Llamas equivalent to the Colt Government model. This conformed more closely to the Colt 1911-A1 than any previous Llama, and removed some of the traditional Llama features such as the ventilated rib. However the slimmer mainspring housing from the earlier Llama IX-C was retained, a move considered by smaller-handed shooters to give this model superior handling qualities. The Max-1 was first introduced in 1995 and was produced until 2005 when Llama finally closed its doors.

Compatibility:

The following standard 1911 parts will fit with no modifications required:

Recoil spring, guide rod, recoil spring plug, firing pin stop, magazine, hammer, hammer strut, hammer pin, thumb safety, sear, sear pin.

The following standard parts fit with some minor modification:

Barrel bushing, barrel, firing pin, magazine catch, grip safety, slide stop, trigger, sear spring, disconnector"

I have a bushmaster carbon 15 in excellent shape for sale.  All and all there hasn't been more than 100 rounds through the pipe.  AND NO I'M NOT SELLING THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT. This gun is 100% functional.  I have a couple more AR's I need to make room. 
Now this is the second generation (like the one in the link below). The difference is that bushmaster fixed all the imperfections/complaints. They added a dust cover and a forward assist and metal lined the barrel insert point. The reviews on this 2nd generation are awesome. 
What you'll get:
The gun with no optics. 
2 metal 30 rounds mags

I will post pictures when I get it out of my safe but it's the Dame gun that you see below.  Bushmaster doesn't even have it on their own site because they're still pushing the first generation out.  Lol. Check it or for yourself (close to $900 also).

THE TRANSACTION WILL HAVE TO MEET ALL CURRENT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.  THANK YOU!

The Nikon Fieldscope 82mm ED utilizes either an angled or straight all-metal, O-ring sealed metal body that is waterproof, shockproof and fogproof for use in any weather condition. The body incorporates an ergonomically designed, rubber coated, ridged focus ring for quick focus and easy long-term focus maintenance. Both versions are compatible with common tripods as well as Nikon's exclusive Window Mount for steadier viewing from a vehicle. The hearts of Nikon's Fieldscope 82mm ED scopes are their advanced optical designs and components. The lens glass is a select gradeof ultra-premium ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass that is expertly ground and precisely polished for unexcelled image resolution. The lenses and high-index BaK4 prisms are coated with multiple layers of Nikon's own proprietary anti-reflective compounds to enhance light transmission, provide true color rendition, and deliver flare free viewing, making them ideal for spotting long range game or varmints, or discerning bullet holes in distant targets Both new models incorporate a sliding sunshade for the objective lens that not only reduces the effect of glare on sunny days, but also serves to keep rain and dust off the objective lens in wet or dusty conditions. The Nikon Fieldscope 82mm ED straight body measures 12.8"" x 4.25"" and weighs 56.4 ounces with 25x eyepiece. The angled body version measures 13.3"" x 4.25"" and weighs 56 ounces with the same 25x eyepiece."

Product Information:

CCI is known for making some of the best rimfire ammunition on the market and the Quiet-22 ammunition is no exception. This quiet round produces a report that is 1/4 the perceived noise level compared to standard velocity 22 Long Rifle rounds; making this round perfect for backyard plinking, youth shooting, or shooting in areas where noise may be a concern. This round is ideal for shooters using bolt-actions or single shot rifles (but is perfectly safe in semi-automatics although it might not completely cycle the action). This subsonic ammunition is a perfect choice for shooting through your favorite rimfire suppressor. CCI Quiet ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

The gun is unreal! With the Match slide and barrel the groups look like they are out of a benchrest rifle, and with the RMR I have made shots out to 100yrds EASY. Put 600 rounds thruogh the gun and it has never malfunctioned. I am just getting back into distance shooting and it is not getting used. 

If you are looking to build a RMR gun, this is it! Salient, Agency, or ZEV will cost you 2,500+ and this gun has all the same parts minues the stippling and a ""GOLD"" barrel.

Absolutely do not need to sell, would love to help the gun find a happy home, but will let it collect dust and pull it out to show every blue moon before taking some goofy offer."

The reason it is rare is that it was manufactured specifically for the European market, purchased in Germany and brought back to the US (my grandfather bought it from a military friend of his who bought it new while he was overseas). The differences are subtle, however, with that said I have NEVER seen another one like it for sale online, and I have done a lot of research on it. It took many forum posts and talking to people much wiser than I to even learn it was a European model. The differences are that it doesn't have all the extra engravings on the receiver (only has ""Sweet Sixteen"" on it) and it has factory installed sling swivels (might also be a different type/color wood than usual, but that's only speculation on my end). Also had a knowledgeable seeming employee at Cabela's look at it. While he was a little stumped by it as well he believed it to be a FN High Grade Lightweight Series model based on the serial, but he hadn't seen one without the receiver engravings and factory sling swivels before.

A few specs:
-Serial number: 15188/65 (65 denotes the year, first 5 numbers are the actual serial)
-Fixed Skeet choke (**$ marking on barrel)
-27"" vent rib, Acier special barrel
-Does have the speed loader function (my favorite Browning feature)

This gun was new in box, and was unfired until a couple years ago. I can personally account for every round it has ever seen, 3 boxes (75 rounds total). You can even still see some of the factory grease in the action. Shoots/cycles perfectly, remarkable how a 50 year old gun performs just as well as modern guns. I still have the original box, exterior is ok, styrofoam on the inside is pretty bad/almost gone but again, it is a 50 year old box. All that to say, yes I am asking a premium price for it ($1350 OBO), but I believe it to be a premium gun.

For sale is my last and favorite rifle. Wonderfully accurate , easy to maintain and operate, and surprisingly accurate for this platform (comparative to SKS and other AK formats utilizing 7.62x39). Ive achieved accuracy at 200yrds with this scope by zeroing at 25yrds, a bipod would be beneficial but hand guard and stock upgrades are limited due to NY. 

Comes with everything pictured. Only a couple months old with a couple hundred rounds through it. Cleaned after every outing. Sparkling bore, fun and easy to shoot with low recoil (coming from Mosin's and Dragunov to the Saiga). 

I am leaving the fun of target shooting to pay student loans and other short term debt. Otherwise I would not sell this rifle. Currently Herb Phillipsons (local sports store) has a couple left at 699.99$. I am not sure what import restrictions still exist against Russia, but I know it has caused the price to go up over the past year. Everythings got to go!

Ideal for the Walther collector who wants the guns, and is not so concerned about whether the box is there or not.  Also, ideal for actual use.  The more recent Walther OSP are not as accurate or as good.  The more recent GSP are about equal in accuracy and function.  These guns are in the upper left of the image shown.  The First 2 image are the GSP with a 5 and 10 rd magazine, the third is the OSP.

Important note:  some have said the Armslist email system is NOT forwarding inquiries.  If you receive no response within a day, please email directly at REDACTED, or start by emailing directly.

The OSP is not quite the first ""version"" of this gun, as there are some earlier ones that are slightly different.  The GSP is the first commercial version.  There were a few prototypes before this which were similar, but were one of a kind and not sold commercially.

The OSP, and its follow-on the GSP, are derived from the first really successful ""assault weapon"", the Mauser C96.  The OSP increased the modular nature, the GSP was a further major jump in that modular character.

The first OSP modules do not interchange with any of the later OSP modules.  Some of the first GSP modules interchange (upper section) but with need for some recutting of the grip.  The trigger group interchanges, but not easily.  The magazines are a partial match.  The 10"" GSP barrel can be used with this GSP version, but not with the OSP.

Later model GSP and OSP also are available.  Please note, these guns are assault weapons in some states or towns.  Be sure they can be shipped to you.

Also available, for $3400, is the Walther GSP in nickel in .22 and 32.  This is the 5th version of the GSP, with the grip secured by a bolt below the frame.  This is a unique set, including nickel plated weights.  The nickel guns in general are rare in the USA.  With the nickel weights, it may be one of a kind.

Other OSP and GSP are available as well.  Prices range from about 900 to $1600 depending on the gun.  The OSP and GSP in this set also are available individually, rather than as a set.

Also available is a complete Hammerli SIG P240 set in all 3 calibers, with SN matched box for the .38 gun.   (P240 in .32 only also available, but not pictured.  Looks very similar to the .38).  This set also is illustrated.

Overall condition, all guns mechanically are excellent. Cosmetics are near perfect, but it is not NIB and has had moderate use.  The grip with the gun is the original Mornini, which was used in many of these guns from the factory.  Size is large, but note the Morini grips are designed for longish fingers.  The palm shelf has been recut on this gun, usually needed on the Morini grips to allow them to fit properly.

The guns have had enough use to be past the break-in period for both mechanical smoothness, and accuracy.

Please note, in a few towns or states, this gun may be classified as an assault weapon due to some technical details of the barrel and magazine

When you think of the fire arms company that has been around for a long time no other company can top the Beretta company. The company has been manufacturing arms and firearms since the 1500s that's a long time. The model 92 was one of the first widely adopted semi automatic pistols used by Law Enforcement agencies. It was also the second semi automatic sidearm selected by the united states military. And if it's good enough for our troops it's pretty safe to say it's good enough for us civilians. But, like all models there needs to be a time for upgrades and the Beretta 92G is exactly the upgrades needed for the Beretta 92. This version of the Beretta 92 features a stainless steel barrel, a heavy duty slide with front and rear serrations, dovetail sights, and an upgraded trigger. Anybody who has shot a regular Beretta 92 knows that the trigger has a lot of take up and at first can be a little sloppy well the Beretta 92G solved all of those problems, this trigger is light short and has little take up when in single action mode. This Beretta comes and it's almost new configuration it has the the hard plastic case, two mags, and the original lock from the factory. The original 92G Elite does not have a rail under the frame seen in the second generation brigadiers. This gun is in overall excellent condition."

Bore is shiny and dark rifling. A few handling marks in stock, I have never shot this gun personally so to be safe have it checked before shooting but I know there won't be a problem. Action is smooth and tight. 
Make a reasonable offer I know what they go for. I will also consider trades perferrably other milsurp rifles. Keep in mind these are more valuable then the 91/30s gunbroker has a few from 350-850  so please don't try the $150 offer
