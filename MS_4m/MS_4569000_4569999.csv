The new Citori 725 is the evolution of John M. Browning’s legendary B25 Superposed, now with the modern performance advantage of a Low-Profile receiver. The new 725 receiver is significantly lower than other Citori 12 gauge receivers, yet the 725 shares the renowned durability of generations of Citori over and unders with the same rugged full-width hinge pin and tapered locking bolt design.

With a 725, you get the ""one with the gun"" feeling you want, with the long lasting durability you expect from a Browning over and under. And the features don't stop there. The 725 showcases an all-new Mechanical Trigger (FireLite) that offers unmatched feel and lighter pull weights than ever before. Inflex Technology has also been added to make shooting more comfortable. Experience the benefits these improvements can do for your shooting with a new Citori 725.

Unique to the 725 Sporting Model
Signature 725 rounded fore arm with subtle palm rest is both comfortable and stylish
Barrel porting assists the shooter by reducing muzzle jump, enabling consistent sight plain and quick follow up shots.
HiViz Pro-Comp fiber-optic front sight and ivory mid-bead sight for excellent target acquisition even in low-light conditions.
Five Invector-DS extend choke tubes (Full, Improved Modified, Modified, Improved Cylinder, Skeet)
Beautiful gloss oil finish Grade III/IV Walnut
Gold accented Engraving

Receiver
The Low-Profile steel receiver of the Citori 725 is a triumph of modern design without sacrificing traditional strength, keeping the full-hinge pin and tapered locking bolt design that makes a Citori superior to weaker trunnion designs.
The silver nitride finish on the receiver is as tough as it is beautiful.

Barrel
Ventilated top rib provides a horizontal sighting plane, reduced heat mirage, and a classic sporting look.
Ventilated side rib reduces overall weight and aids in barrel cooling.
Vector Pro lengthened forcing cones provide improved shot patterns and superior durability, even with steel shot.
Invector-DS choke tubes are longer than traditional chokes, allowing for a consistent barrel taper at the muzzle. The double seal keeps fouling gasses out of the threads between the choke tube and the barrel.

Action
The Fire Lite Mechanical Trigger system design features reduced take up, a crip break, and shorter overtravel, resulting in a high performance trigger that doesn't require intertia to reset.
Hammer ejectors quickly and reliably clear the chambers for quick reloading.
Top-tang barrel selector/safety allow you to verify the status of the gun without unshouldering it.

Stock
Close radius pistol grip and palm swell with detailed checkering and classic lines for beauty without sacrificing function.
Inflex II recoil pad absorbs and deflects recoil away from the shooter's cheek, allowing you to shoot comfortably for longer periods of time.



THE BEST TARGET SHOTGUN EVER BUILT. Unlike other Low-Profile guns that rely on undersized trunnions and narrow, tapered pins to lock up their receivers, the 725 still has the rugged full-width hinge pin and transverse mounted locking bolt design of the original Citori. That means the 725 Sporting is built strong enough to compete year after year and round after round of breaking clay targets. While this kind of use will wear out lesser Low-Profile over and unders, it simply wears a Citori in.

If that isn't enough, the new Fire Lite Mechanical Trigger delivers a smooth pull with a lighter squeeze than other Citori sporting guns. Inflex Technology recoil control keeps you shooting all day with none of the beat down feeling you can get with lesser recoil pads. Not to mention the totally redesigned Invector DS choke system gives more consistent patterns with more predictable scaling of chock constrictions than ever before. When you choose a choke for a certain shot you know you are getting what you need.

With all the strength of the legendary Citori, plus all the performance and recoil absorbing advantages of a lower profile, the 725 is the total performance package that will have your competition running scared."

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

Beautiful grips. The pictures don't do it justice. The revolver feels amazing in the hand. Great bore, extremely tight lock up and solid action. Double and single action work smoothly and function flawlessly. Trigger is awesome; not too easy, but not an old heavy trigger like a nagant! Smooth.
This is definitely a tough shooter and reliable revolver. 
The nickel has been refinished at some point in time, but I have no idea when in history this took place. It was professionally done, however, and that is plain to see. 

Overall great condition, with minor specks here and there on the finish simply from age. 

Open to trade offers (anything except .22s, really), especially military surplus weapons. Shoot me an email, worst I can say is ""no thank you"", but I'll consider all offers. Firearms only, preferably, but may also be open to .30 carbine, .303, and .45 ACP bulk ammo.

I started a super lightweight build but need school books more. The current weight with all of the components listed installed is just shy of 850 grams, which is just shy of 30 ounces. 
All that remains to complete the rifle is a buffer assembly, bolt carrier group, barrel, handguard, gas tube, gas block, muzzle device, and a sight system. 
For the inevitable barrage of people bashing me for listing a non-complete AR for this price, do yourself a favor and research what I've got so you don't make yourself look bad.

It has been meticulously maintained and cleaned. 

I have 4 P-Mag's that will come with it along with the original 20rd steel magazine it came with. It has Mag-Pul flip up sights, and a fore grip that can also be used as a bi-pod. I bought it new and do have the original case which is actually a nice hard case. 

I would estimate around 1000 rounds have been put through it. Anyone who knows about these guns, especially Rock River, know that is not much considering it has been cleaned and maintained throughout.

-functioning charging handle like 5.56 version
-fully adjustable sights

I have put probably 200 rounds through it.

$500 for rifle with TWO additional unopened 25 round magazines AND a box of .22LR ammo (>200 rounds). 

Yes this is THREE total 25rnd magazines, not the 10rnd mags that they often come with). These are hard to find.

Sorry no trades, I need the cash since I am saving for an engagement ring. Can also take credit cards (I have a square card reader).

New Orleans, La.

Car runs and has a clean title. It is about 80% restored I guess. Motor has $4000 in it alone.

500 miles since rebuild.

Motor: bored 30/10 with Edlebrock carb, intake, valve springs, cam, timing chain/gears. Crane Cam roller rockers and hardened push rods. Summit racing pistons/rings. New oil pump and fuel pump. Converted the alternator to a one wire set up and an HEI distributor to get rid of points system. Clutched cooling fan from a 1991 Mercury Grand Marquis. (The original stiff bladed fan made an insane amount of noise.)

Exhaust: Thrust glass packs with side dump just in front of the rear tires. Sound great with a low rumble but too loud.

Brand new aluminum racing radiator.

Trans: T-5 from a 1994 Mustang Cobra, new clutch plate, hydraulic clutch, trans completely rebuilt at same time as motor. New drive shaft. Rebuilt 8' rear from a 1966 Mustang, replaced 2.79:1 gears with 3.50:1 gears with new trans. 

All new suspension. Replaced exterior lighting with HiD and LED.

Steering: Unisteer manual rack and pinion ($1000). Complete 'Granada Swap' on front spindles. I used the front spindles from a 1977 Granada for the disc brakes and a larger braking surface. Replaced the single cylinder (Suicide cylinder) master brake cylinder with a new 1974 Maverick master cylinder. New brakes all the way around.

Interior is in awesome shape. I currently have 2006 Mustang GT seats installed for the high back and head rest that the original seats did not have. I installed torque boxes and sub-frame connectors. Replaced the front floor boards and sanded then painted the interior and underneath with bed liner.

I have the original seats in my garage under a cover. I also have like 3 boxes of parts to go with the car as well as almost all the receipts and work I did to the car. 

What still needs to be addressed with the car: 

Minor body work. There is very little rust on the car. It has been garage kept since I bought it 5 years ago.

There is a 'clunking' noise from the left rear of the car, I think this could be the left rear axle. This just started happening and I haven't been able to look into it. Steering is still a bit stiff since there is less than 500 miles on the car since I installed the new rack and pinion.

The reason I am selling is that I had surgery to rebuild my left elbow and left wrist so can't really turn wrenches as well anymore. Also, I am retiring 01 Sep 15 and do not have the money to finish the car like it should be.

This is my photobucket album for the car. Let me know if you can get in to it.

Rifle has some wear, but is still in good condition (was teaching my son and shooting it this evening still). It'd been drilled (and tapped?) to add scope bases. I'd always shot it with open sights and am not sure which bases would fit it.

A single screw holds the barrel to the stock. The screw can be tightened and loosened with a coin. This is an original ""take-down"" rifle. With the long barrel, and long sight radius, it's a quick handling, nice shooting rifle. I enjoy the rifle, and am only selling it to fund another project.

I built this pistol from a police trade in (Maryland State Police, if memory serves) gen 2.

I built it with steel challenge matches in mind, but it’ll work well for most any type of pistol competition (USPA, IPDA, etc). I decided to change to 1911 in 9MM so the Glock I just sitting around going to waste, total round count on the pistol since reworked – about 600.

Mods include: 
Lone Wolf match grade barrel 
Lone Wolf “Pro Pick” trigger kit (3 ½# disconnector, mid weight striker spring, 6lb trigger spring, ultimate trigger stop)

Dawson fiber optic front and rear sights 
Extended slide release and take down levers 
Hard chrome plated slide by Rock Your Glock
A Grip grip enhancer sleave
Those with a keen eye will notice the finger grooves on the front of the frame that the gen 2s didn’t have. What I did was cut the finger grooves off a Hogue grip sleeve and glue them onto the front of the frame, under the A Grip wrap. I used a small amount of silicone glue, so if you don’t like the feel they can easily be peeled off.

I am posting a high end custom duel action knife to trade for handgun or handguns. The knife is a Doc Hagen (Please research his work) duel action high end hand made folding automatic knife. This knife is actually duel action (manual & auto) so you have the choice depending on location. I had Doc make this for me to carry as my dress pocket knife but at a little over 9"" it is a bit large for me. The fit & finish are perfect. The action both manual and auto are butter smooth and fast. The handles are white bone and blade is polished S30V so it is tough enough to be a user. I am 61 years old and have been collecting auto knives for over 35 years and this is one of the nicest I have had. I paid $700 for it. the knife also has custom file work on the spine and liners.
I will list the handgun trade options.
Cash price is $575 firm

Also up for grabs is a Beretta Gold Mallard (12 gauge) that has had 6 shells down the pipe and is in A-1 condition. Both of these firearms where a part of my inheritance from my father passing and I have no need for hunting or skeet guns. I have researched both firearms and know there value so any low ball offers will not be recognized. I will make a very handsome price on a package deal for both Beretta's. Both models are 2005 and I will be willing to let go of them both for $3100.00. While the Pigeon is valued at $3300.00 and the Gold Mallard (A-1 Condition) warrants a $1200.00 price sticker. If one would like to see the pics of the Mallard I have it for sale on Arms List (only one listed). All laws apply and will be accompanied by a Bill of Sale, prefer those with a CCW license and I may lower the price for a more secured transaction. Only trades I am interested in is Kel-Tec KSG,  FnH PS90 (any 5.7 NATO family), 44 Magnum revolvers and Desert Eagle Bi-Tone chambered in 357 Magnum. I am not hurting for money and in no way pressed to sell either of these firearms. I am not trying to price gouge anyone and would like to see these go to the right person and shared the same love for the sport as my father did.  More pics of either firearm are available upon request, I am willing to travel to meet but w/my work schedule one must be patient and reasonable with time constraints.

 Is in almost new condition, got it new a few weeks back and have only put a 100 rounds through it.  This is a TALO special edition so it comes with Ameriglo steel sights and a fiber optic front post.  Put in a 3.5 connector and it comes with 4 magazines.  Also has a brand new Lone Wolf 9mm conversion barrel thats threaded, havent fired it yet.  This one is ""blind marked""  so it doesnt have the big Lone Wolf logo on it that some people dont like.  Don't have any dedicated 9mm mags yet, however it will feed and fire 9mm from the .40 mags.  Will of course come with the stock .40 barrel and Glock case.  Will not trade/sell the conversion barrel without the gun.

Just interested in other quality 9mm handguns right now.  Particularly interested in a Walther PPQ, HK VP9 or P30 SK, Sig P226, maybe a Beretta 92a1 or M9a1 or XDm, but fairly open, so let me know.  Not really looking for other .40's right now, but you can try me.  No Taurus's or long guns, thanks!
