The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector."

This firearm is pretty close to new, and only has 50 rounds down the pipe. 

Previous owner never fired it, but he did send it into SIG Custom Shop to get the nickel controls ($200) before I purchased it. This is a gorgeous firearm.

Slimming down the collection a bit to make room for new stuff. Would rather sell a few things than spend a bunch of $$ on a new safe!

**Found the SIG case for it, so now it comes with everything!

Asking $700 FIRM for this. These things go from $800-$900 new, plus the controls from SIG Custom were $200. You're getting an $1000-$1100 firearm for $700. Please don't try and lowball me, the price is non-negotiable and priced low to sell fast. I got a good deal on this, and figured I'd pass on the savings to someone else. 

Easiest way to contact me is by texting REDACTED.

Thanks for looking!

Most accurate handgun I ever fired. No marks scratches or dings. Less than 100 rounds fired through it. Very comfortable to shoot with little recoil and easy to conceal. Will only sell to KY resident, prefer concealed carry holder. No trades. 

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine in the 9mm Luger version. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry."

From the Company
Survival Armor® has brought together some of the best minds from the US ballistic protection industry combining well over 75 years of experience. With that experience you get patent-pending technologies that afford quality products to end users.
Survival Armor® goes beyond the standard NIJ template for production of their armor. They felt there was a need in the market for armor that allowed wearability, as well as, having the maximum coverage that concealable armor can allow. Survival Armor chose not to copy existing armor templates, but rather come up with their own new design for maximum coverage and protection. This path allowed them to enhance the NIJ template and design more coverage in areas of concern by officers today! More coverage equals peace of mind for the wearer, which leads to more armor being worn, which translates to more officers surviving…and that’s what theyr’re about… Survival!"

According to the serial numbers it was manufactured in 1987 at the FN Herstal plant. The bore is in excellent condition. I tested it out at the range shortly after buying it and it feeds standard ball & hollow point ammo like a champ. I ran about 150 rounds that was a mix of brass, nickel plated, and steel cased ammo through it with no problems. The gun comes with a 13 round factory mag but Mecgar makes 15 rounders which folks have had good luck with if you’re looking for a more modern magazine capacity. The finish is an epoxy coating which is worn but the metal underneath it is in great shape. This was a trade-in from Austrian security forces and like most such guns looks to have been holstered a lot and fired very little. I have left the gun completely stock, as it left the FN plant, so the springs are all as-issued and the magazine disconnect is still intact. 

If you're looking to own a piece of history without breaking the bank this is a great opportunity! Most Browning Hi-Powers cost double the asking price and this one has a neat history as an actual fielded service pistol.

The xdm is ready for a beginner to get into competition shooting. It also has the really nice case that xdm's come with, and the holster/mag holster/loader/interchangeable backstraps that come with them. It has a talon rubberized grip tape on it which matches up to all the molded bits on the frame and looks really nice, and also gives a really nice grip. All together its about $700 of gun and upgrades. The reason I want to trade for a G19 is because I want something smaller that I can carry since I decided to do long range competition instead of uspsa/ipsc style competition.

Must be able to do a face to face trade, I dont trust sending guns through the mail. Ive heard horror stories of being ripped off with no recourse when the cops refuse to help. Also, the 9mm conversion barrel in the first pic is not included unless you want it for an extra $100 or some extra stuff with the g19."

The G43 is Glock's subcompact, slimline, single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43
is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is
ultra-concealable, accurate, and fantastic for all shooters regardless of
hand size. The grip has a built-in beaver tail design which allows the
shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the
grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine
catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the
same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other Glock
pistols.

Our model performed EXACTLY the same against the wooden bow! It was documented on video  which can be seen on the Odinson Archery Facebook page. When testing our bows against the other expensive models sold in China, our bows performed slightly faster than those Chinese models.

""Just got my new PVC bow from Odinson Achery and it is superb. I own several bows, take-down survival, longbows, recurves, etc. but this is my first made from PVC - I can't believe how light it is! And very strong. I feel comfortable that I could bugout, hunt or whatever with it and not need to worry about it getting damaged by hard use. I'm pretty rough and tumble in the woods, cheap gear never lasts with me very long. No worries here""  -- Matthew M.

Why Should You Buy a PVC bow?

Our Odinson Archery pvc bows have been tested against MANY different styles of bows. In performance evaluations, we have documented on our page video evidence of penetration tests with our Odinson Archery bows. Our 60# model was tested against a 60# hickory longbow. Our model performed EXACTLY the same against the wooden bow! It was documented on video  which can be seen on the Odinson Archery Facebook page. When testing our bows against the other expensive models sold in China, our bows performed slightly faster than those Chinese models. Why not spend half the money as well as the pride of supporting local craftsmen by BUYING AMERICAN?  Our bows have also been sold and tested in more harsh environments such as Alaska where they have performed flawlessly and without issue. Many have purchased our bows so they may take up bowfishing. Once thing about our PVC bows is that no special care needs to be taken to waterproof them......THEY ALREADY ARE!

 While others have made PVC bows, Odinson Archery has PERFECTED the process!

See what others have said about our bows:

""Just got my new PVC bow from Odinson Achery and it is superb. I own several bows, take-down survival, longbows, recurves, etc. but this is my first made from PVC - I can't believe how light it is! And very strong. I feel comfortable that I could bugout, hunt or whatever with it and not need to worry about it getting damaged by hard use. I'm pretty rough and tumble in the woods, cheap gear never lasts with me very long. No worries here""  -- Matthew M.

""Excellent products and service. Pricing was very reasonable. I bought two hand crafted bows from Odinson Archery. Shipping was prompt and the bows arrived in perfect condition. My son and I have been flinging arrows each available evening, since they arrived."" -- Shea M.

""I purchased the Comanche and the Assyrian bows and they are awesome! They are very powerful and very cool. Also, I have the Utlever hand release and they work great as well. Great customer service too. Two thumbs up.""  --  John T  (US Army)

""Awesome bows and great shipping time to Alaska. Highly recommend."" -- Dragan S
