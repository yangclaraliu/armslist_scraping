Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 19oz in the Blued version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.

Very light rifle, about 8lbs with bipod and scope.  The synthetic stock looks good and feels good and came with fiberglass bedding from the factory.
Detachable 3 round magazine. 
Smooth 3 lug bolt--stainless steel, blued barrel good looking hunting rifle capable of taking down anything in North america and at 200+ yards.

Has a Leupold VX-3L 3.5-10x 50mm objective with the cutout on the bottom for lower mounting, fine duplex reticle.  Not really target turrets, but you don't have to remove any covers and they have numbers and markings to correspond to the 1/4MOA click adjustments.  Very clear picture.

Rounds for this are fairly pricey which got me started on reloading I have about 200 fire formed brass and a box of 50 unprimed unfired Hornady brass that is annealed along with plenty of high grade hunting bullets (250gr Barnes MRX with the ballistic tip and Tungsten cores) as well as some 200gr Nosler CT ballistic tips for varminting.  If you like I can load up enough hunting rounds to last you pretty much forever if you're even a decent shot.
Also have some Lapua 250gr boat tail hollow points that I used to determine my MOA adjustments and play around with different zero settings as they are much cheaper.
If you reload I'll also throw in the dies as I'm selling to buy a 300 win mag and will not have use for the reloading components or dies.

Comes with an upright case that is airline approved--I've flown with it without issue--and some cleaning supplies and odds and ends.  Also I have two spare magazines which are about $50 a piece.

asking $1300 for everything or $800 without the scope.
recently moved here, so don't let the area code fool you:

The serial number on this Colt is C153591, which was manufactured at the Colt Plant in Hartford, Connecticut in 1928. The serial number range for Colt Government Model Pistols in 1928 was C152,000 to C154,999, which is a small production run of only 3,000 pistols that year. It is important to note that there was no military 1911A1 production from 1925 until 1936, only commercially available Government Models in the 1911A1 configuration, so the only examples for the Colt collector from this decade are these Government Models. Colt took the opportunity to not only capitalize on the popularity of the pistol based on its service in WWI, but to also continue to refine the design for any future military contracts. Colt's commercial production of the 1911 began just after the military contracts were manufactured. The first fifty Colt Model 1911 Pistols were crated and shipped on January 4, 1912. The first commercial Government Models 1911, serial number C1, was shipped from the Colt factory on April 13, 1912. When Colt began to experiment with design modifications following WWI, they did so with the commercially available Government Model 1911. The first of what became the 1911A1 pistol rolled off the Colt production line in October 1923, at serial number C135,000. The newly designed Colt Government Model 1911A1 incorporated the finger relief cut on the frame/receiver, the arched and checkered mainspring housing, and the fully checkered walnut stocks. The first military Colt 1911A1, which was known as the Transition Model, began at serial number 700,000 in 1924 and only 10,000 of this model were produced before military pistol contracts ceased for over a decade. The next military contract Colt 1911A1, serial number 710,001, would not be manufactured at Colt until 1937.

The Receiver (sometimes referred to as the Frame) on this pistol retains 99% of the original Colt high quality ""dull"" blue finish. As both Charles Clawson and Joe Poyer note in their respective treatises on the Colt 1911 Pistol, the ""dull"" blue finish used by Colt was only slightly less reflective than the earlier glistening ""oil finish."" Once the finish was applied, the worker polished the blued steel to what was known as a ""fine finish,"" which is the polishing stage just below the ""oil finish."" As Poyer notes, the new ""dull"" finish was ""dull only in comparison to the high gloss ""oil"" finish, which was discontinued on the Colt Government Model around serial number C10,000. The right side of the Frame has the serial number ""C153591,"" with the correct vertical, sans serif ""C"" and the numbers are the ornamental serif font that slants to the right. Colt used this font format for Government Model serial numbers from serial number C130,000 to C198,000. The serif ""C"" had previously been used but it was dropped by Colt for a short period around serial number C130,000 and did not reappear again until serial number C170,001. The ""GOVERNMENT MODEL"" stamp is sans serif and is correctly to the rear of the slide stop in hole. Both the Government Model nomenclature and the serial number stampings are as crisp as the day they were first made.

At the top right portion of the Trigger Guard flat on the right side of the Receiver is the crisp, sans serif ""51"" stamp, which is the Colt Assembler's Mark. The Assembler's Mark in this location on Colt Government Model 1911A1s began at serial number C130,000. The top left side of the Trigger Guard flat on the left side of the Receiver has a crisp ""1"" Commercial Inspection Mark above the crisp, stylized ""V"" and ""P"" stamp set inside an inverted triangle, which is the Colt Verified Proof stamp. The top of the Receiver, just to the right and rear of the disconnector at the 5 o'clock position is the correct sans serif ""S"" stamp, which is the Colt Commercial marking for ""sales,"" as opposed to the ""G"" stamp for government contracts. Just above the ""S"" stamp, at the 3 o'clock position, is the Colt Commercial Inspection Marking. The Receiver on this Colt is simply beautiful. The interior portions of the Receiver retain nearly 100% of the original blued finish with virtually no wear at all. The internal portion of the Receiver at the recoil spring shroud retains 100% of its original blued finish with no wear noted. The internal wall that serves as the facing portion of the Receiver for the Grip Safety and Mainspring Housing retains 100% of its original blued finish. The barrel recess at the front of the Receiver retains 100% of its original blued finish. The Feed Ramp is correctly polished to the white and shows no scratches from feeding or any wear whatsoever. The area around both the top and bottom side of the disconnector hole retains 100% of its original blued finish with no wear noted.

The area of the Receiver that is under the grip panels when they are installed retains 100% of the original blued finish with slight brown discoloration in places, which is probably from the original oil finish on the stocks. The front grip strap and trigger bow, areas that ordinarily show the most wear on 1911 pistols, both retains 100% of their original blued finish with minor surface scratches seen on close examination but in remarkable and beautiful condition. The Ejector is solidly in position and retains 100% of its original finish with no wear noted at all on its leading edge, which is another indicator that this pistol remains unfired since it was manufactured. All four stock screw bushings are securely screwed to the Receiver and all retain 98% of their original blued finish. The Plunger Tube on the upper left side of the Receiver retains 98% of its original blued finish. The rounded ends of both the Slide Stop Plunger and the Safety Catch Plunger correctly remain in the white and are polished bright. There is a very faint slide catch line on the left side of the Receiver arcing downwards towards the left side finger relief cut but it is not deep and appears to only go through the blued finish layer. The only wear of note on the Receiver is a small area just above the finger relief cut on the right side and a small area just above the right side trigger guard. The rest of the Receiver is pristine and truly exhibits the fine finish and lack of wear consistent with an unfired weapon."

Pistol has had a couple hundred rounds through it, but lacks any serious wear. In excellent condition to say the least. Barrel is pristine, gun is clean as new as I spent an hour today taking the whole thing apart to clean and lube it obsessively. This gun has been loved and well maintained, has NEVER had a problem that wasn't directly due to bad ammo. Has only been ""broken in"", if that's really a thing for a quality pistol. I can perform surgery with this at 50 yds, but I own a p226 and simply don't rationalize having both. This is SIG quality at a budget
You probably know a SIG SP2022 is, but in case you don't, here is a brief explanation:
The SIG Pro is a short recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. It uses a traditional Browning cam-operated locking system. The frame is made from polymer, with detachable grip panels. Grip panels can be easily replaced and are available in several different sizes and shapes. Basically, it's SIG's hammer fired competitor to the Glock. 
Would consider trades, what I really want is a SIG 225 though. Feel free to make an offer, just don't be sad if I turn it down. 
I am the original owner of the firearm, and as such I will need you to sign a basic firearm transfer form, you will need your NV drivers license. This protects both the buyer and the seller"

The Battlelink Utility Stock is the evolution of battlefield technology. Manufactured using a specially developed reinforced, super tough polyamide from DuPont's Military Plastic Division, and with advances in materials, this allows for an unsurpassed weight to strength ratio and results in a stock that is lighter and stronger than anything similar currently on the market. Putting the stock to your shoulder is the foundation of any stock. Holding true to the basics while adding functionality was Mission First Tactical's goal. With heavy input from operators from all spectrums they saw the need to make a stock that adapts to the users demands. This stock adapts and changes to your environment or operational needs, from storing additional items to utilizing custom accessory mounts and is able to accept any type of sling configuration. There are three sling slot options and two quick detach mounts, forward and rear, and the cage offers multiple hand hold options. MFT’s accessories can easily be mounted utilizing the sling slots and accessory rails, this includes Garmin 401 Mounts or an adjustable cheek piece. Taken as a whole, this makes MFT's stock superior in today's AR accessories market.

Fitted to the Task-And The Shooter

The two overriding questions that must be asked when purchasing a pistol are: How is it going to be used? and By whom? 

The P250 makes those questions much less critical by being adaptable to a variety of tasks and a variety of shooters. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers. And, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes."

Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

With high velocity practice target (worth 100$ by itself) comes with three bolts, quiver, scope with multi-crosshairs, original box and manual. It also has the crank cocking mech installed. (I think that's worth like 100$ too) I'd either like to sell it outright for $300, or trade it for a nice pistol. Prefer .40 cal, .45, or .357 magnum. I like colts or Springfield armory. Cash is king. This crossbow is deadly within 100yds. Highly accurate, it's not junk, so I don't want to trade for junk. I'd also consider trade for a wasr 10, or better. Thanks for looking. 
EDIT: I've had this on here for quite a while, some interest, but no buyers yet. If your interested, this is the rock bottom I'll take, it really is worth much more...look it up.. I'm trying to save up in sales for a Walther ppk...thanks for looking."

Details
This 223 Remington cartridge is loaded with M855 penetrator projectiles ideally suited for barrier penetration. This load is not to mil-spec requirements as it is loaded with lower 223 pressures. Additionally, you will note that the projectiles do not have green tips which is a military indicator to differentiate the projectiles. These are the same projectiles as the mil-spec loads used but they have not undergone the cosmetic dipping process.

This ammo is manufactured from once fired brass in Montana and is accurate, reliable and American made.

This remanufactured ammo is perfect for a day of sharpening your skills at the range with your favorite AR-15.

Glock's Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit.

This is a heavy duty trailer with a 3500 lb axle and 15 inch wheels. The back gate is removable and turns into two ramps that hook into the back of the trailer very nice feature. Keep in mind this is not one of your cheaper Lowe's or northern tool trailers. It is made by Load Star and originally cost around $1400.

The gun came with a holster also from Sig and an additional grip. I put 3 mags through it with 115 gr fmjs; nice recoil. I like the gun it is a great 9mm but I own several HK pistols and just prefer to stick with one company that I can interchange magazines with. I repeat I really do like the gun but I know I won't give it the attention someone whom likes Sigs would. I am asking for $550.00 for all but I am willing to negotiate. If you have any HK pistols maybe we can work something out. Please feel free to contact me, I'm a LEO so I plan on doing the sale with proper paper work. Thanks."
