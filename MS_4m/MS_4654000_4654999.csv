This is a Palmetto State Armory 'Stealth' lower. It's called a stealth because there is no Palmetto State logo on either side of the magwell. There is also a Rock River Arms lower parts kit installed with mil-spec trigger and A2 grip. The takedown pin, takedown spring, takedown detent, buffer detent spring and buffer detent are all currently out of the lower because there is no buffer tube installed. I have them in a small ziploc and they of course come with the lower. Also, I upgraded the mil-spec trigger guard to a Magpul MOE Polymer guard. I shot less than 100 rounds with this lower. There is a very small scratch next to the bolt catch.

I paid $89 plus shipping for the lower, a $25 transfer fee, and $55 for the lower parts kit. I'm only asking $80 for it all. I will expect the buyer to sign a typed transfer letter, and will need to see and take a picture or photocopy of both a driver's license AND a concealed carry permit. If you don't have the permit, or you are not comfortable with these terms, we can do the transfer through my local gun shop in Virginia Beach and they will charge a transfer fee."

weighing you down, take a load off. The Henry Big Boy Carbine is a modern
carry-over of the 'Trapper' classics of the past. It combines all the
features of Henry's legendary Big Boy rifle with the quick handling of a
shorter, lighter carbine barrel length which decreases barrel weight by
almost a pound. It's the ideal brush gun for tight spaces, but don't let
its compact size fool you. The shorter barrel gives up nothing in accuracy
to the regular Big Boy. And like the classic Henry Big Boy, the attention
to detail in the design with great western styling including the large loop
lever makes holding this rifle as thrilling as it is to shoot. The 16.5""
octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn
rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded
front-sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 7 rounds. Both the
straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut
accented with a brass barrel band and Henry's recognizable brass receiver.
All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made
Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods
today. The .357 Magnum can also shoot .38 Special rounds. Whether you're
looking for the perfect gun to saddle up with or to hog hunt across the
Florida backwoods, the Henry Big Boy Carbine is the big shot in a small
package you've been waiting for.

Is one of the most accurate snubs I own with excellent trigger pull. Great carry gun and have an extra round opposed to the new airweights.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."

Beautifully grained wood stock.  I took it in trade and already have other 10/22s.  
   The Ruger® 10/22® is one of the most popular, and widely used rimfire rifles in the US. And justifiably so—the 10/22 has had a solid reputation for reliability and accuracy for over 50 years, making it a favorite for target shooting, plinking, and small game hunting. The standard 10/22 Carbine comes with a hardwood stock, a blued barrel, and a satin black finished receiver. The 10/22 utilizes a blowback semi-auto action, and a 10-shot rotary magazine, both of which are legendary for reliability. The hammer-forged barrel locks into the receiver by a unique 2-screw, V-block system that provides unsurpassed accuracy for a mass-produced rimfire rifle. The Carbine model comes with a fine, gold bead front sight and an adjustable, folding rear sight. The included scope base screws onto the drilled and tapped receiver, and is compatible with both Weaver®-style and 3/8"" tip-off scope rings. An extended magazine release allows for rapid reloading. The short and light 10/22 Carbine handles incredibly well by adult and youth shooters alike. The popularity of the Ruger 10/22 has led to a myriad of after-market 10/22 accessories, making it one of the most customizable firearms ever made. The Ruger 10/22 Carbine is an indispensible, go-to firearm for any American serious about shooting, training, self-defense, or hunting. Made in USA."
