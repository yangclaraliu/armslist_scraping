FROM THE LWRC website, but my rifle does not have the fluted barrel. 
The IC Enhanced rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels that are spiral fluted to reduce weight. They include a two position gas block, with a bayonet lug, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. We complete the upper with our modular rail in a nine inch length. This handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard.

The IC-Enhanced is perfect for those who wish to have a fluted barrel along with an adjustable gas block, allowing you to shoot suppressed. 
The IC-Enhanced is essentially identical to the IC-SPR mechanically; with a shorter rail and adjustable gas block.

This is a Century Arms Vz2008 in 7.62x39mm.  I have modified it heavily from it’s original configuration by adding an aluminum NEA picatinny gas tube cover and handguard (handguard compatible with Troy Alpha direct attach accessories and rail sections, each slot is also a QD sling mount), a Lanco Tactical Grip Stop, FAB Defense pistol grip with storage compartment, Stormwerkz stock adapter (straight angle so recoil goes directly back into your shoulder as opposed to back and up with the factory angle, this helps with accurate follow-up shots), ACE Ultralight stock with rubber recoil pad (also able to swap w/ AR-15 buffer tube for collapsible stock of your choice), Zahal tactical bolt release (allows for trigger finger to release bolt after magazine change), Zahal ambi mag release (allows for release of mag w/ trigger finger for faster reloads), and 10 30 round magazines (ammo not included) all topped by a Primary Arms MD-ADS 2MOA red dot optic (lower 1/3 cowitness w/ iron sights and over 6 year battery life).  I’ve put close to 2,000 rounds through with gun without a single bobble.  The irons and optic are sighted in at 100yds and I was getting about 2MOA groups with Wolf Military Classic ammo and about 1.5MOA with Winchester PDX1.  For those unfamiliar with Vz’s, they are light and handy compared to AK47’s coming in around a full pound lighter even with a milled receiver.  The mags allow for last round hold open for visual ID that the gun is dry instead of jammed when it goes click instead of bang. The barrel is US made and around 1MOA more accurate than your standard AK47.  Specs below:

The SPHINX SDP Subcompact is a lightweight concealed carry, or back up, pistol with design roots from the competition circuit.  Carry with ease, draw with confidence, fire with precision.

The SPHINX SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9” and 1.2” respectively.  Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance.Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha.The Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line.It also features a steel slide machined from billet.The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up.The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip.The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side.The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha.The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight.The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset.Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight.Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance.

Up for SALE or TRADE(see below) is a VEPR chambered in 7.62x54r. This is the most powerful Russian AK you can buy. Fires the same round as the Dragunov Sniper Rifle.

It has a 16.5 inch barrel, two 5rd magazines, Magpul grip, Magpul CTR Stock, Magpul AR15 midlength handguard, Canis Design Group M4 buffer tube and stock adapter, and Canis Design Group billet AR15 Handguard adapter set. I do have the beautiful factory wood furniture also. The 7.62x39 round is in the pic to show the size difference of the 7.62x54r round.

I also have 100rds of rare Russian brass cased sniper ammo. And an unopened spam can of 440rds Steel core ammo.

This has considerably less recoil than a Mosin Nagant. If your wondering about these rifles check out what AKOUL, AK Operators Union Local 4774 has to say about the 16.5 inch VEPR. You can no longer get these rifles anymore thanks to the ludicrous executive order from the leader of our country banning Russian Firearms. There is nothing wrong with the firearm at all (as people often wonder about with AK47s), and we can arrange a test firing of it on a serious offer to trade or purchase."

Item 4B (300gr. JFN) is designed for super deep penetration at revolver speeds, but will mushroom and penetrate less deeply at rifle speeds. At handgun speeds you can expect a solid 3 feet of penetration in muscle and bone and at rifle speeds expect roughly 2 feet of penetration in muscle and bone. At handgun velocities, this bullet will act just like item 4A in living tissue. The greater velocities generated by the longer barrel of the rifle will cause the bullet to mushroom and that large mushroom will make a much bigger diameter hole in tissue, but that frontal area on the mushroomed bullet will cut down the depth of penetration.
You’ll note my below velocities form over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.
1.       Ruger Super Blackhawk with 6 inch barrel--------1330 fps
2.       Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch barrel-----------------------1334 fps
3.       1894 Marlin with 18.5 inch barrel---------------------1770 fps
Item 4B is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is NOT suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."

Walther PP - Walther's original factory was located in Zella-Mehlis in the state (Land) of Thuringia, in present-day eastern Germany which was occupied by the Soviet Union following World War II, Walther established a new factory in Ulm. However, for several years following the war, the Allied powers forbade any manufacture of weapons in Germany. As a result, in 1952, Walther licensed production of the PP series pistols to Manurhin who manufactured the PP series until 1986. In fact, all postwar European-made PP series pistols manufactured until 1986 were manufactured by Manurhin, even though the pistol slide may bear the markings of the Walther factory in Ulm.[4]

It is mind boggling how many folks use Bud's gun store or Gun Broker even, to determine whether or not some one is pricing their gun too high but never intend on ordering it online but want that online price.  It seems that unless your gun is priced at Bud's price or less, that you are trying to perpetrate a gouging to the uneducated and unsuspecting gun buyer. 

I have been buying and selling guns on this site for many years as well as the other site. Just because you didn't order your gun online and have it sent to your FFL but bought it from a reputable retailer, doesn't mean that it is over priced. 

If you are truly looking to own the gun that you are searching for on this sight, then just get it from old Bud himself and save all that ripoff money.  

Sorry for the rant but everyone is a gun appraiser and it is not always a bad deal that you are getting. Pretty sure mine won't sell for my asking price even though I paid over a grand for it but that's OK as well. 

It is an awesome pistol with the quality I want, it is just too small for my big hand. Thanks fellow buyers and sellers."

Belonging to the Custom II family, the Kimber Stainless Target II provides the classic look of stainless steel with cutting edge technology and low profile adjustable sights. Kimber is known for their tradition of excellence and high quality firearms, and the Stainless Target II simply serves to reinforce Kimber’s superiority.The Stainless Target II .45 ACP blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements. Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II with adjustable sights, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless Target II is one of the best choices for daily carry.Manufacturer: KimberModel: Stainless Target II Caliber: .45 ACPBarrel Length: 5"""

The arms company Zastava released the M76 in the mid-1970s. Since then it has become the standard issue sharpshooter rifle in the Serbian army and its predecessor the Yugoslav National Army (JNA). It is designed to fulfill the same role as the Soviet Dragunov SVD, which is to provide a designated marksman capability to the infantry platoon. During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, it was used by several sides; it saw action in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.[2] In Serbian service it is reportedly being replaced by the Zastava M91. The Zastava M91 uses the 7.62x54mmR cartridge which is replacing the 8x57mm IS (M-49) cartridge in Serbian service. Design details[edit] The M76 is similar in concept to the Russian Dragunov SVD sniper rifle; a semi-automatic rifle using a full-power cartridge from a 10-round magazine. However, the M76 is closer to the AK-47/RPK design than the Dragunov, similar to the Romanian PSL. Being derived from the AK design it is simple and reliable, and like other Zastava AK-derivatives it is of high-quality manufacture. Accuracy is typically around 1.5 MOA, which is good for a Kalashnikov design and entirely acceptable for the designated marksman role. Macedonian special policeman holding a Zastava M76 sniper in his hands. ZRAK ON-M76 4x 5°10’ reticle layout. The top center ""chevron"" (^) is used as the main aiming mark. The horizontal hash marks are for windage and lead corrections and can be used as mil marks for ranging as well. In the bottom-left corner is a stadiametric rangefinder that can be used to determine the distance from a 1.75 meters (5 ft 8.9 in) tall person/object from 200 m (2) to 800 m (8). Rather than being a Dragunov clone, it looks more like a lengthened AK-47 with a heavier barrel, an impression strengthened by the separate stock and pistol grip rather than the Dragunov's thumbhole combination stock. Instead of the Dragunov's 7,62x54mmR chambering it uses the 7.92x57mm Mauser a.k.a. the 7.9mm or 8x57mm IS round. The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) adopted a 7.9mm Cartridge, Ball M49 variant, designated as M49, as infantry ammunition at the end of the 1940s and later a 7.9mm Cartridge, Sniper, with Universal ball M75, as sniper ammunition, designated as M75.[3][4] Instead of the Dragunov's separate gas piston, the M76 has an AK-type piston attached to the bolt carrier.[5] The receiver is a milled forging like that of the original AK-47 to give greater rigidity when firing a full-power round and it is longer to suit the 8x57mm IS chambering. The AK-type rotating bolt, bolt carrier, barrel and other parts are also longer and heavier to suit. Feeding is via a 10-round steel box magazine, which has a follower that holds the bolt open after the last shot. Since there is no device in the weapon to hold the bolt to the rear, the bolt will move forward when the magazine is removed, which increases the difficulty of removing the magazine. Fire is semi-automatic only, so the AK-47-type safety on the right side of the receiver has only 2 settings - 'safe' and 'fire'. The barrel has a tapered profile with a Dragunov-type combination slotted flash suppressor and foresight housing. A standard AKM bayonet can be fitted to the bayonet lug below the foresight. Like the Dragunov, but unlike the AK-47, the M76 features an operator-adjustable gas regulator enabling more propellant gas to be vented to the piston in marginal operating conditions and even blocking the gas from pushing back the bolt, making the rifle a manual repeater. The furniture features a straight comb butt, which has a rubber pad similar to that found on the Zastava M70 series of weapons, and a well-shaped contoured pistol grip. The fore-end is also reminiscent of that found on the M70 series. There is no butt trap for cleaning kit storage in the wooden butt. In newer production models the wooden furniture is replaced with synthetic polymer material which offers some storage space for accessories like a cleaning kit and reduces the M76 overall weight by approximately 0.5 kg. With the exception of the gas regulator, disassembly and operation are similar to that of the AK-47/AKM family of weapons. Though the M76 fires its bullets at a relatively modest 730 m/s (2,395 ft/s) muzzle velocity, the 8x57mm IS cartridge loaded with aerodynamically efficient 12.8 grams (197.53 gr) military sS ball bullets still offers a supersonic reach of ˜ 950 m (1,040 yd) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ? = 1.225 kg/m³). To mount the optics, a side-rail is permanently attached to the left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the locking lever open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give easy access to the receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place. ZRAK ON-M76 elevation turret with bullet drop compensation markings and warning for the radioactive illumination The typical scope used is a ZRAK ON-M76 4x 5°10’ scope originally produced in the ZRAK factory in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[6][7] This optical sight is similar to the PSO-1 4x24 sight used on the Russian SVD rifle and the Romanian I.O.R. LPS 4x6° TIP2 4x24 sight used on the PSL rifle. The ON-M76 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge (the 7,9 M75 sniper ammunition) at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical adjustment control of the reticle, the windage or horizontal adjustment control of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc. The reticle illumination of the ZRAK M-76 4x 5°10’ is provided by (radioactive) tritium. The tritium light source has to be replaced every 8–12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay. The reticle features a PSO-1 type range-finding reticle. Performance[edit] The M76 is relatively accurate for a semi-automatic rifle. It can achieve 1.5 to 2 Minute of angle or MOA consistent accuracy with appropriate ammunition. Under normal conditions a maximum effective range of 800 m (875 yd) against man sized targets for an average sniper is achievable. The dispersion at 900 m (984 yd) is described as 50 x 50 cm (19.7 x 19.7 in), which is ˜ 1.9 MOA. Under optimal atmospheric and environmental conditions excellent marksmen might use the M76 up to 1,000 m (1,094 yd). Recoil is described as being modest.[1][8] It has the reputation of a reliable and capable weapon and has seen extensive combat service.[citation needed] There is a known issue, however, with the magazines of the M76 being unreliable. Due to the bolt hold open property of the magazines, the bolt will slam forward when the magazine is removed, putting considerable pressure on the follower. This can result in the follower being jammed in the forward position, rendering the magazine inoperable."
