If someone is looking for a light weight drilling that handles like a fine shot gun, this is it. This is a Dural receiver drilling with walnut stock and forend, with horn grip cap, butt plate, and trigger guard.  The engraving is the scroll type.  The gun weighs about 6.5 pounds. Barrels are 25 ½ inches. LOP is a bit over 14 inches. I slugged the rifle bore and it is .318 inches.  Because it is a light gun, it’s a joy to carry and pleasant shooting with the light loads.  The shotgun chambers have been opened to take 2 ¾ inch shells.  Bores are good. The wood finish is in very nice condition as is the checkering.  There is one small crack at the top of the left side of the stock where the action meets the wood.  I’ve tried to show it in the pictures. 
 The surface finish on the receiver has some wear of the finish and on the inside where action parts rub.   It has a greener safety, a greener crossbolt and sideclips.  The front trigger is a set trigger and has worked nicely for me. The rifle sight is actuated with the rifle selector which cocks the rifle lock, as I understand it.  There are cocking indicators.  The front sight flips from an ivory bead to a blade for rifle use.  Barrels are Krupp steel. 
The gun is fitted with a set of Talley rings that go on and off easily and smoothly.  The scope in the gun is a Leupold Compact 1 – 4X.  I will include two boxes of 8x57JR ammo, to get the buyer started.  Shipping would be at the cost of insurance and  shipping to your FFL.

This rifle is in nice condition, and has only been to the range.  The barrels and action are blued and the stock is walnut, I believe. This gun was imported for a short time by Remington. As I understand it, this gun can no longer be imported because of trade restrictions with Russia. The barrel regulation can be adjusted, so you can set it up to shoot different weight bullets.  After I bought this gun and I  had my gunsmith go over it, so it is in good working order. Fun to shoot and uses standard 30/06 ammo.  The barrels were relieved to also accept a rimmed version of the standard .30/06 cartridge.  The cartridge can be made by either necking down and trimming Hornady 9.3x74R brass or by resizing 7x65R brass.  To accommodate the rimmed cases, a new extractor was also made.  The original extractor and the new extractor are included in with the rifle. I have fired both rimmed and rimless cases in this rifle.  It is regulated with Remington Corelokt 180 grain factory loads.   I will include nearly two boxes of resized and trimmed 9.3x74R cases.  Gun comes with box and paper work, both the rimmed extractor and the rimless extractor, a set of QR one inch rings, and the resized 9.3x74R cases.  This is a neat little rifle.  $825 plus shipping"

PWS started with a clean sheet of paper in designing the MK118. Start with the PWS long-stroke piston sytem which combines the agility of the AR-15 with the reliability of the AK-47 into a sleek and efficient design. By utilizing a one piece design, the PWS piston system creates a purely gas to metal operation, rather than metal on metal contact that you may see in other designs. The PWS four position adjustable gas block restricts gasses, rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation.

The PWS QPQ Isonited Barrel is made using only the highest quality chromoly barrel blank. It's turned at PWS and then treated with QPQ Isonite for increased surface hardness and corrosion resistance. MK1 rifles are chambered in .223 Wylde, which accommodates both 5.56 Nato and .223 Remington without sacrificing accuracy. The barrel features a 1:8 twist, which accommodates 55gr through 75gr .223 round with a high degree of accuracy

The PWS Bolt Carrier Group is machined from tool steel at strict tolerances, then Nickel Teflon coated for durability and to reduce friction. It features an increased carrier mass to extend dwell time and delay unlock. As a result the PWS bolt carrier group allows chamber pressure to be greatly reduced for easier extraction. The PWS bolt system is Nickel Teflon coated and optimized for the .223 wylde chamber. It features a small assist spring for system assembly.

This rifles ergonomics match its mechanics. With all Magpul furniture, including a Magpul Precision Rifle/Sniper Stock, the MK118 includes the PWS Free Floated Handguard. PWS engineers designed a handguard which is ergonomic as well as durable. Featuring the KeyMod interface, the MK1 series handguard eliminates unnecessary weight and allows for a wide range of accessory placement. The picatinny top rail is extruded and then machined from aircraft grade 6061 aluminum, every handguard comes standard with a full-length Picatinny top rail and two 2 inch Picatinny sections.

Included is a 30 round Magpul PMAG and Magpul flip-up front and rear sights"

Payment Accepted: Cash or VISA/MC w/ 3.0% processing fee added.

The SIG SAUER P224 is the first true subcompact in its classic all-metal firearms line. Ideal for concealed or off-duty carry, the P224 offers all of the features expected. The SIG Anti-Snag (SAS) model, shown here, features a de-horned slide and frame, and the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip.

Based on the P229, one of the most prolific sidearms in federal law enforcement, the P224 takes the same hammer-fire reliability and lightweight all-metal frame with One Small Change that makes it an ideal concealed carry or back-up gun. The P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms.

Despite its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 10 rounds of .40S&W giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact competitors. The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.

“Almost 80 percent of federal law enforcement agencies have chosen the P229 for its durability, reliability and safety,” said Ron Cohen, SIG SAUER President and Chief Executive Officer. “The P224 may be cut down in size, but it hasn’t lost an ounce of these performance features.” 

Traditional DA/SA trigger, short-reset trigger (SRT) and full-size SIGLITE Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts.

When you safely store your unloaded gun, put a snap cap in the chamber and fire your rifle to allow the firing pin to lay at rest. This will help prevent firing pins from breaking in the future. Snap caps are also a great tool to practice dry firing your guns to teach safe gun handling, improve your shooting skills, and tune your trigger.

The trigger is a 3.5 lb CMC flat single stage tactical trigger installed with anti rotation pins ... Very smooth and clean break.  It will also come with 140 rounds of Z01 7.62X51 ammo. 

I also have a  GG&G sling swivel picatinny mount and a Harris Bipod and a Nikon M-308 4-16X42mm BDC scope that was mounted and went to the range with it one time. The scope is not for sale by itself ... Only with the rifle, otherwise I want to keep it.

The only partial trades I would be interested in are: Glock 19,  G20 or G21 (Gen4 only) or a Glock 43.

For the rifle and ammo (all original stuff) and the hard case, I am $1600
For the above and the Harris Bipod $1650
For all above and the Nikon $2050

I am in no rush to sell this rifle so I am not really flexable on the prices.  I will only sell face to face and buyer must sign a bill of sale and show valid NC ID.

Thanks for looking. If interested, please email me or text 919-457-two 7 zero 5"

The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semi auto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match.Manufacturer: Beretta ( Made in USA )Model: 92FS Caliber: .9mmBarrel: 4.9""Capacity: 15Action: Single/Double Action"

   PATS APR. 12—10-APR. 2-12      SN18649
This was my step-dad’s “Turkey Shoot” gun in the 1950’s; and it was old then, but it remains in good condition--very little pitting, it operates smoothly and is a shooter.
""The No. 200 was a hammerless pump 20 gauge which could handle 2 1/2"", 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells at a time when most 20 gauge shotguns were single shot ""boy's"" guns which could only handle the 2 1/2 inch shell. It was only made from about 1911 to about 1914.
Based on serial numbers, there were only about 20,000 made. The highest serial number observed on any internet forum or auction post is in the 19,8xx range. This number is correct by the usual other sources. 
The Stevens No. 200 is a complicated gun.  It operates with a short bolt which is held in place by a tilting ""carrier"".  It also has two blades which, when the pump is acuated, first keep the shell from rolling out of the partially closed action, and second, seals the hole behind the bolt. 
There is a tang mounted safety like on better grade double barrel shotguns.  It weighs from 5 3/4 to 6 1/2 pounds, depending for the barrel length.  All barrels are choked ""Full"" unless the barrel is marked otherwise.""

The Stevens No. 200 is a complicated gun.  It operates with a short bolt which is held in place by a tilting ""carrier"".  It also has two blades which, when the pump is acuated, first keep the shell from rolling out of the partially closed action, and second, seals the hole behind the bolt. 
There is a tang mounted safety like on better grade double barrel shotguns.  It weighs from 5 3/4 to 6 1/2 pounds, depending for the barrel length.  All barrels are choked ""Full"" unless the barrel is marked otherwise.""

The Henry Silver Eagle is based on the engraved scroll and silver plated Serial Number 9 Henry Rifle presented to US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles by The New Haven Arms Company. Welles served under President Lincoln, distinguished himself as a political leader nationally, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party. Secretary Welles was also instrumental in the creation of the Navy’s Medal of Honor.
Using original photos and hand drawings of the Gideon Welles Serial Number 9 as reference, the master plate used in the creation of the new Silver Eagle pattern was hand cut for production with full coverage on both sides of the receiver cover.
The Silver Eagle pattern, like the Henry Rifle itself, is one piece of American history without rival. This model is built on the award winning Henry Golden Boy platform. The rifle features a traditional 20″ octagonal barrel outfitted with buckhorn sights; a gunsmithing masterpiece that closely mirrors its legendary predecessors, the original Henrys when they were patented in 1860.

Only selling due to needing money to finance some home repairs. This shotgun also comes with approximately 150 rounds of various 12g ammo (slugs, buckshot)

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The Rossi tradition of firearm design and manufacturing started with the founding of the company in 1889 by Amadeo Rossi. Over the last 115 years, that tradition has grown along with the company. Over the years, Rossi firearms has led the way in design and engineering. At the same time, it has always been important to produce an affordable product without sacrificing quality or accuracy. In 2008, Rossi was acquired by Taurus and together the two firms work to improve products and create new lines.
The Winchester Model 1892 was a lever action repeating rifle designed by John Browning as a smaller, lighter version of his large-frame Model 1886– which replaced the Model 1873 as the company’s lever-action for smaller dual-purpose rounds such as the 44-40. Cowboys on the frontier found it convenient to carry a rifle and a revolver chambered with the same ammunition. When asked by Winchester to design an improved pistol caliber lever action, John Browning said he would have the prototype completed in under a month– or it would be free. Two weeks later, Browning had a functioning prototype of the Model 92.
The Model 1892 has become an indelible icon of Western mythology through its use in hundreds of motion pictures and television shows. Even though Winchester ended production of the Model 92 in 1938, Rossi continues to manufacture a faithful reproduction of this historic rifle to this day.
The Rossi R92-68016 lever action rifle features a 16″ barrel, STAINLESS STEEL finish, adjustable buckhorn rear sight, Brass Bead front sight, hardwood furniture with recoil absorbing butt-pad, 8+1 capacity tubular magazine, and a manual safety. These rifles are the ultimate companion to your .454 Casull revolver!

I bought this rifle from Vance's in Columbus a few years ago.  I believe it was unfired surplus back then as the bore was nice and shiny and it was covered with a good amount of cosmoline.
Since then i've removed most of the cosmoline and i've put maybe.... ohh...... 200 rounds through it.  Something like that.  The bore is a bit darker now and there is some frost but the rifling remains strong and it remains a good shooter.  We're not talkin' old abused mosin nagant territory here, just shooter-condition sks territory, if you will.
I've tried to clean it well after shooting.  Occasionally i'd clean the gas piston to make sure that was all fine and good.  Contact me if you want a picture of the bolt face and bolt carrier.  I cleaned these after each outing but they sport a bit of rust now regardless.
The sight hood is slightly bent from a time when the rifle fell over from an upright position.
The threads on the cleaning rod that screw it into the receiver are stripped so it doesn't screw in there, but it still serves as a cleaning rod... of course.

The serial numbers on the receiver, bolt carrier, bolt, stock, and magazine all match.  The rifle also sports some electro-penned numbers along with the factory stamped numbers... i suspect from being arsenal refurbished/stored.  The numbers on the bolt, bolt carrier, receiver, stock and magazine are all stamped from the factory when the rifle was built and are not force-matched.
You will also receive two stripper clips, around 60 rounds of brass cased yugo surplus ammo, a sling if i can find it, the old yugo cleaning kit that stored in the butt of the stock, and a cute little ""thanks for buying this sks!"" thing from century arms that came with the rifle.

See my listing for my other yugo (an m57) if you're lookin' for one of those."

Bought a couple years ago and put about 200 rounds through it.  It's a surplus/arsenal refurbished gun.  The serial numbers on the frame and slide match.  The number on the barrel matches the frame and slide but it is electro-penned and may be an arsenal force match.  The number on the hammer group is electro-penned and does not match.
The bore doesn't shine like new but it's not dark.  There's some rust in there but it isn't heavily pitted.  Perhaps slightly pitted.  Maybe minor pitting?  The rifling remains descent- not super strong, but not perfect.  That's probably not the best description you've ever read.. contact me for a picture of the bore if you like.
I'd describe it somewhere between dark frosty mosin nagant bore and sks-i-didn't-clean-once bore.

Picture shows the condition of the bluing well.  You can see some scratches on the frame from where that lever swings out when you want to disassemble the pistol.
It has that importer-installed safety.
It's a shooter... not perfect but it functions well and it's fun to shoot.

You'll also receive around 30-rounds of surplus 7.62x25 and the standard surplus yugo package that includes two magazines (9-rounds as this is an m-57), a leather holster, and a cleaning rod.
The surplus ammo IS the kind that you'll get occasional case-neck splits from.  It never bothered me and i don't think the gun cared either, but i feel like that's important to throw out there.

see my add for my other yugo (an sks this time) if you're lookin' for one of those are interested in both."
