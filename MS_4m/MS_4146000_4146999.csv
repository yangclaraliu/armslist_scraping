Please Note: This model comes with 10-Round Mags for states with magazine capacity limits!
The CZ 85 Combat version was created as an extension of the CZ 85 B with some additional features. The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.
The rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage, and the trigger for overtravel regulation. An extended magazine catch, elimination of the magazine brake and ambidextrous controlling elements directly predispose this model for sport shooting competitions.
Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters.
   We have 1 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $579 each.  Type : PistolAction : Single / DoubleCaliber : 9mmBarrel Length : 4.7″Capacity : 10 + 1Safety : AmbidextrousGrips : Black SyntheticSights : FixedWeight : 2.2 lbsFinish : Black"

RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18″ model to be only 26.1″ long, or as much as 14″ shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.
The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work “drop free” and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18″ long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8×24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24″, 26″ and 32″ will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user’s preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.
   We have 1 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $1,689 each.

Thinning the herd to fund the down payment for a home. Private sale with no FFL fees or paperwork to hassle with. If a face to face meet isn't possible, must ship to an FFL. Shipping is $35 within CONUS private party to your FFL, or an additional $20 if my FFL has to ship it.

Product DescriptionDesigned in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The SSR Mp40 is a ATF approved design and can not be made to fire live ammo as it chambers the ammo backwards. My blank gun was the 24th gun made of the initial first run of 25 gun. My blank gun has been used in many WW2 reenactments and while it is still in good working condition it has the usual manufacturer issues that occur with these blank guns which are minor finish loss, folding stock play when closed, and slight side to side twist of the lower to upper assemblies. The blanks for this gun are available at Atlantic Wall blanks and a few other places.

 The blank gun package will include
 1 SSR MP40 BFONG
 1 Bag sealed bag of 500 blanks and around 200 +or- loose blanks

 10 magazines

DO NOT contact me for trades, asking for a lower price, or any other nonsense.  This is not craigslist ad before I will take less I will keep it.  Also, I have gotten a ton of responses today and I just listed it today from people outside of Illinois.  Let me make this CLEAR, if you do not have a valid FOID, won't happen, if you cannot purchase it legally, meaning sign the bill of sale and wait 72hrs as required by law so that I can go to the state police site, give them your name and FOID number and get approval to sell you the firearm, it's not going to happen, this will be by the book, or not at all.

Never been fired, free of defects. comes with batteries. Any question please contact me. Description follows:

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight for handguns and long guns features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light—more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

Activating the X300 Ultra is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. Optional DG grip switches (for pistols) and a pressure activated XT07 tape switch(for long guns) permit the X300 Ultra to be activated without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The X300 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof.

The rifle is in the factory Accustock and also has a Savage Accutrigger set at a clean 2.5 pounds.  The stock is a desert digital type camo pattern.  I had the barrel threaded and installed a Surefire muzzle brake.  The barrel is factory fluted and shoots VERY WELL.  This gun shoots 175gr rounds in quarter minute groups.

Mounted on the gun is a Blackhawk 3.5-15x, mildot reticle, first focal plane scope.  Blackhawk scopes are made by Weaver tactical and carry a lifetime factory warranty.  Being a first focal plane (FFP) scope, the reticle will change in size depending on your magnification setting, which means your drops and hold overs will be the same regardless of what magnification setting you're at.  Ideal for quick shots without making scope adjustments.  

The scope is mounted in NightForce rings, and sits on top of a Nightforce 20MOA base, and therefore as the adjustment range to reach out to 1000 yards without issue.

Perfect set up for someone wanting to get into the long range shooting game.  I simply have too many 308's, so this one is on the chopping block.


Local face to face cash deal preferred.  Located on the south side of indy.  Not interested in any trades.  Price is firm."

I really don't need this much but the big kegs were all that was available. I wouldn't mind splitting it up, would prefer someone interested in 4 pounds @ $25 a pound which is right at what I paid including tax. May consider selling 2lbs, but that would be $60. I don't want a big headache and will keep it all before jumping through hoops to sell it.

If your not familiar with this powder, it is close to Power Pistol. Burn rate falls between Unique and P-P. Hell it is all Alliant lists on its website reloading guide for 380, 9mm, 38spl, 357, 40, 45acp, etc... Here a link to the website:

I am going to be in Cinci this coming weekend (3/20-3/22) on a family vacation and thought this may be a good chance to do this. I live in the sticks in central KY and so far haven't found any interest locally. Early morning or evening hours would be best, as we have trips to the zoo and the aquarium planned. 
This is a family trip and I am not interested in a big hassle to pull off this deal. If your interested I will let you know where I am staying in Cinci and you would have to meet me at the hotel. Bring a container and an accurate scale with you. No exceptions, unless you live reasonably close and make it very easy for me to come to you.

Features include over-sized grip safety, ambi-safety, slim rubber grips and Novak sights all factory. I added an extended slide release that has a spot of rust on the top edge. The slide shows wear from the Fobus holster I carried this in for several years. The plastic holster held it tight, but the friction of carrying, holstering, etc., wore the OD green finish from the front edge and along the top rear near the sights. I polished the feed ramp and barrel for smooth feeds. I never had jams in this, using both manufactured and reloaded ammo. I shot both lead and copper RN, plus HP and lead truncated cone in weights from 185 to 230gr. Comes in the original case with manual. Links to info:

The early ""AW"" series have a heavy Wilson target barrel that has 12 flutes, same as the original HK9112 and will shoot any surplus .308/7.62x51 ammo, which many of the newer PTR-91's won't shoot. Today PTR states that the PTR stands for Precision Tactical Rifle. Back when this was made in 2006 - PTR stood for Precision TARGET Rifle. 

The SN for this rifle is AW14XX. The bolt gap is within tolerance at .008. The bore is mint and the rifling is clear and crisp.  I installed the HK heavy recoil buffer and had the entire rifle has had a professional militec-1 dry lubricant treatment (same treatment the military uses for corrosion prevention). I will include a sight tool, removable HK/GI 3 point sling, and Pelican gun case with the foam cutouts for everything included. I will also include ten 20round magazines, one 10 round mag and a box of Winchester RP .308 hunting rounds.

This thing will shoot. I bought it new and have only run 700 rounds through it. I know because I have 300 Left I am selling on this ad. Only selling because I am moving to Hawaii and this gun doesn’t get to come with me there. $1200 gets everything listed above.

I also am listing a can of .308 Argentinian surplus ball ammo. 300 rounds for $150. This is excellent ammo that has become very hard to find. It is noncorrosive, Berdan primed, safe, reliable, accurate, and clean burning. I will let the ammo go with the gun for an additional $150 or sell it separately for $200. 

This is priced to sell so please know that this is my bottom dollar pricing. Also unless you have a victory highball in your possession I am not interested in trades. 

I am not open to shipping or selling sight unseen. Also am not familiar with every states local law. Please do your research to prevent any issues. I do know this Isn't Mass compliant due to the threaded barrel and Flash suppressor. To be Mass compliant you would need to have a muzzle break pinned and welded to the barrel after purchase.

Feel free to contact me via email or my cell at 510-387-4234. Don't mind the 510 area code, I am in Boston Just got tired of changing numbers every time I moved."

The early ""AW"" series have a heavy Wilson target barrel that has 12 flutes, same as the original HK9112 and will shoot any surplus .308/7.62x51 ammo, which many of the newer PTR-91's won't shoot. Today PTR states that the PTR stands for Precision Tactical Rifle. Back when this was made in 2006 - PTR stood for Precision TARGET Rifle. 

The SN for this rifle is AW14XX. The bolt gap is within tolerance at .008. The bore is mint and the rifling is clear and crisp.  I installed the HK heavy recoil buffer and had the entire rifle has had a professional militec-1 dry lubricant treatment (same treatment the military uses for corrosion prevention). I will include a sight tool, removable HK/GI 3 point sling, and Pelican gun case with the foam cutouts for everything included. I will also include ten (Pre ban) 20round magazines, one 10 round mag and a box of Winchester RP .308 hunting rounds.

This thing will shoot. I bought it new and have only run 700 rounds through it. I know because I have 300 Left I am selling on this ad. Only selling because I am moving to Hawaii and this gun doesn’t get to come with me there. $1200 gets everything listed above.

I also am listing a can of .308 Argentinian surplus ball ammo. 300 rounds for $150. This is excellent ammo that has become very hard to find. It is noncorrosive, Berdan primed, safe, reliable, accurate, and clean burning. I will let the ammo go with the gun for an additional $150 or sell it separately for $200. 

This is priced to sell so please know that this is my bottom dollar pricing. Also unless you have a victory highball in your possession I am not interested in trades. 

I am not open to shipping or selling sight unseen. Also am not familiar with every states local law. Please do your research to prevent any issues. I do know this Isn't Mass compliant due to the threaded barrel and Flash suppressor. To be Mass compliant you would need to have a muzzle break pinned and welded to the barrel after purchase.

H&R will fit other caliber barrels to this receiver, including shotgun barrels for this model.

The box was damaged in shipping, so it has been discarded since this thing has lived in a safe for years. This is a new-condition firearm with under ten rounds ran through it. It comes with the twenty-round factory polymer mag. The mere fact that this is a factory gun and not from a kit brings the price up over some of the others out there but I do believe it is worth it. That being said, I am certainly open to reasonable cash offers. This is a unique firearm that is not being currently imported, and probably never will again. In folded condition, it will easily fit into a back pack or storage area of a vehicle, while allowing for a serious amount of firepower when deployed. The short barrel and stock configuration lends itself well to CQB environments, and the polymer grips and stock provide for years of easy maintenance and aggressive looks.

Sig Sauer P290 RS 
Designed to be the ultimate concealed carry 9mm in a polymer frame, perfect for both a backup duty gun and responsible citizen's carry gun. Less than 21oz unloaded, this micro-nine has less rest recoil than the competition, keeping your follow up shots faster. And improved from the first generation of P290, the P290RS all for a re-strike ability, letting you pull the trigger again on a failed to fire hard primer. With a lighter DAO trigger, this pistol is reliable and safe with no external safety, which when combined with the SIGLITE night sights let you hit your target quickly and accurately.

I just want this thing gone since it's taking up room in the safe. Marked down.

Up for sale or trade I have a Sig Sauer 516 rifle. This is an AR platform PISTON rifle, which equates to a more accurate, tougher, and more dependable firearm. I love my direct gas ARs, but I do prefer a piston system as it does not get the bolt nearly as dirty, and the system is adjustable so if it doesn't function correctly when you need it the most, you can crank the horsepower up and still use it. The rifle itself will come with the Gen 3 Pmag it came with, along with the original box/docs/lock from Sig Sauer, along with a two point sling equipped with quick detach mounts (the rifle has multiple places to put them) and rail covers. It will also come with a 20 round magazine as well, and a Vortex Crossfire II 1-4x25 scope with an American Defense Quick Detach mount can be included for just $400 ($500 setup if mount and scope are bought separately) never fired while mounted. The rifle is equipped with fold down Iron Sights. If you really want to go all out, I could include an extra 5 30 round Pmags and 500 rounds of ammo for an extra $200. It doesn't have to be all or nothing, we can discuss what you'd like. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED.

Breakdown:
Rifle new plus tax: $1360 (based on the price you found)
 Extra 20 round mag: $12
 Sling with QD mounts: $40
 Total price: $1415 

 My price I'll drop it to so you're definitely getting a deal: $1000. That's a $400 off price for a brand new rifle. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED."

Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have..... 

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright. I can acid test it in front of you to show purity 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. 

Im looking for an ar-10 or ar-10. Only calibers I will consider is a 6.8 spc first. I will consider a 458 socom, 450 bushmaster, 50 beuwolf, 308 win, 338 federal. There may be other calibers I'll consider but nothing smaller than the 6.8.  Will also consider trading for 1911's or a high end hunting rifle.  

Only other thing I will consider trading for is a night vision scope."

I'm the first owner, this rifle was bought by me last week from a local gun store, I have the original receipt that came with the gun. This rifle is absolutely brand new, never fired, never loaded, never chambered. There is not one single scratch anywhere on the rifle, including the internals since it's as new as you can get. The rifle comes with the box, 1 20 round mag from factory and everything from the factory. Reason for selling is I couldn't help myself and bought a Wilson Combat X-tac from Tampa's Shoot Straight, I've always had a weak spot for 1911s especially that one. Asking $2800 for the rifle, which I believe it's very reasonable since these rifles generate a lot of interest. Located in Gainesville but I travel to Orlando twice a week to attend school at UCF so I can meet anywhere in between Gainesville and Orlando.
