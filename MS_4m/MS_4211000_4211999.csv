The Ultra Dual Shot Pro Spec Night Vision QD Reflex Sight from Sightmark® delivers not one, but two ways to dial in with pinpoint accuracy. Featuring a side-mounted red laser for quick target acquisition, the shooter can fire quickly in close-quarter situations such as tactical training situations and three-gun matches. When sighting through the dual-pane glass, users can customize their view with one of the four illuminated reticle patterns. The Ultra Dual Shot is equipped with a night vision mode, allowing shooters to mount the device in front of a night vision monocular and create a co-witnessed riflescope set up. Its featured double-pane glass lens system eliminates parallax and retains accuracy when Fired from the periphery of the lens. Users can quickly and effectively adapt their firearm to the situation at hand with the included quick-detach mount. Its Interlok™ internal locking system of the Ultra Dual Shot holds zero extremely well, so the shooter does not have to continually re-adjust the sight in the field. The all-aluminum construction enhances durability, making it operable in various environments and situations.

Inspired by military and law enforcement applications, the Sightmark® series of Tactical Magnifiers are multi-functional weapons accessories featuring a slide-to-side mount. Offering the ability to quickly move the magnifier out of the way without having to detach the unit, the 3x Tactical Magnifier gives shooters quick target acquisition capabilities. The device is designed for use in conjunction with holographic, collimated reflex, and other compatible weapons sights, giving the shooter the benefit of a reflex sight and scope in one combination. The 3x Tactical Magnifier increases the magnification of the accompanying sight for greater sighting range and improves target recognition significantly at medium-range distances. Engineered to assist in quick target acquisition up to 200 yards and accurate target shooting at 100 yards, the 3x Tactical Magnifier also features extended eye relief for comfort, a wide field-of-view and high quality multi-coated optics for improved visibility and clarity. Designed to work with EOTech, Aimpoint, Trijicon and other brands, the 3x Tactical Magnifier can be securely mounted on most picatinny and weaver mounts. Its lightweight, weather proof and shatter-proof frame provides durability in all elements."

Model 6004-73421 SLS Tactical Holster with Light Green / Grey
MODEL: 6004 SKU: PART:

This tactical light holster features the SLS (Self Locking System) rotating hood. With no snap, the SLS allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied.

I purchased this firearm used from my local FFL with one 13 round magazine and the box, and I bought 2 additional 10 round mags for the gun. It didn't come with the back straps (they can be purchased online for ~$20). The grip feel without back straps is comparable to a g19/g23, which is well suited for medium-sized hands.

As you can see from the pictures, this Glock 21 is in excellent condition, and it has minimal wear on the slide and frame; if someone handed me this gun and told me it was brand new, I would believe them. The only reason why I am selling this Glock 21 is because I barely shoot it. I tend to gravitate towards my 1911, but this Glock 21 is an amazing firearm. I will probably regret selling it, but I think this gun should belong to someone who will use it the way it was meant to be used! The gun has standard sights, it comes with the original box, and everything shown in the pictures."

Nikon 3x32 P-223 Rifle Scope 8496 is a powerful close-range rifle scope that combines high-brightness optics with quick adjustment capabilities. These effective Nikon rifle scopes feature a 3x magnification and a wide, 32mm objective lens that is fully multi-coated, providing an astonishing 98% light transmission rate, allowing you to do some great hunting during sunrise or sunset. Optimized for the trajectory of a 5.56 NATO round, the Nikon P223 3x BDC Carbine Reticle Riflescopes are equipped with a BDC Carbine reticle with 400 and 600 yard hashmarks; using Nikon's Spot On Ballistic Match Technology, you can tailor the reticle to your specific load. Adjustments in windage and elevation are easy to make with these rifle scopes, which utilize 1/4 MOA tactical-style windage and elevation turrets with a zero reset feature that makes adjusting the reticle of the Nikon 3x32mm P223 Ballistic Match Rifle Scope as easy as dialing in the appropriate range.
All these adjustment possibilities plus a 100 yard parallax setting makes for some highly accurate shooting with the Nikon P-223 Rifle Scope. Not only is the Nikon P 223 3x32 Matte Black Rifle Scope precise and accurate, it is also comfortable to use, easy to mount, and as durable a rifle scope as you'll find anywhere else. Nikon has equipped these scopes with generous eye relief that's big enough to guard against heavy recoil, harsh shooting angles, and lighter rifles. For a close-range rifle scope that combines fast target acquisition with precise windage and elevation adjustments and crystal clear optics, mount the Nikon P223 Matte BDC Carbine Scope to your rifle of choice."

This tactical light holster features the SLS (Self Locking System) rotating hood. With no snap, the SLS allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. Molded sight track and soft SafariSuede™ protect the gun's sights and finish. The Model 6004 features a standard double leg strap and leg shroud with mounting holes for optional accessories. The rugged STX finish protects the gun against scrapes, scratches and dents."

The slide, lower, and grips are in great condition for a gun that is over 20 years old; this firearm was not handled or used often.

Optional with this sale: 130 rounds of .25 ACP FMJ ammo and 5 .25 ACP snap caps. 25 ACP ammo goes for ~$25/box online, so this equates to $65 of ammo + $10 of snap caps. Snap caps & 130 rounds of .25 ACP ammo will be $60 extra; gun+ammo+snap caps will be $150.

The MP-25 C Raven goes on gunbroker for about $80-$100, without shipping and transfer. So I think my asking price of $150 for the package deal is fair, considering the excellent condition of this firearm and the cost/availability of .25 ACP ammo; also, Fiocci ammunition is premium, so I am not selling you garbage/cheapo ammo with this gun.

The Jennings J-22 is also for sale, it is in good condition, 1-6 round magazine, price: $100; these go on Gunbroker for $100 in poor/beat-up condition, and around $150 if they are in good condition. Buy both guns with the premium .25ACP ammo for $250.

I've caught a lot of interest on here, and I'm not in a hurry to sell, so prices are NON-NEGOTIABLE; NO TRADES. Also, please have a valid AZ ID to present at the time of the sale. I have been receiving a lot of demanding/threatening e-mails- If you send me demanding/pushy e-mails, I will not respond to them. E-mail me your name and phone # if interested; this is the quickest way for me to respond to inquiries."

Not desperate to get rid of anyting. The harder it is to find the more it costs, it is called supply and demand.
 I do not need to hear how much ammo costs at china mart when you set your alarm, threw on some sweat pants and waddled in there the other day. If you can find it on a shelf for cheap than please go for it.
 I don't want to the list the price of 1000 different ammos so please just make a reasonable offer.  Anyone asking how much for xxx? or will you meet me in seattle for 100rds, uhh no. The better the deal if you come to me.

I am willing to ship for actual shipping charges, payment would need to be in usps money order. I can provide good guy proof upon request.

Purchased brand new this year and fired for less than 400 rounds. Its not even fully broken in yet but I am selling just to free up some cash.
Picture evidence of light use just ask for me to send them. The pictures show rubbing off of just the finish on the trigger and bolt. The metal is still is pristine shape and not worn down.  Pictures taken while I was cleaning rifle but rifle was shot only with brass cased m855 and cleaned after each use.
Its a colt so the quality speaks for itself and I didn't mess with it like most users do. The attached sight in the picture is not included but it is instead sold with the original magpul sight.
 The case it comes with sells for over 100 new and you can get that for just an additional 60.
The Eotech 552 is also working perfectly and can be had for 300 obo (a little cheaper if bought with the gun)

 My prices are very reasonable. For the gun and the PMAGS it reflects over a 25% reduction in price from the new price, you don't pay sales tax, and it is practically new. For the case and Eotech, they are over 40% off. Sale only to NC resident with valid ID and signed bill of sale.

Gun has approx 100 rounds thru It. Selling as l need the space and do not utilize this gun. Looks / shows / performs as new. Have all paperwork and box. No trades. Listed price is my price. Great little gun and great deal over new.
Located in Niles.

CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore."

I'm interested in selling primarily but here's what I'll consider: XDm 9, FNS 9c, FNS 40 5"" long slide assembly and $250 on top. Also, a CZ SP-01.
 Cash sale, Bill of sale/trade required. Valid AZ ID-CCW. 21+ and NO prohibited possessors/felons. If the add is up, the item is available. I will ignore lowballs.

With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20SF, the subcompact GLOCK 29SF is also suitable for concealed carry.

The receiver and barrel are solid Chrome-Molly, which you will never wear out, or find on newer guns. The barrel is 30-inch, and the modified choke is removable. I could not find anything to use as a comparable for the price, but I think the price is justified by the quality, rarity and condition of this gun. Having said that, I'm open to reasonable offers.

My 11 year old son and I enjoy collecting fine examples of old guns and love the history behind them. Beyond teaching him firearms safety and marksmanship, learning their significance in history through research teaches him appreciation and the importance of preservation of vintage firearms for future generations to enjoy.

We like antique lever action rifles as a significant part of American history during our expansion into the Western territory. Those shown are what we have and are looking for others. we also collect wartime issued WWI & WWII service rifles from many nations but already have good examples of the common ones, but if you have something really special available, please let us know.

I am not a profiteer, just a passionate hobbyist and amateur firearms historian enjoying time with my son who is being taught to appreciate and preserve a collection that one day will be passed on to him. Asking prices and selling prices are often two completely different things. One is wishful thinking and one is reality. If you have an antique gun for sale at a reasonable price, please send me photos and a description. If it's a fit for our collection I can offer cash or trade.
