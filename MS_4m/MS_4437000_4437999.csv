This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Adjustable rear sights, but comes with a scope.
As you can probably see in the picture, the receiver has no finish (it's silver).
When I bought it, the receiver had most of it's finish/bluing chipped or worn off.  I went ahead and removed the rest of the bluing.
I actually like the way it looks. I just put a pinch of gun oil on it to protect it and it seems just fine.
If I was going to keep it as a collectors item, I'd have refinished it, but I just wanted a plinking rifle or maybe something that I could hunt with.
I think the best use for this rifle is to teach young or inexperienced people how to shoot. It's great for that."

It's been shot about 30 times, if that and can easily pass for brand spanking new, because it is! It shoots great, BTW.  Comes with everything as new from the factory, 3 15rd mags, 4 backstraps (two normal, two beavertail) and it also comes with a 10rd mag too for four mags total.

It's two tone and the slide and barrel are finished in WMD's NiB-X, the guns are sold this way from Glock, I didn't send it in to get refinished it comes this way when purchased new.  The gun brand new after taxes is near $700.

Ammo wise I have 49rds each (98 total) of Hornady 180gr XTP and 155gr XTP.  The 180gr XTP averaged over my Beta Master Chrony at around 1175 fps and the 155gr XTP averaged right around 1315 fps, both have little recoil from the G20.

For the Gen4 20 + ammo I'm asking $650 cash.  I'm not really looking to trade right now.

I also have, optional, a KKM 4 port compensated barrel for the G20, which I will sell as well but the barrel cost is $225 (cost me $285 new), it's seen about 15rds, that's it.

For the reloaders I also have ~1,000pcs of Starline 10mm brass.  Approx. 925pcs new 
and the rest once fired.  $135 for the brass. 

I'll sell everything, the G20 Gen4 + ammo + KKM 4 port barrel + starline brass for an even $1,000."

Includes everything from the factory and some extras (case, gun itself, manual, 2 magazines). Gun has approximately 2,000 rounds through it and runs like a charm. See below for other extras.

Please don't waste my time with ridiculous low ball offers. New, this is a $1350 - $1500 gun in most shops (cheapest I can find a new one online has been $1300). 

I also have 2 extra Checkmate magazines, 4 Wilson Combat magazines (selling them as a lot; they retail for $40-$45 new per mag; three are stainless, one is blued), a IWB leather holster from R Grizzle, a horizontal mag holder from magholder.com, and two sets of different grips (one smooth, custom made pair of a fairly light colored wood -- I forget the name -- and a red set with checkering from Fusion Firearms). The grips cost me $75 and $35, respectively, and neither have been used. 

I'd part with the entire bundle for $1,250 (assuming the gun value is $1,050 used; the package is worth $1,800 new, and you're also not paying tax; that's approximately %31 off the list price for everything as new). Again, everything is in tip-top condition.

It is odd, and I can't figure out exactly when it was made, but it seems to have been made in 1982. The problem with that is, the ones made with the ""P1"" are supposed to be aluminum, yet this one is steel, and I know it is, because a magnet will stick to all parts but the grip. One of the 2 mags it comes with is a P38 mag, making it older than the gun, but the other mag is a P1. The mags are interchangeable, so this is not a problem. It comes with a very nice old style holster, with a mag holder built in, and the gun is in EXCELLENT condition, regardless of the age. It has a slight bit of wear on the bluing, but otherwise, it is in suburb shape. I am going to ask $699.00 for it, and I am not going to post photos, because I don't need my email filling up with a bunch of ""expert"" opinions about the gun. If someone wants to look at it, they are welcome to come to my home, and look at it personally. I will not sell it for less than my bottom line, and I am not going to tell anyone what that bottom line is, so if you are a collector, come by my home in Rexburg, and look at it. I am in no hurry to sell this gun."

freshly built custom Remington 700 chambered for 7mm STW. This rifle was built with an emphasis on accuracy by competitive benchrest shooter Pete Piper of Precision Barrel Work in Hempstead, Texas. The heart of this rifle is a 26"" Broughton 5c 416R Stainless Steel Match barrel with a 1:9"" twist rate. Broughton barrels are double stress relieved at the mill and triple stress relieved in the shop, pulled button-rifles, and hand lapped with a uniform land and groove diameter up to .0001"" from breech to muzzle. The barrel is spiral fluted for decreased weight and increased heat dispersion, is threaded with a custom left hand helical muzzle brake fitted, and finally matte black cerakoted for a consistent appearance and durable longevity.

The receiver is completely trued, has a 1.070"" thread tennon, and is pillar bedded in an epoxy gel to extract maximum accuracy. A Jewell trigger set to ~2 pounds further enhances potential precision. The bolt body is spiral fluted for decreased contact area, increasing the smoothness of cycling, and lending a high end custom look.

This rifle features a McMillan Hunter stock with grip and forend checkering and a Pachmayr Decelerator buttpad. It has an olive drab green, tan, and black marbled matte finish.

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4437989,For Sale:  5.56mm AWC Suppressor / Silencer SPF,"Grey Forest (NW of SA), San Antonio, Texas",$ 500,"Listed On: Thursday, June 18, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SOLD PENDING FUNDS

Offered for sale is this heavy-duty suppressor for a 5.56mm / .223 Remington rifle. In fact as close as I can tell the bore of the suppressor is about 6.75mm or .266 caliber, so I would think it could be used on any of the 6.5mm weapons — or of course, anything smaller. It is threaded 1/2-28, which is the standard thread for 5.56mm AR-15's and other weapons chambered for that caliber. It also works quite well as a .22 suppressor.  It is a very strong unit, constructed of 100% stainless steel with each component solidly 360 degree welded, and is made to withstand both semi- and full-auto fire.

Dimensionally, it is 7.5"" long, 1.45"" in diameter, and weighs about 25 oz. It has a matte crinkle finish The markings on the suppressor are as follows:

[LOGO]  AWC SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
PHOENIX, AZ
[SERIAL NUMBER]
CQB  5.56mm

AWC no longer makes this specific model, but they verified that it is an earlier model of the Raider model they currently offer, described on this page: https://awcsilencers.com/shop/raider/ There are minor cosmetic differences from the images on that page (compare with the picture presented here), but the other characteristics listed fit with this suppressor.

I am not the original owner of this suppressor, but I have owned it for years, used it occasionally and kept it cleaned out. There is no thread, muzzle or baffle damage. It is every bit as functional as the day it was manufactured, and I can find only very minor marks in the finish. All in all, it is ready for duty.

If you've never owned or used a suppressor, let me tell you, it's easier and less expensive than you may think — and if you want to take the leap, gi'me a holler and I can talk you through it, even help you with the paperwork if you decide to move forward.

I'm not a dealer, just a private owner, but that works to your advantage since any dealer would charge you a transfer fee, which usually runs $75-100 for class 3 transfers. Sometimes they charge sales tax too. As long as you're a resident of Texas, there's no need for a dealer to be involved — you buy it straight from me, just like any other firearm, except that the BATFE has to bless the transfer first. No problem with the paperwork, I've done it a lot, even have some good templates to make it easier. Feel free to ask me any questions you have – I'll be happy to read you in on anything I know about, and I'll also tell you if I don't know.

All laws apply here. I will expect you to pay for the purchase up front, and you will have to complete and submit paperwork to the BATFE for their approval before I can hand you the suppressor, but if you can legally own a pistol, you can probably own this suppressor. There's a $200 tax that has to be paid to the BATFE one time, a little more paperwork than a firearm, and you'll have to wait a few months, but believe me, it'll be worth it!
