That being said, I did go ahead and order replacement springs for the decocker and trigger, so those feel like new. I also replaced the necessary pins in the slide just to make sure the firearm is safe for the next owner. 
I also cerakoted this particular P6 in a bronze color and it turned out beautifully. I also thought it was cool that this gun has the last three numbers '777' in the serial number, so the barrel, slide, and frame all have a matching '777' on them--what are the odds of that!? 

If you are into one of a kind items, this is for you! It also makes an excellent concealed carry weapon, as it is a single stack pistol with a much smaller overall footprint. Because the pistols are so similar, I was able to carry this one in the same holster my p226 fits in--I just had to adjust the retention screw.

Over $800 invested WITHOUT the ammo, that would easily be another $150. So, well over $900 between the gun, ammo and extras. Grip tape in pics peels right off.

Was sent to me as a wrong order. Surefire SFMB-7.62-5/8x24 Muzzle Brake/Suppressor Adapter: Thread-on muzzle devices give the tactical rifle shooter a variety of options for recoil reduction. Precision CNC machined to exact tolerances from high-quality stainless steel alloy that withstands extreme heat and gas particle erosion, even after thousands of rounds. Stands up to the intense tempo of combat conditions without loss of performance. Substantially reduces muzzle rise and provides outstanding felt recoil reduction for better shot follow-through, improved accuracy, and faster follow-up shots. Advanced Impulse Diffusion™ technology diffuses muzzle blast to the sides, virtually eliminating gas dispersion back to the shooter and minimizing felt concussion to help keep the sights firmly on the target. When used in conjunction with a SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the muzzle brake provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. All SureFire SOCOM Series muzzle brakes have blind pilot holes at the 3 and 9 o’clock position to enable fine-tuning of recoil characteristics for individual shooting styles or ammunition characteristics. They also have blind pilot holes at the 6 o’clock position to enable indexing the adapter at bottom dead center, and to pin-and-weld on short-barreled rifles. All that is required is a basic hand drill and appropriate drill bits. SureFire muzzle brakes are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment, and each is covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee. Features: Offset porting delivers greatly reduced recoil impulse and muzzle rise, so the weapon tracks straight back to keep you on target for faster shot-to-shot recovery Multiple bearing surfaces for superior suppressor alignment Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock High-precision single-point cut barrel threads for optimum thread interface Inspected for all critical dimensions including concentricity and alignment Pilot holes for tuning of muzzle brake and to pin-and-weld on short-barreled rifles Black Ionbond DLC coating provides maximum protection against harsh environmental conditions and facilitates cleaning after extreme use Serves as rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series sound suppressors Labyrinth seals prevent carbon buildup on suppressor lock ring indexing system Installation requires no permanent modifications for M4 / M16 / AR15 type weapons

306,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4252306,For Sale:  Charles Daly Hawken - .50 caliber - Includes Lots of Goodies,"NE Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 450,"Listed On: Thursday, November 26, 2015",Muzzle,no type,50 Black Powder,no type,no type,"Hey 'Listers,




     For sale is a like-new Charles Daly Hawken rifle, in .50 caliber. I say ""like-new"" because the rifle itself, such as the stock, trigger guard, etc, are all in perfect condition, but the barrel appears to have some powder residue around the muzzle. Without being 100% certain it is new, I decided to claim like-new condition. If this gun has been fired at all, it is less than a dozen times. There is no damage to any part of the rifle, nor is there powder residue on the percussion lock.


   This is a beautiful example of a Hawken rifle, and I will include some extra goodies with purchase. They include:

-1 half-full bottle of Bore Butter
-1 full box of brass Sabots
-1 real powder horn(handmade, with handmade sling)
-100 round balls
-30 minie balls, pre-lubed in bore butter
-1 full bottle of bore butter
-100 percussion caps
-1 bullet screw
-2 powder meters
-1 powder measure



    As this is a BP gun, I am happy to ship anywhere; the buyer pays shipping at-cost. Email me anytime for details, or more detailed pictures. 


NOTE: From the time these pictures were taken (a loooong time ago, to show off to buddies), I have replaced the cheap plastic ramrod with a nice heavy wood and brass model. This wood ramrod has two different end caps; one for use with round balls, and one for use with sabots/minie balls. I have found this double-end style of ramrod to be amazingly useful at the range. 

    I have also added an adjustable rear sight, which can be adjusted via a screw set in place; if you're determined, you can adjust with a thumbnail without leaving your shooting position. It would be easier to use a screwdriver however.


This Hawken has the double-set triggers for hunting. Pull the back trigger, and it sets the true-trigger on a hair-pin pull. The tiniest motion will loose a shot. Very fun, and quite the difference between this hunting set-up and normal, single trigger muzzle loaders. The double-set trigger system is my favorite by far, for both hunting and target shooting.

Again, email me anytime if you need more information. I may throw in extra goodies if someone buys this quick, depending what I have lying around, or I will also consider a 1-for-1 trade if someone has a sealed Traditions Kentucky rifle kit.


Price is negotiable and I'm interested in all black powder firearms(in particular, percussion rifles) for trades. I'd also consider AK's, Mosins, Mausers, basically any military rifle."

Since I've never shot this rifle and it has been strictly a safe queen. I wanted to share his exact description of this AK when I bought it. 
I'm selling one of my favorite toys, my Lancaster AK-47. This is a Romanian AK, but it's not a cheap lowly WASR, these are built on American receivers w/G2 trigger group from the Romanian ""G Models"" (G stands for Guardia' and were the genuine military issue rifles.) I am the original owner of this rifle, purchasing it new about 8 years ago, directly from Lancaster Arms in Arizona (and shipped directly to Columbus.)
At that time Lancaster was very highly regarded by AK aficionados, but as order volume increased, they ability to maintain the same quality began to suffer after a few years, as did their reputation.
But the older Lancasters are still widely considered excellent rifles, as this one definitely is. One of the cool production trademarks was that they Parkerized the bare metal, and then used that as a base for the Gun-Kote baked on epoxy finish that looks great and is completely corrosion resistant.
The rifle has only been fired a few times, and is in pristine condition. The chrome bore is clean and crisp. The front sites and gas tube are perfectly straight, and the rivet heads are perfectly formed, and magazines fit firmly (like I said, it ain't a WASR). I installed an ERGO-Grip myself, as the are much more comfortable and ergonomic than those cheesy stock AK grips. I also installed the larger, Bulgarian flash-hider seen in the pics. The rifle has both the cleaning rod and cleaning kit concealed in the butt-stock.
Included is the green-web AK sling, Case, 2 mags and one (1) Russian (Tula) Bake-Lite magazine as seen in the photos ( These are expensive, difficult to find and collector items on their own). 

I'm asking $1,500.00 or best cash offer. But may consider a trade for an AR-10 or Kimber Crimson 1911 45 pistol or what do you have? You can text me at 404-427-133one if you have any interest. Please don't waste my time if you are not legally allowed to own this firearm.

If you're low on ammo, please visit us at:

www.vexxer-munitions.com



    Now, we are a new company, and that means having a somewhat limited selection. We are off-setting that by offering our customers a free service for obtaining the rounds they want. If you don't see the caliber, brand or style you are looking for, do not hestitate to email us. Simply tell us what caliber, what brand, and how many rounds you would like, and we will contact our importer on your behalf. This is our way of apologizing for the small stock in-store; we chose to keep a good amount of inventory of commonly-shot calibers, rather than attempt to cover all our bases and only have 1 or 2 items per caliber in stock. We can find whatever you need.


    Before you email us asking about 9mm, let me just say that Vexxer is well aware of that deficiency; 9mm and .22LR are the next two calibers we will be adding to our store.



Email me anytime if you have questions; please note, we do not sell individual boxes of ammunition. The pictures below are either of our basic product, the 'brick' (100 rounds), or they are simply stock photos showing what we have in stock.

I have just created a wholesale ammunition company; Vexxer Munitions. We are one of three wholesalers who sell directly to the public.


If you're low on ammo, please visit us at:

www.vexxer-munitions.com



Now, we are a new company, and that means having a somewhat limited selection. We are off-setting that by offering our customers a free service for obtaining the rounds they want. If you don't see the caliber, brand or style you are looking for, do not hestitate to email us. Simply tell us what caliber, what brand, and how many rounds you would like, and we will contact our importer on your behalf. This is our way of apologizing for the small stock in-store; we chose to keep a good amount of inventory of commonly-shot calibers, rather than attempt to cover all our bases and only have 1 or 2 items per caliber in stock. We can find whatever you need.


Before you email us asking about 9mm, let me just say that Vexxer is well aware of that deficiency in particular; 9mm and .22LR are the next two calibers we will be adding to our store.



Email me anytime if you have questions; please note, we do not sell individual boxes of ammunition. The pictures below are either of our basic product, the 'brick' (100 rounds), or they are simply stock photos showing what we have in stock.




Cheers, and happy hunting,

I'm including all accessories, ammunition, and magazines that I've collected for this rifle. I would consider an offer on one item, but it is honestly easier for me to sell it all as a single unit.

Included accessories: Holographic sight, flip-up iron sight, detachable carry handle.

Ammunition: two cans of 5.56mm NATO 62 gr. ball ammunition. One can is entirely full with 10rd stripper clips, the second can is about half full, with a mix of stripper clips and loose rounds. I estimate well over 1000 rds total.

Magazines: 10 standard 30rd magazines, with magazine speed loader for stripper clips.

I'd strongly prefer an in-state face-to-face sale, for simplicity.  $1,650 total, or best offer. I would also consider trades for certain landscaping equipment (brush mowers, wood chippers, etc.)"

Yes, this shotgun looks and performs like a $2000+ shotgun, but look at the price. American Tactical Importers (ATI) imports the Calvary shotguns from Turkey and some believe they are made by Yildiz, one of the world's best shotgun manufacturers and sub-contract to big names, like Weatherby. The Turkish economy has seen better days and the skilled workers aren't paid very much. The cost in production is directly proportional to the price tag. Thus, we have a low-priced shotgun that has the looks, performance and dependability of the higher priced guns. Just compare the description items below (even has auto ejectors!), along with the price, with any O/U shotgun and you'll understand why it's so hard to find or keep one in stock. Sorry, but I have the last ONE from my wholesalers. My Cousin, Ronnie or Ron Bob, as he is known up on Ridge Road, doesn't like O/Us of any kind. I think it's because he can't get a double without 4 or 5 shells, but don't tell him I told you.

The Bounty Hunter is another great and affordable firearm from European American Armory (EAA).

A can killer, a snake charmer and one that you and cousin Ronnie Bob could spend an afternoon just plinking, like the old days. And don't forget Mary Sue, you could easily teach her how to shoot for the fourth time.

You are looking at a Pioneer Arms AKM made in Radom, Poland, and was imported by I.O. Inc.

This rifle is pretty much new. The scratches on the receiver and cover are all from rubbing against other guns in the safe. Some may even be from the factory. I've only run 200 rounds through it and its not even broken in yet.

As far as I know, the receiver, barrel, stock, bolt, and bolt carrier are all made in Poland. The FCG, pistol grip, piston, muzzle brake are US made. 

The Handguard is finished a dark red color, and it looks great.

This also accepts all the mags I have, Bulgarian, Korean, Romanian, Croatian, Tapco, Promag, etc. So you should be able to use any mag in this gun.

I'm including a Bulgarian 30 round mag seen in the photo, and one Promag 30 round magazine. I will not sell any other mags with this gun.

Ford Guns in Florida did all the metal work. They radius all the corners and smoothed all the edges and polished the matte to a mirror finish. The finish looks better than any bright stainless gun or nickel that you will ever see. Grant Cunningham gave the pistol one of his super trigger jobs. The single action is Scary and breaks at less than a pound. The double action feels like its gliding on Ice. All springs were replaced and all internals polished to a mirror finish. The pistol has a Hogue Rosewood grip and looks awesome against the mirror finish. Also has HI VIZ sights the red and white pipe have never been taken out of the pack. Shoots as good as it looks and will cut the same hole at 15 yards freehanded all day long. The pistol has had less than 400 rounds thru it and shows none to little drag line. FOR TRADE ONLY AND PLEASE KNOW THERE IS 1200 INVESTED IN THIS PISTOL. Thanks for looking.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  
Please note: This is the VP9 LE model, and comes with THREE 15-round mags and Tritium 3-dot night sights.
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

The gun is a 98% numbers matching example including the internal parts.
The dis-assembly screw located in front on the cylinder is an original replacement.
I ordered it from a french mil-surp supplier. Age appropriate with a matching finish.

The F block stamping dates the gun between 1873-1876 & its has a F138XX serial number.
The gun has two P stamps & S1892 stamping that indicate it was re-barreled in 1892.
It's one of the 1st DA/SA guns made and one of the 1st center fire guns made.
The markings indicate a manufacture date of 1873 (the first year of production)
It wasn't issued until 1874 and there were approx. 337,081 made.

Still retains the factory ""Bright"" or bare metal finish. Gunsmith advised it appeared original.
Bore is in excellent condition with sharp rifling & no apparent erosion or damage. 
The trigger & hammer still have the correct ""straw"" coloring. Very minimal signs of usage.
Handle may have been refinished??? However there no cracks/chips. 
The checkering is very deep & the finish still retains a shine. 
The Gun looks great to be 139 yrs old!!
There is a little patina on the bottom of the handle & minor age blemishes throughout.

A gunsmith advised it appeared mechanically sound but I have never fired the gun.
The cylinder aligns perfectly with the barrel & the Lock up/Timing are very tight.
The Double Action & Single Action trigger pull are extremely smooth.

The action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore.  The actions lugs have also been squared and trued.  The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared.  All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore.  Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.  For this build the bolt was also spiral fluted.

A brand new Rock Creek stainless match grade 5R rifing barrel was used for this build.  The contour is an M24 heavy bull barrel with 11.27 twist and finished at 24"".  An ovedsized Badger Ordinance recoil lug was installed to give a longer barrel shank.  The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action.  The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"".  This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter.  The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown.  The barrel has only 3 rounds through her...  I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was left in the white but this rifle can still be customized to your needs - add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; ect. 

The barreled action in a quality stock will easily shoot 1/2 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/4 MOA using hand loaded ammo.  I have a few HS precision stocks and a few Bell and Carlson stocks to offer with this build.

I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s avalible as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note...  I probally have it or can build it.

It includes a POF Warhog! Please google this rifle and you will see how outstanding this gun is! It is without a doubt, the best piston system money can buy and I have owned all the best piston rifles on the market (LWRC, POF, PWS, etc..) This is POF’s Premiere rifle at the current moment. i bought this rig to varmint hunt with.. My needs have changed and I am going completely away from the AR platform. I intend to focus entirely on the long range bolt gun platform now… Im selling to fund a build so there are very few things I’m interested in as far as trade goes…. Below is a break down of everything included in the package and what I paid for it. I have all the paperwork, boxes, manuals, warranty cards for everything. gun has been fired less than 60 times. I had zero problem hitting a 12” steel swinger at 600 yds. The barrel is 1/8 twist so it will stabilize all ammo from 55-77gr. This rifle coupled with the Leupold glass is a great setup. The scope has the Kenton Industries turrets with yardage marks on the elevation turret. Rifle is dialed at 100yds. Just range target, roll turret to specified yardage and fire! its dead on out to 600yds. Minus wind of course :) Please Please Please do your research before making an offer..Im not hurting for money and I don’t HAVE to sell it. Lowball offers will be ignored!!! This is NOT an Academy, Wal-Mart AR….. For those of you who have the same ""Best Money Can Buy"" disease as me, you will appreciate this more than others! Thanks for looking!

Here is the blurb off the Wilson website:

The 92G Brigadier Tactical features the most sought after Beretta 92 features and all-steel Beretta and Wilson Combat custom parts right out of the box.

Some features of the limited production Wilson Combat/Beretta 92G Tactical include steel ambidextrous decocker-only levers (G model), enhanced Brigadier slide, a modified M9A1 style checkered frame with accessory rail and rounded trigger guard. This model also features enhanced accuracy with an ""Elite"" style match grade stainless barrel with recessed target crown, the action features a ""D"" hammer spring for lighter trigger pulls, and Trijicon dovetail tritium front sight and Wilson Combat rear sight.  Wilson Combat G-10 grips, Wilson Combat steel guide rod and numerous other features to enhance performance. The 92G Tactical is finished in Beretta black Bruniton and marked with the Wilson Combat logo and specially serialized to ensure its place in Beretta history.

Although the 92G Tactical has been optimized by Beretta to meet the needs of high round count tactical and competitive shooters, further customization and finish work is available through Wilson Combat.

""Being a serious Beretta collector, I have always considered the 92G SD the best model ever produced, but almost too expensive and rare to shoot. I feel fortunate to have been able to work with the fine people at Beretta USA to produce a pistol that, in my opinion, is an improved 92G SD. Having Beretta USA build my dream 92 series pistol is awesome and I’m very happy that a lot of people will be able to enjoy this fine pistol model."" -Bill Wilson"
