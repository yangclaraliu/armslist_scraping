The K-15 Kryptonyte Green laser is a modern styled laser for the modern rifle. The military styling and use of cutting edge technology makes this the best laser to put on the modern carbine rifle. 

Specs are listed below, but this is a professional green laser aiming system for your carbine.  Used as a training demo model, it was only used in the classroom and never mounted on a rifle in the field.  Nothing included other than what is pictured, but in “like new” condition with no wear.

The Kryptonyte Green Laser was designed for use with the modern rifle, carbine or any weapon with 3 inches of picatinny rail for mounting. Made out of aircraft grade 6061 aluminum with T3 hardness. The entire aluminum body is black anodized in a level 2 hardness. The concise laser engraved markings clearly shows all the user-friendly features. The laser is fully adjustable with hex drive screws protected by sealed turret caps. The offset design of the laser aperture allows for more flexible mounting options.

The issue is you have to hit the forward assist before you fire it.  The upper and lower receivers were hydro-dipped in the “Blizzard Camo” pattern.  I have fired approximately 25 rounds through this rifle and it is awesome.  I am selling for two reasons: one is I bought the all the rounds I found locally (five boxes) and I do not like ordering rounds through the mail and two I had shoulder surgery last year and every time I fired this weapon my shoulder ached for about a week after.

Selling my used Gen 4 Glock 22 chambered in .40S&W with everything included from the factory like 3 factory 15rnd magazines and four back straps, also inlcuded is a factory Glock 22rnd Extended Magazine, and 3 mags worth of Underwood 180gr Gold Dots. I've carried this Glock every single day for 2 years every where I went, no carry gun stays spotless, especially the finish on Gen 4 Glocks, so it has scratches but they're very light and not through the finish, blemishes, and holster marks from holstering and unholstering over the course of 2 years but none of the marks are bad or deep. The gun is functionally flawless, about 500 assorted rounds without any failure. If you plan on carrying a handgun daily it will get scratched up, theres no way around that, so don't get caught up on that. But if you want a safe queen only to show off to your friends this isn't the gun for you.

I recently got a Glock 17 which why I'm selling my 22. I took my aftermarket sights off my 22 onto my 17, and put the brand new factory sights on the 22. So sights are brand new and bright. Also has a Lone Wolf Extended Slide Release Lever with some finish worn off, I will include the factory release in the box. Plus a Jentra Grip Plug in the box, It's for use without the back straps on.

The Underwood Gold Dots are hot loaded defensive ammo with 1100fps and 484ft-ibs of energy. There are 47 rounds as I fire 3 rounds from every box of defensive ammo to make sure there is no issues with the batch. Thats 3 magazines with 2 +1's.

With Rossi’s Rio Grande series, the Brazilian Company has tapped Browning’s brilliant elder, John M. Marlin. Photos show the first specimen we had of the Rossi RG3030B Rifle, the Rio Grande chambered in the tried and true .30-30 Winchester caliber. The Rio Grande series, writes the factory, is for high performance lever action hunting and shooting. Now there's a Rossi rifle in the popular 30-30 Winchester caliber. The Rio Grande offers accuracy, performance and practicality for a lifetime of fast, lever-action shooting. Authentic buckhorn sights and a beautiful hardwood finish make this model look like the classic, but the Rossi design performs like a state-of-the art rifle. These blue steel hard-charging lever-actions provide 6+1 rounds for shooting fun. They come fully loaded with the latest features for safety and reliability. This Rossi will digest any .30-30 ammunition from the 125 grain hollow points all the way to 190 grain lead heads. Factory specs are Lever Action Repeating Rifle, 20 inch Blue Steel Barrel with 1:12 right hand six groove rifling; step elevator dovetailed Buckhorn all blue steel rear sight with matching brass tipped blade dovetailed front sight; blue steel receiver made on the order of the Marlin 1895 ancestor; Marlin style white steel bolt with blue steel extractor and ejector assembly; lever safety, cross-receiver safety and Taurus patented internal hammer lock system furnished with two keys; .367 width low serrated spur hammer set low enough to clear most scope objectives without the use of a hammer extension; .275 smooth faced blue steel trigger set on 4 pound range with minimal felt creep; tube fed with 6 + 1 round capacity of .30-30 Winchester Caliber ammunition, not interchangeable with any other caliber; 14 inch length of pull from trigger face to end of the magnum grade, spacer-lined 1 inch buttpad; Brazilian Hardwood stock and forend with swivel studs installed in the buttstock, and barrel band integral forend area stud; overall length 38 3/4 inches; weight empty 5.8 pounds with center of gravity at the lever pivot strut; 6 slot Picatinny or Weaver type scope mount included and in place. This is a fine looking rifle, as the photos suggest. Competitor and progenitor Marlin 336 rifles command pricing upwards of $600 per unit in our area.

589,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4495589,For Sale:  Silencerco Osprey 9mm,"Denver West, Denver, Colorado",$ 720,"Listed On: Monday, April 11, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Silencerco Osprey 9mm with 1/2-28 piston - $719.95 Silencerco's Osprey family of pistol suppressors (or silencers, as often called) is a perfect blend of form and function.With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs, the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&amp;W, and 45ACP.Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube's diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun.The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun's sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter's sight picture or adding excessive width and length."

I've got receipts for everything and am asking for 75% of what I have invested.

Details:
I used my friends HK45 at the range and loved it enough that I bought one of my own. I love how the 45 shoots, but I really don't need a full size gun.  I've got an HK USP40 compact for my conceal carry that doesn't shoot as nice, but fits my carry style better.  So, this gun has had 20 rounds through it since I bought it and I figure it is time to move it on to make room for something else.

I've also recently bought into a hunting lease and would like to add to my shotgun and rifle collection.  I'll be hunting Turkey and plan to buy a good shotgun for the spring.  I'd also like to pick up one more ready to hunt rifle for this fall.  Kind of leaning toward a .243 or a .308, but might go with a .270.  I'm not locked into a caliber as much as I want a nice set up that I can hand to my 15 year old and know he will be able to shoot it accurately.  

For that matter getting a great coyote gun might be interesting as well.  I'm not desperate to sell, but I would like to sell this gun before I buy a rifle (told myself that the safe would be one gun out for every gun in...)

You'll need to show me your CCW or permit and your DL in order to buy the gun.

This rifle is all matching numbers to include the receiver, barrel, stock, bolt and magazine (magazine is a forced match, the others are not).

This is not a Mitchell Mauser. It is import stamped.

Previous arsenal and manufacture markings were scrubbed on this one, but are still visible.
Faintly below the 24/47 markings Royal Yugo markings can be seen, as well as the location of original manufacture (Artillery Technical Institute). This makes original manufacture prewar (1928-31). Hard to get a picture of this as it is so faint, but it is there and I certainly welcome anyone to inspect it in person if they wish.

There are also two scrubbed German acceptance stamps, one on the receiver, indicating that the action (not the rifle as it sits today) was seized and put into German service, and one on the bolt release. So the action certainly saw combat during WWII.

The rifling is nearly flawless. The rifle does have some surface rust on the receiver, but this is limited and there is no corrosion. Not pretty but this rifle has been through a lot looking at the number/type of arsenal marks and stock markings.

Cycles great, shoots/groups dead on (though I don't have anywhere to shoot long range, so a little high at 100 yards as expected).

I have taken pictures of the rifle in and out, including all the markings should anyone wish to see more, ask questions etc.

All and all would make an all matching good shooter with a little bit of history behind it.

I'll cheat and use what Glock lists.  Per Glock:

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

As can be seen in the pictures, this pistol has seen very little use and, most likely, has around 10,000 rounds of life left before any repairs would have to be made.  There again, that could be much, much more.  Gen 3 Glock 30 SF yours for $445!  Purchaser must show valid IN ID and preferably have LTCH.  Also, PLEASE don't think I am rude, but I'll will most likely keep the pistol if I can't get this much in cash or a decent trade.  I'm looking for reloading equipment."

I have a quite rare BRNO model 1 in .22LR  for sale. The condition shows use, and the metal has some pitting especially around the wood line. Bore seems to be in good shape however. Wood is dinged up with some scratches and dents, but nothing you wouldn't expect in a rifle this age. Has a magazine, but my bet is this is not the original magazine. It is missing the front sling swivel, the hood for the front sight, and the factory original butt plate. There is a cork butt plate that someone made for the gun, I'm assuming to lengthen the stock a bit. It's done quite well actually, and sort of looks like it honestly could have come from the factory that way if you didn't know better! Overall, I would rate the condition 85-89% It's not a prize collector, but because they are so rare, even in the condition it's in, it's still fairly nice and a great shooter grade Model 1 for sure. Would prefer Wi sales only, but shipping to FFL is not completely out of the question. Can send more pictures if interested. Price is $325.00"

Let’s talk about the difference

We have hand fitted the ""Made in the USA"" CZC Match Grade Barrel, tighter fit and tolerance then standard factory barrel.

The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug.

NO TRADES!! Forgive me if I sound harsh, but I do a lot buying and selling online and there are quite a few folks out there who either cannot read or are simply knuckleheads.  So, you either have the money to buy this kind of gun or you don't.  I am of course okay if you don't, but please don't waste my time and yours with offers - if this is not worth the price to you, please just keep looking, and please don't send me silly emails.  I did actually lower the price, but I also have patience and am well aware of the demand for this gun,  I sold another I had last year for $2300.  Given the demand and supply, this is a very good price.  Thanks to those who do have a head on your shoulders for your understanding.

CZC ACCU Shadow  (CZC Custom Version with Match Fit Barrel)
CZC MATCH BARREL & FIXED SIGHT

CZC 75 SP01 ACCU Shadow #91735
USPSA Production Approved!
Features
*CZC Fitted Match Barrel
*CZC Stainless steel barrel bushing.
*CZC Stainless steel reverse plug.
*CZC SHORT reset trigger system “CZC SRTS”
*CZC Competition Fixed rear sight.

These modifications have been added to the already customized CZ Custom SP01 Shadow Pistol. #91029

We have been very busy at the CZ Custom Shop over the last few months. We have been working and perfecting some new products and parts for the SP01 Shadow and the CZ 75 Shadow. This details the changes brought about to create the CZ 75 SP01 ACCU SHADOW.

Let’s talk about the difference

We have hand fitted the ""Made in the USA"" CZC Match Grade Barrel, tighter fit and tolerance then standard factory barrel.

The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug.

The bushing keeps the front sight in the slide so no pin is necessary or needed (fitting the pin will damage the bushing threads.)

The bushing will need to be removed before the barrel can be taken from the gun.

Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group.

This can be retrofitted by CZC to any CZ with a full width slide.


What’s new and very exciting is the CZC SHRT reset trigger system. People have been asking for a shorter faster reset without the trigger swinging all the way forward in SA mode, now we have it.

We have taken almost all of the forward movement out of the single action position with the trigger moving on average less than a 1/16 (0.0625”) before stopping. We have basically created a 1911 single action on a double action gun."

I know because I am Romanian and I served in the ROM Army and this was my service weapon, it really delivered in times of need. Comes with one 10 rounds, one 5 rounds magazines, cleaning kit, 8x42 red reticle battery powered scope made in Belarus, Harris bipod. I didn't have a chance to sight in the scope due to lack of a proper shooting range. This is an honest like new rifle who sat in a safe for too many years. Buyer pays for shipping.
P.S. For all of you PSL and other rifles owners out there, never mount your bipod right on the barrel. Never constrain your barrel with anything else. I see too many pictures out there and that's a sin. Good luck!"

The bore is in great condition, the pistol comes with the original 8rd magazine and a pair of really nice walnut grips. The pistol is fully functional as I have personally shot about 100rds down range, and let me tell you it is extremely accurate with hardly any recoil. The pony is in mint condition as you can see in the pictures. I will also throw in a spare barrel to sweeten the deal. I have had the pistol for about 5 years, it was purchased in an auction upstate New York. The pistol was found in a old cigar box wrapped up in a cloth in the attic. Lots of history here. Only reason I am selling her is because I have 2. Please no lowball offers, trades or spamming as I will completely ignore you. (The pictures do this pistol no justice).
