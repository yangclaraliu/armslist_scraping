The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

These are very high quality magazines they have stainless steel bodies as well as stainless steel springs. I paid 30$ each for them at Cabela's about 2 months ago opened them, loaded them and then sold my AR15. I know I overpaid for them so I'm not trying to get my money back but these are very nice magazines and are basically brand new besides being opened.

I'm not really sure what price to put on the whole package,maybe around 100$ or so that's less than half of what I paid for it. Email me for a complete count on what ammo I have left and we can work out a price. It does not have to be sold as a package I will separate it.

As far as trades go:
I have a full size double-stack RIA 22TCM / 9MM combo that I am looking for parts for. It is a double stack 1911. I'm pretty much looking for any higher end (Wilson, Ed Brown, etc.) stainless steel aftermarket 1911 parts. The top of my want list is a stainless ambi mag release, 2 barrel bushing, mainspring housing, nice set of double-stack grips and a set of higher end adjustable combat sights - dovetail style. It comes with an adjustable rear sight on it but isn't up to par for me.  I'm pretty sure most of the single stack parts will work on the double stacks except for the mag release, trigger, mags and grips. There might be a few others that I'm not aware of.

May also trade for 9mm ammo or (preferably 22 TCM ammo)."

A large contract for the Beretta 92 was with the Brazilian army, for which Beretta set up a factory in Brazil. This factory was later sold to the Brazilian gunmaker Taurus (Forjas Taurus S/A ). Taurus makes these pistols (called the PT92) without the need for a license from Beretta since their design is based on the original Beretta 92, whose patents have since expired.

Like the Beretta, the Taurus PT92 utilizes the open-slide design where the upper portion of the slide is cut away exposing much of the barrel itself. The original PT92 was exactly like the original Beretta 92, though it was also unusual for the time in that it featured a squared trigger guard for supporting the index finger of the opposite hand while firing, a feature which was subsequently introduced to the Beretta 92 with the 92SB-F (92F) model in 1985.

Other versions of the PT92 include the PT99, which has an adjustable rear sight and a taller front sight, the compact PT92C version, and the PT100 and PT101, which are .40 S&W versions of the PT92 and PT99, respectively.

The Taurus PT92 has undergone many revisions in design since it was originally produced in the mid-1980s. Early PT92s and PT99s did not feature the third safety position decocker that is now standard; this feature was added to the second-generation models in the early-1990s, which also included the three-dot sights found on the Beretta 92F. A third revision in the late-90s changed the grip and slide design (which now has wider cocking serrations than PT92s manufactured before 1997).

More recently (as of 2005), Taurus has begun manufacturing the PT92 with built-in accessory rails on the frame, a feature found on the newer Beretta M9A1, a military upgrade of the Beretta 92F from which the PT92 is derived"

Rock Island 1911 9mm: $425
Well built, well cared for, full size 1911 in 9mm. Gun is very tight, has VZ grips, ambidextrous safety, an extended mag well, and comes with 4 magazines. Low round count, no issues. 

Para Ordnance Tac 4 1911: $500
Double stack .45, commander size. About 400 rounds through it and haven't had any issues at all. Has a little holster wear but no nicks or damage at all. Cleaned and safe kept when not on the range. Comes with 5 magazines, 3 are almost brand new. 

Interested mainly in trading for a 1911, prefer commander size with the bob tail/palm swell (Sig Nightmare Carry would be ideal, love Springfield too). Open to other gun trades though. Worst I can say is no thanks. Will sell individually as marked or together for $850. Meet in town, Theodore/Tillman's Corner area. Text or email questions or for more pictures. REDACTED"

	I have available for trade/sale a used but great little Carry pistol. This is a Kel-tec P3AT chambered in 380 ACP. This is a great shooting little gun that would be perfect for a girl or smaller frame person. The size is so small that it is hard to believe it shoots a centerfire round that large. This gun shows a lot of carry wear on the edges of the bluing, but shot perfect when i shot it and mainly just needs a deep cleaning. I bought this for my girl to shoot, but she doesn’t like it as much as the LCP. This will come with the pinky rest magazine plate and the flush plate. I also have ammo I could include for the right trade/price.
	Trade wise, I am somewhat open as long as it is for firearm items. No 22s, blackpowders, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor though. To make an offer or for any questions, shoot me a text at REDACTED. Need to meet in Norman."

Pre B means before the B model or without a firing pin block equating to a much smoother trigger pull and fewer moving parts. The oldest model apart from the 1975 Short Rail. I have noticed several of these coming up for sale lately, many shoddily ressurected guns with a cheap duracote job and thrown on gunbroker. I am asking the same price, but if you take a close look my gun is worlds better in quality. For starters my gun had NO import marks like all those aim surplus and cdi guns out there. And unlike the flipper specials, this gun was refinished by DOA arms in Virginia Beach the right way. The devil is in the good prep work. 3 stages of stripping including media blasting and alkali strip are performed. Then Cerakoting with the thermal baked formula, not the thinner air dry cheaper mix. Afterwards, the gun was reassembled by me including upgrades in springs and an internal polishing. The stainless steel barrel is also polished. From the outer view this gun is bone stock. Lastly it's wearing a brand new set VZ Frag Black Cherry G10 grips. Original CZ grips are included as well. 1 hard to find Pre B 16 round mag included. The secret to finding excellent mags for a good price: CZ SP-01 mags fit perfect, match the grip contour and hold 18 rounds. Buy them. You will not find a nicer CZ 75 Pre B for anywhere near this price if you look closely to the detail work. More pics available via text if requested.

Cumbersome to put on, not enough capacity and plenty primers don't even make it into the collector.

I fixed this by improving an existing design for a new primer catcher design. Much, much better than what RCBS provides... There is one person on ebay selling those in a different (inferior) design - my version has a few significant improvements.

The improvement are making it more stable on the press (smaller gaps between catcher and press) and a clamp on version versus the one that tries to lock the catcher down with a spent .22 case.

The one I sell also comes with the tube.

But, to set expectations - this is not coming out of a mold, it will have minor cosmetic imperfections (3D printing in the consumer market simply are limited in regards to resolution). It will be working perfectly fine and will fit your Rock Chucker IV as advertised.

Have a look at the pictures and let me know if you have questions. 

Price is $20 and includes shipping in the lower 48.
Payment via money order, certified personal check, cash, 1oz silver and local pickup/cash only.

•Fiberglass bedded stock provide longevity
•X-Lock four-screw scope-mounting system

•60° bolt throw is easily operable with heavy gloves

 Browning's X-Bolt Composite 3D Bird's-Eye-Maple Rifles are packed with innovation that rivals firearms costing thousands more. Their 60° bolt lift prevents your thumb from hitting the scope and provides quick cycling for follow-up shots. The 3- to 5-lb. adjustable and predictable Feather Trigger breaks like glass at the precise moment for tack-driving accuracy. A lightweight polymer detachable-rotary magazine feeds the rounds in line with the bolt for perfect feeding into the chamber. An ergonomic top-tang safety quietly clicks into fire mode to prevent spooking your trophy. The bolt-unlock button atop the bolt lever provides peace of mind while unloading your firearm because it prevents the safety from being turned off to unlock the bolt. The receiver's X-Lock™ scope mounting system uses a four-screws-per-base design that secures the scope in accurate placement, providing reliable accuracy on demanding hunts. Glass bedded to provide a sturdy foundation, connecting the receiver to the stock. Inflex Technology recoil pad is constructed of a soft rubber that directs recoil forces to prevent muzzle climbing while drawing the comb away from your cheek. Matte-stainless steel receiver reduces game-spooking glare that keeps a showroom-quality finish. Matte-stainless barrel looks as good as it hunts. Free floating and hand chambered with a target crown, providing superior accuracy. Composite stock with a bird's-eye-maple finish resists the elements. Black-textured gripping panels on the forend and pistol grip provide a sure hold when the weather doesn't cooperate. Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides long-lasting dependability.
