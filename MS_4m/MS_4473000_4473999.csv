15,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4473015,For Sale:  FLARE GUN - M2 Aviators Set - UNUSUAL,"Vestavia, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, November 7, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is quite unusual and you don't see these come up for sale complete very often. It's a M2 Flare Pistol Aviators Set consisting of the rather massive and super heavy duty M2 flare pistol (made by International Flare & Signal Company), carry case that holds the flare pistol and it's ammo supply which are absolutely massive MK1 60 second parachute flares. That's right 60 second parachutes!! To the best of my knowledge nothing else that is hand held rivals the sheer size and burn duration of these shells. They are monsters and each one weighs over 2 pounds! They are sealed on top and the primers are sealed as well. So while I can't guarantee it - I do think these big boys would fire if you decided to do that. Although you'd certainly need to pick your place well as you might have every emergency responder in the area show up if you don't. The flares were made by Kilgore and they are dated 1948. They are consecutively serial numbered so they are a matching set. This flare gun outfit might have seen military use or it could have been issued to a commercial flight crew. One thing for sure is that these were in service as the Cold War was heating up. The pistol, case and the flare cartridges are all in great shape. The carry case has the original nylon carry handle in place and the small strap that secures the pistol in it's compartment.

This 9x19mm pistol shows VERY little wear and use considering it was a former West German Federal Police handgun. The polizei ordered these to replace their Walther 32s.

It's in very nice used condition, with two 8 round magazines, black composite handgrip, black alloy frame, black/blued steel slide. 

 I'd rate the finish at 95% or better.  Feel free to check it out and prove me wrong.  I've heard some P6 owners say that they easily added Sig Pro night sights that popped right on with the assistance of a sight pusher.
How does it shoot?  Say what you will, but like many of my other pieces, I've never had the time to take it to the range. That's what living in L.A. can do to you. Still I like it by itself, just as a piece of history.

It's like-new with two 13-round mags, the original box, manual, and interchangeable back straps. 

Price is absolutely firm, cash only, and I don't want a lot of back and forth via email (no offense, but some buyers on Armslist make things needlessly complicated and involved). Background checks for private party sales aren't required in Oregon until August, but I will be requiring proof of ID, an affirmation that you can lawfully purchase and possess the gun, and a bill of sale for my records. I'll show you my ID as well and can affirm that I'm the true original purchaser (i.e. it's not stolen). Will absolutely not drive to Salem or Eugene to meet you (I've seriously had people ask me that). Strong preference to meet downtown Portland (at my office). Hey, it's air-conditioned!

The photographs here are stock photos which better showed the resolution and color, but my Glock looks the same as these.

If there are any questions I can answer, fire away, and I'll shoot you a response. See what I did there? Now repeat that line a million times without jamming. A little Glock humor. Hehehe!"

This is the real deal.  This is brand new never mounted in box with all papers.  I took off cellophane and took it out just for photos. And of course to look through it because it is awesome.  This is the scope that comes standard with Barrett M82A1 rifles, that's how I got it (yes, IN BOX UNMOUNTED) but I do not want it.  It is too nice for me and if I use this scope, then I will think all my other scopes are fuzzy and dark (which they are compared to this!)  So it is best to let it go.  This scope ""retails"" for $1200+ although if you look around you can find it for $999 several places.  I just want $800 cash.  If you want to pay paypal, add 3%.  I will ship it anywhere in US no problem and will pack it up real nice.  This is serious.  This is the real scope at a big discount, you have to know what this is and what it's worth.  Don't offer me less, don't offer me trades, I just would like the cash, thank you.

BNIB (Brand New In Box) means the weapon HAS NOT BEEN FIRED (apart from a test fire at the factory).  

ANY rounds through the weapon -- weather it is a box of ammo, a magazine (they are not ""clips,"" folks), or a single round by a consumer -- means IT IS NO LONGER BRAND NEW!!

The rifle is fitted with a BSA Sweet 17 Scope, specifically designed for .17hmr. This Rifle is set, adjusted and ready to go. You cannot do any better then a Weatherby and this is the best of the best for small game and varmint hunting. Comes with original box and three magazines.

One of these amazing rifles just closed on Gunbrokers with more then 20 bids and ended at just over $2000, and that was without the scope.

I am asking $1600 cash, OR would consider talking trade for a M&P 15 or similar type of rifle, 300 whisper/blackout with Realtree Camo. NOT interested in anything without factory camo finish."

The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G22 Gen4 .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

It is patterned after the SIG 55x series rifles that fire 5.56x45mm centerfire cartridges.The 522 fires .22LR ammunition and serves as a training platform for its larger counterparts due to mostly identical controls and features. It differs from its centerfire counterpart in a number of ways. The 522 series has no adjustable gas block as the 55x series does. Instead, a mock gas block is installed. SIG refers to this as a storage container. Instead of 30-round magazines, the 522 series accepts 10-round or 25-round magazines that are manufactured by Black Dog Machine and re-branded for distribution with the SIG 522.Manufacturer: Sig SauerModel: SIG522 Caliber: .22 LRBarrel: 17""Type: Semi-Automatic"

Features a 16.1 inch 1-7 inch twist chrome-lined barrel and is chambered for 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington). With the all-black MOE buttstock fully retracted, it measures 32.25 inches and weighs 6.8 pounds. Magpul Generation 2 Rear Back-Up Sight (MBUS), MOE Vertical Grip (MVG), 30-round Magpul Polymer Magazine (PMAGS), MOE Hand Guard, MOE-K Hand Grip, MOE Trigger Guard and MOE Carbine Stock and an RVG fore end grip and Colt Flash Suppressor.

Colt's popular 6920 M4 carbine, proven to be effectively mobile during tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Fully retracting buttstock, this carbine measures only 30.5 inches and weighs in at only 6.8 pounds. Tried and true, this carbine boasts proven advantages like a safe, semi-automatic rate of fire for potent firepower capability and speed of target acquisition.

The advantage of the LE6920MP-R is the Troy Rail and Magpul's American-made accessories as standard equipment. The Magpul additions are cost effective products engineered to enhance weapon performance and usability. 

Not only do you get the rifle fitted with all those accessories, I'm tossing in one 40 round PMAG new in package, 5 steel 30 round Blackhawk mags with anti tilt followers new in the package, a accu wedge new in the package, and 600 rounds of ammo!

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation as well as be entirely removed to expose the threaded barrel. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The 9mm SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK17, GLK19, S&W59, BERETTA92,  SIG226.
