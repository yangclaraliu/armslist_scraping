I am trading my rifle with the ultimak, krebs safety,  us palm akbg, 5 loaded 30rd pmags, manticore arms flash hider, buttstock cleaning kit, 60 rds of boxed wolf ammo and cleaning rod. Everything is in excellent condition. This rifle is like new with only 100 rounds through it. Only reason I want to trade is because I'm worried about over penetration for my intended uses where I'm living currently and am considering the 5.45 AK's instead. I will meet in Stuart, Jensen Beach, or Port saint Lucie otherwise you will have to drive to me. Sorry. I may also be willing to sell it if I get enough cash or close enough to buy a Arsenal 5.45 AK with the 100 series folding stock, 5 loaded mags, ultimak, and us palm akbg. If I don't find a trade or a sale I will just keep the rifle and buy some hornady HP in 7.62x39 or something else that won't over penetrate so if you've got that and want to sell it please let me know as I might want to buy it.

I have taken it out once since buying it new and it was a blast to shoot and it made me look good shooting traps (which is hard to do). Since I don't shoot it enough, I am going to part ways with it. I paid 1300 a year ago and it comes with original box. Here is the description from Buds Gun Shop:
This is CZ-USA's first gun designed with target shooters in mind. The Redhead Target is assembled like the standard Redhead, but with a different purpose. This over/under has been built to crush clay targets, plain and simple. It has a Monte Carlo stock designed to keep the gun into the shoulder while keeping the shooter's head up so that rising target is instantly seen leaving the trap house. A true target gun, it comes as a 12-gauge with 30"" barrels and stepped 10mm rib designed to pattern 80 percent above point of aim and 20 percent below, ideal for rising trap target presentations. The beautiful oil-finished Turkish Walnut stock is coupled with a matching forend featuring cut checkering and a Schnabel flourish. The silver finish of the receiver and the polished barrel provide impressive looks and the 5 chokes (F, IM, M, IC, C) make it read for any patterning. It's a perfect choice for those wanting to own a true target gun at a very affordable price point.

The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes."

I love this gun, ever since I got it in January 2015 to use for my carry gun. It's small, but still has some girth to it, that makes it fit well in the meatiest of paws, and it's built well so there aren't pinch points. 

From the first shot, it's been on target, and although I've only put about 200 rounds through it, it's been a great companion, and never let me down. It looks like new, because I take care of my things. It's always been stored with a trigger lock, in a locked safe when not in use, and like I said, I've only owned it for a few months, so it doesn't have any wear and tear on it. 

I have all the paperwork from purchasing it new at Cabelas in January, the manual, etc. and will even give you some 9mm ammo as a part of the deal. 

I'm not looking to gouge anyone, and I know you can buy this gun new for $500 or maybe a little less, so make me a fair offer, and you'll have yourself a new toy.

May Trade for an earlier gen Nova, Chevelle, Camaro or C4 Vette. Or other hit me up! Will take price down for the right guns added to a trade as well. But really just looking for CASH!

Original owner, bought new about a year ago. No scratches or dings. have put 200 rounds through the revolver, all my handloads with cast bullets. I have all the papers, box, and scope rings. I also have a Weigand rail that fits the revolver, this allows you to mount red dots among other things. This is the softest shooting 44mag i have in my collection. I just prefer the single actions, i never shoot this gun.

My experience ordering it was in-line with the reviews you can read online. The owner is a bit of an odd duck - when I called to order it he said he had his Glock 20/21 mold ready to go and would make it the next day. After weeks went by I couldn't get ahold of him and thought my money was gone, until one day around a year later I got a shipment notification. The gamble was worth it as it is a very high quality holster and the attention to detail is superb."

Make: Smith & Wesson

Model: 500 Magnum

Serial Number: CHR3248

Year of Manufacture: 2004

Caliber: .500 Magnum

Action Type: Single and Double Action Revolver with Swing-Out Cylinder

Markings: The right side of the barrel is marked “Smith & Wesson”. The right sideplate is marked “S&W 500” and the right side of the frame has the Marcas Registradas address. The left side of the barrel reads “500 S&W MAGNUM” The left side of the frame is marked with the S&W logo and an “L” with a counter clockwise arrow. The yoke cut is marked “CHR3248 / MOD 500” and the yoke is marked “159”. The butt is marked “CHR3248”.

Barrel Length: The barrel measures 9” to the end of the compensator

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a Patridge style blade on an elevated ribbed base. The rear sight is an S&W Micrometer Click square notch adjustable for windage and elevation.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The one piece round butt Hogue Monogrips are textured rubber with finger grooves and imprinted S&W logos. There is little to no wear. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition.

Type of Finish: Stainless Steel

Finish Originality: All Original

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion in the bore, but there is a bit of fouling which needs to be cleaned.

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 95% of its metal finish. There is some dried red grease which is difficult to remove. Once removed, there are some tarnished spots that are left behind mostly on the rear face of the cylinder. As this is a stainless gun, we believe it may clean up with considerable time and effort. This substance is found on the underside of the hammer, top strap, cylinder, in the bolt stop cuts, and around the cylinder release. The screw heads are Sharp. The markings are Clear. Overall, this handgun rates in about Fine condition.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly in both single and double action. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This revolver comes in a blue plastic S&W carry case. The end label does not correctly describe the pistol. The case shows only light storage wear and is in Excellent condition.

Our Assessment: The Smith & Wesson site has this to say about the massive 500 Magnum revolver: “In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W 500, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.” This is the ultimate in deep woods defense and handgun hunting. Strap this beast to a shoulder holster and be ready for anything. With some diligent cleaning and scrubbing, this will be a stainless beauty once again."

So, now I have some ammo I don't need.

I have a partial box of Hornady American Whitetail.  Specifications are: 150gr, Interlock

I have 8 rounds left in this box.  As you probably know, rounds for this caliber go for about 1.50 each at cheapest.  I am willing to sell these for $8, making that $1.00 a round. 

Then, I have a partial box of Winchester Super X.  Specifications are: 150gr, Power Point tips. 

I have 14 of these left. I am willing to sell these for $15, so pretty much $1.00 a round. 

For both that's $25, so that's what the posting price for the entire listing will be---but if you only want one or the other...that's fine too."

I am offering a basic gun clean service for $20.  At a retail store, you would easily pay $29.99 for their basic field strip and clean, which sometimes, especially if the gun wasn't that dirty to begin with--they wouldn't even take it apart.  They would just run the rod through the barrel and call it a day----ridiculous to me. I have seen this first hand.

Anyways, they would also take 1-3 weeks to get your gun back to you.

This of course isn't my day job, so I couldn't promise anything as far as time---but anything over a week is ridiculous to me.

I have my own equipment kits and cleaners/oils.

Specifically, I use Hoppes Elite and Rem Oil."
