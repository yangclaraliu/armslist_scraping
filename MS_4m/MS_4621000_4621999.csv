The SMR MK8 is one of the first rails available to utilize the Magpul M-LOK technology. These rails are designed to give the user full modularity while maintaining a strong and rigid platform. Maximum venting at the lower 45° quadrants create maximum heat dissipation and also dramatically reduces the rails overall weight. Utilizing Magpul's M-LOK technology at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, as well as the upper 45° quadrants. The SMR MK8 is both versatile and modular, allowing the user to tailor their platform to his or her unique needs. The SMR MK8 also features Geissele's proprietary 2"" long barrel nut. This increases the surface contact where the rail interfaces with the receiver and creates a platform that can be trusted to be straight and true the entire length of the free float rail. This increases accuracy and zero repeatability during disassembly and reassembly when performing maintenance. Bundled with a low-profile Geissele Super Gas Block, the SMR MK8 is not only feature packed, but it is also value packed.Description:Height: 2.3""Length: 15""Inner Diameter: 1.35""Outer Diameter/Distance Across Quadrants: 2.11""Weight: 10.8 oz.Installed Weight (w/ Hardware): 12.7 oz.Available in Black and DDC (Desert Dirt Color)Item Number: 05-285"

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.Item #: 5080300UPC_Code: REDACTED30Description: WAI CCP 9MM PST 8RD BManufacturer: Walther Arms IncModel #: CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol)Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Black CerakoteStock: Black Polymer, Non-Slip Hi-Grip TextureSights: FT: Interchangeable RR: AdjustableBarrel: 3.54Overall Length: 6.5Weight: 22.33 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 8+1Action: Single Action# of Mags: 2 Receiver: Black Polymer, Equiptment Rail Features: SoftCoil Delayed Gas Blowback SystemLoaded Chamber Indicator, Reversible Mag ReleaseWe strive to provide correct and accurate information.

I built this rifle just a little over a year ago, and have only had the opportunity/time to shoot it once. The rifle has only had two magazines through it, to break in the barrel. It's very accurate and makes consistent hits on a 4 inch steel plate at 500 yards. 

The Rifle is chambered in 223 Wylde. Therefore, it is capable of firing 223 Remington and 5.56 NATO cartridges. 223 Wylde is essentially a NATO chamber with tighter tolerances to increase accuracy when firing 5.56 NATO cartridges.

I have a little over $1,300 in this rifle, and it is practically brand new. It's had one outing, where the barrel was broken in with 60 rounds and has set in a case since. I don't have the time to enjoy it so my loss is someone else's gain.

Here's what I have:

-Gen 3 Glock 22. Used, but perfectly functional condition. Moderate holster wear on slide finish, but functions flawlessly. Like a Glock should. I have a Hogue grip and a grip plug installed, but both are easily removable if you choose. Also has Trijicon night sights installed. Included with the Glock is a leather Minotaur IWB holster, a blackhawk SERPA paddle holster, 3 magazines, and Glock case.

-Like New (75 shells fired) H&R 18.5"" Pardner Pump Tactical. It's a Remington 870 clone, basically. I installed a 4-shot side saddle, Blackhawk sling swivels, Blackhawk sling with 15 shell capacity. It has the standard recoil pad and front bead sight. After some research, I found that new Remingtons have had some reliability issues, so this was my alternative. It breaks down the same as an 870, functions exactly the same, but doesn't have the reliability problems. I put less than 100 shells through it, but I never had a problem. It's a beast of a shotgun, and is fun on the range as well as good for home defense. 

Included with the shotgun is a padded shotgun case (used once), manual, cable lock, magazine tube plug, approx. 50 rounds of target shells, 10 rifled slugs, and 10 '00' buckshot shells.

I'm looking for NEW or LIKE NEW subcompact guns. Specifically: Glock 26, 27, 43. Also willing to consider any subcompact Sig Sauer, Walther, S&W (no revolvers), or Springfield. 

Not interested in full size handguns, budget guns like hi-point or kel-tec.

I built this rifle just a little over a year ago, and have only had the opportunity/time to shoot it once. The rifle has only had two magazines through it, to break in the barrel. It's very accurate and makes consistent hits on a 4 inch steel plate at 500 yards. 

 The Rifle is chambered in 223 Wylde. Therefore, it is capable of firing 223 Remington and 5.56 NATO cartridges. 223 Wylde is essentially a NATO chamber with tighter tolerances to increase accuracy when firing 5.56 NATO cartridges.

 I have a little over $1,300 in this rifle, and it is practically brand new. It's had one outing, where the barrel was broken in with 60 rounds and has set in a case since. I don't have the time to enjoy it so my loss is someone else's gain. 

 I'm asking $1,100 obo. 

 I'm not really interested in trades as I just want to sell to fund other projects, but if you want to attempt to trade, trade value is $1,300. My only real interests are a Sig Sauer 224 in 9mm, and I like M&P's (9mm and 45 Fullsize only). Be prepared to add boot.

The reason why I am pricing this higher than other 835s on nationwide armslist is because this one includes a lot of extras that the others don't.

First and foremost, the stock has been upgraded to an adjustable length (I believe ar-style compliment, but ive never tried) stock, with clips on the side that i used to hold different types of shells in. It also comes with a second barrel, which has a rail for an optic should you want to put one on. When you are using this second barrel, you can also use the tube extender, which I am including, to hold more rounds. If I can find it I will also include the sling with sling adaptors for a more comfortable fit.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

This poorly-written turd of a law known previously as HB 13-1229 and now known as CRS 18-12-112 specifically exempts antiques and curios and relics from the private-party background check requirement. It does not require the transferror or transferee to hold a C&R license for the exemption.

CRS 18-12-112:
(6) THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION DO NOT APPY TO:
(a) A TRANSFER OF AN ANTIQUE FIREARM, AS DEFINED IN 18 U.S.C. SEC 921(a)(16), AS AMENDED, OR A CURIO OR RELIC, AS DEFINED IN 27 CFR 478.11, AS AMENDED;

27 CFR 478.11:
Curios or relics. Firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons. To be recognized as curios or relics, firearms must fall within one of the following categories:
(a) Firearms which were manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date, but not including replicas thereof;
(b) Firearms which are certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum which exhibits firearms to be curios or relics of museum interest; and
(c) Any other firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event. Proof of qualification of a particular firearm under this category may be established by evidence of present value and evidence that like firearms are not available except as collector's items, or that the value of like firearms available in ordinary commercial channels is substantially less.

So for any firearm 50 years old or older, or on the C&R list can still be bought and sold freely, privately, just like before 7/1/13!"

Description
MB762SS01

Enables attachment of FA762SS suppressor to M1A, M14, or any 7.62mm (.308 cal.) semi-auto or bolt-action rifle with M14 spec muzzle configuration. This adapter functions alone as a high-performance muzzle brake when the suppressor is removed. Patented design greatly diffuses side blast, counteracts up/right muzzle movement to keep muzzle on target, eliminates felt concussion on shooter. Heat-treated stainless steel construction.

NOTE: SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders also serve as adapter mounts for our Fast-Attach® sound suppressors. If you do not plan to attach a SureFire sound suppressor to your firearm, we recommend choosing a shorter-length muzzle brake or flash hider. SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders that mate with our overlap suppressor models are longer in order to extend rearward over the barrel, a feature that is unnecessary unless mounting an overlap suppressor.

Features

    Provides rock-solid suppressor attachment in seconds without tools
    Precise tolerances provide minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of number of attach/detach cycles
    Acts as high-efficiency muzzle brake when suppressor is removed
    High resistance to heat and gas/particle erosion
    Installation requires no permanent modifications for Mil-Spec firearm barrels"

Laser Aim was a manufacturer who built ported .45 ACP pistols based on the original M1911 design, but incorporating elements of the BHP and the CZ-75 into a new design. The unique feature of the Laser Aim was a hole cut out of the trigger guard ahead of the trigger to mount a laser. By the late 1990's LaserAim had gone out of business and had sold their patents to AMT.

She has some cancer on her manly the front fenders, under the doors, and in the bed but it still holds me in there at 220 lbs, she has a small block 307 from the 70s in her with a new cam, new plugs, new fuel pump, and new water pump. she could stand the 4 barrel carb cleaned or rebuilt there is a little lag going up hill but she runs with no problems, never left me stranded. She has headers and glass packs with pipes bent coming out the side, sounds real mean. I drive her all the time pull my boat with her, and wouldn't hesitate jumping in her and driving to south Florida tomorrow. She has a 350 turbo transmission that runs and shifts like a champ. I hate to see her go but we own 4 four wheel drives and that's a little much so i'm lookin for something different to play with, some things i'm interested in are four wheeler s, guns, crossbows... and cash always works. Just shoot me a text or call with what you have to offer i'm open to most anything worst i can say is no

I do not know the actual millage of the truck. I got it and it had the new motor in it. It ran and the 4X4 functioned flawlessly so I did not care this is a great hunting truck/mud truck or piss off the person next to you in traffic truck. I never worry about someone dinging my doors or bumping into me in a parking lot, she ain't a show truck but if someone wanted to sink a little money in her she could be, the frame doesn't have any rust to my knowledge at least i never seen any, no reason to really crawl around under her to find out 

the con's carb needs cleaned possibly rebuilt but still goes and has a oil leak from the oil pan gasket that's it, that's all i drive it from Garner to Youngsville on a regular basses to see family and take her out to the farm in Zebulon from time to time its been a awesome truck to own and a very fun truck to drive

This is the older style 92 Type L, without the accessory rail.   These were discontinued in the early 1990s (if I remember correctly), although some were imported into the U.S. market c. 2011 - 2012, supposedly from  an over-run for some foreign government contract.    In 2013, Beretta re-introduced the 92 Compact Type L with an accessory rail for mounting lights.

Great condition. Some handling mark and a couple wear spots on the blueing.  Bores are clean and shiny BUT there is a small nick at the end on the inside of the right bore. Never noticed it before and it has zero affect on accuracy / pattern.  All and all a lovely gun. Locks up tight. I've adjusted the price to reflect the nick and i will not go lower."

It was bought in September of 2014, brand new from Cabelas in Boise. It was only used for the last fall waterfowl season in dry fields - This gun has never seen a pond or lake. It is in 100% condition with box, choke tubes, instructions etc. The only reason that I am willing to sell it is because it is in Max-4 and when I originally set out to purchase an A400 I wanted it in the new optifade but none were available at Cabelas (or any other gun shop in the valley at that time) and so I settled for this - and had planned on selling it this year as more of the A400's in the Optifade became available. Local in person sales only. Payment is expected to be paid in full at the time of transfer for straight cash. I will accept certified personal checks but will not transfer the gun until the check has cleared, A postal money order will also be acceptable and the transfer will occur after it has been cashed. Credit cards etc. will not be accepted. I will only meet in a public area,during daylight hours."
