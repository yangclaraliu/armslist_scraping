Based on a different mineral than zeolite-based QuikClot® products, it generates no heat. It shares the benefit of being inert and non-allergenic. Combat Gauze provides the ease of gauze but with an added clotting agent embedded within providing the power to stop even the worst arterial and venous bleeding. The user simply packs the Combat Gauze dressing into the wound just as they have been taught in any basic first aid class over the years, and applies pressure for 3-5 minutes. Even the most traumatic arterial and venous bleeding is stopped. QuikClot Combat Gauze is so pliable that it conforms to virtually any size or shape of injury you will encounter. It is easily removed once clotting has taken place."

If you don't have the room for a table or want to get rid of the movement of the table, this allows the press to me mounted to a wall, it occupies about the same amount of space as wall shelving, in fact wall shelving adjacent to these brackets can serve as your reloading bench, it can be mounted at what ever height you want, and I thought it was easier to reload standing up, seemed easier and faster because you can easily put your body weight into it. I have 1 of these, I would like $40, if you want them shipped it will be actual shipping cost only. I'm sure these can be used with other presses, you will have to drill new holes. I am open to alternate offers. Thanks Bill Bill"

This is a brand new Sig Sauer 556 SWAT Rifle that was custom done by Sig for the US Army 160th SOAR (A), Special Operations Air Regiment (Airborne). 

This comes with all of the original equipment and accessories in the original factory box. From the Sig website, the product is described as:

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. 

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

The weapon comes custom engraved from Sig with the 160th SOAR logo engraved as pictured. Please email with any questions.

I am not a dealer, but will ask to see positive identification before completing a sale. If you have an AZ FFL, even better but not required. I reserve the right not to complete the sale if you appear, in my opinion, to be someone who shouldn't own a weapon.

Please email me with questions. I will provide my phone number via email. Similar to: AR15, AR-15, AR 15, AK47, AK-47, AK 47"

From Sig Sauer:
AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

The only modifications to the gun is some stippling I did on the Polymer frame but the end result, in my opinion, is a much better grip on the pistol that would normally cost upwards of $100 for custom stippling or a new frame.

I also have a factory CZ light attachment that is very powerful and good for home defense that I can include with the pistol for an extra $40.

It comes with the original non-detachable magazine, and a 20 round detachable magazine.  The safety lever broke off of the gun, but this does not affect the function of the gun, just no safety.  I have not looked for a replacement but I can’t imagine it is that much to replace.  Included in the price is about 200 rounds of ammo and probably 20 stripper clips (some loaded, some not).  I am the original owner.


Smith & Wesson M&P Bodyguard .380    $300.00
Nice little gun.  This is the model without the laser.  Comes with all factory accessories, 2 mags, and 15 rounds of defense ammo.  I am the original owner.

SKS $400.00
This is a Chinese SKS in good working order.  Has a Dragonov sniper style stock on it.  I do have a scope mount cover for it but it is not shown in the picture.  It comes with the original non-detachable magazine, and a 20 round detachable magazine.  The safety lever broke off of the gun, but this does not affect the function of the gun, just no safety.  I have not looked for a replacement but I can’t imagine it is that much to replace.  Included in the price is about 200 rounds of ammo and probably 20 stripper clips (some loaded, some not).  I am the original owner.

The Build

I. Remington 700 Sps varmint
-Caliber: .308 WIN
-Barrel Length: 26""
II. Leupold VX II 6-18x40mm AO w/soft cover and flip open covers
III. Caldwell bipod
V. JP Enterprises' Advanced Modular Chassis System (AMCS) with two 10 Round Magazines

JP Advanced Modular Chassis System™

The JP AMCS™ is the direct result of years of long-range shooting experience. After trying another aftermarket chassis, I realized that I wanted the vastly superior ergonomics of a gas-operated rifle such as the AR-15/AR-10 platforms for my bolt gun. The JP chassis delivers the best of all worlds. The cheek piece can be raised to accommodate an AR-15-type optics mounting system like the JPFTSM-30 with the line of bore relative to shoulder identical to the gas gun. Combined with the palm shelf grip, you have the most comfortable chassis system with the most linear impulse feel and reduced muzzle rise possible. For a more traditional bolt gun setup, you need only lower the cheek piece and use your preferred standard height rings.

The JP AMCS™ is completely machined from 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum with the mil-standard black hard coat anodizing process. The chassis will accept any Remington 700 right-hand short action or clone thereof as well as Savage short action rifles. The ambidextrous, extended magazine release does not require the operator to relinquish the shooting grip to perform a magazine change. The chassis includes the precision type tactical grip with palm shelf, fully adjustable folding butt stock, QD studs for bipod or sling systems and is also designed to accept the Accu-Shot Monopod system. JP magazines will hold 10 rounds of any cartridge based on the 308 Winchester with an OAL of 2.820 or less. The JP magazine can also feed 7 rounds of short mag with slight modification."

Full set of chokes. Full (F), Modified (M), Improved Modified (IM), Improved Cylinder (IC), Cylinder (C); handles 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells.  Oil-finish select walnut wood.  

Designed to perform, the Beretta Silver Pigeon I is also as beautiful to the eye as it is to the touch. The oil-finished stock is select walnut with a traditional Schnabel fore-end. This over-under also enjoys the Beretta’s legendary point-ability, thanks to the 680 series low-profile receiver. Furthermore, the absolute strength of the unique locking system provides for years of trouble-free use

The Silver Pigeon I marks the dividing line between Beretta’s more economical double guns and the highly decorated luxury models. While popularly priced, it offers the aesthetics and materials of the premium over-unders.  The frame has extensive, but refined, floral and scroll decoration that will make this shotgun a source of pride
for years to come. Beretta’s 28 and .410 gauge shotguns are built on scaled receivers resulting in a smaller overall profile and a reduction in weight.

Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

It is a piston AR, with four position gas regulator, and functions flawlessly. There are multiple varieties of ARs on the market today but the 516 is definitely one of the best and on the high end. The original pistol grip and stock have been replaced with Daniel Defense furniture but the originals will be included. The rifle has had less than 200 rounds through it and comes with the original box (the serial numbers on the box and rifle match, as you would expect). The number of magazines included is negotiable.

I am offering a Microtech Combat Trodoon D/E in their Stonewashed finish model number 142-10
The knive was built in December 2014 and purchased in June 2015. The blade has seen no action as I refuse to use it as a utility knife. The handle shows signs of being carried in my pocket from time to time but mostly it's a safe queen as our laws are kinda ridiculous here in Washington state. We can carry whatever firearm we desire with our CPL but this knife can be owned but not carried outside your residence. I will be picky on who I sell or trade this piece to and will require at minimum a CPL. If you are Law Enforcement,Military or an EMT there are no restrictions on where or when you carry this knife. The knife is a double action OTF and has been registered with Microtech for warranty purposes. It has a lifetime warranty again defects and workmanship and Microtech will resharpen the blade for life as well. I have all the paperwork and packaging materials that the knife came with. I am taking offers, I paid 399.95 plus shipping as I got it on sale. I will consider cash offers but I am mainly interested in silver coins or silver bullion. As a collector of coins and bullion I have all materials and equipment needed to authenticate and appraise any offers and will be very fair. Please feel free to text or email me if interested.

791,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4827791,For Sale:  S&W Sigma SW9VE 9mm pistol,"Wilsonville, Portland, Oregon",$ 350,"Listed On: Monday, November 2, 2015",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a Smith & Wesson ""Sigma"" pistol. Many years old but has been kept clean and not used very often. Shoots great and true.

The Sigma is so similar to the Glock that S&W was actually sued by Glock because of patent infringement. S&W won the suit, though, because they had just enough micro-parts to make the design ""different"" enough from the classic Glock 9mm. One of those micro-parts was an extra (unnecessary) spring added to the trigger assembly, which made the trigger pull much harder than the Glock. I have removed this stupid extra spring, making the trigger pull much smoother and closer to that of a Glock. I have kept the spring, though, and can include it if you want to ever reattach it.

The gun comes with a soft fabric black holster, two mags, 250 rounds of ammo ($65 value), a chamber safety flag, a Sigma picatinny rail adapter ($10 value), and a rail-mounted red laser from Cabela's ($20 value). 

I am asking $350 for EVERYTHING, or best offer. I have no need to get rid of the gun, and I love it, but I need the cash as I just bought an Xbox One and need to fill that hole that is now there in my bank account!

Disclaimers:
The gun has had previous owners, the last of which was an OSU college student who, I assume, thought it would be ""cool"" to scratch at the serial number, attempting to hide it, probably thinking that would make the gun suddenly ""under the radar"" from the feds. Fortunately he did a bad job (or gave up soon after beginning) and the number is still totally visible. The scratches there are the only scratches on the gun - the rest of it is in great condition. I had someone do a serial lookup on the gun before and after I bought it to be sure it was not hot and twice it has come back as all good so I know it's totally fine to own. A scratched serial number may arise suspicion if ever detected by a cop, but after running the serial they will see that there is nothing illegal. Additionally, the picatinny rail mounts directly under where the serial number is, so it hides all the scratch marks. So, no one would ever know that it is scratched, anyway. 
Oregon is a very liberal state when it comes to firearms, and selling privately is legal here. Must be 21 or older to purchase. ID will be asked for upon meeting, unless you clearly look old enough. No paperwork or bills of sale will be provided. All sales are final and there are no guarantees or refunds. With that said, I do personally promise that the gun works great! We can always meet at a range and you can test the gun out yourself before you buy.
We would meet in a public place, away from other people though. And the gun would be unloaded with the safety flag inserted."

The TRAVIS HALEY SKIMMER ENHANCED CARRY TRIGGER SYSTEM gives your Glock the performance of a stock 1911. Manufactured using 100% OEM parts, all of the metal components are individually hand polished to a mirror finish for consistent, reliable action. The mated surfaces glide freely, adding a smooth short transition into a predictable wall. The trigger break is crisp and clean, reducing muzzle movement. This is made possible by our unique pre-travel reduction modification, which is non-adjustable. Multiple inspection points are part of the production process. This system is completely drop-in with no fitting required."

This pistol runs really well.  Includes all the normal Springfield stuff to get you started: holster, magazine holder, and speed loader.  Also includes an extra 10rd magazine, saving you extra money.  If you want to try before you buy, let's meet at a range and you can sling lead to ease your mind.  Grip Zone is included at no additional charge.  That last part's a joke.

Springfield Armory®, the same company that brought Point & Shoot Ergonomics™ to the market in 2001 is proud to announce the latest evolution of the polymer pistol - The XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact in 9mm and .40CAL.

Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.

Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.

The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch larger than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.

If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact."

I have these XD-9 magazines left from when i sold the pistol.  They are all Springfield Armory Factory magazines in brand new condition.  There are five of the XD Gear grip extenders and one extended 5 round baseplate.  

The 13 round magazine has a letter M written on it in black sharpie.

All of the magazines have been loaded and fired.  Each one has been used twice, except for the 13 round one which has been used only once.  They have been sitting in my closet unloaded for about two years.

This is a good fair deal for the magazines.  I bought them during the 2012 scare when everything was very expensive.  I am selling these at a loss, but at a price that is relative to today's market.  I intended to keep them forever, but the XD9 was too heavy for me to carry so i got a Shield instead.  

The 16 round magazines with the XD Gear extender are $33.99 at MidwayUSA right now, before shipping.  My price is $140 for all six magazines including the 21 round magazine.  That is $23.33 per magazine.  Reasonable offers considered.

I am willing to ship them for an additional $5.25 which is the price of a small flat rate Priority Mail box.  I can receive funds through paypal if you are willing to cover the transaction fees.  I would rather meet locally in the Eugene/Springfield area for an in person transaction.  Must be over 21.  Thank you for your time."

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades only if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal, I will politely pass.  Mostly interested in semi-autos, but will consider others.  If it's not a good trade offer and your value is not there, please do not offer, just trying to save everyone some time.  About the only want now is another AR-10 like the DPMS Recon G2 or similar, would even consider the cheap Sportical model, but would need a few hundred on top since they are $700 new, unless you have added a nice rail, stock, have ammo mags or other to add.
