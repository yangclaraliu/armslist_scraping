IHC manufactured approximately 337,623 of the total 5,468,772 rifles produced since 1936, if you believe Scott Duff's research into the matter. This one bears a date of the 307th day of 1954 from the Julian date stamped into the inside of the stock when the wood was tooled out by the Frank Overton Company. Line Materials made the barrel. They set out to produce among the finest barrels ever put on a Garand. This is arguably the scarcest Garand to be had and this one is just about as-issued in 1954, save probably the handguards have almost assuredly been replaced at some point."

The .40 S&W is a formidable round.  Firing the Hornady 155 gr XTP or 180 gr XTP the .40 S&W delivers 479 ft-lb of energy at the muzzle; this matches the energy delivered by the venerable .45 auto and 40% more energy than the 9mm.  This is accomplished while keeping felt recoil comparable to the 9mm.  This massive increase in energy is why the U.S. military plans to replace the 9mm pistol with .40 S&W.

This is a full size Beretta pistol with 4.9"" barrel and stainless steel guide rod: it is in excellent condition.  It comes with an ultrasonic cleaning, two 10-round magazines and a hard plastic case.

Not a huge fan of .380 these days so I'm selling so I can start moving back towards 9mm.

This firearm is in excellent condition, and is fairly new since it was made Feb 17th, 2012. The night sights are still bright, and it shoots wonderfully. Easily one of the most accurate guns I've ever taken to the range, which you can't usually say for small 380's!

Unlike the blued or two tone models that used aluminum frames, this one has a full stainless steel frame and slide. It's a VERY sturdy gun and the weight makes shooting it very fun do to the recoil reduction. 

Comes with the factory case, and 3 magazines. 

These stopped being imported due to crappy import laws in Germany. When they were selling new, they were priced at $899. Due to the fact they were discontinued, you can easily go on Armslist, Gunbroker, etc and see used Stainless models with night sights like mine, that are listed for $800-$1500. People know these are getting harder to find so they're asking outrageous prices.

I am asking $700 for this beauty, which I believe is an excellent price.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of various accessories. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

This is an Authentic, Rare, Engraved, Pocket Sized, Double Action, Pinfire Revolver, with a Folding Trigger and Ivory Grips. It is a part of the mid 1800's European Lefaucheux Legacy of the type of firearms that were extremely popular in Western Europe in the latter half of the 19th century, particularly France and Belgium. Some also made their way to the Confederate States of America for use in the Civil War. A Frenchman named Casimir Lefaucheaux developed the original pinfire mechanism in 1828 and patented the pinfire cartridge in 1835. By the mid 1840s, guns using this mechanism grew very popular in France and Western Europe. Both French and Belgian manufacturers copied and produced various versions throughout this time, and this revolver is one of those. Overall condition as seen in the photos is Very Good, and all parts are sound and funtion just as they should with a tight cylinder lockup and crisp trigger release. The trigger return spring is a little weak which seems to be typical of most double action pinfires. The barrel is 3 ½ inches long. The gun also features good looking Ivory grips and a folding trigger for easier stowage in a pocket. The metal is mostly in the white with some discolored areas which may still be the remnants of the original blue or browned finish and appear in the photos as a plum color. XXXXXXXXXXXX For those who are not familiar with Pinfire Firearms, here is a brief history. Or, if history is not your cup of tea, then jump ahead to Terms and Conditions. Historically, the pinfire cartridge was one of the reasons for the decline of muzzle-loading weapons. It was much quicker and easier to load a breech-loading weapon using pinfire cartridges. The pinfire cartridges were the First Metallic cartridges. On one side of the cartridge is a protruding firing pin (see pictures). The other end of the pin touches a small copper cap containing a pressure sensitive primer. The rest of the case is filled with gunpowder and there is a lead bullet at the end. To ignite the gunpowder charge, one applies a sharp blow to the pin. The other end of the pin then strikes the primer which then ignites and then burns the main gunpowder charge. To load a pinfire weapon, the user opens the breech of the gun and drops in a cartridge. There is a slot at the top so that the pin can protrude out of the slot. The user then cocks the hammer. When the user pulls the trigger, the hammer is released onto the pin, thereby firing the weapon. Although later rimfire and centerfire cartridges made the process even more efficient and eventually replaced the pinfire cartridge, all of today's cartridges with metal cases owe some history to the pinfire.. contact me on 9852310903"

Now for the price. Yes it is expensive. Sure, CZ USA advertises them around 200 before tax. But we all know good and well they are far behind in supply and are not in stock anywhere locally. I am not making a dime off of this. After shipping and cost, I'm breaking even. Thats the cost you pay for having something in high demand right now as opposed to later. 

First unconditional ""i'll take it"" gets it. IF you want the pistol AND the stock, I will cut a break in price. There are some fine details we have to tend to before that happens however.

Please email a picture of your FOID card if you would like to purchase the firearm.
Once I get the FOID pic and we agree on price via email, the mandatory wait starts (since we have it on record at that point). After the mandatory waiting period, you can come and fill out the form 4473 and pay for the firearm.As long as the background check clears you can take the firearm with you that day.

Extremely lightweight, with two eight round magazines that store in the butt-stock, this nifty little shooter breaks down completely into its own butt-stock and can be tucked away in the back of your pack (if you're a hiker, like myself), trunk (if you're an enterprising survalist in need of a semi-automatic rifle for an inexpensive price), or just someone that enjoys having a cool rifle (also myself). 

As an added selling point, the entire thing is coated in teflon so as to ensure that rust is a lesser worry, and the butt-stock is air-tight so that you can drop this rifle in the water and watch haplessly as it floats downstream away from you.

BOTTOM LINE: Looking to sell, gents. Only 50 rounds have been put through this piece, and I'm not attempting to haggle. I know that these go for roughly $250-$300 in gun stores new. I recognize this, so recognize that I'm offering you a good deal on a slightly used rifle. If you low-ball me by a stupid amount, I won't respond to you unless I'm in a mean spirit."

It should have at a minimum one 20 round mag parts kit with it, more are better.

I can pay up to $750 CASH for what I want and will pay transfer and BGC at NorCO FFL."
