Great deal on a Top Tier AR pistol in 300 blackout. 

Breakdown: Spartan billet upper and lower cerakoted in FDE, 
YHM lightweight rail also cerakoted in FDE, 
Magpul MOE grip
9.5"" pistol barrel with YHM .308 flash hider
Sig arm Brace over the pistol buffer tube.  
Geissele S3G trigger, 
Nickle Boron BCG, or standard phosphate BCG, both like new. 
Used the phosphate for 1 mag to test function. Then a buddy talked me into a NiB BCG. They really are a lot easier to clean. 

Also have an EOtech mounted on it sighted in a 25/150 yards give or take. 
Over 500 rounds of FMJ, and a couple hundred of hollow point/Ballistic tip ammo.
All new ammo that works perfectly. No reloads. Never had a single jam. 
I have put 3-4 magazines down the barrel. Sighted in it, shot some targets, and took it hog hunting. Really slams the hogs, could be used to deer as well out to 100-150 yards. The 150 grain ballistic tips are amazing. 
Only selling to consolidate calibers. Only trades I'm interested in is a DDM4 or DD MK12

AR with EOtech: $1200 (EOtech was $650 new and has hardly been used)
Will include the FMJ Ammo for another $300. 
200 rounds of the hollow points for $180.  

I will sell the whole package for $1500 and include a soft case, or will trade for a DDM4 or DD MK12 in good condition. No other trades please. Will take $100 off if you want the mil spec BCG instead of the NiB BCG

I would estimate about 200 rounds through this (as recommended for break in).  Everything is absolutely perfect with the slide release having the edges rounded off (sharp edges from factory).  Raven concealment makes some of the best holsters on the market today as does Galco.  Extra magazines are direct from Kahr. 

Only reason being sold is I'm a glock fanboy and have a 43... the Kahr is definitely a superior gun but we all know how glock fanatics can be...

But I'll let these go for about half of what seems to be market price right now.
Cardboard sleeves have been pulled open and folded.....a dab of hot-melt glue sticks them back together easily!

I have the following: (shipping is extra and not included)
(See the pics: http://tinypic.com/a/17g7eq/2)

Repack kit - (1) 4 pocket M855 kit, consisting of the bandoleer, black safety pin, (4) cardboard sleeves, (12) stripper clips, (1) loading spoon....like new.
I have 7 of these left at $6.00 each.

5.56 strippers/stripper clips....these hold ten (10) rounds each ready to load your magazine and are used in the bandoleers or can be stored in boxes, either loose or in cardboard sleeves.
I have a bunch of these and will sell them in lots of 50 for $10.00. (that's just 20 cents each).

Mag. loading spoons....these fit on your M4/M16 mags and accept the stripper clips....the cartridges are pushed quickly into the magazine ten at a time (look it up on youtube - pretty sure there is a video if you haven't seen it done before!).
I have a couple cans of these also and will sell a bag of 25 for $10.00 (that's just 40 cents each).

Cardboard sleeves (silencers)....these are the M855 variety and hold three strippers full of cartridges each...thirty rounds, so each one, with strips would fill a magazine quickly.
I have about 300 of these and will sell them in bundles of 10 for $2.00 each (that's just 20 cents each). These are all SPF

The strips and sleeves are a nice easy way to securely store 5.56 in an ammo can, ready to go and keeps the ammo clean and from getting all banged up....neat!
(I also have ammo cans listed here separately)

Let me know what you need, where you are and I'll give you a shipping estimate....and feel free to make me a REASONABLE offer. Not trying to get rich off this stuff but I won't use it and hate to lose money!

Of course, if you are local to St. Paul Minnesota, get in touch and we'll work out a meeting!

This tank of a handgun is a CZ clone and and eats whatever you feed it, making it ideal for home or vehicle defense (or for carry if you want to show everyone what a BAMF you are).  I have put 150 rounds (FMJ and JHP) down range with this one without issue, and the prior owner indicated that he had no issues as well.

This sale will include the two magazines I received with my purchase plus the two Mec-Gar magazines I purchased from Greg Cote LLC.  All magazines have been tested. I will also include the Hogue wraparound grips (made a HUGE difference in comfort) and the original grips. 

As an added bonus, I just cleaned the gun last weekend (carbon killer for the barrel, recoil spring, stainless steel guide rod and slide stop; CLP on pretty much everything).  The barrel and feed ramp are shiny; the internals are clean; the rails are oiled.  To be honest, when I checked for function after cleaning, I though the trigger was better than the stock trigger on my CZ 75B Omega.

The SIG516 Patrol FDE in Flat Dark Earth with a matching FDE Cerakote® finish on both the upper and lower receivers and aluminum handguard. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the Flat Dark Earth use the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. 

This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

A 16” Nitride treated barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating aluminum forend. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights.

I'm a little reluctant to sell, but realize I just don't shoot this often enough.  I understand the Camp 9 is a bit hard to find, and I rarely see this rifle offered with the original factory box and the OEM 4 shot hunting mag.  (Including an additional high-cap mag, 17 round)

I took this rifle to the range last month, and it fired great!  Nice grouping without scope, no FTF/FTE at all.  A modern factory replaced recoil buffer installed in 2012.

Sorry, I'm not really interested in trading right now.  Can send additional pictures if you are interested.  My camera sucks though.

RT upper and lower, CMMG lower parts kit with 2 stage trigger smoothed out at 3lbs, 1:7 twist 16"" HBAR profile stainless JES barrel, Milspec bolt, bushnell 3X9 mounted with a single rail mount (very much like the Burris PEPR mount).  The 1:7 twist helps tremendously with heavy bullets at subsonic velocities for use with suppressor.  With 220 grain at 1100fps from the muzzle and a can, it is an absolute nail driver.  It also likes 125gr sierra game kings, around 2250fps.  It will constantly cut 1"" groups at 100yds.  I would have to say between just shooting and load development there is around 700 rounds through it.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Carried it for a while and have only put about 300 rounds through it. Amazing gun in great shape.

Only reason for selling is the wife originally wanted it but recently moved on to something much smaller for carry and I did the same.

Has an extended slide lock lever, Vicker's Tactical extended slide stop lever, original three 10 round mags, and one older 13 round mag. The 13 round mag is older so likely won't work if you switch mag release to left handed use, but works perfectly fine with standard right hand release.

The Alien Gear holster is brand new, have literally only had it on my side for 2 minutes. Comes with the bag it came in along with the extras. I do have two of these and will sell both if anyone is interested.

I bought and have carried with the Serpa holster less than a month. In basically brand new condition.

Everything together I'll sell for $740 or separately below:
Glock 30 Gen 4 w/ extended slide lock and slide stop lever - $550
202 rounds Federal HST +P, 20 Winchester PDX1, 12 Remington Golden Saber, 1 something something FMJ (all 230 grain) - $125

Remington 700 action with a 26"" Heavy barrel

McCreese Custom Folding chassis in aluminum

Vortex MilDot 10-40X power FIRST FOCAL PLANE scope

Accuracy International 10rnd Mag

Plano hard case

400 Rounds of Norma match ammo

This weapon has been fired exactly 30 times at one outing and produced 1"" groups at 400yrds. I will include the 30 spent brass casings.

$2500 is a steal for this set up and ammo. Just moving on to a new project and don't have room for this one.

I will accept cash or strait trade for FN SCAR 17. The only other trade I will consider is a CZ SP01 Shadow + $1000 cash
