The fit and finish on the rifle rivals much more expensive rifles and it has great reviews on the website.  Looking to sell or trade as I'm finding out I do not like AR 15 ergonomics after shooting ak's sks's and ruger minis.  I am firm on the price as I paid alot more since I originally bought the rifle during the panic.
Not looking for anything in specific in regards to trades but I'm into semi auto guns and ak ruger mini type rifles, +/- money on either end, towards a trade.

Reviews of the gun are available on the link below, and if you look all the way in the beginning, the reviews are for the MMC version before the company changed names to Bear Creek Arsenal.

ZEV Technologies™ Match Grade drop-in Glock® replacement barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened chromium stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in Match Grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant.

ZEV™ Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.0002” for consistency and accuracy.

The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish.

                         Advantage Arms .22 Rimfire Conversion Kit

FITS: GLOCK 17 22 24 31 34 35 37 (1st - 3rd Gen)
The Kit will fit 1ST, 2ND, 3RD GENERATION PISTOLS (DOES NOT FIT 4TH GEN Frame)
OEM FACTORY PACKAGED (With Cleaning Kit, Black Finish)

Five great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm.

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

The Kit will fit 1ST, 2ND, 3RD GENERATION PISTOLS (DOES NOT FIT 4TH GEN Frame)
OEM FACTORY PACKAGED (With Cleaning Kit, Black Finish)

Five great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm.

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

Nikon has expanded its line-up of precision .308 WIN riflescopes with the introduction of the all-new P-308 4-12x40 BDC 800. The new P-308 riflescope provides shooters with everything they need to hit their target, including 4-12 magnification, a 40mm objective, Fully Multicoated lenses to ensure a clear view, and Nikon's popular BDC 800 reticle.
Developed specifically for the trajectory of the .308 WIN/7.62 NATO round with 168-grain HPBT match bullet at 2680 feet per second.

Fully Multicoated Optical System
Multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds on every glass surface provide bright, vivid pictures and optimum light transmission from dawn to dusk.

Spring Loaded Instant Zero-Reset Turrets

To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into the P-308 riflescope. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.

Spot On Ballistic Match Technology

The P-308, like all of Nikon’s riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On™ Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on your scope’s reticle at various yardages for your specific ammunition and load.

This pistol is .45ACP in Flat Dark Earth. Fully ambidextrous controls, meaning mag release, slide lock,  safety, and de-cocker on both sides. Magazine capacity is 15+1, pretty much the highest available for a standard .45ACP magazine. Has threaded barrel silencer or muzzle brake ready, has a pre milled slide for red dot attachment, also has a $600 Trijicon RMR dual illuminated green dot sight, never requires batteries and is always on, works in complete darkness, and adjusts perfectly to any lighting which will make target acquisition lightning fast. Comes with the original slide cover and tools if you decided to remove it. Has Trijicon raised night sights, co-witnessed with the RMR. This pistol is amazingly accurate with very low recoil. Also comes with original tactical case, and 3 different grip extenders. Also have a custom made holster worth $75 included. it's my favorite  pistol I've ever owned, the only reason I'm getting rid of it, I've fallen on hard times.

I have a Glock 43 bought new July this year. It has 500 rds down the pike and has a couple of modifications. I took down the front of the trigger guard to round it off and lightly sanded the area where the trigger guard meets the grip (see GlockTalk on this subject) to ease bite. The gun has a set of Talon grips attached and a Ghost Trigger connector that reduces the trigger pull. I also include an extra mag for a total of three. I have other mags and night sights for sale if you are interested. Would consider trades for a Sig 238/938 that will include extras mentioned. Must be legal to own and willing to sign a bill of sale.

So for $650.00 in trade I will let it go to a new home and someone that will use it for the fun it was built for Not Just Sitting in My Gun Safe.

I got the gun in a trade and it's awesome ......but I'm a bolt action and pistol guy myself so I don't really need this one as it would just become a safe queen.....it was built to rock and roll....
Not Grampa's Old Relic...... This is a serious weapon now...

*** Note: Transaction will be completed through a FFL dealer with a BG check. (No Exceptions) ***

Here are some specs and comparisons over AK-47
    • VZ2008 possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped.
       Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
    • The bolt of the VZ2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
    • The VZ2008 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
    • The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ2008.
    • The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ2008.
    • The VZ2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
    • The alloy magazine of the VZ2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine.
    • The VZ2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.
