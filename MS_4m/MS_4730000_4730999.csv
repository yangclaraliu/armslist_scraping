It's really hard to see how good of condition this is, it has been taken very good care of.

The P-Series are short recoil–operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. It utilizes a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel.

It has an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released the firing pin springs back to the normal position. It features an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.

Constructed of investment cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel; while the slide and ejector are carbon steel.

It uses double-column box magazine and has a 10 round capacity.The P-Series pistols have an ambidextrous magazine release located behind the trigger guard, it can be pushed forward from either side to eject the magazine."

I had never seen one of these and am unaware of any Benelli dealer having one locally.

It is the best of both worlds; keep it on semi as any other Benelli and it functions the same. Or flip a lever and it functions as a pump shotgun as any Rem 870. As many of you know, the Benellis at times will not shoot low brass target loads in semi auto until a good break-in; I first fired low brass target loads and found it would not function so switched to pump and it was at most a 2 second delay and it ran as an 870; putting regular high brass in it, running semi auto, it fired as fast as any other M2 Benelli.

Patterns well.

This weighs about 1/2 pound more than the same configuration M2 Benelli Tactical, and the extra weight does not hurt as it reduces recoil on the Benelli due to its very light weight.

This has ghost ring sights and it came to me with an extended tube on it. It has no box or brochure or other accessories.

The original owner said he shot 30 rounds and put it in his safe -- 8 years ago. I have shot about the same.

I had my Magpul dealer add a new Magpul sling for easy carry either traditional or across the chest.

I will consider some things in trade if you are adding cash for the difference: HK or Sig German. 

Each will show their Ark DL and CHL. A bill of sale  will take me 5 minutes to draft.

Gander - out of stock $1,499.99 Availability: Sold Out. . .The M3 Convertible is a no-nonsense shotgun that military and police all over the world depend on.

History:

George Kellgren, an Engineer from Sweden, moved to the US in 1979, and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987. In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded. The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company. He founded another firearms company, Kel-Tec CNC Industries, or better known as Kel-Tec, and began producing firearms once again in 1995. In 2011, Mr. Kellgren produced the PMR-30, which was modeled from his earlier P-30 design.

That brings us to the 2nd Pistol. The Keltec PMR-30, is as new, and has only been factory test fired. It too comes with 2 30rd mags, and will additionally include factory case, manual, and other accessories/papers.

This pkg. is $1500. A cash sale is preferred, but a cash plus pistol trade may be considered with more towards the cash end."

I'll also include a DeSantis Sof Tuc IWB holster for it. Comes with original box, manuals, and lock. Trades I would be interested in would be a Gen 2 or 4 Glock 19, 10mm Gen 4 Glocks, Sig P232 stainless, Interarms PPK,  certain S&W J frames, Ruger S/A or D/A revolvers, lever action rifles, Glock frames, AR lowers, but I  will entertain others.

You can get the .50 barrel and mags that will allow you fire .50 AE, it just made more sense IMO to have one in .44 Mag. due to ammo cost and if you can't put it down with a .44 Mag, you may have bigger issues, lol.  You can also fire .357 Mag by changing the barrel, mags and the bolt.  They also make longer barrels you can swap out.

Winchester’s1873 rifle was the “Rifle that Won the West.” It is chambered in the economical .38/.357 Magnum cartridge. A cowboy could have both a lever-action rifle and his six shooter, and needed only one cartridge belt for both. Most Texas Rangers and every old West cowboy worth his salt carried 1873 rifles. Chappo, the son of Apache war chief Geronimo, packed an 1873. And Buffalo Bill carried an 1873 lever-action rifle along with a pair of .44-40 Colts in 1876 when he worked as an Army scout. This piece of rifle history is available in a variety of distinctive models including this Special Cimarron branded Deluxe Short rifle. Don't let that fool you though, it has a 10+1 capacity and power to spare."

WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION ON THIS M67 ROUND:

In the 1960s Yugoslavia experimented with new bullet designs to produce a round with a superior wounding profile, speed, and accuracy to the M43. The M67 projectile is shorter and flatter-based than the M43. This is mainly due to the deletion of the mild steel insert. This has the side effect of shifting the center of gravity rearward in comparison to the M43. This allows the projectile to destabilize nearly 17 cm (6.7 in) earlier in tissue. This causes a pair of large stretch cavities at a depth likely to cause effective wound trauma. When the temporary stretch cavity intersects with the skin at the exit area, a larger exit wound will result, which takes longer to heal. Additionally, when the stretch cavity intersects a stiff organ like the liver, it will cause damage to that organ. However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws (tumbles).

Hello everyone,
	I have available for trade/sale a used but classic pistol. This is a Norinco made 1911A1 45 pistol. This gun is in good overall shape and will come with two magazines as well as some aftermarket ""Don't Tread on Me"" grips. It also has a compensator installed on it as well. This is a good shooting pistol. I would keep it, but shortly after I bought it, I realized I would prefer something else. This gun needs a good cleaning, but aside from that didn't give me any issues. 
	Shoot me any offers at REDACTED via text, or a message on here. I'm open to most firearms, Bersa Thunder plus boot,  but no black powder, 22, Taurus, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor. Some trades will need boot on my end, some will need boot on your end. Need to meet in Norman on this. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

The Heckler & Koch P2000 V3 is a semi-automatic pistol from the relatively limited line of Heckler & Koch handguns that utilizes a short recoil operation alongside both a Browning locking system and a recoil buffer system. This particular model is chambered for the 9mm cartridge, which when joined with its enhanced ergonomics make it a suitable choice for both personal protection and concealed carry. Moreover, as its title suggests, this particular pistol comes equipped with the V3 trigger variant – a double-action/single-action trigger with an added decocking lever.

I purchased this compressor new and it has always been housed in the room you see in the pictures, I purchased this compressor to run a large blast cabinet that I was using while I restored my car. It has very low hours and I have serviced it as recommended. I sold my blast cabinet and don't have a need for this large of a compressor anymore. The compressor is in excellent condition and will handle about any thing you want to run. A new comparable compressor is well over $2k. I will sell for $1300 or trade for quality firearms or a golf cart. I like smith and colt wheel guns but will consider others. Thanks for looking."
