It's a wonderful little gun and I really love it, but it just doesn't see as much use as it used to, 223 is cheaper and more accurate so my AR is what tends to make it out shooting with me in general. Not to say the M1 is inaccurate, if you've shot these guns you probably either love them or hate them, but this is a great little rifle, it's gotten me a few deer and broken many old beer bottles. I'm not hell bent on getting rid of it, and I'm not looking to sell it for cash, I really would like to trade it for a quality 9mm pistol. I want an affordable, accurate pistol to target shoot with, my preference will always be for older guns, I'm not so much interested in plastic guns and I have very little interest in anything striker fired. Ideally I would like to see something made of steel with wood grips and a trigger capable of crisp single action firing. I really like smith and Wesson model 39s and 1911 style pistols. I am also open to sigs. Anyway, if you're interested, let me know what you have and maybe we'll come to a deal we're both happy with. I'm willing to put some cash down too for the right trade if the value is clearly higher than the M1, likewise I will accept some cash with the right trade if the value is lower, or accessories or ammunition."

650 out the door!

3rd party review:
Mossberg’s entry into the AR field is the MMR, a direct-impingement design that is being offered in two different lines, Hunter and Tactical, to appeal to as wide a consumer base as possible. I tested the Mossberg MMR Tactical, an all-black model with 16.5-inch carbon-steel barrel with 1:9 twist and chambered for 5.56 NATO, as opposed to most domestic ARs, which are chambered in .223. (What’s the difference? Check out this article.)

The Tacticals come with a quad-rail fore-end with your choice of fixed or adjustable stocks, 10- or 30-round magazines, no sights or detachable iron sights. I chose the model with fixed buttstock, iron sights and 10-round magazine.

Mossberg MMR Tactical receiver
The MMR Tactical features a carbine-length direct-impingement gas system and carbine-length buffer tube with standard-weight buffer. There is no forward assist.

The government profile barrel is manufactured by Mossberg in Texas and has the distinctive M4/203 cutout, in case you need to attach a grenade launcher at some later date. The rifle has a carbine-length gas system, and the 10-inch long quad rail fore-end extends a few inches past the low profile gas block.

Quad rails are popular not because of their looks but rather their performance. Want to attach a flashlight or a vertical foregrip? If it’s designed to clamp onto a rail, you’re all set. Quad rails can chew your hands up if you do a lot of shooting, but many companies produce either rubber or polymer rail covers in varying colors.

The barrel is tipped with a simple muzzle brake that amounts to a standard A2 flash hider, which instead of being open at the end has a flat with a center hole. While not as efficient as some brakes, it does reduce recoil (which an A2 flash hider does not do). In the early days of 3-Gun competition this GI-profile style of muzzle brake was the only kind allowed.

The rear sight is a standard A2 rear sight clamped on to the flat-top upper receiver. There is a detachable front sight supplied as well, installed at the factory at the end of the top rail. The rifle has a carbine-length buffer tube, with a permanently attached M4-style buttstock. It is supplied with a standard (not heavy) buffer.


The rifle comes with a full-length optics rail and is available with removable rear and front iron sights.

Instead of a standard A2 pistol grip, the MMR is supplied with the Stark SE-1 Grip, which not only increases the distance between the backstrap and the trigger but has an integral oversize trigger guard. The pistol grip has a water-resistant compartment inside with slots designed for battery storage. The charging handle of the MMR is not GI standard but slightly oversized for better manipulation.

Inside the MMR appears to be totally mil-spec aside from its lack of a forward assist. The bolt carrier key is properly staked, and the carrier itself is the lighter semiauto AR type. Trigger pull was straight GI single stage, which means it was heavier and grittier than I would have liked but typical for an AR. The 10-round magazine supplied with the rifle was from CProducts, a well-known AR magazine manufacturer. It had a blackened stainless steel body and an orange non-tilt follower.

The MMR tips the scales at 7.5 pounds, which means it is light enough for shooters of smaller stature to handle yet heavy enough to tame the already anemic recoil of the .223. It’s the quad rail that adds the extra weight, but that extra weight helped keep the muzzle on target during offhand rapid-fire strings.

Shooting the MMR brought no surprises. I started with quality magazines (in addition to the supplied CProducts mag), lubed the gun before testing, and had no malfunctions firing several hundred rounds over the space of a week.

Mossberg MMR Tactical grip compartment
The Stark SE-1 pistol grip has a waterproof battery compartment and an integral, oversized trigger guard.

Curious to see if it would show a preference for bullet weight, I tried everything from 50- to 77-grain projectiles. The rifle showed no clear favorites and shot most everything into groups hovering around 2 inches. I threw a Hi-Lux CMR 1-4X scope on the carbine for the accuracy work. This budget scope has good glass, and I probably could have produced better groups with a better trigger. I find I am able to do better groups when I combine a match trigger with a mediocre barrel than the reverse.

An MMR Tactical without sights has a suggested retail price of $885. Those with sights have an MSRP of $921. The fact that Mossberg’s suggested retail is less than the street price of most of its competitors should come as no surprise.

99,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4545099,For Sale/Trade:  2003 Ford Focus ZX3 Manual - Rusty but Runs Well,"Mentor, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 900,"Listed On: Friday, July 24, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"130,XXX Miles, 5SPD Manual Transmission with the 2.0 DOHC Zetec Engine. Has new exhaust, newer Brakes, newer Alternator and Battery. Rusty and has leaky oil pan but otherwise excellent in a lot of ways, ESPECIALLY in looks and the Interior is excellent. I'll be as thorough and honest as I possibly can. The car does have issues but they are relatively minor for this price and it drives very well. I bought it intending to use as a winter beater for my delivery job but found a better job and only need one car now.

The Engine runs EXCELLENTLY. As stated it has a leak at the Oil Pan and smokes when driven hard but the engine runs and sounds like it's new. The Oil Pan replacement is a $30 part and about an hour of work if you have Ramps and some car knowledge. The Transmission shifts well in ALL gears with 0 grinding or jerking and the clutch engages smoothly and I made sure it does not slip, period. If you keep the oil topped off this car this car should last years or until the Subframe completely rots through. Perfect car to learn to drive Manual or drive it until the wheels fall off.

Emailed me with questions and I have more pictures if interested. 

Pros:
-Engine and Transmission work well with no MAJOR repairs needed. No engine light and passed E-Check in Nov. 2014. 
-Extremely clean Interior and Exterior above the rocker panels. 
-No electronic issues whatsoever
-Good tires with tread remaining
-Brakes work great 
-Drives very well with good steering and suspension 

Cons:
-Rust. The Unibody isn't all that bad but the Crossmembers should be coated to prevent further rusting during Winter. Rocker Panels completely rusted off. 
-Parking Brake system completely inoperable. Would need entire cable assembly to use. Car will NOT move if parked in 1st Gear unless maybe on an extremely incline. 
-Oil leak from the pan. Smokes on the exhaust; especially when driven hard. 
-Air Conditioning not working, possibly Compressor. 
-Driver's window needs a new Crank Assembly to roll down. The vents do blow, however and the Passenger windows rolls down. 

This is a $1000(obo) car solely because of the rust. The problems are minor and the Engine/Trans/Suspension/Brakes function great - all you can ask for in a car this cheap. As a bonus the Interior is near-perfect and the Exterior is attractive above the rocker panels.

Review:
Bought this gun about 1 month ago. Never shot it, bougt it to have it to my collection as it is a really clean and unique looking piece, honesly feels like a cannon in side my hands. But now need to sell or trade it because I just picked up a S&W 500, so don't need it no more and need to get some extra cash in hands. Gun is in great condition, no marks no rust or scratches, as clean as can be.  Comes with a holster and 20 self defence rounds. Honestly a really expensive peice, but im only looking to get $600.00 cash or something in to trade. Feel free to call or text and make an offers (open to all) or if you want to see the gun. Usually at work Monday to Friday 7am to 5pm but if you send a next message or an email i will respond right away.

British Bulldog revolver. Manufactured by P. Webley & Sons Birmingham, London. The revolver is assumed to be a .44 caliber based on the five bullets that come with it. The bullets appear to be labeled .44 S&W Spl. The British Bulldog was adopted and copied by gun manufacturers in Belgium, Spain, France and the U.S.  The Webley versions are considered the original.

The history of the firearm is not confirmed. But, it is believed to have been formerly owned by Cole Younger. Yes, the Cole Younger of the wild, wild west. In 1999, the current owner became the private, home health care provider to Robert F. Coleman Younger who is reported to be a direct descendant of Cole Younger and Jesse James. Robert was an exhibition shooter. He gave me the firearm and said it was originally worn as a “belly gun” by the outlaw Cole Younger. 

There is no serial number. The cylinder guard appears to be missing. The gun has not been test fired by me.

To the best of my knowledge, the specs are as follows:  The M6X Tactical Laser Sight / Flashlight is more powerful, more durable, and gives you more options than other flashlight and laser sight combinations. The MIL-spec design and construction of these flashlights takes tactical lighting and target acquisition to the next level. This powerful weapon light offers the penetrating power of 125 peak lumens and features a military-proven visible aiming laser. The M-6X Weapon Mounted Laser-Flashlight by is waterproof to 66 feet. This flashlight with laser sight fits most tactical pistols and shoulder-fired weapons. For a bright, accuracy-adding accessory for your firearm, equip the M6X Tactical 125 Lumen Laser Flashlight.

Lightly used comes as pictured.  No box or manual but will come with batteries.  Everything I have is setup for the X300 or TLR-1 and I'm not fond of lasers.  Got this in a trade and have no desire for it.  Everything works.  Please email with questions

There is nothing wrong with it in any way (no misfires), and looks brand new (no scratches). I have maintained it and kept it cleaned and lubed appropriately. The reason I'm selling a gun as nice as this is because I just picked up a Sig P938, and would like a bigger gun with more capacity. Since I have 2 of the smallest carry guns (smallest 9mm - Sig P938, AND the XDs, the smallest .45 compact on the market) I decided to get rid of this nice little machine for something large like a 1911. 

Ignoring all offers under $429. You are getting a new firearm already broken in without any wear on it. I basically saved you over 50 rounds of breaking in AND the taxes you would have to pay when you purchase an XDs in store. It retails for 540 at Cabellas plus tax so over 600 bucks.

Info:

You are viewing a pink and black licensed and trademarked Sig Sauer P226 airsoft gun by Cybergun. This is a semi lightweight version on the outside but trust me it's all heavyweight inside. With an FPS of 328 this gun represents the highest velocity of their entire spring line. Want more, with their registered BAXS shooting system you could put a quarter 25 feet away and be able to hit it most of the time using a .20 6mm BB. Unlike most airsoft guns produced in China, anything this strong is usually hard to pull back but this gun. With Cybergun's BAXS shooting system pulling the slide is a breeze. Want even more how about a spare magazine. While the other person is reloading you're just shooting away.

Below are the following specs

It has a few scratches from handling, but I've kept it well oiled and the internals are excellent.
