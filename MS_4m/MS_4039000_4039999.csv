If you don't really know Jimmy Lile please read up on him he's Americas most famous knife makers.  His handmade ones he did himself such as this are few.!  And one day in the lifetime of those born in 2000 and after will see knives made by him! Not the jimmy lile website stamps LILE on the blade and sells ' Jimmy Lile knives ' $3 grand when Jimmy never touched any of those fake knives cc he died in 91 and just because people like Jimmy because he made the Rambo knife these people make a fortune out west off a dead Arkansans name RIP James B. Lile Arkansas's True Favorite Son!

Handmade by James B. Lile.  Has sheath.Has case and belt clip.  This isn't a Dot or stamp knife.  It's scripted ' Handmade by James B. Lile '.  Unlike the guys who bought jimmylile website from Jimmy's wife who have nothing to do with jimmy and you can't even get them to tell you who actually made their ' so called ' Jimmy Lile knife,  Jimmy Lile himself made this one.  And unlike those when the romantics for Rambo die down people will want a Knife Jimmy Lile made himself.  Not a Dot knife they don't even know the man that made theirs, try it ask them.     The knives Jimmy himself made.....are very few and far between , and will appreciate in value at incredible rates.   Possibly even fund your retirement if you buy early enough.  
Ronald Reagan had Jimmy visit his Chateau, he had him make him a Folding Lile Knife.  Jimmy gave it to him and The President responded by giving him a Silver Medallion of the 40th presidential seal of the United States.  And giving his wife Marilyn the same in two cuff links. In 1971, Lile became a full-time knifemaker and was known as ""Gentleman Lile"" or ""The Arkansas Knifemaker"". He was particularly known for his Survival knife designs known as ""The Mission"" series, created by request for Sylvester Stallone to use in his first two Rambo movies. These designs would go on to influence other knife makers in the 1980s. In addition to creating the Rambo knives, Lile designed and made several Bowie knives that he presented to Governor Bill Clinton and U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Other owners of his work included John Wayne, Peter Fonda, Fess Parker, Bo Derek, and Johnny Cash
And everyone knows Slyvester Stallone had him make the Rambo knife in which he uses In the Rambo Movie.  

The website for him does not in anyway have any connection with Jimmy.  They bought the rights to his name.   They can't even tell you which of THEIR smiths made what knife.  Knives Jimmy actually made himself engraved Handmade By James B. Lile in his signature are few.  He died in '91 and they grower fewer with each year passing and appreciate in value, especially when the Rambo knives lose their romantics.    He the most famous knife maker in the world .

These are great collector items as well as for reloading 12 gauge.  I have not used it to reload, but I spent hours cleaning it up, ensuring it is ready to use, and restored to it's original condition. 

Included is the original load data, adjustable shot dipper, and powder measure scoop.   The instructions are stuck together, so I tracked down a copy of the original instructions, and included them.  

The original box is not the prettiest, but you won't find a cleaner set.  I know what they go for on fleabay; most of those have sat for decades, rusted, and unable to pull the assembly out of the die.  I am a retired combat Veteran, and take pride in all my work, and anything I sell.

The LCRx is used but in good shape with no problems to mention and comes with the factory lasermax laser module attached. Has the same excellent double action trigger pull as the standard Lcr as well as an exposed hammer for single action fire as well. Works well but I'm not a fan of lasers and I miss having a S&W. I'd be interested in doing a straight trade for a Ruger SP101, or I'd be interested in most S&W J frames in .38 special, prefer models with a hammer of some sort, particularly a 637. Might consider a standard LCR plus some cash. No Taurus or Charter please.

Inox 2-tone with factory wooden grips, 2 magazines.  Original boxes, paperwork, CA lock, original grips.

“Almost” LNIB – some minor holster wear can be found on the trigger guard if you look VERY closely.

Tip-up barrel allows very easy chambering and removal of +1 round.  Great pocket gun, sweet shooter.

Some early Tomcats had a problem with the frame cracking.  This Tomcat was built after Beretta beefed up the frame design.

The price is firm at $450.  Beretta only makes a few of these during a short production run, and they are usually hard to find – especially Inox 2-tone versions like this one.  If you see a better deal on a better Tomcat, GRAB IT!

Please read more details at the following link: 

http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/02/foghorn/atf-moves-ban-m855-ss109-5-56-ammunition/

I have 276 rounds of American Eagle XM855 Green Tip 62gr steel penetrate 5.56X45mm for $190.00

I also have 840 rounds of SS109 62gr steel penetrate brass 5.56x45mm which is manufactured by SADU FONDAT in Romania and is boxer primed, new brass with a lacquer seal at the neck of the bullet and at the primer for long term storage. I want to sell the 840 rds for $500.00

Recent video review of the ammo: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlQwzY67ZKY

Now the reason why I am selling both of these for this price is because outside of a few retailers that upped their price to even higher than I'm asking before shipping is taken into account, all XM855 and equivalent SS109 ( both are the same specifications, XM855 has green tip but SS109 is 62gr steel penetrator just like XM855 is) is out of stock. 

The AFT will change both the XM855 and SS109 ammunition to Armor Piercing and it will not be available to civilians to purchase after March15th, so many people are trying to get this ammo before they are never allowed to own it again. 

I am willing to drive within an hour of Farmington Hills to try and get a deal. 

Not interested in trades or low ball offers, I am firm on the price and would appreciate serious interested buyers only. 

So to repeat the prices: 

American Eagle XM855 Green-tip: $190.00 for 276 rounds 

SS109 SADU 5.56x45mm: $500.00 for 840 rounds

If you are interested in buying all of it together I can offer a lowered price to bring down the cost per round: $650.00 for 1116 rounds of both the XM855/SS109 5.56X45mm ammo. 

If you consider that the shipping is free, this is better than anything you can find online at the moment for this threatened round type. 

*I don't like the B.S. the government is pulling regarding banning certain types of ammo, similar crap happened when king obama decided 7N6 was banned, I am just following the free market and putting this offer up for anyone who wants to get this stuff before it disappears for good*"

The Upper Is built for home and auto defense. The optic is the real deal and looks like it was hung up wet but it works well enough to not warrant sights and a pricey quad rail. The bilt Headspaces like it should, and it functions fine with standard 300 ammo and mags. To use subsonic ammo you must install a silencer. As you can see by the pricing, I'm not asking too much for anything. Actually asking a pretty low price for it. Sells as is

Will take pics and send to interested parties upon request. 

This piece comes from a long history of Ruger excellence and reliability.  Many people use these in competition target shooting.  When the Navy SEALs wanted a .22LR pistol for “up close and personal” work, they chose a suppressed Ruger MkII, the previous version of the MkIII.

The “improvements” from the MkII to the MkIII consist of a magazine disconnect and loaded chamber indicator (both of which some people remove).  I had the magazine disconnect removed to see how it changed the piece; the trigger was smoother, magazines dropped more freely, and disassembly and reassembly were easier.  But the disconnect has been reinstalled for the purpose of selling the piece.  If you want it removed, I suggest either the Tandemkross or Volquartsen MkII hammer bushing – really easy fix, with plenty of help on the internet.

The 22/45 was designed to match the grip angle and controls of the 1911.  This 22/45 is the Target version with bull barrel, which makes a VERY stable shooting platform.  This provides excellent experience for new shooters to learn basics before moving to more powerful handguns.  If you are shooting any handgun before you learn with a .22LR, somebody steered you WRONG and set you up to be “recoil sensitive” and therefore less capable of rapid target reacquisition after the first shot.  Training with this piece, putting all 10 rounds into a small group very quickly, can set you up to shoot more powerful handguns effectively for self-defense.  

I bought this new but just don’t need it anymore.  It shows the wear I have given it, but it is in excellent condition.  It comes with the original box and paperwork – everything except that stupid padlock (which was quickly reassigned to another use).  But this piece has an internal key so you can lock the safety in the Safe position – far better than risking damage to the action with a padlock.  I also will include a Ruger branded leather holster – fits the piece perfectly.

The price is $275 firm – that’s what this is worth.

I will only deal FTF, with a SC resident with CWP or FFL."

the pistol fires just fine but the slide stays locked back after firing a round, im guessing it just needs a new slide stop lever, everything else functions as it should, i have a few 1911's already so i really dont have motivation to fix it.

I used some Klean Strip Premium Paint Stripper over the weekend and cleaned it up as best as I could. It is still in pieces and I'm not 100% sure (or even comfortable) on how to put it together. Thankfully the ugly paint is gone. There is one screw missing, the one that screws one of the plastic grips on.

I have seen some interesting advertisements in the last couple of days written by those who claim interest in free market economics. While I believe in healthy economic competition, I don't care for those who would divert fellow enthusiasts time and attention from the facts and instead seek to gain monetarily from the circumstances. If those parties interested in the free market were genuine wouldn't it be far more productive to halt the construction of an artificial market created by government regulations instead of exploiting the situation?  I would like you to turn your attention to this link so you may judge for yourself given the facts and more importantly that there is still time to do something about this.

I hate to part ways with this bow but the wife is making me part ways with it. I purchased this bow the beginning of last season and used it just on weekends and shot a little through the week. Not many shots have been through it. The string is in great condition along with the bow itself. Not a nic or scratch on it. I do have all paperwork from when I purchased it if you are wanting it. I am taking a big hit on it at this price but it is priced to sell. $1000.00 firm. No trades. Serious inquires only.
