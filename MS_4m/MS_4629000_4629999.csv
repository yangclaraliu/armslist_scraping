I've used it primarily for display. About 5 years ago I linked 100 rounds and fired it for the first time and it did well except occasionally the sear wouldn't catch and I had to wiggle the trigger a little before it fired the next round. It seemed to happen less often the more I fired it so could be a break in issue.  Along the way I acquired an M2 tripod with pintle and T&E mechanism that I understand was used in Israel, it had a coat of ugly, thick sand colored paint. I blasted off that junk refinished it in black Gun Kote and it looks pretty good and has the original (I think) brass data plate or it could be one added in Israel. I can send a picture if interested. I also have a linker, a few hundred links, a trunion shield for using the metal links, one cloth belt and an Army manual.

The gun itself is in as new condition. Fired once and on display the rest of it's life. It was assembled by a company called Rapid Fire out of Ohio. I checked around the web for what they are going for and if it were 100% functional I'd ask maybe around $3500. Since it has a little hitch, I am dropping to a display gun price of just $2500/obo, more than fair I think. I don't display it any more and it just sits so time for someone else to enjoy it.

For sale is a nearly new Springfield Armory SOCOM 16 7.62 mm semi-automatic rifle with a synthetic stock.  It has the 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle break.  I am the original owner and it has only fired approximately 100 rounds.  It is completely stock (except for the tan upper hand guard).  It comes with the original box, packing, and manuals.  The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on August 22, 2015.

The rifle is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA.  I will not respond to late night text messages or ""lowball"" offers, and I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  There is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the actual transfer occurs at a gun store.  I originally paid $1,700, including tax, so for $1,299 you are getting a nearly new rifle and savings $400!!!

Give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to see the rifle and purchase it.

Includes all hardware and the box it came in....like new.

Springfield Armory® was the first 1911 manufacturer to offer a frame that included an accessory rail as part of the forging. The Champion™ Operator® mates this forged Operator® frame with a shorter slide and a 4 inch barrel. This results in a pistol that is suitable for concealed carry or operating where a light is needed – and it doesn't sacrifice any capacity.

Pick up a Champion™ Operator®, and you’ll find that it’s a feature-loaded expression of the classic 4 inch 1911. The beavertail grip safety, flat mainspring housing, Lightweight Delta™ hammer, extended ambidextrous thumb safeties and extended trigger give you all the ergonomic advantages you want in a carry pistol. The 3 – dot tritium combat sights mean that the Champion™ Operator® is ready for any conditions. A carry gun also has to be reliable. Thanks to the lowered and flared ejection port, fully supported ramped match grade barrel and proprietary dual-captive recoil system, the Champion™ Operator® is guaranteed to perform when you need it most. And the Armory Kote™ finish will keep it performing for years to come.

You can carry the Champion™ Operator® with you all day, appreciating its smaller size and standard capacity. Then slide your favorite tactical light on the rail, and put it on your nightstand. When you need a feature-packed 1911 for night and day, reach for the Champion™ Operator®."

The clarity, function, capability, ease of use, far exceeds most any other optic out there.  1-3 power magnification on a twist, locking rear focal ring, functions on the first focal plane (faster acquisition), can go two eyes open for close in shooting.  Very solid and stable system.  The clarity of the glass is beyond words.  If you wear glasses, the focus ring allows you to adjust to your vision.  Below are the stats:

Model number LEUPOLD 67670 3rd and latest generation of the CQ/T

The Mark 4® 1-3x14mm CQ/T® is a revolutionary optical sight for firearms such as the AR-15 and M16, combining the strengths of a red dot sight and the flexibility of a variable power riflescope. Just as important, the reticle is always visible, with or without batteries, so you’re always prepared. The CQ/T is also becoming a fast favorite with competitive shooters who appreciate its unique close and long range capabilities.

Features:

•Eleven reticle illumination settings to match any light conditions.
•Common AA batteries power the CQ/T for more than 600 hours at medium setting.
•The true 1x setting allows you to shoot with both eyes for fast target acquisition and reactive shooting.
•2x or 3x settings give you the power to accurately engage targets at medium ranges.
•Many competitive shooters are coming to rely on the versatile magnification and unique capabilities of the CQ/T.
•The integrated MIL-STD-1913 rail mount cross slots allow you to easily attach a variety of accessories to your CQ/T.
•Leupold's Mark 4 CQ/T A.R.M.S.® Throw Lever Mount (available separately) offers dependable, repeatable accuracy.
•The Leupold Circle Dot reticle offers a bold aiming point with built-in range estimating capability.
•The reticle is illuminated in red. When turned off, or without batteries, it remains visible, reverting to black.
•Flip-open lens covers are standard issue with the CQ/T.
•Windage and elevation dials in ½-MOA coin-click adjustments.
•Extremely rugged and 100 percent waterproof.
•Sale of the Mark 4 CQ/T is limited or restricted outside of the United States.
•The CQ/T riflescope, parts, and accessories fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State. Unless required State Department license is obtained, this product is for sale in the U.S.A. only.
•Leupold's all-new, third-generation illumination will keep you on target like never before. Leupold has boosted performance with a 15 percent brighter reticle, and a redesigned, user-friendly interface

Has been on the nightstand since then, and other than some light handling marks, is still like new. No longer made by Beretta, and preferred by many for the ease of the tip-up barrel, which allows you to bypass the slide racking procedure, and feed first round directly into the barrel. Best combination of stainless steel and double/single action. Have watched a couple of these get bid up to over $700 on gun broker recently--I'm selling for what I have into it.
