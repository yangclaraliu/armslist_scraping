This is a rifle I sat down with the owner and picked out every detail to make this gun a real shooter. Specs: - Hamilton Arms built upper and lower - 18.5"" FN steel super bull barrel. The first 13 inches are super bull and then it is tapered down at the end. Has a deep target crown that is great for hunting. This barrel could be fired at full auto for long periods of time and never throw fliers. - Full auto bolt. All Hamilton Arms ejectors are modified to throw the casing straight out instead of out and back. This is especially nice for left handed shooters like myself. - 15"" Super Slim free float handguard - Rifle length gas system with low profile gas block. Virtually no recoil at all. - Hogue ergo grip with compartment. - Magpul CTR stock - Tuned trigger - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves. - Bipod mount - Shorty vertical grip. - 45 degree offset iron sights for up close shooting. - (4) 30rd (2) 20rd (1) 5rd for hunting magazines. All but the 5rd are pmags. Hamilton Arms only uses extremely high quality parts in all their builds. The gun also has a lifetime warranty that you can go right to Jackson, MI to have the repairs done. No more shipping off and not having your rifle for long periods of time. The gun alone cost $1800 and then with all the extras cost a total of $2600. I dont need to sell this gun. I am just interested in a long range bolt gun or shorter barreled ar15. Get this AR before it becomes impossible again!! Used lightly for target shooting mostly. Extremely accurate and a perfect long range shooter but not too long or heavy to be a battle rifle. Asking $1500 OBO. **The first photo has the 12"" super slim on it. I changed that out to a 15"" as shown in the 2nd photo."

I can put together a package that will give you everything you need down to the reamers for the trigger pins. What a lot of people don't realize when getting into this is all the little stuff they do need and the stuff they don't need. I have built 8 aks on this tooling and have done work on many more. This equipment also helps on saiga conversions, no more plastic bs rivets or screws in a 2000 dollar gun. I really hate that shit. Also the spot welder you need will be included I can also include a small drill press and shop press if you want a complete package. The only reason I'm getting rid of it is because I've got a slew of aks and really only wanted to build them to prove to myself I could haha. Do text me or email me if you are interested. Don't text me or call me thinking I'll build you one. I am not a manufacturer. There are rules to this which I will explain to interested parties. But I'm not here to be your encyclopedia there is tons of info all over the Internet about this. Thanks for reading the ad, god bless america and screw Hillary and Obama they can say they wanna stop sellin them but they can't stop me from building them

MSRP: $679

Weighing less than 14 ounces and with a barrel length of just 2.75 inches, Kimber Micro .380 ACP pistols are easy to carry and conceal.

Slides on the Stainless and CDP models as well as all Micro barrels are machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory.

Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance.

The pieces of wood are a tad loose, and are held on with a philips screw. The gun is marked with the serial # 2929MR on one side, and with the characters ""6. 15"" and ""13"" and a 4 inside a circle and an E S and a crown. It also has ""R1666"" carved by hand into one side just above the trigger area.

I haven't fired it. It cocks and the trigger works fine, and it collapses just like it's supposed to. I can send more photos.

I will also be selling ~2,000 rounds of M80 NATO ammo that I will make someone a package deal.  I also just bought a scope mount from DSA with the hex bolts that I am planning to return, it's still in the bag, but can be included in the deal for $75 if someone wants it too.

Have title in hand. This car is in outstanding shape on the inside. The exterior has a few scratches on the front but has a new hood on it. Has four brand new tires (literally, less that 100 miles since I don't drive this car) on aftermarket rims that don't look half bad on this car. It only has 120k miles.

The interior is in excellent condition, heated seats work but they are cloth so you might not even have to use them this winter. This car does need new axle shafts to stop occasional vibrations around 60mph and it is throwing a code for the secondary air pump (this is the ONLY code it is throwing, I can hook it up and show you) which I have the part for. 

I traded it to sell since it is hard to sell a Corvette. This is a must see car, great inexpensive high school/college car. Ready to drive even without repairs.

Special Operations (MILITARY and LAW ENFORCEMENT), security personnel and armed civilians firearms training emphasizes survival in an armed conflict.  An individuals survival hinges on the ability to deliver an incapacitating wound to an adversary as quickly as possible.  Prevailing in an armed conflict requires the combination of speed and accuracy, over emphasizing either during training could produce disastrous results during that engagement.  As speed and accuracy are equally important, a responsible training program must start by teaching the individual how to hit the target (accuracy/bullseye).  Once that has been accomplished, the training focus shifts to speed (combat), getting the individual to become accurate enough to end an armed conflict as quickly as possible.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

In development for more than four years, the VP Series is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP, but the VP Series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP40 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP Series has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature found on VP pistols is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; either 13-round or reduced, 10-round capacity magazines. VP Series pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams). VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP40’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. The VP40 is essentially the same dimensions as the 9 mm VP9 model. The overall height of the VP40 is one millimeter (.04 inch) taller. The VP40 also weighs 2.37 ounces (67 grams) more, 28.93 ounces for the VP40 versus 26.56 ounces for the VP9."

I traded for this a few months ago and it had a broken plunger tab on it so I ordered a new one but when I tried to remove the screw that holds the plunger housing to the barrel the screw stripped out so it will have to be backed out somehow. I don't feel like messing with it so I'm just looking to sell it. The revolver works good mechanically speaking.

This doesn't kick bad, but my shoulder can't take it. Arthritis is flaring up after shooting this. I've fired less than 150 rounds. It's fun to shoot but the aches afterwards isn't worth it.

These rifles now sell for $800+ if you can find them and ammo can still be found for $.24 a round in bulk. I think the price is a bargain (ammo worth $370 + shipping and tax), bi-pod ~$80, rifle ~$550 elsewhere on armslist. Over $950 value for a slightly used rifle and kit for $750.

Beretta 92FS 9mm pistol. I am the original owner, which I purchased from Vance's. It's made in Italy and works flawlessly. I also have a OTB holster that comes with it. I am only selling it to finance another project. If you have any questions, please let me know and Ohio residents only, CCW preferred. Thanks!

Description:
The Beretta 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively on or off. The safety lever also functions as the pistols decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
The Beretta 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them. One of the most tested and trusted personal defense weapons in history.

Also TFO tritium and fiber optic sights, green day or night and less than 1 year old. I have an EFK Firedragon recoil assembly that reduces recoil much like the gen 4 dual springs, plus the stock polymer recoil assembly. I did duracoat the the lower frame magpul FDE, but a new lower frame can always be put on or one of the new colors Glock is using. Then there are the optional Streamlight TRL-1 tac light (the 300 lumen, 8000 candela newest C4 version) in brand new condition and new batteries (I couldn't have a home defense weapon or any other primary without one, the flashlight always gets lost) which has inserts allowing it to fit 1913, Glock , 92 (assuming beretta), or S&W99 type rails and a Gundo light bearing custom retention holster (must have light on to retain).
