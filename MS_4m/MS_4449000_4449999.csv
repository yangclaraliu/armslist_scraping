The grip has been cut to a compact length and one magazine has been matched so it's 10+1 capacity. I bought the gun new back in December and have loved it it's had a little over 600 round through it all factory brass ammo with no malfunctions. Does have 2 full size magazines and factory soft case with all the original equipment the RMR does not come with it. Polished feed ramp. I know there isn't much interest for this but I'm wanting to go 357sig.   In size the grip is borderline shorted than my G19.  I'll ask 700 OBO and will come with all 3 magazines loaded with speed gold dots. Again the RMR IS NOT PART OF THE SALE this is my carry pistol at the moment so the RMR will remain on it until I have a buyer. 


EXPLANATION;
I was practicing dry firing at my home and needed to use the restroom so I went and came back to find my roommates dog chewing on my pistol the bottom of the grip was deformed and gouged so badly I couldn't insert a magazine so I decided to do whatever I needed to still be able to use the weapon so I cut the grip high enough to clear the gouges I then stippled the full grip and undercut the trigger guard all to cover the scratches and gouges it was a momentary lapse in judgment on my part but I did what I thought was the best at the time. I also modified one magazine to work compact it will hold 10+1 however it's a bear to get the magazine in with 10 rounds so I usually just keep 9 in it. I've had the pistol like this for about 3 months now and the only problem I've had is the small magazine doesn't like to always drop free without being helped."

Have had pistol since last september and have taken it to the range a handful of times. This is the .40 sw caliber and would make a nice duty or carry pistol. It is very accurate. The trigger always breaks the same as any glock. No cosmetics on this. 

The price I am asking is 460. I could negotiate some on this if you also buy the box of winchester red and white 100 round bulk box if you needed it. I have an open box with twenty rounds in it I am tossing in as a gift.

It comes with an extra glock factory magazine.

I'd like to get cash but I would trade for a smaller caliber rifle for my wife to target shoot with. Ideally I'd love a Mossberg MVP Patrol or other non-laminate variant, KelTec SU16, Ruger 10/22, Browning Buckmark (specifically a Black Label). I'm pretty flexible. Any trade offers should be of relative value. Everything I've seen says a gun like this in this condition is worth about $850 but I'm asking $650 cash.

The .45 ACP Glock that I have for sale is one of the original 500 ever produced by Glock.

Glock developed this weapon to appeal to the U.S. Generals and Special Forces that traditionaly carried a Colt .45.  They wanted the Glock because it was lighter and indestructable.
Less than 300 rounds have been put through this weapon.  It needs a new firing pin SPRING which will  be replaced but Glock told me to just hang on to it and not shoot it because it was a highly desirable collectible.  They told this to my Glock Tech when he called to see if there were any upgrades.  It has been sitting in my safe since then.

This comes with a box, Glock instruction booklet, 3 magazines, and a holster.

Buyer pays for BG check and transfer as well as the BG check or transfer back to me if unable to pass checks:

First I have a hand carved Remington SportMaster Model 512 chambered in 22 LR. It is also in very good condition. There is some minor wear on the barrel nose but other than that the finishes are excellent. There is a minor problem feeding ammo. I've taken it to several gunsmiths and (while none would actually get around to doing maintenance on it) they've told me the problem was likely caused by needing a better cleaning than I'm capable of. It includes original offset mounted scope. Again I would prefer cash but I'd entertain offers of equal value ($350), namely Ruger 10/22 takedown, target or tactical, or Browning Buckmark 22 pistol. 

Selling price: $250 FIRM

Second is a custom sporterized Mauser Model 98 re-chambered in 30-06. It features a hand carved stock. Finish on stock and metal parts is in great condition showing only minor wear. Includes the original x4 claw mounted scope with leather lens covers, and leather sling. The receiver is stamped with the Nazi Iron Eagle and the date 1940. I'd like to get cash but I would trade for a Mossberg MVP in 223 or 308, a Kel Tec SU16 or Buckmark Black Label pistol. Any trade offers should be of relative value. Everything I've seen says a gun like this in this condition is worth about $850. 

Selling price: $750 FIRM. 

I also have 80 rounds of Remington Core Lokt 30-06 ammo I'd like to sell if the Mauser goes. $80

I'd love to keep these guns as a set so if you're interested in both I'll sell for $1000.

My father purchased this new in 1982 when I was a teenager. Therefore I know the complete history of this awesome S&W .357 Mag Revolver since it has been in my family for 33 years and stored in a safe. It comes with its original Factory Box, Upgraded S&W High Gloss Wood Grips, a extra set of Pachmayr Decelerator Hard Rubber Grips, a Gould & Goodrich Black Leather Retention Hip/Belt Holster. The line of S&W 65's was discontinued in 2004 which adds to the collectibility. I'm on the fence about selling this one but I'll never shot it so it needs a home with someone who can appreciate it. I will consider offers but please keep in mind that I am highly educated in firearms and I know what it's worth to the S&W Collectors Association in 99% condition. Thanks for looking! $675 OBO..."

This is from my personal collection of SKS's. 

* 1954 Russian Tula - OH MY, this is extremely rare as it has NO refurb markings! Nearly all Russian SKS's have been factory refurbished and marked as such prior to being imported to the U.S. for resale. It is extremely rare to find one that hasn't been refurbished. Not only has it not been refurbished it has dark solid wood. Many of the later SKS's came with the ugly laminated or plywood looking stocks. SKS with all matching numbers.Comes complete with cleaning rod and bayonet. What a rare find, asking ONLY $700 obo !!!

This holster attaches to the side of the bra and both the carry position and the draw stroke are very similar to a high ride shoulder holster. The Marilyn loves dresses and she also works great with sports bras. The gun is accessed by reaching down the neck of the dress or blouse so outfits that eliminate most other types of on-body carry still accommodate this holster.

     The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
     This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
     The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The M4-2000 is a physically small, light-weight, fast-attach silencer intended for deployment on the 5.56mm assault rifles. Durably constructed of welded 304 series stainless steel and Inconel, the CAD-designed, CNC machined M4-2000 delivers world-class sound suppression under sustained full auto fire. The M4-2000 attaches to a replacement flash suppressor, and can be installed or removed in less than 3 seconds. The mounting system utilized on the M4-2000 contains no moving parts, and suffers from none of the accuracy degradation or carbon binding problems common with other systems on the market today. The light-weight and low profile design of the M4-2000 adds only 5.0"" in length to the host firearm and does not interfere with the overall weapon balance or the mounting of accessory hardware. Replacement flash suppressors are available for the AR-15/M-16 series of assault rifles, Ruger AC-556, HK-33, G-36, G-36K, G-36C, and Steyr AUG.

Also, I am interested in purchasing .380 acp and 9mm ammunition; both target and self defense ammunitions (I am not interested in tulammo or wolf ammunition, however. Sorry...) 

If you have any and are interested in selling, you can contact me through email or text anytime REDACTED.

I am usually a Glock guy, but I went out on a whim and purchased the two aforementioned firearms and very much like them. I have CT lasers on both and a pocket holster for the lcp. I am interested in purchasing extra magazines (not junk magazines please) and ammunition. Also, I have heard that there is a pocket holster that practically covers the entire lcp, except the trigger; I am interested in trying this out, but can not find any information on it. 

I am just trying to experiment with these two firearms as backups to my Glocks; if you have anything you are willing to part with, please contact me with a price and pictures. 

I will not haggle with you too much; I am looking to pay a fair price and have both of us happy. 

Thanks and have a great day"

Selling my ISSC MK22 rifle. In new condition. This is a .22 LR. I put new condition because it was only used once. At most it has 50 rounds through it. Has the box and manuals with it. This is the new version that has the firing pin modified so you don't have problems with the strike. It worked perfectly, nothing got stuck. And we even used cheap ammo! Comes with a 25 round magazine. Face to face sale with bill of sale and with your ID in hand (as an Oregon resident). $300 firm. No trades! No calls please! Only texts or emails. REDACTED Thanks! This sale will only last a few days because after the 9th of August it will be required to do a background check, because of new Oregon law."

It has been fired exactly 140 rounds to check function and it runs great. It is 100% reliable with every magazine I have tried with it. Magazines lock up tight and function great. This is by far the most accurate AK I have ever shot. 

 To improve upon the accuracy potential it has an adjustable trigger installed. The trigger pull is crisp and breaks cleanly at 2.5 pounds. This is the best AK trigger you have probably ever felt. Or if you want I will install the factory Tapco FCG group which gives a ~5-6 pound trigger with plenty of creep.

 The Magpul Zhukov-S Stock is a no-compromise folding stock for the modern AK. The Zhukov-S Stock casts aside traditional AK stock shortcomings and offers a folding, collapsible stock with QD sling mounts, modular Cheek Risers, and a shock-absorbing rubber butt-pad for superior traction. The Zhukov has right-side folding for compatibility with side-mounted optics. Designed to fit most common stamped AK receivers without modification via a unique wedge block, the durable injection molded polymer Zhukov-S Stock redefines the human interface with the AK platform. It does have one QD sling swivel loop installed.

 This gun comes with a three, yes THREE, year factory warranty. It will also come with one free recoat of the finish anytime within that time frame. It will not require the gun to be shipped anywhere to have it recoated. I will provide details to the buyer. 

 DDI AK47 Black Stock Model , 7.62 x 39 semi auto, Destructive Devices Industries stamped AK is built using a DDI stamped receiver, Green Mountain 4140 barrel, TAPCO FCG, like new Hungarian AKM kit. This DDI Stamped Ak47 has a KG Gun Coat finish, Fenocited bolt, bolt carrier, cleaning rod, axis pins, rear sight assembly, spring guide, and Green Mountain barrel. Fenocite provides superior corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and reduced wear, barrels can last a third longer than conventional barrels. Hogue grip/handguards, and a Phoenix Technology stock has a LARGE storage compartment in the rear. One 30 round polymer magazine, rail sections and hardware for the Hogue hand guard, additional railed upper hand guard, and slant brake found on all modern AKMs.

 The price is $825 with the Magpul folding stock or $725 with the factory stock.

 And because it is made right here in Tennessee no federal regulation will ever ban it because of the laws recently passed in Tennessee like SB 110 as well as the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act. Get this before Hillary gets into office and prices on ALL AKs go through the roof. And with Obama's newest threats against guns get it before prices go through the roof like in 2012-2013.

 Watch review videos and read about the DDI AK here:
 http://ddiarms.com/about-us.html

 This gun is literally like new. I bought it new and installed the trigger. I fired 100 rounds to ensure reliability, which it is 100% reliable, then I installed the Magpul Zhukov folding stock. Then I fired 40 more rounds and I must say I LOVE this stock. After that it was cleaned and stored in a soft case.

 Again, this gun is literally a brand new gun with only 140 rounds through it"

About the Car:
Pros:
-CLEAN TITLE
-Both drives axles were replaced, 30K miles ago. 
-New clutch Assembly from Honda Dealership, 30K miles ago. With transmission oil change using Honda transmission oil.
-A rock flew up and hit the windshield so I went ahead and had it replaced with a new windshield through my insurance, I did that so whoever gets the car doesn't need to fix it. Brand new windshield replaced May 2015.
-Gets great gas mileage.
-In 2013 the Tie Rods for the steering where replaced with band new ones from Honda Dealership.
-NEW tires and a full car alignment where done at Les Schwab's just 8k miles ago! 
-It has a K&N air filter, other than that this car is stock and reliable, not a bunch of modifications done to it. 
-Brake pads where all replaced 4K miles ago.
-Has an electronic sliding moon roof.
-Has working A/C.
-Oil change was just done.
-All belts where replaced 2 years ago, A/C belt, Power steering belt, and alternator belt.
-Heater coolant hoses are all brand new with parts from Honda Dealership.
-The distributor, spark plug wires and spark plugs are all recently replaced with parts from Honda, the wires are NGK's and regular type spark plugs. The distributor was $400 through Honda, only Honda parts have been used on this car. More expensive but then it's more reliable so it was always worth it to me for the peace of mind.

Cons:
-Passenger side window motor went out, so the door panel needs to be pulled off and then replace the electric window motor."

This listing is for my very rare and very good condition 1954 Russian SKS.

This is from my personal collection of SKS's. 

* 1954 Russian Tula - OH MY, this is extremely rare as it has NO refurb markings! Nearly all Russian SKS's have been factory refurbished and marked as such prior to being imported to the U.S. for resale. It is extremely rare to find one that hasn't been refurbished. Not only has it not been refurbished it has dark solid wood. Many of the later SKS's came with the ugly laminated or plywood looking stocks. SKS with all matching numbers.Comes complete with cleaning rod and bayonet. What a rare find, asking ONLY $700 obo !!!

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

We choose this site because we know there will be no trickery or Thom Foolery and by all means no OVERPRICEING. Saddam had the fine craftsman at Sotheby's in New York create this one of a kind Masterpiece. It took them 3 years 6 months 22 days 30 minutes and 3 seconds to create this one of a kind Masterpiece fitting to only be sold on the greatest site on the net Armslist. Saddam was so happy with the craftsman he flew them all to Bagdad and showered them with golden gifts and last but not least the Palace Whores. Since you can ask any price on here we feel it only fitting that the price be 1 million$ since this is Armslist. Please Note. The buyer of this fine weapon will be flown to NY on a private jet and will be wined and dined in the finest NY has to offer.
