This is the poly version that includes the hammer to allow single action accuracy. I also like it because it does not protrude enough to be a snag issue. 
WHY: Simply because I decided to get a new toy. This is my 2nd LCR and will probably replace it again some time. Right now I've got a hankering for a new FNS 9C. 
CONDITION: Excellent to like new. Gun has never been broke-in nor been to range. Aside from factory testing I have shot exactly two rounds through it. I did carry it IWB for a few weeks. Very light and easy to carry IWB or in pocket (if that is ur preference).

It incorporates a number of quality features including, 16"" chrome lined barrel with 1 in 9"" twist, flat top upper, and two piece plastic handguards. The result is a rifle that is ready for ammunition and a trip to the range.

 The SRC is a semi-automatic rifle that uses a gas-impingement system to cycle the action. The receiver is constructed of forged 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum with a black anodized finish. Although some companies are using polymer trigger guards these days, Windham's are aluminum.

Item Description
This is a heavy-barrel mid-length AR-15 that saw range time and a few competitive rifle matches. Not a safe queen but it wasn’t abused like someone’s “torture test” rifle. It has some cosmetic blemishing (scratched finish on receiver rails where optics were mounted, some marks from sling hardware rubbing the buffer tube/receiver, rail cover scratches, etc.) but has perfect function, it will feed and cycle steel cased ammo reliably (Tula, Wolf, Herters, etc.) as that was what was most commonly shot through it. It is on the heavy end of AR15s and quite loud due to the Dynacomp. 


The rifle will include four D&H gray 30 round aluminum magazines with anti-tilt followers, a standard A2 flash hider in addition to the compensator (in the event you want to swap it out, note you will need a muzzle brake wrench and a suitable crush washer) and a Palmetto State Armory shipping box.

The Holographic Hybrid Sight I (HHS I) features an EXPS3-4 with a G33.STS magnifier. It has great utility for any shooter, whose target ranges vary from close to mid-range. The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.
The durable, night-vision-compatible system offers wide-field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low-light conditions.

Gracefully-designed with great balance and the typical S&W trigger pull.

Serial number begins with AJP -- I believe a 1985 production / shipment date, so it has all the classic S&W features (not like the new ones)….no internal lock, firing pin on the hammer, genuine square butt K-frame (not a round-to-square conversion) with a beautifully-exposed back strap, and Magna S&W medallion wood stocks. 

Used, but not abused.  Except for a couple of small “character marks”, the frame, barrel, and cylinder are in exceptionally great condition for a 30-year old gun (IMHO).

The cylinder turn line is very, very faint.    4” heavy barrel.  Ramped and grooved front sight and fixed rear sight.

Upon request, I will email additional excellent quality pics to interested buyers.  You will be proud to own this revolver.

It’s not the Pavona or the Compact.
It’s full size, but it has a thin grip.  Even people that don’t have huge hand can comfortably grip and shoot this gun.  Even with the smallish grip, it still holds 16 + 1.
The P is for polymer and the S is for either great ergonomic small frame or standard frame, which is smaller than the huge grips that many folks have a hard time shooting.
The slide riding inside the frame, like a CZ 75, cuts down on recoil and makes it easier to shoot and control.
Black slide, but the frame is pretty neat dark blue color.  The Blue is very difficult to find.

Ruger LC9s Pro Differences/Features

The Ruger LC9s Pro has no external thumb safety.

This is a feature that we absolutely love. We have heard countless stories about fellow peace-keepers pulling out their firearms in self defense, and then losing a second or so to disengage the safety.

When you don't have a thumb safety on the side of the gun, you don't have to worry about an extra step while saving a life.

The Ruger LC9s Pro has no magazine disconnect safety."

I've got an NM American Springfield Loaded 1911. Excellent condition, typical use wear on moving parts (Grip safety, safeties). Trijicon Night Sights dated 12 rear and 13 front. Approximately 350 rounds fired and not a single hiccup with a variety of ammo. I've got plenty of magazines. 6 Wilson Combat 47Ds, 2 Colt XSE 8 rounders, a Chip McCormick 8 rounder and the two factory mags. All of these magazines have functioned flawlessly and are ready for some actual use. I also have a Wilson Combat Lo-Profile OWB leather holster and a Galco King Tuk, both of which are excellent holsters. Josh at Stoddard's has done some sear work. The sear has been filed down a little to make the trigger pull slightly crisper. And finally my favorite accessory to this gun: VZ Simonich Gunner grips. These grips are a super aggressive texture. They grip the hand and don't let go. Naturally box and docs will be included as well. 

What I'm looking for at the moment is primarily a Glock 19 Gen 4 and a Surefire X300 ultra, iwb/owb holster, mags, ammo, etc. 
Holler at me and we'll make something work. 

Text me at REDACTED for the quickest response. I'm off tomorrow so I can be a night owl if need be."

I have had it since Fall 2015. 

For those that do not know, the LEM trigger is one smooth, long, ~4lb pull. Many people who have the P30 type guns modify the triggers to LEM, which HK does not authorize/acknowledge. This is a factory LEM gun. 

Gun is in 90-95% condition. Local stores would charge you $1000 for it. A great price for a gun that is a few months old. A few years ago this model went 90k+ rounds, with cleanings every 6000 rounds or so in harsh conditions. 

So why am I selling/trading such an awesome gun? I could use the money elsewhere. Specifically, something more concealable to potentially compliment my open carry full-size gun, and well I have taken a liking to HK so I'd like to have at least one - hence I am looking for the SK version (cheaper). Why not a VP9? I don't like striker fired guns.  

Or I'll take a reliable AR15 or AR10, as I don't have a rifle.

I paid over $130 for everything but since its used I will sell for $120. 

I also have an older .177 crossman Co2 rifle. It works like it should and comes with extra clips and the rotary pellet holders. The front site was cracked and has tape on it but it is still perfectly accurate. 

The other gun is a Co2 Daisy Powerline mode 4500l. It works like it should also but the rear site is cracked ""see picture"" it is still fun to shoot. 

If you want all of them make an offer. I would prefer to trade all of them for any type of rifle, shotgun, pistol, it doesn't hurt to ask. I would say these air rifles are worth about $150 all together. Please offer something worth around that.

Made by Remington Arms. In great condition. Stock is steel, handle is plastic. Everything works 100% and there is no notable damage to anything. No cracks in the handle. Great condition for being almost 40 years old. Also included are 1980s Uncle Mikes Quick detach sling swivels with the original packaging. Only reason im selling it is because as cool as it is, its 1970s cool and isn't as practical as a modern 870 fixed stock and the gun it was on doesn't see as much action as I would like it too. I wouldn't be hurt if I had to keep it around by any means.

Its semi-humpback design, which refers to the pistol grip and rear of the receiver area, allows a sure grip for smaller hands. Additionally, the lightweight profile barrel helps pick up the ivory front sight bead very quickly. Shouldering, the grip, sight plane and weight are all critical factors when selecting any shotgun, either for youth and ladies or for adults. The Silver Hunter Micro Midas becomes the only real choice because of its compact and lightweight handling. The finely cut checkering on the grip and forearm also help to better control the gun."
