No box or ppwk included or I would be asking a lot more.  Serial # N807xxx, from reseaching it should be an '81-'82 model.  Very clean as shown in pics, only some very light and small marks/specs behind the cylinder release, not bad, but want to mention it, would be tough to find another one used in this condition.  Whether it be for hunting or target shooting, If you are looking for something to fill the gap between your .357 mag. and .44 mag. or can't decide between the two, look no further, you've found the solution to your dilemma, lol.  If you look at ballistics on factory loads the .41 mag is much closer to the .44 mag than the .357 mag, a couple I found even exceeding the .44 mag. numbers.  Also, ammo is around the same cost as .44 mag.  

$1,160 in cash for everything or better in trade, no hurry to sell/trade this one.  Thanks for the interest and great trade offers so far, just have not had the right deal come across yet.

Trades considered:

About the only thing I want right now is a DPMS Recon G2 AR-10, they sell new for around $1,200($1,000 if you got the Black Friday Deal, dang it), so I would straight trade on that.  Maybe interested in the DPMS 3G1 or MK12 18"" models too or might take in another Armalite AR-10T.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

I am the second owner. I purchased it this past spring from an FFL in Central Illinois. I can not recall how many rounds the previous owner was said to have put through it, though it does not show excessive wear. I have only put 60 rounds through it myself. It does have a few scratches on the ejection port side, and possibly some wear marks on the left side of the slide, near the front. Not sure of the cause of any of the marks, since I have never carried this, nor holstered it. They were already present when I purchased it. Plenty of photos available, Armslist only allows me to post one.

I am looking to sell this as a package. I will miss having it around, as it is easy to operate, very dependable, and enjoyable to shoot. I have had zero malfunctions of any sort with this firearm. I am located in Carroll County, but would be willing to travel a bit, so as long as we meet in a location that ensures our mutual safety, and allows you to inspect the firearm without causing undue alarm and concern (i.e. a shooting range, ffl dealer, etc.)

Would be willing to do a partial trade for a level 3 holster for a glock 17/19/22/23, 1 or 2 Firestone destination A/T 255/70r17 tires with 75% tread remaining, a hard tonneau cover for 04-08 F150 with 6.5 foot bed, or a duty light or light/laser combo used in good condition made by a reputable manufacturer (Streamlight, etc.), a brand new roll of berber carpet in a tan shade. I would be willing to consider a combination of the items as well.

The XDs comes with the case, 1 7 round magazine with pearce base plate (allowing you to get a full grip, factory base plate also comes with), 1 9 round magazine with the mid mag extension. Extra back strap, mid mag extension, Springfield Armory plastic holster and double magazine holder, lock, and cleaning brush, and factory fired shell casing. It did not have the owners manual with it, and i haven't bothered to purchase one since I was already familiar with how to disassemble for cleaning. Reassembly is equally easy. The ammo in the magazines will not be included.

The ammo consists of the following:

1 350 round bulk box Blazer Brass 115 grain 9mm full metal jacket. Purchased just after I purchased the XDs.

1 50 round box of Remington UMC 115 grain 9mm jacketed hollow points. Purchased last month.

Pictured is our best seller; the 120lb Crossbow in Black. Specifically made for hunters and larger men, the stirrup is able to fit any kind of boot with ease, and the entire weapon is made of single-cast nylon fibers for the ultimate test of strength. I have personally owned one for over 6 years; I take it to the range weekly, and I have never had to replace a single part. This is easily the best and least expensive way to start archery, and comes with everything you need to start loosing bolts right away! 



Stringers, shorter/longer bolts, extra strings, extra limbs, replacement parts are all available upon request. Happy Hunting, and do tell your friends. Armlist ad rules mean that I cannot place this in multiple locations, but this is not just for Oregonians! We ship across the entire USA, Alaska and Hawaii included! So get some buddies together and throw down on a set of crossbows for this year's hunting season.


Supplies are limited! We are selling crossbows faster than we can restock. If something is out of stock I am happy to give you a quote and a time frame of when you can expect it back in stock. We have real-time inventory control for just this type of question."

1944 IZHEVSH ARSENAL M 44 Carbine.    Excellent example of Vintage WW2  battle rifle.  Bore is bright with strong rifling. Stock is very good and Blued parts in great condition.  Comes complete with Sling/Ammo Pouch/Tools/Head Space Tools/Tactical Butt Stock Cheek Rest & Soft Gun Case.
I have scoped it with ""Brass Stacker"" Anchor Point mount and I have two scopes to go with it. 1. NC Star 2.75 x 22 Long Eye Relief and  2.  2-7 x 42 Aims Sport LER.  This scoped set up works great and makes the Mosin a great fun range rifle and hunter. The scope mount can remove and restore the rifle to stock configuration, thus no permanent  alteration was done.  I have the two removed parts to make the M 44 original again if desired.   If you want some 7.62 x 54 R ammo, I have some I will let go at a great low price. Must be 21 Y/O and otherwise legal to own a firearm in Texas.

We have a set of 2 spring-powered Scorpion SMG with fold-out stocks that has your name on it, shipped to your door. Wanting to spend more for a better piece?

Built by National Ordnance in So Cal, this is an M1 carbine, ser# 79xx in nice overall shape.  These were produced in the sixties after the patents on the military M1 carbine expired, and were sold to the public as well as law enforcement agencies, and foreign governments. The low wood potbelly  stock with a ventilated handguard has an isolated 1 inch crack under the buttplate (pictured) which is separated by the sling/oiler cutout, and does not effect the rest of the stock.  The solid front sight with no holes in the uprights dates this rifle  to post-1965 from what I've read.  Due to California law the 15 round magazine isn't included with the carbine unless you are a LEO or have an out-of-state address I can ship it to, however 10 round mags are available on the market. The 18"" barrel has a nice looking mirror bore with six groove rifling.  This has the correct longer inertia block on the front of the slide (pictured), not the problematic shorter versions that some of the later models had.

Previous owner installed a ghost ring sight to the lever Rifle. As far as I can tell, whoever did it actually drilled out the manual safety to achieve this. Fair warning, the rifle has no manual safety anymore. It functions fine, however, and the ghost ring sight makes for really fast target acquisition. 

Its a 24""(?I think) hexagonal barrel. Runs flawlessly. Previous owner said he used it for Cowboy Action shooting as well as Hog hunting in Texas and stated he had only put approximately 250-300 rounds thru it. I have only put about 50 more thru it since I've had it.

This is a 1830's Belgian pistol that would be described as ""bag-butt, screw barrels.
The shape of the hand-grip, like a cloth bag or "" even a bull's scrotum, makes the term ""bag-butt"" appropriate.
The four notches you see in the muzzle of each barrel fit a wrench which came with the gun (now long lost). With the wrench, you could unscrew the barrels individually. Removing a barrel would present you with a hollow, tube-like chamber into which you would pour a measure of black powder, which would then be topped by a round ball.
The length of the inner chamber would automatically limit the amount of powder you could put into it, and its interior diameter would limit the diameter of the (soft lead) ball. Thus, a safe charge was guaranteed.
