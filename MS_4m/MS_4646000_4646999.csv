The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting days, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense,and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle - well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you'll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again.KEY PERFORMANCE FEATURES:Attaches via choke mount to most commercially available gas operated, inertia driven, or pump action shotguns with barrels threaded for chokes.Modular design allows the user to shorten the silencer to 6"",8"", or 10"" configurations to balance size, weight, and sound requirements.Rated for wadded shells up to 3"" including buckshot and slugs.Can be shortened to 8"" configuration and remain hearing safe at the ear.Noticeably reduces felt recoil.Choke mounts and rod kits sold separately - choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full.The Salvo 12 is compatible with the following barrel and ammunition pairings.BARREL LENGTH AMMUNITION10""-16"" 2 3/4"" Shell, 1350 FPS16""+ 3"" Shell, 1550 FPSSPECIFICATIONS:CALIBER: 12 GaugeMFG ID: SU823MUZZLE AVERAGE dB: 136.8WEIGHT: 34.5 ozLENGTH: 12.00""DIMENSIONS: 2.21"" X 2.96""MATERIALS: Aluminum & Stainless Steel"

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems. To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Loaded Chamber Indicator.
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

CZ P-07 Duty Polymer-Framed Combat/Tactical Pistol: 
The Best Pistol Nobody Knows About (Range Review/Shooting Test)

by Mike Pannone    July 05, 2013

. . . The P07 Duty I have has proven to be extremely reliable and durable. I have more than 7000 rounds through it and have yet to encounter any pistol-related malfunction. By “pistol-related” I mean a mechanical failure of a properly maintained pistol with quality ammunition and good magazines. Any unmaintained weapon will eventually fail, and magazines are always the most failure-prone part of a quality firearm. Recently, I shot 900 rounds of Wolf 9mm ammo that was given to me.

Over three sessions in 3 consecutive days without cleaning or lubricating the pistol (just to see how it would do), there were no issues, even though the guns internals were absolutely filled with un-burnt powder residue. The only stoppages were 2 failures to feed, where the round stopped on the feed ramp due to mud-like fouling. The ""tap"" of a ""tap-rack"" drill released the slide each time. As far as durability is concerned, in 7K rounds, all I have done is clean it on average every 500-700 rounds fired and put more ammunition in it. . . .

. . . I am convinced that for a personal protection firearm, the CZ P-07 Duty combat pistol is equal to anything out there and better than most. The reliability, durability, safety, shootability, accuracy, capacity and cost make it a win in every category for a self-defense/concealed carry pistol. The smooth double-action first shot is an inherent safety and is less likely to be inadvertently actuated under stress by a less experienced shooter. For an experienced shooter, it is a pleasant gun to carry and shoot, handles extremely well and is truly bomb-proof durable. At $496 MSRP (and readily available for less than that), it’s a steal.

For sale is my Interarms Mark X, in 7mm Rem Mag. 23"" barrel.

It is in excellent shape. I can find very little wear, I doubt it has been shot much, ever. I cant decode the stampings, or find a date code. But, I believe this is 1990s manufacture. It was imported out of Manchester England. This is NOT one of the very recent Interarms or Remington Imports.

Bell and Carlson Stock, that originally cost about $300. NOT a cheap plastic synthetic.There is a flake of paint in the forearm, I could cover it with a sharpy, but didnt want to hide anything.

Only the gun is for sale, along with a Bushnell 4x and bases are included. Again, the Leupold scope pictured, sling and bipod are not included. I have barely shot it, maybe a half box in the time I have owned it. So it is for sale.

This is a high quality commercial Mauser action. These guns are great actions to build a custom gun on. Intearms and Parker Hales are great shooting guns, even when completely original. Very under rated, and low price compared to like quality rifles. Excellent long range rifle for low $$$$.

I am asking $425 or offer. If you dont want the stock, I will sell the rest for $300, and I am not open to offers if sold this way. Willing to ship, your dime.

397,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4646397,For Sale:  (New) Huntertown Arms Kestrel 7.62 AK Suppressor MFG # K7AK,"Howell, Michigan, United States",$ 499,"Listed On: Saturday, May 28, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"CALL TO VERIFY IN STOCK STATUS BEFORE DRIVING TO STORE OR BUYING ONLINE>Huntertown Arms Kestrel 7.62 AK Suppressor MFG # K7AKHuntertown Arms Kestrel 7.62 AK MFG # K7AKPurpose-built for the AK platform, the Kestrel 7.62 AK is designed specifically for short cartridge 7.62 rounds.SuppressionThe Kestrel 7.62 AK had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor for the AK platform that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.MaintenanceCleaning the Kestrel 7.62 AK is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors.With the Kestrel 7.62 AK full user servicability is truely a reality.The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel will allow up to five times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.SafetyThe Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.SpecificationsCaliber: 7.62x39Overall Length: 6.5 inchesDiameter: 1.5 inchesWeight: 18.5 ounces (includes mount)Core Material: Stainless steelTube Material: TitaniumRegistered Part Material: Stainless steelFinish: Black Moly Resin"

This is a field Grade Garand. Spring Field Armory.  Receiver is in fact WW II era. Not sure about the additional parts of the Rifle. Meaning, this is an all Springfield Armory Rifle but serial numbers are not going to match every part.  If you know anything about Garands it's hard to get one.  And it's getting harder. One of these days they are going to dry up and you won't be able to get one at all.  If interested or you have additional questions email me.

I do have some Stripper clips and a small amount of Greek Ammo I will include. I will also be including a Brand New Wood Stock you can install. The Rifle would then look pretty new.  CMP Garands are good. They are shooters."

I've had this gun Cerakoted in burnt bronze as well as some of the parts like the mag release and slide release.  

Has 1 factory mag and 1 1911 mag.  The factory mag makes the gun 7+1, the 1911 mag makes it 8+1.  This is one of the few 1911 mags that actually feeds perfectly in this gun and also allows the slide to lock back on empty, just like the factory mags do."

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

It's not a safe queen, but it's still in great shape. Only thing that I would consider bad on this gun is holster wear. 

Only 600 rounds through it. At 500 rounds, I stripped the gun completely and cleaned every part of it. Took it to the range, put 100 rounds through it, field stripped it, and haven't been to the range since. 600 rounds is nothing for a Glock.

The Crossbreed holster has been worn for around a year, maybe year and a half. Has wear from the Glock being holstered and unholstered. Super comfortable and makes it feel like you're not carrying anything at all.

Only reason I want to sell it is to try a Springfield XDs. Can't have 2, so I have to sacrifice my Glock.

Will have pics later today or possibly tomorrow. Asking $500."

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Rifle Scope was designed specifically for the US Special Operations Command SOPMOD M4 Carbine and features the reticle bullet drop compensator and range finding stadia lines that are based on the trajectory of the 62 grain bullet from a 16 inch M4A1 barrel. The black, daytime reticle of the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 glows amber at night and in low light due to its tritium composition. Unique to the Trijicon ACOG sights is its internal adjustment capability - only the prism housing moves - making this the most rugged scope available. This rifle scope by Trijicon will withstand exposure to temperature extremes, salt spray, fog, fungus, humidity, sand, dust, shock vibration and a free fall drop onto a hard surface. Aerospace seals make Trijicon riflescopes waterproof to depths greater than 500 feet. The user does not need to make any special adjustments between shots at different ranges.

This one manufactured by a subsidiary of Remington at Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, PA. These rifles were the main rifles used by the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I. This rifle has the red band painted around the stock which means it was purchased by the UK British Purchasing Commission for use by the Homeguard & the red band was painted on the stock to distinguish it from the British P14 .303. It is import marked on the barrel. The serial # is 4804XX, which I believe dates it to Jan-April 1918. The barrel is dated 4-18. All parts I can see, including the barrel, bolt, safety, etc. have an E for Eddystone & the stock has the Eagle head stamp for Eddystone - the bolt is serialized, but the number doesn't match the serial # on the receiver. It is a shooter, as well as a great piece of military history - the stock shows wear obviously considering the age, which only adds to the character of this firearm.

They actually produced the PP until the mid 80's, and even if the firearm may say Walther, it was still actually produced by Manhurin.
