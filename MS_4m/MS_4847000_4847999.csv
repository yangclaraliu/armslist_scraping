Most BARs are in 30-06. This one is in 308!!! and it's not ""easy"" to find, so to speak.

 By the looks of it, it's not been fired much at all. Everything is perfect. I haven't even shot it since getting it in trade and probably won't get to it till this winter when bored. 

Before I put new glass on it and hunt with this baby, I thought I would check the interest out there. I'd love to shoot it but a true browning collector or enthusiast may want to see some pictures. It been in a climate controlled safe for nearly all of it's life.

Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy. Blaser Saddle Mount Only with a perfect scope mount, rifle and rifle scope become one accurate unit. Four inconspicuous notches which are aligend with the chamber hold the one-piece mounting base without causing tension."

Price listed is value new without the added scope. Gives us a starting point for values. E-mail me and I'll send you my text # with more pictures."

NOT FOR ENFIELD PURISTS::::This is a Enfield No.5 stock adapter. PERFECT CONDITION. This solid aluminium adapter allows you to remove your original (somewhat boring) wood stock and add a buffer tube and your choice of a more comfortable AR style stock and add a AR style pistol grip. Anyone who`s shot their No.5 a lot knows that hard rubber butt pad hurts after a few rounds.  Any mil-spec or commercial buffer tube will fit. I only know of one place that sells these, they`re in Australia and with shipping costs around $230. Comes with mounting bolt. Very easy to put on or take off. I used it to turn my No.5 Enfield into a bush rifle. I was able to collapse the stock for easier backpacking into the back country. More pics upon request. Any questions feel free to ask. FREE SHIPPING to lower 48. I sold my No.5 to a friend who collects Enfields and he only wanted the original stock.

PLEASE LET ME BE CLEAR: THIS IS FOR THE STOCK ADAPTER ONLY ! I WILL NOT ANSWER EMAILS WONDERING IF THE ENFIELD IS FOR SALE, IT`S NOT MY RIFLE  IT IS THOUGH WHAT YOUR No.5 COULD LOOK LIKE WITH THE ADAPTER. ALSO NO LOW BALLERS YOU WILL BE IGNORED"

This particular rifle is a CMP Compass Lake Engineering rifle, these were available in the late 90s to early 2000s. The standard CMP rifles ran $875, used bushmaster chrome moly barrels, and were assembled by Compass Lake Engineering. The upgraded rifles were about $1200, and utilized a compass lake stainless barrel(I believe it was Krieger, you could always call compass lake and confirm which barrel they used.) This rifle was purchased new in late 1999 or early 2000 by my father, and as far I know was never shot.
Here are the details:
Bushmaster upper and lower with CMP laser engraving
Rifle assembled by Compass Lake engineering with a CLE stainless barrel, CLE windage adjustable FSB, cle NM front sight post, Frank White trigger, CLE float tube, and CLE NM rear sight.

Price is $700 OBO, shipping to lower 48 is $45(this is a heavy rifle), I will not ship where prohibited. I prefer to ship to FFLs that will accept from a private individual, if I have to ship from my FFL it's an additional $40. This is listed in multiple forums, the easiest way to get ahold of is by email.

Proven shooter on 1000yd range. Only issue is slight wear on ceracoat at wear a few wear points as seen in photos. Below is manufacturer description and list of specifications copy and pasted-

The evolution of the SPR comes home to Daniel Defense in the MK12.  Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.  

The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  This, along with being salt bath nitride finished, equates to unprecedented accuracy and durability.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ quad rail for allowing your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.  

The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  We also furnished the MK12 with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

749,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4847749,For Sale:  4x32 Browe Combat Optic w/ Blue Chevron Reticle $850 OBO,"anywhere within 50 miles from chicago, Chicago, Illinois",$ 850,"Listed On: Monday, November 23, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"4x32 BROWE Combat Optic w/ blue .223 chevron reticle 


The 4x32 BROWE Combat Optic (BCO) is a state-of-the-art optic that delivers highest quality optical glass, high precision machining, with a rugged military design. 

The BCO is a purpose designed and built optic ideally suited for tactical scenarios and well suited for military, police and sportsmen.  Its titanium housing is compact and light weight, yet nearly three times stronger than its aluminum counterparts, enhancing its ability to survive the rigors of field abuse under the most severe environmental conditions.

The BCO’s list of evolutionary technology is long and includes such features as:

 Target Light Sensor Technology  
The BCO has a cadmium-sulfide photocell located in the optical path providing great sensitivity and accuracy of the target light that is being transmitted through the optic, not ambient lighting. In tactical environments lighting levels are very liquid and constantly changing. When nanoseconds count there is no time to make manual illumination adjustments or search for a poorly illuminated reticle.  The Target Light Sensor Technology simplifies the operation and allows the operator to focus on the job at hand. 

 Single Intuitive Control (SIC)  
Gives the operator a simple button designed to control the illumination systems and simulate muscle memory.  With a single press of the SIC button the BCO will enter Automatic Mode; this will utilize the Target Light Sensor Teechnology by measuring the light transmission and automatically set the reticle illumination to the proper brightness.  The second press of the SIC button the BCO enters into Manual Mode.  This gives the operator complete control of the reticle illuination with the choice of 10 day settings and 3 night vision settings.

 BCO Utility Port  
The BCO utility port is a sealed port on the backside of the battery housing.  This port can be used to update the operating firmware or customize the existing program.  It can also be used to plug in a remote pressure pad switch, so the SIC button controls can be placed at a secondary location on the weapon.  This port can also be used to import or export power.  This means that accessories such as lasers or mini red dots could be powered from the BCO battery.  Alternatively, the BCO utility port is capable of importing power, to run on an external power source such as a central power system.

 Vibration Motion Sensor  
Designed to conserve battery life by placing the BCO in SLEEP mode if motion is not detected after two hours. The BCO has an average battery usage life of over 2000 hours with a minimum of 775 hours on max brightness.  In sleep mode the battey current is less than 1uA, which will give the BCO a shelf life of over 10 years.

Optical Design  
The BCO optical design is based on an internally adjustable roof prism optical system with an etched glass reticle.  This design was incorporated to maintain a short overall length, a platform that has proven itself successful with currently deployed products.  All lenses are precision ground of the finest quality optical glass available and are broad band anti-reflective coated possessing excellent light gathering capabilities even under low light conditions.

For the time being at least. If you'd like to see one, email me and I'll send you a couple. 

I'm selling my Zastava Yugo AK 47. It comes with Ultimak upper and lower rail system. The bottom rail has been shaved down a little bit in the back, to allow the stock to fold more completely.  Ultimak rails are one of the best built and most sturdy rails out there. They are perfect for mounting red dots. I had an Aimpoint Mirco on this one, before I had to sell it. Also comes with the original stock set, a cheek riser and 5 p-mags. The rifle is in amazing shape.

Face to face transaction and cash only. Must have a valid drivers license and be at least 18 years old. We will also fill out a firearm owner transfer form, for Personal records.

Also comes with two extra Trip research mags.

Manufacturer Product Description:

Our Classic Bobtail has proven so popular due to its concealable profile that we decided to bring you something even more concealable. The Concealed Carry Officer. This model is built as a classic CCO, a Commander slide on top of an Officer frame. This combination provides the control and reliability of the Commander with the easy concealment of the Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP in the two provided 7 round flush base magazines, you won’t feel under gunned.

To make it more comfortable and make it disappear even easier while carrying concealed we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce the over all weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. To help control recoil, we have included an undercut trigger guard and our new “Chain link” pattern on the front strap and mainspring housing. The slide and small parts are coated in the same “Duty” finish that we use on the Valor. Like all of our night sight models you will find dual colored Tritium lamps for faster low light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO wears a medium length trigger shoe to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models this gun is both beautiful and functional.

They both run fine but ive just always preferred steel magazines. Each holds 30 rounds.
Based on bulgarian waffle design with extra thick locking tabs.  Could even be bulgarian molds.
They look like new and have run flawlessly in my use. (Admittedly not extensive use)
Great for plinking and practice counting rounds with a visual aid. Any mag is a good mag to have in a fight over no mags but i generally like to only trust steel with my life.
And i recently purchased a bunch of steel mags and still have my israili iwi polymer mags for backup.  I just do better with the feel of the steel or iwi mags so these ones i just dont need.  Never use them.  It occurs to me that someone else could give them a lot more use than me. So here they are.
I have then priced pretty fairly i think.  Brand new  + Shipped these mags are minimum of $12 each.  So im saving you the shipping and the hassel of waiting a week while they slowly meander across the u.s. lol.
I can maybe a wiggle a bit but im not giving away free magazines either.
 $20 for both or $8 for black $9 for clear.
