MSRP on this gun was $1,019. It is no longer made by Smith and Wesson and only rarely comes up for sale on the used market. The 340 pd is a 5 round hammerless revolver. The frame is made of Scandium alloy and the cylinder is made of Titanium alloy. The high end alloys allow the shooter to use high power .357 Magnum (or .38 sp) ammo in a gun that weighs 11.4 ounces. I don't know of another gun this size that shoots .357 mag. Most of the guns in this concealed carry category are limited to the much less powerful .38 special.

This 340pd has been carried a good bit, but shot very little. This is the Hi-Viz model with the green fiber optic front sight. It has holster wear and a couple of small nicks. But it functions perfectly and is 100% reliable. It comes with box/docs and a DeSantis pocket holster.

I'm asking $650 and am willing to drive within reason. I'm also open to trades for Smith 686 revolvers or possibly a Ruger GP100 + cash. I'm open to other trades but will be fairly picky. Let me know if you have any questions."

I bought it used, and it was someone's competition gun, thus the weird rail and RDS. I never used it, as the regular night sights were fine to use. The night sights still glow strongly, and you can clearly make out the sight picture in the dark.

I've got 600+ rounds through the barrel, and is quite accurate due to the slide in frame design, and (for me at least) its great ergonomics. No problems at all. It makes a great range/HD gun due to its recoil-absorbing weight, but I wanted a lighter gun for carry, so this one has to go.

Firearm has the following defect or I do not know how to operate it

When you pull the trigger the hammer comes back and strikes firmly.  The cylinder does not rotate nor the the trigger rebound automatically for the next shot. The trigger must be pushed forward so it needs repair. This apparently is a black powder pistol for a collection and must not be fired with modern high pressure ammo just black powder cartridges designed for 100 year old firearms  


It appears to be Calibers: .32,  

Info from the Internet 

.32, .38, or .44 cal., 5 (.38 or .44) or 6 (.32 cal.) shot, 2 1/2, 4 1/2, or 6 in. barrel, nickel (standard) or blue (rare) finish, pull pin cylinder release, marked on top strap ""THE AMERICAN DOUBLE ACTION"", first variation has round barrel and nickel trigger guard with rear retaining pin offset to rear slightly (1884 only), second variation has round barrel and nickel trigger guard (1884-1887), third variation has octagon barrel and nickel trigger guard (1888-1897), fourth variation has octagon barrel, blue trigger guard and company name and address on left side of barrel (1898-1904). Mfg. 1884-1904. 




H&R made three variations of this model from 1884 to 1904. Mine is a second variation, made between 1887 and 1897. The differences were mostly cosmetic. Most of these revolvers were made with a nickel finish, something quite popular at the time, and sold for around a dollar or two.

This revolver is chambered in .32 Smith and Wesson and is designed for black powder cartridges. The second model American, made from 1905 to 1942 shot smokeless powder.



This was a pretty basic gun. It could hold six rounds (although with the hammer-mounted firing pin, five is the rule) in the cylinder. There is a loading gate on the right side of the revolver. The cylinder is removable by pulling the pin under the barrel.

This little (and it is little - the barrel is 2.5"" long) critter works just fine and can squirt an 85 grain round nose lead bullet downrange at the sedate pace of about 600fps. Recoil is a little more than that of a similarly sized .22. The black powder does produce satisfactory smoke and fire, though, so it makes up with drama for the lack of oomph.



The American was chambered in .32S&W, .32H&R, .38S&W and .44 Webley. H&R stopped making revolvers during World War II and contracted to build weapons for the military. After the war, they continued with a different line of guns and The American faded into glory.

H&R went out of business in 1986, but was resurrected in 1991 as a subsidiary of Marlin."

Both the process and material are sufficient for the lower pressures of the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The gunâs 37-ounce weight is surprising, given its chambering. Itâs not until wallets are weighed that the M9-22 regains its charm.

I have had a lot of fun with this wonderful pistol. I have put 939 rounds through it since I bought it back 2013.

This Chiappaâs magazine release, slide release lever, decocker/manual safety, hammer, and take down lever all function like its center-fire brethren, except the decocker/manual safety and the sights are made of plastic rather than metal. Its 10-round magazine is made from plastic, save the spring, and weighs 1.5 ounces. I appreciate that it falls free of the magazine well when released.

The only problem I have had with this gun is that the mag release button got damaged and Chiappa fixed it for free and it works just as it did the day I bought it.

The decocker/manual safety system is a proven one. Safely drop the hammer by rolling the ambidextrous decocking lever down. This movement disconnects and shields the firing pin by rolling it up and out of the path of the hammer. With the lever and therefore the hammer in the down positionâthe safe positionâthe trigger can still be pulled in double-action mode, thereby cocking and dropping the hammer, without the possibility of firing. If the gun is dropped accidentally, the firing pin block prevents it from reaching the primer unless the trigger is pulled. To fire, rotate the decocking/manual safety up, then either pull the trigger in double-action mode, or manually cock the hammer to fire the first round in single-action mode. Despite the decocker/safety being made of plastic, it functions fine.

The M9-.22âs trigger is a replica of the original and for that reason it is a great source of love or loathe to individual shooters. It uses a reliable system that creates cocking leverage by pulling an external, sliding trigger bar that engages the hammer when the slide is installed. Trigger pressure cocks the hammer before pushing the sear disconnect forward to release it. The double-action trigger pull measured slightly more than 12 poundsâso stout some petite shooters like my wife can't pull it without losing the line of sight."

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVORÂ® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situationsâ¦or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the usersâ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVORÂ® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines

This over under has Browning's mono-lock action with the lowest profile I've ever seen on an over under. This Browning is very popular but with limited production. It has no blemishes or marks and is truly in excellent condition. There are other Cynergy classic fields out there though this has the rare pheasant and quail engravings and the traditional checkering unlike the other Cynergy classic fields with neo-modern engravings and checkering. Many have no engravings at all. This gun has never seen the field, was purchased new by me and has less than 300 rounds put through it at the range. I have never seen one of these online or in person besides this one. I have seen the 12 gauge a couple times. If you have any questions please contact me."

------
The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950âs to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealerâs showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National MatchÂ® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard.

 Who Am I:
 My names Chris. I have done countless Glock Trigger/Slide jobs on my own Glocks as well as many others people Glocks. I also do other weapons including Handguns and Rifles. I am legally allowed to possess a Handgun, I can show you my CCP and Mil ID so you know I'm not a felon. I do not own a shop, I do this as a hobby and to help people with cost. I will however do the same if not better job then you will get at a gunshop for a fraction of the price, you can pay over $100 for a polish job at gunshops! I enjoy gunwork and I do this as a hobby, I have been for many years and I am very familiar with Glocks and many others, just shoot me a message with what gun you have. Turnaround is 48hrs, however in most cases it is ready for pickup next day, I say 48hrs for a 1 day buffer in case I have something going on with work. Cant beat that! Also I can install what ever custom parts you have purchased on your own. There will be a ""Pre"" and ""Post"" work form to fill out stating what services will be provided and that your giving and taking back possession. A copy will be made for you to keep.
 -------------------------------------------------
 Why Polish Internals?:
 Polishing is like waxing a floor. Less friction equals smoother surface, which in our case equals a physically smoother operating gun and a smoother feel to the user. It will remove most/all of the grittiness in your trigger as well as making a smoother pull and reset. Glocks come stock with a 5lb trigger pull which in reality is closer to 6lb, sometimes slightly more, due to all the friction from factory coated parts. Polishing will bring it to where it should be with stock parts which is roughly 4.5lbs-5lbs, thus making the trigger pull feel lighter then your used to. I also offer two parts to further reduce trigger pull and enhance smoothness, that when coupled with the polish job will make your Glock operate as smooth as possible and make the trigger pull break like glass every time....Pull the trigger on one of my glocks before you commit and see for yourself!
 -------------------------------------------------
 What I offer:
 I will completely disassemble the gun(slide and frame), clean the entire gun(bore at your request), polish all friction prone internals, oil and reassemble. Can also polish Barrel Feed Ramp at your request with no additional Fee.
 Price $25

 I will Remove the Factory 5lb Connector and replace it with a POLISHED 3.5lb connector. This reduces the trigger pull to roughly 3lbs-3.5lbs.
 Price $15

 I will Remove the Factory 5lb Trigger Spring and Replace it with a 6lb Trigger Spring. Why heavier here? The Trigger Spring actually assists the Trigger in Pull/Reset, a Heavier one will make for a Smoother pull and Smoother Reset.
 Price $5

 I will refinish your scratched/worn barrel by slightly sanding, degreasing and applying an even coat of Black DuraCoat DuraBake which is a heat treated form of Duracoat making it hard as nails once its heated.
 $15

 For any custom parts you would like installed, please let me know and I will give you a quote. I can install parts you bought or I can order them for you at a discounted rate and save you some money.

Two magazines, cleaning tools and original box. No papers.

I inherited this fine piece from a family member about 5 years ago.  I shoot it occasionally and have never had a problem with it.  Round count is unknown since I'm not the original owner.

If I understand CZ's manufacture date stamp, there is an oval to the rear of the ejection port with the number ""96"" inside of it.  That would make the manufacture date of this pistol 1996.  The experts out there can correct me if I'm wrong.

I will entertain reasonable offers and trades of same quality handguns.  I'm particularly attracted to Beretta 92, Seecamp .32ACP, Kahr MK9, Sig Sauer P938 and P238.

ZT 300BW BLACKWASH THE CLASSIC BEAST, NOW IN BLACKWASH Our flagship knife looks great in our new blackwashed finish. The 0300BW looks like it's been serving you for yearsâlike a battle-tested tool or a favorite pair of well-worn jeans. Blackwashing gives it an already-broken-in look. To make a blackwashed knife, knife components are Tungsten DLC (Diamond-like Carbon) coated, then tumbled to produce the distinctive ZT blackwash finish. The 0300BW has all the features you expect from your ZT: extremely solid construction, premium materials, and sophisticated ergonomics. The blade is built of tough S30V stainless steel blade designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The blackwashed finish provides a non-reflective surface and helps emphasize the lines of the blade. The 0300BW is equipped with SpeedSafe assisted opening making it easy to deploy its big, beefy bladeâjust pull back on the flipper. Believe us, with a blade this massive, SpeedSafe supplies an assist youâll appreciate. The 0300BWâs handle is 3-D machined G-10 in the front with a blackwashed 3D-machined titanium back. The titanium frame lock provides a secure blade lock up during use. With or without duty gloves, this enables a very firm grip. The solid grip enables a quick transition from forward to reverse grip time and again. Heavy jimping on the thumb ramp further enhances the grip. A 3/8-inch hex head pivot shaft nut makes field adjustments possible with minimal tools. ZT's Quad-mount pocketclip enables for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry. Made in the USA SpeedSafeÂ® assisted opening Titanium frame lock Quad-mount (tip-up/tip-down; left/right hand) pocketclip Steel: S30V, blackwashed finish Handle: 3D Machined G-10 front, titanium back with blackwashed finish Blade length: 3.75 in.

I had a friend who worked in guns locally look at it and he said it is in very good condition for an older gun.  It has 23.5 inch barrel, a heavy/bull barrel and a semi-bench stock.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Gun is unfired, I never found the time to take it out to go shooting. Only reason I am considering selling it is because I finished getting it together in mid-September and here we are in late February and it still has yet to have a single round fired. 

The lower receiver is a Delaware Machinery, the LPK is CMMG. It has a Magpul ACS-L stock and an MOE grip with punisher skull engraved. Both are in OD Green. It currently has a POF trigger with KNS Anti-rotation pins installed. 

The upper is a complete Palmetto upper, 20"" 1-8 twist hammer forged 410 stainless steel medium profile barrel. M4 barrel extension, rifle-length gas system with low profile gas block. 223 Wylde chamber, so it is great for shooting both 5.56 and 223 rem ammo. It has a YHM Phantom flash hider installed as well as a Midwest Industries SS Keymod 15"" free float handguard. 
The BCG and CH are PSA, PSA logo is laser engraved on the bolt carrier

Has 45 degree offset flip up sights and a Mueller 4.5-14x40 scope. Has target turrets and adjustable objective. 

I am offering a few options. I would prefer to sell everything as a package, and the best deal will be had buying everything as a packaged deal.

I have a lot of money invested into this rifle. (none of these prices include shipping or tax)

Lower- $80
LPK - $60
Buffer kit and magpul stock - $100
Engraved grip - $25
POF trigger/anti rotation pins - $180
PSA complete upper - $550
PSA BCG + CH - $100
YHM Flash Hider $30
Flip up sights $50
Mueller Scope - $180

I have over $1350 into this. Not expecting to get all of that back, but for a complete and unfired gun please do not thing you can rake me over the coals either. 

I am willing to consider cash or trade (with cash going either way depending on what the trade is worth, my cash prices are not the trade value, trade value must be close to what I have invested in the gun). 

I would like to get $1150 for everything as listed. 

For $1000 I will let the gun go without the scope. 

For $900 I will let the gun go without the scope and with a mil-spec fire control group. 

For $650 I will sell just the complete upper with BCG, CH and back up sights.

My asking prices on each setup are firm. I have a lot more money into this than I am asking, and they represent the most I am willing to lose on this investment. If I cannot get that value out of this setup I will gladly let it sit in the safe until the time comes that I can get out and make use of this rifle."

This ammo shoots clean, has sealed primers, and annealed case necks.

Reliability has been 100% with this ammo, but I shoot at an indoor range most of the time and they don't allow me to use this due to the steel core.  Because of that, I'm selling my remaining rounds at a cost of 50 cents each.  I can meet in Castle Rock or Parker most days.   I'll also provide copies of the factory lot testing showing 1 MOA accuracy. 

From ammunitiontogo.com: ""This is American Tactical Imports 5.56 Mil-Spec SS-109 62gr. Penetrator Ammo. This ammo is manufactured by MKE in Turkey. MKE is a state of the art ammunition factory, that is NATO approved. They provide ammunition to the Turkish military and exports ammunition to over 40 other countries for military use. This ammo is approved by the U.S. Department of Defense as an accepted ammunition for our military. This ammo is brass cased, boxer primed and non-corrosive. This ammo has a sealed primer and an annealed case neck to meet NATO spec's. This is excellent ammo and each lot is tested at the factory to meet a less than 1"" MOA at 100 yards.""

I will also trade for an H&K VP9 plus 200.00 cash my way, or an H&K VP9 LE with 100.00 cash my way. Can get you pics later after work, but both are in great shape. Email,"
