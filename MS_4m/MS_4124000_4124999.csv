Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Features: 

Suppressor-ready muzzle brake. Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. Accepts M1913 accessory rails. Thermal cheek guard. Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail. Model:M107A1 Caliber:.50 BMG Operation:Semi-Automatic Rifling Twist:1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm) Magazine Capacity:10 Rounds"

This is a one time deal. All of these are brand new rifles, never opened, never loaded, never fired, never transferred, but each one has a tiny white spot on top of its black alloy forend. Named Model on this Colt HBAR Elite 6720 rifle is simply, CAR-A3 HBAR Elite. Producer is Colt Manufacturing Company of Hartford, CT. Manufacture date was June 2014, because some of the rifles come with their original pallet labels. Construction is stainless steel barrel, with steel bolt, trigger, and internal parts assembled into lightweight alloy upper and lower receivers. Caliber is .223 Remington and 5.56x45 NATO interchangeably. It comes with a 20 inch stainless heavy barrel that is completely free-floating, except for the gas mechanism. Forend is ported alloy, as the photos show, with a 32 slot picatinny rail atop. Buttstock and pistol grip are factory issue mag-pul with folding trapdoor butt plate. Outside diameter on the photo specimen measured .730 at the muzzle, .745 at the gas port, and .945 behind the gas port. Bore is right hand six groove 1:9 twist, and this rifle will perform with exceptional accuracy with any bullet weight. Trigger is .290 Stainless National Match two stage. Photo specimen pulled at 5 1/4 pounds with negligible felt creep. Weight empty is 9 pounds; and the conventional raised military sight system is completely gone, in favor of a 13 slot Picatinny rail upper that accepts any standard Weaver type mounting devices. Colt has included their factory #W2975, alloy body scope mount like the one in the factory photo we have attached. This AR comes with one factory nine round magazine, and it will accept any conventional M-16 type magazines. We will be happy to sub a factory 20 or 30 round magazine for the 9 rounder, for buyers who reside in jurisdictions where those are legal. Each rifle comes in its original factory box with manual, cable lock and scope mount.  Replacement price on this rifle, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $2,000 in our area. Its most recent wholesale price was over $1300. We're offering the HBAR 6720 in the photo, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 939.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Orders and not Credit Card.

There is no box since this one was custom built, I'm just getting away from glocks.  I was going to use this one as a carry gun but can't give up the Sig P938.  The Timberwolf frame is night and day above what a glock from the factory and even a stippled glock feel like.  It currently has the flat backstrap in it which is great for small hands.  The other backstrap will be included and also the allen wrench and instructions for the adjustable trigger.  There are three factory Glock magazines included with it.  IT HAS NOT BEEN FIRED so please be aware that the trigger screw may need to be adjusted.  The striker drops and functions tests just fine but the overtravel stop allen hasn't been set.  These frames alone are $333 a piece when they are in stock, the compacts usually don't last long on the website."

The rifling is in immaculate shape, I'd say. I have put right around 150 - 200 downrange without malfunction (I am aware that is not really a lot, just what i have managed to do in the last several months). The worst wear on the gun as a whole is on the extractor / loaded chamber indicator.

Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches along with a forward-mounted steel bipod.

Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.

The stock in pre-accustock but the action is built with the accutrigger and the pull weight is very low. The magazine is hinged trap door style and hold 2 rounds.  300 WSM are fat rounds.  I bought this new in 2008 and have hunted with it intermittently.  I'd estimate 75 rounds have been cycled through so the rifling is like new.  The mounts are basic Weaver.  There is nothing wrong with this weapon and it's very accurate.  I'm told Accustocks are better but off a bench this gun and scope combo will shoot 1/2""cloverleafs with factory ammo.  I'm selling to simplify my gun holdings.  I still hunt but have too many different chamberings and am trying to get things down to the basic calibers I use most.   It's truly a fine weapon and very hard hitting to 300 yards.  If you're disciplined and neck shoot your deer, it's superb; no tracking required...
The pictured sling is not included.  For 75.00 more I'll add the scope. It's a cheaper, but older and decent Center Point 4-16x40.  It's much nicer than the ones currently sold at Walmart and has held zero flawlessly.  The reticle is lighted mil-dot and adjustable to either green or red.  So 425 for the gun with base or 500 for the mounted scope with rifle.   
I would like to deal locally and will accept cash from another Ohio resident.  You will need to show me your drivers licence or CCW to deal with me.  Shipping is an option, but at the buyer expense and only to an FFL with USPS M.O. payment.    Feel free to contact me with questions. And the only trade I'd take would be for an older Marlin 336 in 35 Rem.  Thanks"

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users. Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components"

The M107A1's titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with this quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor. 

The QDL features its own two-port muzzle brake, which reduces the recoil. It’s been tested and approved for short barrel (20 inch) CQ use. This outstanding suppressor is made of dual layered tube construction of specially heat treated high-strength alloys and redundant 360 degree spot welding. 

The suppressor attaches by sliding over the muzzle brake, which guides it directly to the indexing point. The QDL mounts using a Quick Detach 1/4 Turn Lock Ring.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor. 

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. 

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability. 

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side. 

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. 

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.  While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.  Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.  In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

Here is some info on it:
The bolt action Model 40/45 was produced from 1928 until 1940.  Chamberings included the popular .250 Savage, .300 Savage, .30-30 Winchester, and .30-06 Springfield, a lineup that covered most American big game hunting.  Approximately 18,000 of these rifles were produced, but only 6,000 of these were the fancier Model 45.  This accounts for the fact that one can go years without seeing a Model 45 on a used gun rack.  Just as obscure is a knowledge of the nature of the rifle’s action, its quality, and how well it worked.  We will shed some light on that here.   -http://ataleoftwothirties.com/?p=472

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees. We charge $30.00 to ship this firearm UPS to the lower 48. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii.

While the rifle is at the 16” legal limit, the ISR’s integrated suppressor will require an NFA tax stamp.   This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.
Using the tool provided, the ISR’s baffle core is removable for cleaning.  With the inclusion of the Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, it provides the shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  This rifle can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the end user to customize the rail set up."

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees. We charge $30.00 to ship this firearm UPS to the lower 48. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii.

I have since secured the ""correct"" stock for mine, and this stock truly should go to someone who is restoring a Garand.   The stock with this EMcF cartouche was used on Garands between 700,000 and 1,990,000 - June 42 to October 43.  This stock does NOT have the smaller crossed cannons cartouche on the grip bottom, which would put it toward the latter half of that serial number range.  Stock metal included.

Overall great condition for the age of this stock.  The left side exhibits some dented areas which would likely steam up/out to a large degree.  There appears to be some tiger striping of the walnut, which would likely really be beautiful with some minor cleaning and oiling.  I have NOT touched the stock - felt it would be better to allow the new owner to enjoy the restoration effort as they deemed appropriate.

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card. Please add 3% for credit card fees. We charge $30.00 to ship this firearm UPS to the lower 48. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii.

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card.

Notice to those Commenting on the Armor Piercing Ammunition Exemption Framework

Thank you for your interest in ATF's proposed framework for determining whether certain projectiles are “primarily intended for sporting purposes” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(17)(C). The informal comment period will close on Monday, March 16, 2015. ATF has already received more than 80,000 comments, which will be made publicly available as soon as practicable. 

Although ATF endeavored to create a proposal that reflected a good faith interpretation of the law and balanced the interests of law enforcement, industry, and sportsmen, the vast majority of the comments received to date are critical of the framework, and include issues that deserve further study. Accordingly, ATF will not at this time seek to issue a final framework. After the close of the comment period, ATF will process the comments received, further evaluate the issues raised therein, and provide additional open and transparent process (for example, through additional proposals and opportunities for comment) before proceeding with any framework."

This is a package deal. Black version of the governor with front night sight, factory case/paperwork. It runs great, and shoots surprisingly accurate with ACP, 45 Colt, and the 410 shells are just too much fun (have a read about the Federal Premium 000 buck load through these, impressive). 

Anyway; revolver, Desantis speed scabbard holster, 8 1/2 boxes of the 000 Federal Premium 410 ammo, 480+ rounds of 45 ACP (most of a box of Win Ranger bonded stuff in there). 25+ moon clips for shooting ACP and a very handy demooner tool. 

I don't want to think about retail prices on all this stuff. I'd sell the package for $800. Do the math on the ammo/revolver/extras and you'll get the idea...bunch of money was spent here. 

I am NOT interested in breaking this up without buyers for everything.
