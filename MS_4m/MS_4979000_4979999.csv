This has not been modified to accept P-Mags and still has the factory gasket that fits NATO style metal mags only. It also has the original factory foregrip, no tri-rail.

  >>ACE ARFX Skeleton Stock
  >>Foam tube
  >>Recoil pad
  >>Buffer tube
  >>Buffer spring
  >>Buffer weight
  >>Instructions

Please note: This stock is sold new without a buffer tube.  It is designed to be used with your existing A2 buffer tube. I am including the buffer tube which is already installed on the stock.  Installation on your rifle will entail the following: Remove one bolt which allows the buffer tube to rotate and slide free of the frame. Compress the foam tube and slide the buffer tube out of the stock enough to allow it to be threaded onto your rifle.  After tightening the buffer tube you can slide the stock up to the gun and replace the bolt. The last step is to stretch the foam back out to cover the tube. It's about a 10 minute project."

Upper is made by Hardened Arms, lower is from Anderson.  Outfitted with a brand new, unfired, unused full-auto BCG for your shooting pleasure.

Has approximately 30 rounds down the pipe--shoots Barnes ammo highly accurately (I shot it at 50 yards and was less than 1MOA).  This would be deadly on deer out to about 200 yards with the right load (the Barnes 110gr ammo would be a good load).

Set up for legal shooting--the BATF ruled you can't use the Sig Brace to shoulder your weapon; this utilizes the CAA Saddle set up on two foam buffer tube covers (gives you two storage tubes to boot).  Comes with a set of 45 degree offset iron sights.

Comes complete with: a new Blackhawk single-point sling; FDE Magpul trigger guard; angled fore grip (vertical grips are not legal on pistols); FDE rail covers; and a new ergonomic grip.

Just add a magazine and your favorite optic and start shooting!

Face-to-face sales preferred; will ship to an FFL of your choice for an additional $50.  Must be willing to show a copy of your concealed carry permit.  No Sunday sales.  Cash only.

If you feel I'm off in my pricing and you want it, feel free to make an offer."

Color: all black, naked style

Bought this bike long ago as a project but lost interest. It cranks and work last summer, but been sitting in the shed for months. 

Pros: It's not fancy, but it runs and have enough power to give you a taste of liter bike. You can practice riding and drop the bike; it won't break your heart. Bike have all original parts, lights, wires...ect. 

Cons: It is old and doesn't have all the fairings. It currently not running, but I have the video of me jump start it couple months back to show you that the engine still cranks. 
NO TITLE. will give VIN for inspect. No lost or theft. 

Price negotiable, but please be reasonable. Cash is king."

I have a really nice Ruger Alaskan .454 Casull revolver. This gun is in excellent shape. This is definitely a hard find. Its hard to come across. This is a hand cannon, no questions asked lol. Its a fun gun but doesnt see much range time at all so here it is. It comes with the original Ruger hard case, soft carrying case, 25 empty cases, 17 300gr XTP Hornady bullets for reloading, 20 rounds of .45 Colt, 20 rounds of .454 240grain, 19 rounds of .454 300grain, 40 rounds of .454 260grain, 30 .454 300grain reloads (reload case not included.)
