This was my grandfather's deer hunting rifle, and it was passed down to me. He and I are the only 2 people ever to fire it. There are a few nicks in the wood, and it has been in storage for a while, and could use a cleaning. It hasn't been fired since the late 1990s. It has been used to killed many deer, and is a fantastic rifle, but it's time for it to find a new home.

I am asking $480, a more than fair price for this quality rifle. I've seen the same rifle for sale at much higher prices.

NO disclaimers. if you want the very best and very rare, this is it. Out of my collection, this is probably one of my favorite double action revolvers. This is an absolutely perfect, N.I.B. Bright Stainless .45 long Colt in unheard of condition. PLEASE, PLEASE, look very closely for drag/turn lines. This was very hard to photograph. Box is in great shape, but not as good as gun. I have many, many double action revolvers just like this that i will be listing only on Gunbroker. This gun was purchased, taken out of box and then wrapped in cloth and put in safe. 3 day from date of receipt return. No return if scratched, shot, disassembled etc. payment by USPS money order or cashiers check. shipped from ffl. to ffl. Do not bid if not legal to own. No money back if you cannot take possession. I have received many inquiries and absoloute statements, referring to the fact that this firearm is a fake, because it was a non cataloged .45 made by colt. please check wikipedia, i am including their quote, to hopefully inform and update collectors regarding the veracity of this anaconda. the colt archives department told me , ""no anaconda was ever made in bright stainless"". we all know that over 1,000 of these were made and refered to as the first edition, furthermore, the custom shop often produced uncataloged items. please see photos of box. according to one source, ""only 8-10 anacondas were made in 4"" barrel, .45 colt in bright stainless"". considering that this firearm came out of a 200+ colt double action revolver collction, including multiple python's [2 1/2"" in royal blue as well as blue, 4"" nickel, 4"" bright stainless, 3"" california with letter, 3"" from hartford, too many 6"" and 8"" to list], diamonbacks in every caliber {.38 and .22} and finish, boas, snake eyes, cobras, anacondas, including legacy, and on and on, it would seem that the collection was very legitimate. IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE OWNING AN UN-CATALOGED ITEM, OR NEED A LETTER PLEASE DO NOT BID. WIKIPEDIA QUOTE, ""Kodiak[edit] Introduced in 1993, the Kodiak was similar to the Anaconda in that it was constructed entirely of stainless steel, but offered the additional features of a recoil-reducing factory magna-ported barrel and unfluted cylinder.[4] There were 2000 Kodiaks made as a special run of Anacondas, breaking away from their long history of naming revolvers after snakes.[4] A special run of 1000 King Cobras was made about the same time, having the same Magna-Ported barrel and unfluted cylinder and were called the Grizzly.[4] There was an uncataloged 5"" barrel version of the Anaconda, with reportedly less than 150 made. These 5"" versions command very high prices when they are encountered. Additionally, Colt made an extremely low number of 4"" barrel Anacondas chambered in .45 Colt. This ultra-rare variation commands a premium price when encountered as well."" THANK YOU FOR LOOKING. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER GUNBROKER AUCTIONS FOR MORE UNIQUE GUNS."

Please don't pay scalper and gouger prices for 5.56 ammo. There is no ban, there was no ban and it's highly unlikely there ever will be a ban. By paying these hugely and ridiculously inflated prices, you play right into the hands of the greedy, fear mongering individuals who seek nothing more than to make a quick buck from a perceived national crisis.The despicable dealers and want to be dealers guilty of perpetrating this betrayal of the public trust will get theirs in the end. Everyone just calm down and take a breath, and before you know it the shelves will be full of reasonably priced ammo again. Thanks for taking the time to read this and stay safe out there.

	Hey all,
I have available for trade/sale a used but great condition Bi-Tone Springfield XD-45. I just picked this up on trade It is in great condition with on a ding on the front sight and some blueing wear on that barrel. This also comes with a never worn Uncle Mikes paddle/belt holster and two magazines. I also have defense/target ammo i could include for extra. This gun is still nice and tight and would be a great piece for anyone wanting a reliable and quality piece. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this due to my schedule. 
	Mainly looking for cash, but would consider trades if they happen to peak my interest. I can add ammo or cash for certain trades, but some trades will need boot on your end. I am somewhat open to trades, but no 22, BP, or non-gun items (unless it is for a large LED TV heavily in my favor, that i would consider. Im a guy, sue me. haha.) would like another M9, 92fs, or ATI clone if possible. Would also consider a pair of Tokarev pistols and boot. Would consider a GP100 4 inch stainless (or blued if it really clicks with me). A Ruger Security Six 4 inch. A Kel Tec PMR30. Possibly a Glock 20sf or ""maybe"" a 20c or regular. Honestly, shoot me a message, worst I can say is no. 

If you have any questions or anything shoot me a message at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting

Most is rings and chains. All  but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold.  The marks are correct.  Here's a list of what I have.....

10k gold: 1.155 grams
12k gold: 16.700 grams
14k gold: 85.810 grams
16k gold: 4 grams

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.)

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16

Total market value: $2309.77

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and ell it outright. 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. Then the price will go up since it will be in a pure gold bar.

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment. As for specifics.....

Purchased with an idea in mind and never made it around to finish the project. Never shot a single round from it, actually, never even loaded it. 

The lower was custom built by Anderson and the upper came from KG. Overall barrel length is 7.5 inches. Comes with a factory installed aluminum key-mod rail w/ picatinny rail adapters and hardware. The pistol is fully functional (with BCG and CH included). Also comes with a 30 round magazine and single point bungee style sling for easier carrying. This is pistol, no different than a handgun. NO tax stamp is needed to own, use, or carry (yes, it can be carried as a CCW pistol if you wish).

Price is $750. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 21 with a VALID OH ID. CCW (like myself) preferred. Thanks for looking."

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

I have for sale military surplus .50 ammocans for sale. They are Condition: Grade 2/Very Good (Grade 1 is new).

These GENUINE military cans have many uses including storage, geocaching, tool boxes, prepping, and of course, they can be used to store your ammo. They have a rubber seal on the lid that makes them virtually air tight and highly water resistant. This can also makes a great camera box on float trips. 50 cal. cans measure 11"" x 5-1/2"" x 7"".

Don't be fooled by those new ammocans sold at Gander Mountain, Fleet Farm, Cabelas, Walmart, etc. Those ammocans are NOT considered MILSPEC and do not have the same gasket and sealing mechanism as the military models do.

Priced as follows:

$12 each if paid in cash.
$12.55 each if paid via Paypal.

Buy just one or one hundred. I'll likely have as many as you'll need.

Please help me lighten my load. I'm moving and no longer own a 1911 thus, no longer need 45acp ammo. 
This lot contains one (1) box of Federal 45 auto, 250 rounds. Bought for $109 several years ago, I am selling for $90. Cheaper than you can buy retail. 
Unopened and stored properly in a dehumidified, climate-controlled room. Local only, I'm not going to ship this bowling ball. Have a great day."

It is a BYF code 44 rifle with excellent blueing and a sharp and shiny bore. The numbers I see on it are all matching and the receiver and bolt match, but from what I have researched the later war mausers were stamped less than earlier models. There is slight wear on the extractor but no pitting or rust. No import marks on this rifle either."

We specialize in S&W Gen 2 and 3 finishes and can accurately match the factory finish.  Our service is for any stainless firearm or stainless part of any kind you may wish to restore to like new condition.  We also refinish stainless rifle parts and barrels depending on length.

We offer satin finish, matte/frosted finish and brushed finishes (requires hand working) for both pistols and revolvers.  We do not offer polishing of bright parts.

The auction price is to refinish one pistol slide, pistol frame, pistol barrel or similar small stainless part.  Price does not include hand working for a brushed finish or to eliminate cuts, scratches, agency markings or gouges.  Parts need to be delivered ""detail stripped"" as we do not offer gunsmith or dis-assembly services. Ask your local gunsmith for assistance if you are unable to detail strip your part.  

Price for pistol frame/slide/barrel combination is $70 and includes small parts such as slide release, safety levers and other small parts.

Due to the low volume for our service, we only schedule on the first and fifteenth of the month.

Since each job is different, email us with your expectations as to the style of finish you require.

Slides and non-FFL parts may be shipped direct.  Frames and receivers must be shipped to our FFL.

Return shipping is actual USPS postage plus $10 FFL handling fee when an FFL transfer is required.  You can check return shipping by verifying the size ""Flat Rate"" box your part will fit or call us for a quote.  Add for insurance over the standard USPS $50.00.

We offer an FFL/Gunsmith discount."
