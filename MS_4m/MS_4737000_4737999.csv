This case is in 'like new' shape. I used it a handful of times to transport the gun to Sporting Clays tournaments. As a general rule, I shot my 12ga for Sporting Clays, so this case didn't get used - to speak of.

   I have been back and forth for a few weeks debating on if i wanna get rid of my second ar. And i think ive finally made up my mind.
   
   I have a Doublestar Ar-15, this gun has been very reliable, and a great rifle to me. But i have the exact same gun jus less of a tactical mode. And theres really no reason for 2 considering i just shoot target for fun and etc. So here goes...

   This Ar has the original box from factory and a couple extras things i can either leave on it, or take off depending on what your offer is, i also have more ammo and magazines available if needed.

-3 30 round metal magazines & 1 20 round plastic magazine 
-110 rounds of tulammo (all 4 magazines full)
-brand new vortex strike fire 2 red/green dot sight with nice mount included and box and paperwork. (has been mounted and bore sighted but never seen day light)
-flip up/down bipod system (6""-12"" i believe)
-g.p.s grip/bipod system
-mag well grip
-utg quad rail
-nothing fancy but nice and very bright flashlight
-6 position collapsible stock
-also has a low profile gas block installed and ready to roll
-foam pad 2 gun carrying case

   The Ar is in pretty good shape, not been abused or mistreated (cleaned thoroughly after every time out shooting) all though its not brand new or show room condition. 

  Looking for a very few things if traded such as : 
Remington 700 (.223/5.56/.308), possibly other make/model bolt action rifles,other ar rifle platforms, ar pistols, possibly ak depending on the brand,  nice pistols (sig, colt, maybe a few others ive forgotten), possibly trade to multiple guns, but throw me a offer worst i can say is no.

  Cash is king but will consider offers. Asking cash (depending on what all you want) 900 obo 
Trades around (again depending on wht all you want) $1100.

http://www.griffinarmament.com/Griffin-Armament-QD-Blast-Shield-p/gaqdbs.htm

The QD Blast Shield was designed to offer significant concussion reduction for the end user and other team members operating in the immediate vicinity. Often team members in CQB environments experience concussion from muzzle blast that is not only deafeningly loud, but also can cause prolonged headaches that can last for days afterwards. 

Especially effective on short barrels, the unique design of the QD Blast Shield directs concussive force forward allowing an end user to rapidly reconfigure muzzle device function. Ultra strong 17-4PH stainless steel provides a robust material to withstand intense use and full auto fire without fear of failure. Fluted geometry in the triangular shield lightens the unit while providing internal front supports for the muzzle device. 

Melonite QPQ surface treatment provides an extremely hard, durable, and attractive finish.

The QD mechanism is fast, positive, and free of wear prone geometry commonly found in ratcheting devices. The QD Blast Shield also comes with a shim set and overtravel stop to refit your A2 compensator for optimal use. 

The Griffin QD Blast Shield is compatible with our line of SDQD mounts in 7.62 and 5.56mm, Including the Flash Comp, Muzzle Brake, Compensating Flash Hider, and Tactical Compensator. It is also compatible with A2 Compensators that fall within the NATO spec blueprinted dimensions. Although many companies manufacture A2 style compensators not all of them are dimensioned properly. Not Compatible with BCM, BCE or PWS muzzle devices. 

Griffin Armament has continued to pursue product development that will enhance hearing safety in tactical and shooting sport situations. The QD Blast Shield is a great product for those that would like to reduce the concussion of their muzzle devices."

(the stainless models are super hard to find) Stainless Marlin X7 in 7mm-08 (great caliber! falls between a .243 and a .308) Bought brand new a year ago and have put maybe 10-12 rounds through it. (I've gotten a 1.5 inch group so far with cheap hunting ammo and could prob get it more dialed in with time and quality ammo) Includes a 3x9-40 Vortex Diamondback scope (this is a great scope!) that I bought new and had installed @ Cabelas. This rifle feels on par with $800-$1000 Remingtons and Savages. I'm only selling to fund a .243 youth rifle for my son's first year of hunting. I'd only be interested in trading for a like condition youth .243 bolt action rifle. $550. Thanks for looking and please let me know if you have any questions.

DPMS GII G2 .308 / 7.62NATO AR-10 Rifle SuperKit Description

Revolutionary improvements make the GII the most reliable, longest lasting MSR platform on the market. Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions.

THE RESULT: THE MOST CONSISTENT, EFFICIENT, AND RELIABLE EXTRACTION AND EJECTION PATTERN OF ANY MSR!!

LIGHTER AND MORE RELIABLE THAN EVER.

THE RIFLE SIMPLY FEELS BETTER WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.

FORGED UPPER & LOWER RECEIVERS

Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.

Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.

REDUCED WEIGHT, YET LIGHTER RECOIL

Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.

REDUCED MASS, FORGED, MONOLITHIC BOLT CARRIERWITH FORWARD ASSIST

New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension.

BEVELED MAG WELL

The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes.

IMPROVED BOLT & BARREL EXTENSION

An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength.

It was basically the last of the ‘recoil operated’ semi-automatic shotguns. It is very different, with its unique Gold Trigger and ‘MOHAWK 48’ marked on the left side of receiver, and is hard to find. It was followed by the model 58, the first Remington ‘gas operated’ semi-auto shotguns; it was NOT successful. It was quickly replaced by the well-known, and successful, Model 1100 ! It is still VERY ‘Useable / Hunt-able’... the ‘recoil operated’ shotguns ( like the BROWNING A-5) just have a ‘little’ more recoil ! If you have a problem with a 12 Gauge... buy a 20 Gauge!

DPMS GII G2 .308 / 7.62NATO AR-10 Rifle SuperKit Description

Revolutionary improvements make the GII the most reliable, longest lasting MSR platform on the market. Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions.

THE RESULT: THE MOST CONSISTENT, EFFICIENT, AND RELIABLE EXTRACTION AND EJECTION PATTERN OF ANY MSR!!

LIGHTER AND MORE RELIABLE THAN EVER.

THE RIFLE SIMPLY FEELS BETTER WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.

FORGED UPPER & LOWER RECEIVERS

Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.

Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.

REDUCED WEIGHT, YET LIGHTER RECOIL

Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.

REDUCED MASS, FORGED, MONOLITHIC BOLT CARRIERWITH FORWARD ASSIST

New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension.

BEVELED MAG WELL

The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes.

IMPROVED BOLT & BARREL EXTENSION

An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength.

The QD Blast Shield was designed to offer significant concussion reduction for the end user and other team members operating in the immediate vicinity. Often team members in CQB environments experience concussion from muzzle blast that is not only deafeningly loud, but also can cause prolonged headaches that can last for days afterwards.

Especially effective on short barrels, the unique design of the QD Blast Shield directs concussive force forward while triangular gas flow pockets allow the muzzle device to retain it's specific performance goals. Ultra strong 17-4PH stainless steel provides a robust material to withstand intense use and full auto fire without fear of failure. Fluted geometry in the triangular shield lightens the unit while providing internal front supports for the muzzle device.

Melonite QPQ surface treatment provides an extremely hard, durable, and attractive finish.

The QD mechanism is fast, positive, and free of wear prone geometry commonly found in ratcheting devices. The QD Blast Shield also comes with a shim set and overtravel stop to refit your A2 compensator for optimal use.

The Griffin QD Blast Shield is compatible with the entire Griffin Line of QD 5.56mm mounts, Including the Flash Comp, Muzzle Brake, Compensating Flash Hider, and Tactical Compensator. It is also compatible with A2 Compensators that fall within the NATO spec blueprinted dimensions. Although many companies manufacture A2 style compensators not all of them are dimensioned properly. Not Compatible with BCM, BCE or PWS muzzle devices.

Griffin Armament has continued to pursue product development that will enhance hearing safety in tactical and shooting sport situations. The QD Blast Shield is a great product for those that would like to reduce the concussion of their muzzle devices.

DPMS GII G2 .308 / 7.62NATO AR-10 Rifle SuperKit Description

Revolutionary improvements make the GII the most reliable, longest lasting MSR platform on the market. Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions.

THE RESULT: THE MOST CONSISTENT, EFFICIENT, AND RELIABLE EXTRACTION AND EJECTION PATTERN OF ANY MSR!!

LIGHTER AND MORE RELIABLE THAN EVER.

THE RIFLE SIMPLY FEELS BETTER WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.

FORGED UPPER & LOWER RECEIVERS

Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.

Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.

REDUCED WEIGHT, YET LIGHTER RECOIL

Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.

REDUCED MASS, FORGED, MONOLITHIC BOLT CARRIERWITH FORWARD ASSIST

New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension.

BEVELED MAG WELL

The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes.

IMPROVED BOLT & BARREL EXTENSION

An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength.

Let me know if you are interested in any of the following items:

1. (1) XL Shoei RF-800 Silver Helmet with new ""light smoked"" visor and also a clear visor.
- Helmet is used but very, very nice. If you normally wear a size L=maybe an XL, this helmet will probably fit you well. Shoei runs tight and I usually wear a L. This helmet its me perfect but you can try it on. Has great ventilation and has zero wind noise when visor is closed. $150.

2. (1) Pair of XL Joe Rocket Velocity Riding Gloves
-Gloves are like new and worn maybe 3 times. $20.

3. (1) XL Joe Rocket Atomic Motorcycle Jacket w/ Armor
-Worn exactly 1 time. It is a very cool jacket in the summer and keeps you warm in the winter. You are able to control the temperature with the vents. It has nice built in armor and it has great interior pockets for concealed carry. This thing looks great, it keeps you safe, and it keeps you comfortable. I didn't get around to using it because I only drove the bike I sold 5 miles to and from class.  $120

4. (1) XL Joe Rocket Riding Pants w/ Armor
- Worn maybe 2 times. Very comfortable, lots of vents, lots of nice pockets. It does have nice built-in armor so they are safe but also look very good. $100

5. (1) Fuel Helmet size Large (Black w/ clear visor)
-This helmet is a little more used and does show some scratches from being dropped (not while wearing). It is not dented and it does not look ""bad"", it just looks used. It is still perfectly useable and some black gloss touch up paint will make it like new. The visor is still in good shape as well. This helmet has impressive ventilation for a cheaper helmet. I had it for a spare or for a secondary rider. I will take $25 for it.

*more pics upon request.

If you want to take it all, I will take $350 for all of it (it comes out to $415 total). I may also make you a deal if you buy more than one item. $400 trade value on all of it together."

I AM WILLING TO TRADE THIS GUN +16 USGI MAGS + 350-400+ rounds of green tip 556 and a tad bit of 223 for your ak package 

Specs:
10.5"" barrel on a RRA's upper receiver. Yankee Hill low profile gas block. Full auto bolt, bcm gun fighter charging handle , RRA's parts and pieces. AAC quick suppressor attach flash suppressor, aluminum 45 degree flip up sights as well as primary flip up aluminum sights..2 fore grips, I made this gun to work exactly how ""I"" need it so that's why it has so much going on with it. It also has a dagger defense red dot that I really do not want to let go of but for the right deal then it's yours...the thing has so much stuff on it that its to the point of me not wanting to go into exact detail about all the ad ons but I will for anyone that's really serious about it. I can't remember the barrel manufacturer or rail, but the barrel was $150 if I remember correctly, and the rail was $100. I've got right around $650-$700 into the upper alone

And the lower specs are : 

Anderson lower with PSA parts kit rock river 2 stage trigger phase 5 buffer tube and (green) heavy buffer spring phase 5 ""w"" shaped trigger guard magpul grip heavier utg h3 buffer magpul grip ambi safety selector rhino magwell grip as well as a few other things that I can't remember atm 

this thing is a beast it shoots like a dream I only have a coue hundred rounds down the pipe. however it is not completely finished being put together, I have not installed the bolt catch nor the trigger guard because I did not have the proper punch set and I did not want to mess up the finish and that being said, it does not hold the bolt open on the last round. And the trigger is exposed 

I have about $1500 give or take into this and I'm just bored with this ar so just shoot me an offer and we can go from there I also have mags and ammo to add for the right trade"

Tried and true action that is the son of the great old M1 Garand, with a nice hard hitting 20 rounds of 7.62x51. I do like this rifle, but sadly need the money so I'm selling for the very low price of 950. This rifle has only had about 200 rounds down the pipe of brass cased ammo, and is in great condition. The stock is an original M14 stock with the original buttstock used on the select fire models. The stock itself has a few dings on it since it was surplus, but is still in great shape. It is synthetic but not wood or polymer, and the barreled action rests on solid steel bedding for extra stabilization. If you are needing some ammo, I have 220 rounds that can be negotiated with for .55 per round. I can be reached best by email, but also at REDACTED. Thanks!"

Firstly looking for a good price on AK mags. Would also be interested in Hungarian 20 round ""Tanker"" mags as well as drums. Not interested in trapco junk mags, or KCI mags. 

May also look at good prices for AR mags. Either USGI, Pmags, Lancers, or similar quality mags.

Technical Information:
Caliber: 40 S&W
Bullet Weight: 165 Grains
Bullet Style: Bonded PDX1 Jacketed Hollow Point

Winchester PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection."

Probably around $1100 or slightly more and I just bought it about a year and a half ago! 
Recently, I've found myself in a financial pinch and need some money, quick. So, I'm forced to let my baby go, for a 'quick sale' price.  
Here is a link to detailed photos of the gun (and everything included).
https://www.flickr.com/gp/135964081@N07/0069wB

$520, includes everything you in the pictures, except the bi-pod. The bi-pod is $40 if you have to have it.
Everything works as it should, actually better than it should. You can put one round of every kind of ammo, in the BX-25 clip and rapid fire every last one without a jam. This gun is very well maintained, correctly broken in and very clean. It has only had maybe 400-500 rounds through it. 
The safety/release and clip release levers are upgraded, as well as the charging lever/spring. The hammer and sear have been professionally tuned (trigger-job) and an upgraded trigger lever (with adjustable creep stop) added on. The stock is a Boyds, The barrel is a Fedderson (higher quality than most out there, USA made) .620"" bull barrel and is 16.1"" long. 
The scope mounts are specifically shaped for the Ruger 10/22 receiver and the scope is a Nikon (Prostaff) specifically designed to match the .22 rimfire ballistics. It's really fun to pull off a 200 yard shot with it using the 'bcd' marks, on the first try! No exaggeration! It's easy to put multiple rounds through the same tiny hole from a bench or take small game with one shot. Highly accurate and reliable gun/set-up. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I also, guarantee you will not find a better deal. Someone is going to walk away with a big smile and a better deal than I've ever got in my life! First come, first serve. NO OFFERS, CASH ONLY!

-if you have any questions feel free to ask before purchase, but ALL SALES ARE FINAL!!  But I will continue to try and hep you the b est I can after the sale, the reason why I'm selling is cause I had a Caregiver who was getting me into shooting and teaching m e properly as he was in the military and I  he said this gun was a FANTASTIC DEAL for $2,000(as a private sale wit everything that's included here)when we went to the Carson Gun Show.  He had let me shoot his Ar-15 the past 2 times we went shooting, but about 2 weeks after I bought this gun, including over a thousand dollars in different types of ammo and targets(including the one I mention below), my Caregiver puts n his two weeks notice, and since I got no one to teach me properly any more, I'd rather just sell everything and then buy it again in the future if the opportunity ever presents itself, cuz I was mostly looking for a handgun at the gun show anyways, not a rifle, but he said it was a deal too good to pass up.....so anyways, I'm knocking off $100 from what I bought it for OR BEST OFFER(OBO)......

The ONLY thing that has been done to the rifle, is that my caregiver took it apart for me, to show me how to properly clean and grease/oil a rifle.  So, it's as clean as a bell and thoroughly greased and oiled & ready for someone to take it to the range and empty mag after mag through it.....

I am asking $1000 cash, which I think is very fair. I will consider trades plus cash for a full size 9mm or .45 pistol, also interested in a Remington R700 tactical in .308 plus cash. A TRP realistically runs $1300-$1400 brand new, not the MSRP then street price is $400 less. You can check any Buds/Grabagun/Slickguns online and see for yourself, so I will not trade straight up for a Kimber/Sig or any other gun you can purchase for $800-$1000 new.

Ammo has been stored in my temperature controlled warehouse since the day I received it.

 There are 24 boxes in each case with 4 10 round stripper clips in each box.  The Stripper Clips make them perfect for the SKS but they are of course perfect for the Ak-47 as well. The ammo is 80's production but when opened will come out looking and performing just like the day it came off the line.  If will remain in perfect, reliable condition for decades to come.

The Ammo is Brass Case, Berdan Primed, Lead Core, and  Copper jacketed with absolutely no steel. Perfect for those unlucky enough to shoot at a range that prohibits ammo containing any steel. IT WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT ATTRACT A MAGNET NO MATTER HOW HARD THE RANGEMASTER TRIES.   

As a side benefit, if you have no use for the stripper clips, the Yugo clips  are easy to sell, lowering the actual price per round even further..

Price is very fair:  $330.00 for 1 case or $320 if you purchase at least 2. If you find it for less, including  shipping from an online retailer I will do my best to match the price.

I am in Olathe, KS and will be glad to meet just about anywhere in the KC area.  Feel free to call or text anytime.  If I can't take your call at the time, I will respond at the first opportunity, usually within 1/2 hour.

Looking to move it along for something else. 

It's had 10 shots through it in two sittings on sunny days, cleaned afterwards, and then just sat.  Has not been hunted with.  Condition is like new.  Synthetic stock, magazine, stock scope Bushnell 3-9x40 (plain reticle) on top.  Standard, detachable magazine is present.  Comes with the other half of the box and the fired brass.   Shoots and grouped well, last four shots were in an inch at a 100 yds with Federal soft points.  Sighted in dead on at 100 yards.

Questions previously asked of me:  

- Not part of the Remington trigger debacle (not that model and made since that issue was identified).  

- No failure to feed, fire, or extract.  

- The bolt has some wobble to it when pulled all the way back.  There is a bolt catch so it will not pull out but this rifle's action is not tight and slick like a more expensive firearm, but you're not paying for the tighter machining tolerances either.  That said, with the cleaning and oiling done to it, it does not grab/catch/bind and will continue to get smoother with cycling, care, and time.

My preference is to transfer at i-5 guns, I-5 exit 111, near Winco/Walmart.  That's an hour south of Seattle for those not familiar with Google Maps.  $20 transfer fee, buyer pays, and photo id with current address required.  I am over in Grays Harbor, up to Federal Way, Maple Valley/Covington, and Enumclaw areas occasionally depending on weekend plans.  I'll travel if it works into my plans (been stood up too many times in the past to do it on my dime and time).  

Fairly firm on price, trying to get my money back out of this purchase to fund something else.  Before contacting me with a low ball offer, I encourage you to look around on Armslist, and search the United States for Remington 770.  This is priced well below the average asking price for the firearm around the state and country and consider I'm already out 25% of my original cash outlay at my listed price.  Not looking for pity but will not take ""$150 and meet you in Marysville""."
