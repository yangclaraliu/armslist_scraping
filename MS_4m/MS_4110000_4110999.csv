I am asking a $100 firm. You will have to pay for shipping. If you you feel more comfortable using an online escrow account you pay the fee. She spun like a top every time I used it. I am selling it because I want something that has threads on the front.

If you look at the successful bids on Gunbroker.com, a rifle in this nice of condition would sell for $700, plus.

I prefer to sell to someone in Washington State so here's the deal.  If you live in Washington State, I will sell it for $600 (firm) and drive part way to meet you at a gun shop to do a face to face sale and transfer paperwork.  In other words, if you live on the west side I would meet you in Ellensburg.  If you live in Spokane, I would meet you in Ritzville.  If you live in the Tri-Cities or you drive to Kennewick to meet me, I will knock $50 off.

Included are three boxes of Hornady LeveRevolution 30-30 ammo.  At least a 75.00 value and it is almost impossible to find right now. 

The Serial No. is 223XXXX, which means it was manufactured in 1956.  It is one of the nicest original Pre-64 Model 94’s that you will ever find and it functions perfectly.  It is rust free and has nearly 100% of the original bluing.  It does not have any touch-up bluing- it is all original.  The stock, which has never been sanded or refinished, has only some faint scratches and dents.  All I have ever done to the stock is wipe on a little oil finish, as they can dry out over time.  The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on February 19, 2015.

The rifle has a Redfield peep sight and sling swivels.  In addition, I installed a new follower for the Hornady LeveRevolution bullets.  The original follower is included. 

I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at any gun shop.  If you pick it up in Kennewick, I prefer the Hole in the Wall gun shop on Deschutes.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  I checked and there is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the transfer occurs at a gun store.

Anyway, give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to see the rifle and purchase it.  I have 20 high resolution photos that I can email if you are interested.

Thanks for looking!

This isn't your typical antique wall hanger. I was shooting clays with it today.  It still has a tight, clean action and was well maintained internally. On the outside its age is slightly more prevalent however for a gun of its age i wouldnt say it's anything more than normal patina, some of the bluing even still in a shiny condition. The barrel is fixed full choke and is in good condition. The model 11 and browning A5 were built under the same patent for some years and a modifed version of these older beauties are still produced by browning today in the form of a technologically advanced highly priced $1200-1400 piece of art. However if you enjoy the platform and the history of these guns you can put your hands on one of these much cheaper model 11's for only $220.00 obo. I may even consider trades.

I also have a bottle that was open in late Janurary with around 20 rds of .308 used out of it. This in New powder stored inside out of the elements. I'm asking $25 dollars each for the upopen 2 lbs bottles and $20 dollars for the one just recently opened.. If you buy all three I'll sale all three bottles for $22 per bottle for all and guarantee all three are in 100% condition. All has been in control tempurture and humidity condition, OR will trade for VARGET and second choice would be Win 231 or HP-38 . Just don't  use win 748 any more prefer Varget, feeds better in my powder measure. Winchester 748 is very good for .223 and .308 loads.
 I'm located in Coats NC , which is between Raleigh and Fayetteville NC. Will drive short way to meet.

I'd also like an SKS. Nothing fancy, actually cheaper is better, especially if it's one that doesn't have some real military significance. If it's a Norinco made for civilians that's beat up that's fine. I'd like a project, but I don't like refinishing milsurp. 

I don't have much to trade, though I do have a few assorted rounds, some 12GA slugs, a few 300 Winchester Mag rounds, some.22LR, as well as two AR vertical grips, and an LED pistol light. Naturally I'd include cash, but I have some stuff I don't need, and I'd rather give it to someone who could use it, and work out a deal so they get some stuff they could use, and I save some cash. Saves me the trouble of selling some of this stuff.

Of course all laws must be obeyed, NJ FID card, and all that other happy horse-crap this stupid state makes us do."

But I think mine is a little above that. I bought this from pyramydair.com as a package with a Center Point 4-16X40 AO scope. Which has proved to be a good scope in which I done some scope cam through. This pellet gun was setup to be a hunter and includes sling mount studs. This gun is good for both right and left shooters. It has less then 1000 pellets through it. The Benjamin Marauder is extremely backyard friendly! I live in a very residential neighborhood and no one has complained. I have had two Marauders. The first one I had drove the dogs wild! But this one does not call them. But my cats comes running because she know it\'s a free meal for her. It\'s favorite pellet is H&N Crow Magnum. JSB\'s work well but make a larger hole. This comes with 1 magazines,1 Degasser tool. I will ship any where in the US for $30 standard post, and 2 day for $45.

This is the older all wood and steel model not the polymer one they make now. I picked this up in a recent trade and have not personally fired it but was assured by the friend I got it from that she's a good shooter. It has been modified with the selectable dual head hammer to choose which barrel to fire instead of what I have read was the problematic original selector. This can all be changed back with available parts found on line with some minor gunsmithing. I think the rear sight needs a little work as well but a new rear is only about $10 online. Lockup is tight and trigger pull feels good. Personally I have no use for it as I don't hunt with .410 much. Asking $200 or a partial cash/trade deal.

Enough of all the over priced ammo.  Stop with the constant patterns of trying to screw each other over.
 Even with the guns i see it daily. 
What happened to all the guys who use to make this fun and make deals and actually stick to the deal and keep their word like a man? 
 Now all we see is people wanting more more more.  Nobody is happy with just making a good honest trade or sell.  The only way a deal is made is if each person is making a huge ass profit which is impossible. 
 Ive seen it myself many times lately trying to make a deal.  Someone will have a gun listed for trade but not mention what they would trade for that way they can keep it like a auction.  I offer many guns worth the same value and all i ever get is 'no thanks' .  Has nothing to do with what the gun is it has to do with the fact they look up value on some stupid website and the value is to close to what they have so therefore they cant make a profit and say no thanks.  
 Your not ALWAYS going to come out on top if thats all you seem to care about. 
 Try making trades for guns that you may enjoy shooting and youd probably trade a lot faster instead of everyone using this to rip each other off.
  The cash value is 200 trade value is 700 crap is really stupid also.  Trading makes it worth more?????? How?  If i have the same gun youd say im overpriced  but when you have it its worth its weight in gold? 
 I have met several really nice honest guys on here but the majority of you are nothing more than smartass kids who spend to much time blogging about guns instead of actually shooting the guns.  
 90% of all guns for sale used i can buy new cheaper all day. 
 Chill out people and come back down to earth.

*****Remington .45 ACP Golden Saber 230 Grain Brass Jacketed Hollow Point Ammunition GS45APB - 25 Rounds per Box
At the heart of Golden Saber JHP is a high-performance hollow point bullet with a jacket made entirely of cartridge brass - not copper gilding metal. Thicker and stiffer than other bullet jackets, Golden Saber HPJ releases energy over a longer distance. And, unlike conventional hollow point bullets, the jacket is nose cut completely through, promoting controlled expansion to well over 1.5 times the bullet's original diameter. The nose cuts, configured in a new, patented spiral pattern, produce larger petals and reduce the nose cavity for optimized mush performance.

Made in the famous Molot plant in Russia this VEPR is chambered in .308 Winchester. This Semi Auto Rifle has a hammer forged chrome lined barrel. This rifle has been banned from import so there will be no more new imports from Russia. These are now VERY hard to find. This VEPR is built to the same standard as the RPK style machine guns. The VEPR is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. The VEPR in .308 Winchester features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 23” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with two 5rd magazines  a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit. I will also include a new 25rd mag. This VEPR has ALL RUSSIAN markings. This makes is much more unique.  Even the users manual is in Russian.

Make them sell it at a reasonable price or stick them with it. The reason is, they will be forced to sell it or get stuck with it. If the 855 ban goes through, it will be illegal to sell it after that date. That will keep them honest. We can be our own worst enemies if you give them an incentive. Also only 855 SS109 is the only round they are trying to ban, for now. These guys are contributing to the shortages and price hikes, that's Capitalism. Capitalism is also when prices drop because these FUDS and creeps have no incentive to buy into any surplus.
