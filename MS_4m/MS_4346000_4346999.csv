This particular one is based off their âHunter Seriesâ which is no longer offered. The Hunters were fitted with a DSA made bull barrel, this one in carbine length (16.25). The Hunter Series was made for accuracy. The bull barrel of the Hunters usually comes without a flasher hider but this one was custom fitted with one from DSA. The rifle also comes with a DSA Billet Heavy Duty dust cover with picatinny rail system replacing the stock steel cover; also fitted at the time of build. The stock charging handle was replaced with a Israeli style forward assist charging handle for field reliability. The forward assist allows for operator manual charging of a round in the case of partial charge that can happen with poor ammo and/or gas plug setting. A Buffer Technologies recoil buffer is also added.

This rifle has seen exactly 50rds during a single outing. It is mint. There are no scratches or marks. Storage was always in dry climate control room.

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It is the ultimate tactical style 22, it blows away the S&W MP15-22, and all others. If you are not familiar with these check out the link below. MSRP on it is $670 from Ruger and they are hard to come by. This one will hold its value and no 10/22 collection is complete without one. All factory built with standard 10/22 reliability inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis. Super accurate rifle, with a true free floated heavy barrel straight from Ruger. This is the better model with the threaded barrel and collapsable stock (not the California legal version). Also has Ruger brand flip-up sights. Never been fired, comes brand new in box with everything, and still in the plastic. Takes all 10/22 mags and even internal upgrades, because it has all standard 10/22 internal components. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for a high end handgun for it, but I will consider all offers for any other cool/interesting trades that you may have.

641,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4346641,"For Sale:  AR parts, everything you need to make your own. 5.56 300 blackout","St Augustine, Jacksonville, Florida",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, May 18, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here at Ancient City Munitions, we strive to have the best American made products at very reasonable prices. Sure you can buy cheap Chinese garbage for less money, but if you want great American made parts at great prices, we can help. We manufacture high quality AR rifles and pistols for the American people at great prices. Don't buy an off the shelf rifle made with the cheapest parts and a bunch of stuff on it you are just going to pay to replace later. Get a rifle made for you the way you want it the first time, or buy all the parts and build your own. We are currently opening a new shop in St Augustine with enough room for a classroom where you can come build your own rifle under the supervision of a licensed gunsmith. The parts that are made for us come from the same machine shops as all the other big name companies, we just don't charge the premium they do because they put their name on it. here are some of the major parts we offer:
Barrels cut just for us:
223/5.56
16""-$99
10.5""-$109
7.5""-$79
7.5"" SS-$99

We like to consider ourselves somewhat of a 300 AAC Blackout specialist. We also like silence, we run a lot of suppressors and what we found is that the 16"" 300 blackout doesn't like to cycle sub sonic ammunition reliably, so we came up with a new barrel. We developed a 16"" 300 blackout barrel with a pistol length gas system that has no problem cycling any 300 blackout ammunition.

We offer Cerekote services, price depends on what you want. Examples-
Glock Pistol single color-$120
AR upper, lower, and rail one color-$120
Custom designs and Camos available on request.

We have everything you need for your AR rilfle, dust cover, charging handle, forward assist, custom triggers, muzzle breaks, flash hiders, full line of Magpul accessories, grips, sights, gas tubes, gas blocks, ect...

We also manufacture our own line of custom ammunition. We do not make regular target ammo for 9mm, 40, 45, or 223. That stuff is just too cheap to buy from Walmart. I do have a company I deal with that does make that ammo and we do carry it. It is a little cheaper than the stuff at Walmart and they use much better components than the big companies trying to push out the cheapest stuff they can. We make a lot of AR caliber ammunition IE 300 Blackout subsonic and supersonic starting at $14 a box for Super and $20 a box for sub, we make .50 Beowulf ammunition, .458 SOCOM ammunition, and .380, 9mm, 40, 45, 50AE Hollow Point ammunition. If there is something specific you need, we can make a load just for you. 44 mag, 357 mag, 454 casull, 500 SW, 460 SW, and so on. Please realize it is not worth setting up the machines to run a custom caliber for anything less than 500 rounds. If it is something we stock it is no big deal.

I hope that we can be of service to our local community.

In 1912, the British started purchasing some 1911 pistols from Colt. With the outbreak of hostilities, it was decided to purchase additional pistols and by 1919 in excess of 17,000 had been delivered. Pistols in both .45 ACP and .455 Auto Mark I were obtained. The former were marked with a ""C"" serial number prefix while the latter had a ""W"" prefix. This 1911 serial # C-4649 caliber 45 acp was made is 1913 and a letter from the Colt archives states it was one of 20 pistols shipped to the London Armory Company on May 4, 1914. This was prior to the opening shots of the War which occurred on July 28, 1914. This pistol undoubtedly saw service in the hands of a British Officer during the Great War! The frame and slide have the British proofs. The over all finish is about 30% with the trigger, hammer, slide release and safety showing about 50% of the nitre blue finish. Barrel is marked HS on the lug and the letter P. Rifling is excellent! Grips are in good shape for a 101 year old War veteran. The magazine is a two tone correct punch and saw cut with lanyard loop. With the approaching anniversary of the start of the Great War July 28,1914 - November 11, 1918 this is your opportunity to own a piece of history. While it has not been researched yet it may be possible to discover which British Officer carried this pistol adding to the collectible and increasing the value! The Colt letter verifying the shipment information is included

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
