It is quite accurate and has been very dependable. I have only took this pistol shooting a couple of times and based on the person I traded this revolver for I believe that the revolver probably has less than three hundred rounds fired. I do not have a box. It will come with a tagua slide holster, an H&K speed loader and the leather carrier for that. There are all kinds of pictures of a Taurus 431 on line. Do some research you might find that this is one of the better Taurus's out there. Supposedly has a life time warranty - don't know never need it.  It shot very nice with a 200Gr XTP in front of 10.0 grs of HS6. I wanted a carry revolver that would approximate a 45 ACP and this met that requirement. Just picked up a 1917 so that niche has been filled.

The special edition scope provides an incredibly clear lens and bullet drop compensator reticle with 3-9x magnification.

The rifle is in excellent shape, and it's a tack driver. Which is unusual for a lever-action, but this was fabricated in the New Haven Marlin Firearms factory before the company struggled and eventually sold to Remington. When they produced this rifle, it was designed to set new standards in the lever action market, and that it did.

The tubular magazine holds 4 rounds +1. The barrel is 24"" long, and sports a clean sight picture with a wide hood. The action is smooth and fast - everything a lever should be.

This is a slick rifle that always gets comments of praise for it's appearance."

It is Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.Features:Caliber: 22 LR Capacity: 6Barrel Length: 4.75 Barrel Material: 1215 SteelCylinder Material: 12L14 SteelFinish: BluedFrame Material: Aluminum AlloyGrips: Cocobolo WoodAction: RevolverLand and Grooves: 6Land Width: .076Length of Twist: 1 turn in 14"" Right HandOverall Length: 10.035""Sights: Open Fixed Type; Notch at RearStyle: LR CYL Only FixedTrigger Pull: (Aprox) 6 lbsWeight Unloaded 33.4oz (Aprox)"

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I'll be picky and if the value is not there, I simply will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know where you are at.   

Trades considered:

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped is fine as I would replace any Mil-Spec FCG in the lowers.  Other parts like BCG, rails etc.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex(others?) 4-16x(mid level models) or greater power range, maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

From Ruger's website:
""The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."""

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the M1A™ SOCOM 16's unique design.

The M1A™ Socom 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the M1A™ SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.

If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the M1A™ SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the M1A™ SOCOM 16's unique design.

The M1A™ Socom 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the M1A™ SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s® forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the M1A™ SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.

If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the M1A™ SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™.

This gun was purchased brand new in around march of this year. Since then this rifle is lucky to have 40 rounds put through it. The gun has the large john wayne style loop on it but comes with the original small loop as well. Also comes installed with a scope mount on the reciever with scope rings. This rifle is the more expensive golden boy with the octagonal barrel. I have the original box and all the paper work as well. Included will be about 80 rounds of .44 magnum with the deal. This gun is extremely close to mint condition with just a few light scratches on the reciever barely noticeable what so ever. Please email me if you have any questions or offers. I'm mainly interested in even deals. I will not put cash out of my pocket so please don't ask. I will not ship this rifle either. Looking for local deals only, face to face."
