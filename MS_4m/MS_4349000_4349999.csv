It has a bbl 1:10"" twist, in a synthetic stock with hogue rubber grips. If u are not familiar with these rifles I would highly recommend researching them. They are the most accurate out-of-the-box rifles I've ever found. 
I own ventures in 22-250, .243, .270, 30-06, and .338 winmag. They all shoot eerily accurately. I reload and have fine tuned a 30-06 load w/ Win760, win brass & primers, with a Hornady Amax 178 gn bullet that shoots a consistent .33 MOA on a cold barrel from sandbags. The first venture I bought was a 30-06 and the cheapest box of federal 180 gn ammo I bought shot sub MOA. 
This rifle was for my brother in law but since he and my sister split up, he's not getting it for his birthday anymore. I paid 430 after taxes and such, but got a $75 rebate. All I want is what it cost me out of pocket. If u can get one cheaper than 350, please let me know as I'm looking for a 300 winmag this make and model.
The gun is still in the plastic, bolt is covered with packing grease. This rifle has a 3-round magazine and is interchangeable with other long action calibers, in case in the future u wanted a .270 or such.

I didn't include a picture but it looks like all the other blue barreled ventures. If u would like to see what it looks like with a scope or whatnot, I can send pics of my other rifles. And if u want to see a picture of the box and the plastic wrapped rifle I can send those as well. Thanks for reading my ad and I hope you have a great day."

It has a hidden hammer so it will not snag on anything in your pocket, purse (don't recommend this gun for a lil' lady), glove box or console.  Very safe to carry one in the chamber and handle it fairly roughly.  Finish is still very good on this gun.  These guns had a few sharp edges on the ramp and a few other areas, which I have smoothed/polished a little but no major customization done to the gun.  I heard there is an aftermarket spring which really makes an improvement on this gun.  I bought a newer magazine for this gun as the old one fell apart so I will include the other magazine as parts only.  There is at least 60 bucks worth of ammo coming along with it - some range ammo and some self defense rounds.  I am going down to my lowest price on this so please do not ask how much I'll really take.  No trades please, prefer CHL carriers but I will at least take a picture of your valid TX photo ID/license at the sale or you will not buy it.

Product Description
 The GI LTC is a big gun with a small price tag. Para's customers asked for a compact version of the GI Expert and here it is. They wanted it lightweight, so it comes with an alloy frame. They asked for custom extras like a beavertail grip safety, a competition trigger, and Para's fiber-optic front sight, so you get them all at a production price. Anodized steel slide with a nitride finish. 8 + 1 capacity.

Up for sale is a early 1968 Marlin 30-30 rifle in good condition. I personally have put 200 rounds down range with ease. Rifle has been cleaned after every trip. She is dead nuts accurate with 75 yards, never really pushed it any farther. Plenty of knock down power for you hunters. Plus the awesome lever action really makes this a fun rifle to shoot. But im in the market for a conceal carry pistol and sadly this must go. Entertaining all offers but cash is king."

The Model 39-2 with A began production in 1971 so this is an early 1970's gun maybe 1971.

The Smith & Wesson model 39-2 9m/m semi-auto was
introduced in 1954, in the traditional double-action configuration.
It had an alloy (anodized) frame, and a carbon steel slide, 8-shot
magazine, and a 4"" barrel. Since the prototype model 39-1 NEVER
existed, the sequence went from the original model 39 directly to
the model 39-2. It featured checkered walnut grips, a serrated
1/8"" front ramp sight; with a micrometer click adjustable rear
sight for windage-only. The hammer spur usually has a small
hole drilled in it, with a smooth fore strap and a stippled back
strap. S&W is stamped on the frames right side, 9mm CTG on
the extractor port; with later production models (after A160000) 
simply marked 9mm. Weighing just 27 oz unloaded, an
with a smooth trigger and magazine safety -
its my favorite of the 9m/m class. The last S&W model 39-2
(S/N A747148) was shipped on February 15, 1983; as regular
production ended it 1982."

The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.). The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.

Marked patent pending, so I assume its an early model. Heat shield/slide handle has a wiggle, maybe it was always like that. Bore looks great. Really cool looking gun, we did not shoot it, we don't usually test fire our used guns. Action, trigger & safety appear to work fine. Could use a cleaning, some crud around the screws. A small spot on the barrel shroud that may be surface rust."

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

This weapon is covered by the Taurus Life time repair warranty.  It follows the gun not the buyer.  It covers the inspection, repair, test firing, cleaning and return. Your only cost is sending to Taurus. No risk to any buyer.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

I have the original box and manual that will go with it. What you see in the pictures is exactly what I am selling: just the rifle, factory scope, and one factory 4 round magazine. The barrel is free floated and it's a flush magazine. It is not an Accutrigger rifle. The rifle has had almost 80 rounds through it.  I bought it for hunting, then basically used it for a little target shooting because I want something a little smaller. The Axis series are bargain rifles that just work, are reliable, and accurate for what they are, and that reflects my experience with this one.  I have a box of rounds that can go with it for a few dollars more.  I really am not interested in trades at all because I already made a commitment to buy a friends' .223.  Thank you for looking."

 in box 

The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

 Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Features 
•Polymer three-piece design with an interchangeable finger shelf that allows for a flat ""A1-style"" surface or an ""A2-style"" finger nub
•Mounts to MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny and NATO STANAG 4694 rails (min. of ~3"" recommended)

I started this pistol to be an Short Barreled Rifle (SBR).  In order to build and test it, prior to converting it to an SBR, I had to make it as a pistol.  Did that, tested it, and it worked just fine.  I made a few mods to the trigger, I just didn't like the way the 2 stage felt.  It was ""creeping"" and not crisp.  The mods made it crisp on the second stage.  I now do not have the time to finish this project, as I am working out of the country about 90% of the time.  My loss is your gain.  I am taking a huge loss on this, especially considering that it has maybe 100-120 rounds through it.

About the weapon..... CMMG MK-4 lower. Aero Precision upper. Daniel Defense 10.3"" Hammer Forged Government 5.56 SBR barrel (1:7 twist). Magpul hand guard with light rail side mounted for thumb activated light , INFORCE WMP 200 Lumens. It has a modified stock trigger, still 2 stage, but much better break when it fires. KNS Anti-rotation pins. Yankee Hill quick takedown pins. Rainier Arms AXTS charging handle. It has a ""knock off"" Noveske Flaming Pig flash thingie. I will also include 2 Magpul parts kits magazines (will not have floor panels), but, in a separate sale, I have Magpul floor panels avaialbe.  They just can't be sold together.

Features:

The milled gas block is located at a carbine length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface.

The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.

The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.

The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.
The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.

The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.
The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.

Includes one 10-round Magpul® PMAG® magazine."

Installed Tru Dot night sights makes an incredible gun even more awesome. 

Please note this is the black stainless version, which is great for concealment but also just plain looks awesome.   It comes with a 7 round extended mag as show in the photo, and the standard 6 round flush mag.   Note the 6 round mag has been tack welded on the bottom so it is impossible for the mag to come apart by accidentally hitting the little round button on the bottom of the mag.   I wanted 100% reliability.   Includes the factory hard case, and all factory provided manuals, flyers, parts list, etc.

Like our other magnum rifles, the TF Rifle features a blowback design. However, in order to help handle the increased pressure of the 17 HMR and 22 WMR rounds, the TF Rifle also utilizes a precision engineered and machined counterweight system attached to our CNC-machined steel bolt. This eliminates the need to use more expensive alloys in the bolt. The weight is located in front of the receiver and concealed in the stock.Our TF Rifle also includes the same TG2000 trigger unit – a Volquartsen exclusive – tuned to a crisp, clean 2.25lb trigger pull. The rifle sports a black matte coated stainless steel bull barrel.
