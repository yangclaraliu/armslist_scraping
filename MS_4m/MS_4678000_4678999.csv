Fully converted minus the forend, I actually like the extended Saiga style but I have a black polymer standard AK forend if you choose you can swap it with a clamp on style front retainer to go full original AK look.
Ultimak gas tube (holds zero perfectly, had a micro dot on it)
Threaded barrel in 14x1 LH with CNC Warrior brake/compensator

Let's do a quick value analysis here...
Saiga IZ132 7.62x39 rifle - $600 (shipped/FFL fee) or more if bought locally
Conversion kit - $180 (Carolina Shooters Supply, Conversion kit #6) **This is assuming you're able to do the conversion yourself not not pay a gunsmith, that would be another $150-$200**
Install bullet guide $50 (Gunsmith fee)
Thread the muzzle $90 (Gunsmith fee)
Ultimak $100
Extended Safety $65 (Krebs is the best I can compare)
Sling mounts $50 (if bought and not made)
Muzzle brake $30 (CNC Warrior, Knurled Compensator)
Vertical grip $15 (Magpul MVG)
Chinese surplus steel mags $25/ea = $100
You're looking over $1200 to recreate this rifle. Absolutely worth every penny as it's the best AK you can get. This is why I am NOT entertaining offers of $800 or less...sorry.

I want an AR-15 type rifle, but because I bought a Glock 19, 26 and 43(wifes) all in the last few months, my wife is not too thrilled at the thought of me buying another gun right now.

It has a rubber grip on it right now, but that can be removed. If anyone has an AR to trade, we can work out all those details then. I can add some cash for the right trade. Email me at REDACTED"

Excellent 3x adjustable prism scope but decided a longer range scope was more appropriate to my needs. Would highly recommend this or any other Vortex product, can't say enough good things about them, great glass, great price, and can't get a better warranty! Ever since purchasing Vortex optics I will never buy another brand. This product comes with a lifetime warranty (see website for more detail on that and the product). Price doesn't include shipping, would have to get a quote on that if you're not local. This is a rock bottom price, please don't bother with offers as it's a more than fair price all things considered.

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.Specifications:Item #: PI-43502-01UPC_Code: REDACTED33Description: GLK 43 9MM PST 6RD FSManufacturer: GlockModel #: 43Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Polished SteelStock: Tiffany Blue DuraCoated PolymerSights: FT: White Dot RR: White OutlineBarrel: 3.39""Overall Length: 6.26""Weight: 16.19 ozCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 6+1Action: Safe Action# of Mags: 2Packaging: Black Plastic CaseReceiver: Tiffany Blue DuraCoated Black PolymerWidth 1.02"

This weapon is flawless, better than new.  I have put less than 200 rounds through it.  Extreme High polish feed ramp and barrel.  The trigger has also been polished, this has the smoothest single action trigger pull, the double is still at the factory 10lbs so if you want to carry this with one in the pipe, it will feel more like a revolver for that first pull. Original box and paperwork included.

This gun has it all from Sig but that short reset trigger is the best!  It gives you amazingly fast follow up shots.  I also like the SIGLITE night sights, (always glowing) and the Hogue G10 grips will hold on to your hand as much as you hold on to them.  This is a must see, more pictures available.

I bought this from a guy who puts together rifles under the impression that I would like the AR-308 rifle but I still prefer my bolt 308. I have shot a handful of rounds through the rifle and would rather the simpler bolt action counterpart. I did have a failure to feed and fire due to a lack of gun lube. The rifle is in great condition with it being painted from the previous owner. There is a gouge in the finish on the upper but it only cosmetic. Here is a list of the parts.

---The RRA LAR-PDS Pistol is the first of a generation of firearms employing RRA's patent-pending Piston Driven System (PDS). Featuring a purpose-designed bolt carrier, an adjustable gas piston and an over-the-barrel spring and guide rod arrangement, the LAR-PDS is able to completely do away with the traditional recoil system associated with AR-style firearms, making for an extremely versatile weapon platform. The pistols feature an A2 flash hider and a muzzle threaded at .5-28, a folding, non-reciprocating ambidextrous charging handle, full-length top mounting rail, tri-rail handguard and the RRA two-stage trigger. The 9"" barrel is chrome moly with a 1:9"" twist."

In place of the rear iron site I have installed a piccantini rail which currently has a UTG Red/Green laser mil-dot scope that has so far proven very accurate out to 150yd. I'll throw in the wood stock with the internal box mag and rear sight with mounting pins as an extra for those purists out there. The old stock will require replacement barrel shroud rings to be reinstalled. Slight age/wear in bluing from bayonet attachment. No bayonet included. This is a super value as it was going to be my project scout/sniper rifle. Currently the barrel is still full length with no modifications to the factory crown and iron sight is still installed.

This is a wonderful carry pistol, incredibly accurate, and loaded with features.  Why am I selling it?  I want to buy something cheap I can tinker with and practice gunsmithing on.  This gun is too nice to be a 'learner' gunsmithing model.


I bought this 1911 pistol new in January and it has 900 rounds through it, with no cheap ammo.  The recoil spring was replaced at 800 rounds, per the manual.  Kimber has a 500 round break-in that I've already done properly so you save yourself the cost.  It comes with these additional items, including all factory items it originally came with as well: 10-8 Performance rear sight installed, comes with factory Kimber sight too. Hogue arched mainspring housing, comes with factory flat mainspring housing too. VZ Operator II grips - black, comes with factory rosewood grips too.

Additional work preformed by Kimber's Custom Shop for total reliability, I have the invoice for the work:  
Ream and polish barrel
Tune extractor
Modify ejection port
Polish feed ramp


Highlights:
*  Stainless steel slide and compact aluminum frame create a lightweight carry package that also resists the elements.
*  Match grade 4-inch bushingless bull barrel for unequaled Kimber accuracy.
*  Carry Melt treatment for rounded and blended edges that will not snag clothing and holsters.
*  Front strap checkering (30 lines per inch) ensures positive grip, regardless of conditions.
*  Self-illuminating Tritium night sights glow without batteries or charging, a low light tactical advantage

If so when you factory that in you will be paying almost $595 ($550*1.08250% = $595.375) at academy for the same gun sales tax included.   If you can get it cheaper sales tax included go for it. If you wish to argue, ""I can get it for a similar price"" from  a retailer and say you have not calculated sales tax you might be economically illiterates and I would point you to investopedia.com to help you correct that.
