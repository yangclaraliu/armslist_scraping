Purchasing a gun online is really very easy. There are only 3 simple steps: 1)	Find the gun you want. You pay us directly for the firearm. We accept credit/debit cards as well as certified funds. 2)	Choose your FFL (Federal Firearms License) dealer. We cannot ship a gun direct to you, we do ship to the local FFL dealer of your choosing. Any legitimate gun store or gun dealer has an FFL; pawn shops and collectors may also have one. 3)	Pick up your gun from your designated FFL. Here is how to arrange a shipment and transfer: 1)	Find a Licensed FFL dealer in your area. 2)	Contact the dealer and let them know you would like to receive a firearm for transfer from Fullyloadedfirearms.com. 3)	Be sure to ask about their FFL transfer fee, commonly around $50 but varies by state. 4)	If you agree to their fee, arrange the transfer with your FFL dealer. (We do not arrange the transfer) 5)	Provide your dealer with our email address where they can scan and email a copy of their FFL. 6)	Once you have selected an FFL for your transfer, please indicate the dealers name and address on your order so we know where to ship your firearm."

This gun is in excellent condition and the action and trigger that is super smooth. The condition is excellent (as you can see from the pics), it has the best sights on the market and I am throwing in a $50 holster to boot. It currently sells for $550-$600 just about anywhere you go with the plain white dot sights. I am asking $575 for the whole package. I could bore you with how accurate it is and how well it shoots at distance but I will not. I am willing to meet at any range you want so you can see the pistol, shoot it, see how accurate it is yourself and know that you are getting a deal (I will even provide the ammo). I will only sell this gun to someone who has a valid CCW permit and NC License. If you do not have that then I will be fine with an FFL transfer at a gun store. Most only charge $20 for this and those are the only two options I am willing to do. I will not compromise on that so please don’t ask. If you are interested please let me know. Thanks.

I also have a 25 Round Factory Magazine with Aluminum 25 Round Pistol Gear Mag Extension for sale. This is not included with the $575 price but an additional $75 if you are interested. I am selling this for more on another auction but if you buy the pistol I will let this go for $75."

It comes with a little gray pocket holster, which is very effective and stays in the pocket when the gun is drawn. There are also several holster companies that make great leather holsters for this pistol if you prefer on the belt carry. The included pocket holster has a kind of sticky feel to the outside and clings to the material on the inside of the pocket when the gun is drawn. Great little gun if you have your carry permit...either as a primary or secondary arm. thanks for looking!"

Very lightly used, it is in excellent condition.

The Industry Standard.
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.
Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero."

I had some issues with one of these rifles and sent it back to Ruger for repairs and for what ever reason Ruger chose not to repair my rifle and just sent me a brand new one.  While the rifle was at Ruger for repairs (about 4 weeks) I found and purchased a bench rest Remington Model 700 .308 and have fallen in beep like with it.  Now I am selling the Ruger that has not even been unwrapped from the factory.  It is 100% new and unfired, it has not been even taken out of the box for the first time yet.  You will be the original owner of this rifle as I have no plans to unwrap it and it will be up to the new owner to do so.  This rifle lists for $1139 from Ruger.

I would prefer not to buy a mutt/frankengun but I'll consider one if its just right. So I'd like to trade one gun plus cash. Looking at about $500 cash plus one of the trades listed below.  All are in excellent condition and very well maintained. 

Beretta M9A1 with original case and paperwork, two mags and a Fobus Evolution OWB retention holster. Trade value $600. *

Beretta CX4 Storm with original case and paperwork, several surplus M9 mags, mag well adapter & mag release (to convert back to PX4 mags) and two PX4 mags. Trade value $600. * (might consider combining with M9 because they use same mags.)

Glock 17 with original case and paperwork, three mags and a Safari Land OWB holster. Trade value $500. 

I can send pics of whatever you might be interested in.  Prefer if buyer has current/valid CPL otherwise a purchase permit must be presented. 

I'm in Port Huron and would travel about 45-60 miles for right deal. You can contact me through email or text to 810 858 2735.

Pictures of actual gun (cut & paste link): http://s1371.photobucket.com/user/flur60/slideshow/Tikka%20T3%20Varmint%2022-250?sort=9

This rifle is lightly used, all original, and in like new condition.  It comes with original box and paperwork.  Scope and rings not included.

Exact round count is unknown but easily under 300 total rounds (probably less than 200 but just being careful).  I bought the gun last year and put 52 rounds thru it.  I never finished the load development before my focus shifted to another project.  

The gun showed great promise shooting both 52gr Burgers & Sierras.  Ironically, the best 3 shot group was the first group I shot after zeroing the scope.  It measured .152” CTC with some old reloads from my youth.  I was just using them to get on target.  I can’t say for sure what the powder was but the bullet appeared to be a MK.  The gun consistently shoots under .400” 3-shot groups with most loads tested.

Web’s Best price I could find was: $798.00 (If they have 1 in stock)
Asking $675.00 shipped or FTF in Wellsville, NY (Your FFL must accept shipment from an individual)

With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

As stated, LNIB maybe 200 rds fired, but doubtful.  Two 16rd. magazines included.

Also includes the wooden grips pictured ( a $55 upgrade)

Would need to dig out the original receipt to be sure, and it may be more like 15. This series has it all: front and rear serrations on the slide, match trigger, flared ejection port, Trijicon night sights which are still active, though not blindingly so; beavertail grip safety, lockable with keys, coco-bolo grips, flat mainspring housing, and 2 SS mags which are 8 rounders, all in the original case! It has to go to feed another interest. You must be 21 to bid/own and shipping is to FFL holder only. This is a beautiful pistol and has only one flaw, a scratch on the slide where (I believe) the first owner tried to raise the disassembly pin instead of lowering it to remove the slide.

Overall in good shape with no real problems worth mentioning.  If you are not familiar with Stag they are a well regarded AR manufacturer that is also a contract parts manufacturer for many of the other AR producers out there.  Their rifles carry a lifetime warranty that follows the rifle not the owner.  Totally Mil Spec with chrome lined barrel, 5.56 chambered, M4 feed ramps, MPI/HP inspected BCG, pretty much everything you'd want in a quality AR 15.  This rifle has been 100% reliable with zero malfunctions of any kind with steel and brass ammo with about a 1000 rounds total through it.  Only thing I can say against it is some scuffs on the left side of the receiver from rubbing against gear.

Have numerous aftermarket accessories and add ons for it.  Have a full Magpul furniture set including an ACS carbine stock, Vickers Tactical sling set up in a two point/one point convertible configuration with Magpul MS3 hardware, Surefire Procomp muzzle brake/compensator, BCM Gunfighter charging handle, and others.

I also have some gear for it, including a Condor Tactical chest rig with ten magazine pouches, numerous handgun magazine pouches, and a universal vertical pistol holster that will hold just about anything, including pistols with lights and lasers.  Also have 10-12 magazines and around 300 rounds of Tula .223 ammo.

I'm looking to switch things up, I'd be interested in a quality AK47 (No WASR's) or a partial trade for a nice 9mm handgun, primarily interested in a Beretta 92, 9mm SIG (226, 229, m11, etc), HK VP9, or similar.  Might consider a decent 1911.  May consider multiple firearm trades depending on what you have, but I'm not interested in hunting rifles or hunting shotguns.

If you'd prefer to buy I will sell it in stock configuration for $700.
With sling and hardware, magpul furniture, BCM charging handle, for $900.
With everything, rifle, add ons, gear, mags, and ammo I'll sell for $1100
Will not sell gear, mags, or ammo before rifle is sold or traded.
Prices are pretty firm, I have over $1400 invested, so I'm already taking a pretty big hit on it.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Would need to dig out the original receipt to be sure, and it may be more like 15. This series has it all: front and rear serrations on the slide, match trigger, flared ejection port, Trijicon night sights which are still active, though not blindingly so; beavertail grip safety, lockable with keys, coco-bolo grips, flat mainspring housing, and 2 SS mags which are 8 rounders, all in the original case! It has to go to feed another interest. You must be 21 to bid/own and shipping is to FFL holder only. This is a beautiful pistol and has only one flaw, a scratch on the slide where (I believe) the first owner tried to raise the disassembly pin instead of lowering it to remove the slide.

ATF Not Moving Forward with M855 Ban “At This Time”
by G&A Online Editors   |  March 10th, 2015

Shooters and hunters concerned about losing access to popular and inexpensive M855 5.56 NATO “green tip” ammunition can rest easy for now, as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has announced it is no longer moving forward with its proposed framework to ban M855 ammo at this time.

Instead, the ATF will be taking time to review the record number of comments it has received on the framework proposal and further evaluate the issues raised in those comments. According to an ATF release, the number of comments on the proposal total more than 80,000, and the vast majority have been critical of the proposed new framework.

“Accordingly, ATF will not at this time seek to issue a final framework,” says the Mar. 10, 2015 ATF release.

In addition to public comments, the ATF’s proposed M855 ban has been rescinded after large opposition by the United States Senate and House of Representatives. Both legislative bodies submitted signed opposition letters to the ATF on this matter.

The ATF will continue to accept comments on the framework through March 16, after which it will process the comments and make them public as soon as is practical. Further, the ATF states it will provide additional open and transparent processes, such as a proposal and public comment opportunities, before proceeding with any future framework.

A release from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), said it “looks forward to engaging in a dialogue with ATF to address this issue that led to the now withdrawn proposal.” The NSSF also stated it will continue to urge the ATF to grant 32 long-pending petitions to exempt alternative rifle ammunition intended for the hunting market.

Here is a MR9 . Steel slide, polymer body great shooting gun. Read the reviews ! I will let reviews and the pics do the talking .
Fast action trigger:
The Fast Action mechanism on the new MR Eagles is something else entirely. For one thing, it is striker fired; all other pistols called Fast Action are hammer fired. For another, more important thing, when the MR Eagles are decocked they revert to a true long-pull firm double-action first-shot trigger, with subsequent shots firing in short-pull single-action mode exactly as any conventional double-action/single-action auto pistol. Fast Action applies only if the striker is not decocked after an initial round is manually chambered prior to the first shot. And the MR Eagles have full double-action repeat-strike capability in case of a first-strike light primer indent.

When you cycle the slide and chamber a round on the MR Eagle, the striker is cocked, but the trigger remains in the full forward “double-action” position. Pulling the trigger at that juncture requires only a very light pressure of about 4 ounces to move it back approximately 0.85 inch to the “single-action” position, where an additional 1/8 inch, 4.5-pound stacking stroke will fire the gun. If you release the trigger without firing after the initial 4-ounce part of this “two-stage” takeup, it will remain in the rearward single-action position.

Normal looking cane (which I do not need or use), with heavy eagle head handle (silver color, does not attract magnet), but with a short sword inside. Blade is about 15"". Cane body and sword do attract a magnet, so must be steel. I'd put it on the wall or something, but the kids can open it, and I'm not sticking it in the gun safe. I bought it online with no description so I know nothing more than I'm listing (won't say how much, but I'll probably take a loss). No marks I can find on it. Make an offer. I won't take $1, that is just default for listing. No shipping. Call or text 406-781-63OO"
