This 39-year-old Colt's MK IV Series 70 Government Model .45 Automatic Caliber pistol,  manufactured in 1976, during Colt’s glory days, is head and shoulders superior to the many Colts manufactured in the decades that followed, which saw the company struggle to survive a prolonged labor strike and being sold and resold, all, which resulted in much deteriorated quality control.

Being a true Colt factory nickel plated firearm, this pistol was finely polished and accurized prior to nickel plating and has always fired very dependably, smoothly and accurately. This weapon is a pleasure to shoot and to own.

I purchased this gun, new, for self-defense and for collecting. I have had it for 39 years. It has only been used for slight practice/target shooting. It works flawlessly and is in excellent condition. The custom grips provide a hand-filling excellent hold.

Please contact me for the link to a video that I've created including many more pictures of this great gun. REDACTED and REDACTED

I will ship anywhere in the USA, through an FFL Dealer, via USPS. The buyer will pay the actual shipping cost. I will honor the buyer's wishes as to how quickly he wants the gun delivered. The firearm must be shipped via a registered, insured, way, which provides maximum security and tracking. I will pay the fee that my FFL dealer charges me to send the gun to the buyer and the buyer will pay whatever fee his FFL dealer charges him to receive the firearm for him.

Please note: I only accept payment via USPS Money Orders and ship via USPS.

This is my first time selling a firearm online but I have sold a lot of things on eBay, where I am a highly regarded seller, having sold cars, motorcycles, vintage guitars and guitar amplifiers, and a wide variety of great things, all which have been in mint or near mint condition.

The Remington® Model 870™ Pump-Action Shotgun is one of the most proven firearm's designs in history. The 870 Express® Compact is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it an extremely useful firearm for young people looking for their first gun, or experienced shooters of smaller stature. The versatile, no-nonsense 870 Express Compact can be used for hunting upland game, turkey, and deer, as well as a home defense shotgun, and informal clay pigeon shooting. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and handle well in the field. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a durable, checkered hardwood stock and fore-end with a non-reflective finish, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The butt-stock and barrel on the Compact model are slightly shorter than standard length to accommodate shooters of smaller stature. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A durable, rubber recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. All 870 Express shotguns function with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells interchangeably. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes."

Please contact me with the make and model of your handgun and we will select the right holster to fit your handgun. 

N82 Tactical Story:

The Original Nate Squared Tactical Holster was developed to allow an individual to carry concealed all day comfortably. We had always thought that carrying a concealed firearm was just supposed to be comforting, not comfortable. After personally carrying some of the most popular IWB's on the market, we understood why so many people felt the same way. After collecting the proverbial box of holsters, we decided enough was enough and started working on our own holster design. We introduced our Original holster in October of 2009 and since then, thousands of people (some skeptically at first) have enjoyed the opportunity to not only be comforted by carrying a concealed firearm, but learned that you could truly carry all day comfortably. With Nate Squared Tactical, comfort is a reality, NOT JUST A SLOGAN.

COMFORT
Comfort was our biggest motivation in the design of our unique holsters. Each Series of Nate Squared Tactical holsters are made from quality oil-tanned leather, neoprene, and suede leather. Each holster is hand crafted to ensure the highest quality possible. We firmly stand behind the quality & craftsmanship of every holster we build.

- The oil-tanned leather will provide a durable, yet safe contact for the handgun.
- The soft suede backing allows your skin to breathe, so even when you sweat against the holster, it will still feel cool.
- The natural friction coefficient of suede displaces a percentage of the weight of your firearm. This allows you to carry the firearm without it's total weight pulling down against your waistband. It is the suede that allows us to utilize a design with a single clip.
- Neoprene is sandwiched between the oil-tanned leather and the suede leather. The neoprene provides the padding to protect you from the various edges of the firearm (slide, rear sight, hammer, beavertail, etc.) even when sitting in a vehicle, but also protects your investment. Neoprene (what wetsuits are made of) is waterproof, creating a moisture barrier that will not allow sweat or skin acids to come in contact with your handgun."

These were issued during world war II.  Here is information about M1's from wikipedia: Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these guns were made by other companies (see list of Military contractors below). The largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood typewriter company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable.""

""When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies."" After doing some digging I found that M 1s with IG markings mean it was made by IBM and General Motors. Although Ive also read that the Saginaw with the SG marking stood for Grand Rapids.

However, I find myself with some medical issues that need to be addressed, so I'm going to sell not only this, but several more! On top of that, I'm looking for some pro grade/boutique guitar gear, even if it's only part of the trade and would also be interested in any type of old amp that runs on tubes, or if you have tubes lying around!  I'm just a hobbyist to this stuff, but having some of this old tube type stuff to work on is good therapy for me.  This weapon only has the slightest wear around the muzzle from being holstered. I have to shoot it at least one more time before it goes to a new home. The stag grips on this are nice and feel perfect to my hand. This is certainly 95% or better. It comes with a couple of speed loaders, the gun rug you see in the pics and and I'll include all of the .357 ammo that I have with it as well. I'm not sure, but I think I have about 300 rounds or so for it.  I'd like to sell this today, if possible, and please bring it in $100 bills. If you have questions or concerns, please let me know. This 4"" Python is one of the best I've personally owned. The trigger is buttery smooth, just like it should be...single or double, but if you pull that hammer back to fire it, it takes but the touch of a feather to unleash all the fire and fury that is the Colt Python. I have other pistols that I'm going to sell as well, so keep watching!  Thanks for your time, and have a great day!"

Other info: Purchased from Tracy Rifle and Pistols about a year ago. California model with Bullet Button and pinned (non folding) stock from the factory to comply with CA DOJ requirements. (Solar Tactical sells a Kydex wrap if you wish to run this featureless w/o bullet button (not included)). I Put 3 boxes of factory ammo through it (WWB, Federal, and PMC) with no failures. Runs great and very accurate! This rifle wears the Troy sights which means it is a late model version with all the factory revisions. Absolutely nothing wrong with it

Mechanically: 10/10 - Clean after every range session and lube with Slip2000 as recommended by Kriss
Aesthetically: 9.5/10 - Has normal wear from brass bouncing off the ejection port. Only ever shot at the range so this thing never got banged around. Safe queen.
