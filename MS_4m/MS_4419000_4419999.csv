When you field strip it you don't find the typical signs of cheap manufacturing like you usually do on lower cost guns: tooling marks, etching and pitting, it is as smooth as it is on the outside. The feed ramp is like glass, highly polished. It is not snappy at all, the recoil pad which I thought might be gimmicky really works. I spoke to SCCY about the warranty and they said it is a no excuse warranty, they will fix the gun no matter what including ""squib loads"" or if you drop it, etc. They are really serious about standing by their product."

These are banned from import thanks to our old friend Obama, so there are no more coming into the U.S. and they are going up and up in price. This bad boy has had the trigger group moved up into the correct position and the trigger guard re-riveted on. It has had a bullet guide welded in and the mag release modified to take 30 round AK mags. It had a Century ""Yugo style"" pistol grip added and then a Fab Defense adjustable stock put on with adjustable cheek riser. This stock is really nice! It has a Guntec USA quad rail up front and the horrible front sight block was removed and relaced with a surplus Bulgarian sight block and muzzle brake. It's got a railed dust cover to mount a scope, and it's see through, so you can still use the iron sights. Speaking of, the rear leaf was replaced with a Russian 1000m instead of the factory 300m. The safety selector was modified to hold the bolt carrier for a bolt hold open feature that many refer over the factory Saiga bolt hold open. It's got an adjustable bipod and a Tapco 30 round magazine. It's also got a Tapco G2 trigger to eliminate that AK ""trigger slap."" The entire rifle was refinished with a bake on epoxy coating which looks great and is extremely durable! The rilfe is used and I am not the original owner so I don't know the exact round count, but you can tell by the internals that it is VERY low. The barrel is hammer forged and chrome lined and looks perfect! If you're looking for a top of the line AK, don't wait! Like I said, these are no longer being imported, so the prices are only going in one direction.

I'm in Twin and am asking $1200 for this baby. I will consider trades/partial trades and I'm not opposed to a road trip out Boise way to the West or Idaho Falls way to the East for a serious buyer, but she is first come, first served. Thanks for looking!"

794,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4419794,For Sale:  Bravo BCM SOCOM upper with Daniel Defense RIS II FSP rail,"Raleigh / Fayetteville / FT Bragg, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 850,"Listed On: Thursday, June 11, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The SOCOM M4 profile is a mid-weight profile barrel for the M4A1 Carbine. The flats milled under the handguards are for mounting of the M203. SOCOM requested the mid profile to better handle the volume of fire from their shooters. This profile is being adopted as a new standard for the M4A1 Carbine.

The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need. The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher without additional parts. As importantly, special tools are not required to mount the M203 grenade launcher. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself. The Daniel Defense RIS II M4A1 FSP feature a cut-out in the top rail to accommodate a standard front sight base on a carbine-length gas system.

Put about 150 rounds through of different ammo brands, no issues. Also includes a a BCM compensator and magpul backup rear sight."

When Military Arms Channel (MAC) on YouTube showed a video of how to build a 1000 yard rifle for $1000, I was impressed.  I was so impressed that I built one for myself, and was able to start long range shooting on a budget.  I put on a Primary Arms 4-14X44 FFP Scope, with Vortex Rings, and a 20 MIL Rail.

Hadn't shot it in a while, so I just fired 20 rounds through it to make sure it was still sighted in…and it was perfect.

This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found traditional handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating 16.1” chrome lined barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range shooting.

Up for sale is a Colt LE6940 M4 Carbine in excellent condition. Around 1,000 rounds have been fired through the rifle in a range setting. I never had one malfunction with this rifle. There is some  slight scratch marks on the muzzle, however other than that, this rifle is flawless. 

Price is firm at $1,000. No trades. Local sale only.

Of course, its always good to put a drop or two of gun oil on the slide when cleaning..but in general the nickle boron slide makes the gun run much smoother (as well as looking great). This Glock is well worth the asking price with the Tru-dot night sights. Comes with two high capacity magazines, loader,  box and all paperwork.

(C&R early 1950’s mfgr) One of my favorite deer rifles EVER!  I don’t hunt anymore, so there is no reason to keep a hunting rifle.  I have personally shot this rifle many times, and it has never let me down.
Here’s the good:
Great shooting rifle, accurate and performs perfectly.  Scope is in very good conditions, but shows some wear.  
Here’s the bad:
Stock has recoil pad installed (not original, but really helps when shooting), missing rear iron sight (removed to accommodate scope).
