53,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4119053,For Sale:  Huntertown Arms Kestrel 5.56 Silencer,"Southwest (Missouri City), Houston, Texas",$ 389,"Listed On: Thursday, April 2, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Kestrel 5.56 had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint. Maintenance Cleaning the Kestrel 5.56 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors. With the Kestrel 5.56 full user servicability is truely a reality. The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.

  Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

ALSO INCLUDES: 2 extra accessory rail sections for the hand guard, 1 modd'd P Mag to allow the follower to tilt a little, 

Built a 5.45 upper, bought 3 crates of surplus ammo. Before all my ammo arrived the ATF bans 7n6.  Took it to the range a couple times & shot up half of a tin (540 rd). Sure I ran it a little hard those days, but I let it cool between magazines, and its a melanite bore heavy profile barrel and the bore is bright and perfect. Ejection was good strong and consistent at 3:30.. I have a short vid of me doing a mag dump, it ran really great. 

Because of the corrosive primers, both times I cleaned the everloving hell out of it in the kitchen sink w/ soapy water, then dried it at 170f in the oven for a few minutes, the oiled it w/ oil base lube (rem oil), so it is in excellent condition. 

With the 7n6 ammo suddenly more costly to replace, and demanding cleaning regimen, I decided that having this extra chambering and upper was just not for me. I've sold the SF stock. I sold the five and half tins of the original six I had ordered. http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_7_133/1409135_WTS_76N_5_45_surplus_ammo_F2F_in_FL__GA_or_SC.html 

upper and charging handle are standard. HG is and a Middy JP FF Tube. I rounded off the back of the front sight rail so that it won't chafe the thumb. I will include a couple extra accessory rail sections. 

Barrel: Ballistic advantage 8.3"" melanite/QPQ coated inside and out, new for $140 currently: 
http://ballisticadvantage.com/8-3-inch-545-spr-pistol-performance-barrel.html 

KAK slim flash can ($35) on there that protrudes past the HG. The HG is actually longer than the barrel so you would not be able to use a typical flash hider comp or brake on there w/o shortening/replacing the hand guard. 

BCG: Ballistic advantage phosphate coated, shot peened HP/MPI: bought it for $75. Carrier is a BCM M16 carrier. 

Gas Block: .750 BRT Pinnable low pro ($40). I got and drilled/pinned it myself so I'd never have to worry about locktite failing w/ hard use. This makes the barrel and gas block fitted parts, another gas block could be used if it a clamp on type of course, but this upper really works great and you wouldn't run a suppressor on this upper so I see no reason to ever replace it: 
http://www.blackrivertactical.com/concrete5/micropin-gas-block/ 

I travel around by car for my job alot all over SC, GA, FL. I can fly w/ it too no prob. Flying to NC & VA next week... 

If course, if you own AR15s, for you to leagally own this upper requires that at least one of your AR lowers is a SBR or pistol, or new stripped. 

w/ a $100 handguard, basic CH, gas tube, $50 upper & $50 carier, it would still cost over $500 easy to build, plust the effort. 

I'll also sell some of those HK416 mags if interested... 

Possibly interested in a trade for 22 LR barrel or upper. I alreay have a CMG Ciener type rimfire bolt but find accuracy through 5.56 barrels too poor."

I am reluctantly selling my P238
This is a very very nice concealable handgun that is in absolute mint condition!!
I sent this brand-new to the sig custom shop to have it went over and made 100% functional. 

It has only been to the range one time and had less than 100 rounds fired through it flawlessly. 
The only reason I am selling is because I just have too many guns of the same size. 

I will include a brand new blade tech IWB holster. 

Comes complete with a box all the paperwork and the receipt from the custom shop.

I have owned this 338MXLR since January of 2013, it has a ""JM"" stamped barrel but has a Remington receiver as the ""barrel droop"" was fixed and it shoots great!! It has the beautiful Marlin cut checkering, not like like that cheap ugly pressed checkering Remington is now doing on the ""Marlin's"".

The only marks on the gun is a couple little chips in the glaze on the bottom of the pistol grip on the black cap as pictured.  Other than that it is a beautiful gun and it is rare to ever find one of these now days.  It comes topped with Leupold aluminum rings and base and a silver Simmons ProSport 3-9x40 scope that is crystal clear.  This gun is a joy to shoot and feels natural in the hands of the shooter.

Looking to get into the hands of a shooter who enjoys Marlin's and is looking to add to their collection!! 

First $1,300 cash takes it!! Or trade plus cash, call or text Ryan @ REDACTED.

Also comes with a bunch of reloading stuff for an extra $100!! Including brass, bullets and dies etc. if interested!!"

I might take a gun of similar size if it is in a different caliber.

Cash price is $350,trade value is the same.

The DB9 weighs 11oz. Disassembly is just like a Glock.
This is the black stainless model.
I'm not really looking to trade for a .22 pistol unless it is Ruger

For trades I prefer .32 acp,7.62x25,9mm,9x18,.380,.38 special,.357 magnum,and .45 acp.

This is a One-Owner gun with very few rounds through it.  Prices Right!

Gun is equiped with a Tasco Pro-Point II Red-Dot Scope, 1 power magnifaction, AND a B-Square, no-gunsmith Mount!  This gun is a real tack driver!  (it's actually hard to miss with this) 

This is a stainless steel gun which has a high polish job, making it look almost like nickel.  Has the original S&W Walnut target grips and the paperwork that came with the gun, manual, etc.
Gun also comes with a beautiful, padded carrying case to accommodate longer barrels and scopes. (lots of pockets in there too)  A cable lock is also provided.  A very nice package!

Smith & Wesson wheel gun fans....this is a rare opportunity to pick up on an all-time favorite in super condition, a real ""must have!""  I have not seen any other guns like this around equipted as this one is...especially for the price, all S&W have been consistently going up in value.
If you do not want the red-dot scope, I will lower the price somewhat, but the mount must stay with the gun.  It is easily removable & I also have the original adjustable factory rear sight.

Any questions....drop me an email or call REDACTED.  Don't let this one get away, the quality & condition of this piece is outstanding!  If you're looking for a powerful revolver, this is a winner, excellent for target shooting, ""hunting,"" home defense, you name it..... Not to mention, it looks like a million too.
I have a few more pictures which I couldn't get on here if that would help, let me know.

I am located in Horseshoe Bend = N.C. Arkensas.  I will travel to Jonesboro or other reasonable  distance to conclude sale to a serious buyer.  I can also ship gun to any FFL or dealer in the U.S., Buyer to pay only actual cost of shipping.  Illinois resident will need a FOID card."

Remington built approximately 131,000 Model 341's between 1936 and 1940, in several grades. The Model 341 has an overall length of 43.25"" with its 24"" barrel, the length of pull is 13.375"" and it weighs five pounds. It is unique in that it features dual opposed locking lugs, located to the middle rear of the one-piece bolt body. One of the locking lugs is the root of the bolt handle. Even more technically interesting is the fact that it also has a cartridge lifter system that pretty much precludes bullet damage on feeding, as it essentially guides the round without touching the rear of the chamber with the bullet nose, theoretically improving accuracy. The rifle is unremarkable in appearance. Its straight-grained American black-walnut stock, sans checkering and any kind of cheekpiece, means that it will forever use its iron, semi-buckhorn sighting system."
