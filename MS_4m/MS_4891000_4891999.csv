An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor"

The Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle was made to suit the preferences of those that want the same concept rifle as the SASS, but lighter. The 20” Hbar Melonite treated barrel is one of the most durable, long lasting barrels you can buy, plus the lightweight rail system reduces the weight from the SASS rifle without negating accuracy.

Has 5 back straps, 5 base plates, 3 mags, 2 mag releases, case, lock, paperwork, ect from factory. About 2 months ago this just had the whole top end(slide, barrel, night sights, springs, everything!) replaced by S&W and the only rounds fired since have been from them. Once I received the gun back from S&W I sent the slide off to have it gunkoted in a distressed/battle worn pattern to match.  I have had a TON of compliments on this firearm and the only reason I am considering parting with it is to get a compact in FDE. Please do not email me and offer me a shield, black model, or one without night sights! I may consider a nice glock 30, 30s 29sf, Sig, h&k or other makes/models of HANDGUNS ONLY if it's something that catches my eye and has night sights. Want to stay in .40 or .45 caliber but the worst I can say is no. I am located in Lafayette and I am not willing to drive and meet. I have been stood up to many times by people that were not serious.

I'm selling my Gen 3 Glock 38. I have owned it for just over a year. I have been pretty busy so getting out to the range over the past few months has been difficult. However, the 200 or so rounds I have personally put through the gun have worked out great. It is built like a tank as expected from the Glock platform and feels very natural in the hand. No misfires or failures to speak of. It is easily concealable and handles well at the range. I was shooting pretty solid groups up to 25 yards. Field stripping to clean is simple making maintenance and upkeep a breeze. I enjoy the gun a lot and worked out great for my first pistol after the military. The only true reason I am selling it is to consolidate my firearms and get something a bits smaller that can fit in my waistline more easily. It will come with the carrying case, reloader, and cleaning kit if desired. I am including 75 Remington rounds, as well as 20 Gold Dot hollow points. I will sell for $350.00 without ammunition."

This was an overrun by the manufacturer and these have an additional propeller marking inside the umbrella logo (as seen in the pics).  These are premium BCGs, and very rarely in stock anywhere.  Will ship anywhere in the US for $5.00.

Here are the specs from Umbrella's website:  

Umbrella Corporation AR-15 Bolt Carrier Groups are our take on a premium, no snake oil, combat ready BCG. Each and every bolt is proof fired, ultrasonically cleaned, tested via magnetic particle inspection (MPI), and once certified, parkerized for corrosion protection and lube retention. In keeping with a superior product, we don't utilize a Crane O-Ring as a crutch to increase extractor tension. Instead, our bolts are built with a mil-spec black insert coupled with a Tactical Springs 5-coil high load extractor spring that's compatible with all DI gas system lengths. It's rated for 150K+ cycles to outlast your rifle barrel many times over. We have improved on the finish requirement of the TDP and have chosen the best materials of those allowed per spec, not the lowest cost like nearly all of our competitors. This second gen product is manufactured to the highest standards with an unconditional guarantee against material defect and manufacturing failure. We challenge you to compare our Bolt Carrier Group specs against the competition. Beyond using Carpenter's 158 alloy for the bolt, ask what alloy they use for their extractors, Extractor pins, ejectors, and whether their cam pins have a solid film lube per TDP. You will likely find they don't advertise any of these specifications.  And don't fall for the 9310 alloy bolt substitute; it is a less expensive, inferior alloy for this application. Bought into the hype and don't believe us? Ask Carpenter Tech; they manufacture both materials and will without hesitation tell you 158 is the proper, superior alloy. The draw for 9310 is that it's a decent material when heat treated properly though since there's no spec, how do you know what ""proper"" might be for this application? It's less costly, and you don't have to buy mill run quantities for manufacturing. It's the little things that make the real difference and we cut no corners with our Bolt Carrier Groups. as before, this initial first release is offered with a discount below our suggested retail pricing. Assembly/function check by a qualified Armorer is required.

It has a Bartlett #4 bull contour 24"" fluted barrel with a 1-10.5 twist.  It is threaded 5/8X24 with a matching thread protector and Badger Mini FTE removable muzzle brake.  It has an OD Green Bell & Carlson Sporter stock and PTG Steel Floor Metal.  The gun is finished in OD Green Cerakote.
I custom ordered this gun in December of last year.  It was shipped March 19, 2015.  After receiving the gun, I mounted a NightForce scope and sighted it in.  I shot a total of 12 rounds.  I had plans of doing some long range hunting with it but life has gotten in the way.  It has sat in my gun safe, unused.  
This is to expensive of a firearm to sit collecting dust, so I'm parting with it.  
If you are familiar with GA Precision or are shopping for one, you know that this gun is built rock solid and is super accurate.  You also know that GA has a 3 - 6 month wait from the day you order.  
Order this one and you will get a new rifle, delivered this week.  
The gun is for sale locally at Mac's Gun Shop in Tyler, TX.  If you purchase it, it will be shipped from there to your FFL.  I accept money orders only and am happy to work the deal through Mac's if it makes the buyer feel more comfortable since this is such an expensive gun.  I go by the same user name (heyjacks) over on eBay where I have been a member for over 10 years and have a 100% positive feedback.
Shipping will be actual cost.

Winchester PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

The first 3 videos listed are the most recent.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHJBTeUlWPDGszT21zEOL6QWinchester 1873 Rifle. Caliber 32-20 also known as 32WCF. 1887 Vintage. Has a 24"" Octagon Barrel. This is a good shooter and I would consider it to be in good condition overall. We were just at the range the other day and fired off 25 rounds with it. Still have about 25 rounds remaining that will go with it. This is a joint venture between my uncle and I and it used to be his late brother's (my other uncle) who was an avid gun collector. I have done all the work on it this past year. It probably sat for 40-50 years prior to that!Condition: I admittedly do not know how to grade antique guns so i will describe to the best of my ability. The wood is real nice with most varnish remaining with a few dings here and there. The front stock is very slightly loose. The ""blueing"", which is actually plum brown, is very good on the barrel with minor pitting and fair/good on the rest of the parts with more pitting except for the magazine tube which is missing blueing. The side plates and front stock end cap are nickle-plated and slightly pitted. Internally, the toggles are fine and do not look to have ever been without lube as well as the rest of the internals. The firing pin/bolt may have seen some work at one point in time but not from me. There were parts missing that have been replaced by me such as the magazine follower, spring and end cap as well as the mainspring tension screw. Those were new reproduction parts from homesteadpartsdotcom. There still might need to be a little bit of fine-tuning done to the action as it is a little stiff but it fired fine at the range.The screw-in octagon barrel was loose and a little over-clocked (about 5 degrees) when I tried to tighten it so I created some shims to get it to line up correctly when tightened. I ended up at .0015"" or so. The bore is pitted but the rifling is certainly pronounced and the gun produced good groups at the range. Fired cases look fine with no evidence of headspace issues or bulging.I also repaired the magazine tube band that holds it to the barrel by milding reshaping the band dovetail and gently peening the barrel dovetail. This work is unnoticable and I was able to reuse the original roll pin. I'm pretty sure I bought a spare when I bought the other parts.Includes 25 rounds of 32-20 jacketed ammo and about the same number of empty cases. I think these can be reloaded with 32ACP bullets and small rifle primers (I think). Ammo is out there if you look and certainly at the gun shows.Looking for $1873 or serious cash offer or trade. Will consider interesting trades plus cash such as maybe a ""newer"" lever-action in .38 or .44 and/or possibly a small or large carry/hunting pistol/revolver and/or .22 pistol/revolver. No junk trades or low-ball offers, please!Will consider shipping with prepayment as this is an antique and will ship through the mail without FFL regulations. Even then, it IS legal for a private party to ship a long gun in-state to another private party. Credit Cards ARE accepted! Serious only contact me through the AL messaging system but please be patient for a reply. Be sure to leave a contact number and I'll get back to you in a day or so."

In 2010 I had the pistol sent off to Springfield Armory to have newer style night sights installed. They did a thorough cleaning and replaced all internal springs. Unfortunately it just sits in my safe and I've only fired around 100rds total since. I had the ultimate plan of turning it into a CCW but decided why risk scratching/banging up this beauty when I can use an old reliable Glock/XD.

Over the years I have collected alot of 223 rem. Ammo. Well now I would like the money for the holidays. I am asking half the price of what they sell for at retail vaule. All ammo is in 20 round unopened boxes. I have 2 different brands of ammo to sell.

First I have very high quality Sako spreed head. These sell in the store for $20 for 20 rounds.

I ask $90 per 200 rounds. (Ten boxes of 20 rounds). This is a steal for this ammo.

Second. I have American Eagle 223.

I ask $45 per 200 rounds. (Ten unopened boxes of 20 rounds)


My loss is your gain. I have been collecting this 223 for years and never shoot it. Now it is time to downsize.

I have thousands of these boxes and would consider firearm trades for it. Also would trade for .22 ammo of course. I am located in concord nh.

Let me know of any questions

Used to win the North Dakota State Long Range Championship in FTR class in 2014 (80 shots at 1000yds).  Very accurate.  Picture is of last 10-shot group at 600-yds shot in Oct 2014 just before I put the rifle away for that season.  Have not used since.  Still has plenty of life left in it.  The scope and bipod pictured are not being sold with the rifle.  The price is for the rifle, the custom cheek piece (Karsten) and the EGW 20MOA rail.  As sold this setup would be $1360 new. Will prefer to sell to a ND resident FTF.  Could discuss shipping to a FFL for the right buyer.  If a ND buyer is willing to use a FFL for the transaction, I will reduce the price to $875.

Shot it at a 300 meter match this weekend so it has 74 more rounds through it.  Here is the last group (19 shots) that I shot.  The X-ring is a little bit under 2 inches and the 10-ring is a little bit under 4 inches.  Still a shooter.  If you want to get into the long-range game, this is the more affordable way to do it."

Thank you. This is a 
9 round double action. Award winning rubber grips. 4"" barrel. Solid gun for a .22 mag.  There is one problem. After the rounds have been fired, the shells have to be pushed out from the other end of the cylinder. They only get stuck about 1/16 of an inch up from the rim of the shell, after that they slide right out. Unfired rounds are not a problem. I'm assuming the cylinder holes need reaming. I just don't like this gun enough to bother with it. I've only fired 40 rounds through it so it's still practically new. Price is $350 and not going any lower. I have the box it came in and will throw in a plastic carry case. Face to face and cash sale only. I will have a bill of sale for you to sign also. Thank you."

We bought the handgun arsenal of a University PD that went out of business and we had them all shipped to SIG for their Service Plan (SSP) for springs, new night sights, etc.  We bought more than we should have and find that we have 4 more guns than we really need.  

These are somewhat unusual P229's in that they are  9mm and DAK.  SIG has never made a production run of P229's in 9mm and DAK (lots of them in .40) and only did so in small batches for contract runs (like these.)  If you know SIG's and like the P229 in 9mm, and like DAK, these are great guns and hard to find.

They have a small police logo on the slide, just in front of the rear sight (see insert in pic provided.)  They saw little (if any) use with the PD and the 4 we are selling are in great condition with new springs and NS from SIG.  *** We are selling this last gun at either $599 for the gun only or $699 with the CTC grip.  The CTC grip will be available at $150 after the gun is gone (if the gun buyer doesn't buy it with the gun.) ***    

No trades, no price reductions.  The price is the price.  You can buy one or all.  We are on the South side of Indy and can show the guns daily between 10 am and 7 pm.  You must have an Indiana DL and sign a bill of sale.    

>>> Getting a lot of inquiries, all asking the same questions.  

No, the guns have not been fired since returning from SIG's SSP service.  At $599, these guns are a great deal."

Because the gun was aqlready stamped ""Junior Pump Gun"" it became the No. 107 Junior Pump Gun. This is, by far, the most difficult variation of the No. 107 Buck Jones to find.""
Ok that is what I found out about this BB gun it is in good shape it does show normal ware for a BB gun of its age.

Great Trigger Kit. I will be buying the same Kit for my current NIB M&P9C that I recently just picked up. Nothing wrong with current one, just wanted a new one.

I had an Apex Tactical FSS & Aluminum Trigger on my M&P9L years ago and they are ___Great___ Trigger Systems.  After I polished the internals it was _remarkably very close_ to my friends $900 SA 1911 that had around 150-300 rounds through it.

SKU #: 209304

I'll take $ 10 off if you have a Valid MN PTC ( CCW ) that is Active.

Under 500 Total Rounds fired. Could be as low as 300 rounds. Bought used,
150-175 were Low to Very Low Power Hornady Critical Defense or Duty Rounds.

Valid MN; DL, Purchase Permit or PCP ( CCPermit ) with a Bill of Sale Required.

Great Shape !! I do not need to sell, just testing the waters a little bit.
I will eventually get a 2nd M&P9C ( or 3rd if I decide to keep this ), don't know if I'll get one with a safety next time or not. 

Also have Soft Grip Tape that's I'll sell for $10. I have enough in the package to sell 2-3 strips.

Also have a new AlienGearHolster Tuck 3.0 that I can sell for $45. Worn like 11 times so far. Carried the Shield more than the 9C so far.
MUCH better than their Tuck 2.0 version. I can just order another one from them since I am going to get a left handed shell soon anyways.

This is a scope that I purchased on a used firearm with the intention of modifying for long range shooting. Although this scope could be used for long range shooting I wanted a MOA reticle which this doesn't have. That is the only reason I am selling. This scope is fully functional and tracks well out to 550yds, which was all the farther I was able to shoot it to at the time. 
   The only things that are of any concern at all would be that the elevation turret cap for the medium turret has been lost. However I usually shoot without the turret caps because I dial the DOPE into all my shots. Instead I use a scopecoat which will be included along with a set of extended 1"" high rings. The second thing of notice was the marks left from the scope rings on the scope tube. Upon disassembly for resale I noticed that the scope rings had actually made small dents into the tube which have obviously had no affect on performance because I only noticed them after they were off the scope. Both of these issues are purely cosmetic. The scope is fully functional and in very good shape.Please feel free to call with any questions. REDACTED. This scope comes with a full lifetime warranty as seen in picture."

I bought this with the intention of mounting on a rifle that has factory sights on the barrel. The rear sight on the barrel is in the way so I have decided to go with a smaller scope. These go for $699-799 online. This Ziess scope has a lifetime transferable warranty that has not been registered yet. I have the original box and paperwork with warranty card. If you look at the photos you will notice it has the adjustable parallex feature. Just set it to the yardage you are shooting and put the crosshairs on your target.
