Here's an awesome 4th generation model 17.

As you can see from the pictures, it's immaculate. I am selling this gun in order to consolidate my collection to focus on Glock 19's, and I have over $600 in this G17, so I'm expecting to take a loss on this...but it simply doesn't fit into my collection anymore because the trigger is not like my other Glocks. I am available to meet most days along I-459 from Trussville to Hoover. Price is FIRM. I will sell ONLY to Alabama residents who are legally allowed to own this gun. Before I meet you, I will require a text or email of a photo of your carry permit so that I know who I'm meeting with and to know that you have passed a recent background check. I will do the same for you. For TRADES, I am interested in Glock 19's or Glock 26's that are out-of-the-box, with limited aftermarket enhancements."

It comes with 3 magazines, 15+1 if you carry with a round loaded. 525 rounds of 9mm ammunition, whereas if zombies, Democraps, or theivers (sometimes all the same thing), approach you, the 400 rounds of regular target ammo will do. Included is the 125 rounds of Hollow Point/Exploding Ammo. 

Also too, in addition to the extra magazine, is two holesters, one for open carry with extra slot for a mag, and other is a LH Neoprene, that I wore on my back (right hand user). I figured, if ninjas put their nun-chucks there, a handgun in the small of your back is the best place to carry. 

This is my 3rd carry gun and I've taken excellent care of it and am even throwing in a 9mm cleaning kit as part of the price. This is a very nice lot for a first time buyer. It is exceptional for a seasoned guy, but you know what you see. Any questions, ask."

Both the upper and lower receivers are equally at home on a standard forged product from other vendors. The flared magazine well aids in rapid reloading, and the tapered transition under the charging handle prevents associated wear patterns from damaging the finish.
