45,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4313045,For Sale:  Juggernaut Arms - Walther PPQ M2,"Sparks, Reno, Nevada",$ 569,"Listed On: Sunday, June 14, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Manufacturer : Walther Model : PPQ m2Caliber : 9mm Capacity : 17rd. (2) magazines Features : great ergonomics, button style mag releaseThe Walther PPQ is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.
FeaturesEdit
The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense'trigger of the PPQ is a departure from previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled, the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with theGlock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm(0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state."

It reinforces the Nightforce commitment to make the company’s renowned quality and performance available to greater numbers of hunters and shooters through the more affordable SHV™ line.The 5-20 x 56 SHV™ is available in illuminated and non-illuminated reticle models. Illuminated versions feature center-only reticle illumination, which helps prevent low-light flare common to some “smart” reticles. External illumination control is incorporated into the side parallax adjustment. Parallax settings are marked in yards, and adjustments can be made quickly without removing the eye from the shooting position.The same Nightforce-designed reticles offered with the 4-14 x 56 SHV™ are available in the 5-20 x 56: the IHR™ (International Hunting Reticle), an uncluttered, fast three-post design with floating center crosshair, applicable for use on virtually any game; and the MOAR™, an extremely effective minute-of-angle-based reticle that provides accurate rangefinding and hold-offs, even on small targets at long distances. Capped elevation and windage adjustments have .25 MOA click values, yielding 10 MOA per revolution of the dial. Total travel is 80 MOA elevation, 50 MOA windage within the 30mm tube. The new 5-20 x 56 SHV™ comes standard with Nightforce ZeroSet™ technology that allows a rapid return to the shooter’s chosen zero point, even after multiple rotations of the elevation adjustment.The same engineering and performance that persuaded Outdoor Life’s editors to select the 4-14 x 56 SHV™ as their “Editor’s Choice” for 2014 are evident in its bigger brother. “We’ve been able to create a line of riflescopes that will outperform any in their class or price range by limiting the number of options available and using a less complex manufacturing process than our NXS™ series,” said Kyle Brown, Nightforce director of sales and marketing. “All we lowered was the price—not our standards.”The 5-20 x 56 SHV™ provides exceptional clarity, resolution and color contrast across its entire magnification range, unlike many lesser variable-power scopes that exhibit a marked deterioration of quality toward the higher end of their power ranges. Manufacturer Part No: C535  Scope Weight: 30.5 oz. Scope Length: 15.2"" Magnification Range: 5-20x Scope Objective Diameter: 56mm Scope Tube Size / Mount: 30mm Scope Turret Adjustment: .25 MOA with Zeroset Field of View: 17.9' - 5' @ 100 yds.

The Barrett 82A1 stands at the pinnacle of firearm design, and has been proven in long-range accuracy, ruggedness, and dependability in any environment (military or civilian). The low recoil and self-loading action of the 82A1 created it’s own hallmark! If you are anything like me, the more that you research the engineering that goes into the Barrett Model 82A1, the more you will be inspired by the close tolerances and meticulous engineering that has gone into every single part of this gun. It is unparalleled.

I was so overwhelmed by Barrett’s development of the Model 82A1, that I got this rifle to hold onto. I am the sole owner, and this rifle has remained new and unfired, to this day. It has been well maintained and stored in climate-controlled conditions with thorough cleaning and lubrication regularly. I NEVER intended to sell this beautiful gun, but must now due to financial necessity.

If you are unfamiliar with the Barrett Model 82A1, please watch some of the You Tube demonstrative videos of this rifle. There simply are NO Comparables.

The Swarovski Optik high-performance scope is made in Western Austria by Swarovski; a family business that was established in 1895 after Daniel Swarovski invented the first electric grinding machine for jewelry stores. In 1935, Wilhelm Swarovski pursued his passion for astronomy and built far better optics for telescopes than the world had ever seen. This gave rise to Swarovski Optik, a company that still stands firmly behind their products. I believe this to be the best scope, atop the best rifle.

The Pelican 1750 case for the Barrett Model 82A1 is built like a tank, and is specially designed for the 82A1. It is watertight, crushproof, and dustproof, and comes with a Lifetime Guarantee of Excellence. It measures 53” Length X 16” Width X 6.12” Depth, and is made of polypropylene with stainless steel bearings. It comes with a side handle, end handle, and roller wheels.

I cannot bring myself to piece out the gun, so I am selling it with all of the accessories. EVERYTHING IS IN NEW CONDITION. This includes everything detailed in the attached photos, including:

The scope is not the Leaper like the Original had but a Bushnell 3x-9x40 and have also add a lace on cheek plate to lift the eye up to the scope level There is a 12 inch spike bayonet stored in the rifle under the barrel in a storage tube. it is mounted by turning it around and sticking the handle into the storage space.

It was a pistol target shooters could only dream about. A Smith & Wesson Model 52-2 chambered for .38 Special, mid range, wadcutter ammunition. Meaning it is one of the original models manufactured between 1969 and 1993 where only a few thousand units were produced. Serial number is A483274. The extension made the sight accuracy better without having a longer barrel. Now for the condition, I rate this firearm to be in Good condition. Please note the pictures.  This pistol is known for its accuracy, and “to insure the accuracy of thepistol,extra-rigid inspection was incorporated by having the Model 52 machine rest tested at 50 yards to assure that the pistol would shoot 5-shot groups having a maximum spread of two inches. Any pistol that could not meet this standard was returned to production for reworking.” The slide action has no sway or loose feel at all due to its closely fitted barrel bushing. The trigger pull is perfection at its best.   
This model has the reputation of being one of the most accurate handguns ever made.  The original grips are checkered walnut grips with Smith and Wesson monograms. The gun has a serrated trigger and hammer with adjustable trigger stop., 2lbs trigger pull...crisp and clean. Included with this pistol are 3 magazines. The grips are sharp with no losses or cracks. All markings are deep. The finish is factory original.

Unfired NIB beautiful 1911. I'm building funds for another gun. Guns&Ammo describes this gun the best: “What's the 'E' stand for? Pick what you like but think top-of-the-line. Like a Mercedes E-Class...S&W’s reconfiguration of its entire 1911 line in the centennial year of John Browning’s masterpiece certainly represents the most evolved stage of a world classic. It would be a gross overstatement to call the E-Series a reinvention of the 1911 itself, and S&W would never consider doing so, but in terms of the SW1911 product line as it existed before, it is just that.""

The 100 ATR has everything you need to make the most of the season: pinpoint accuracy, smooth action and big-game calibers. Widely popular calibers and a free-floating, button-rifled barrel combine to deliver a high level of accuracy unheard of in a value-priced centerfire rifle. A side lever safety is utilized for convenience and safety afield, and the all-steel, machined receiver provides the 100 ATR with positive lock-up for consistent operation. The integral synthetic trigger guard allows for easy cleaning and maintenance while the rubber recoil pad aids recoil reduction and stable positioning.

Widely popular calibers and a free-floating, button-rifled barrel combine to deliver a high level of accuracy unheard of in a value-priced centerfire rifle. A side lever safety is utilized for convenience and safety afield, and the all-steel, machined receiver provides the 100 ATR with positive lock-up for consistent operation. The integral synthetic trigger guard allows for easy cleaning and maintenance while the rubber recoil pad aids recoil reduction and stable positioning.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  
Rugged and rowdy, right down to its very core, the BLR Lightweight ’81 Stainless is ready to take on the toughest hunting conditions you (and Mother Nature) can dish out. The satin finish on the laminated gray hardwood stock, the satin-nickel finish on the receiver and the matte finish on the stainless barrel mean no reflections will spook your trophy buck. The TRUGLO/Marbles fiber-optic front sight lets you draw a fine bead in low light conditions. This is what a serious lever-action hunting rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was.
 
–The button-Rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.–Every BLR barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.–The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.–The barrel’s standard sights include a Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility fiber-optic front blade on a raised ramp-style base.?–The satin nickel finish on the receiver beautifully matches the satin stainless barrel finish.–The takedown models of the BLR are unique, allowing you to simply flip a finger lever, twist the receiver and barrel 90 degrees and instantly separate the two parts for space saving storage or easy transportation, even in a backpack or hunting duffle. Reassembly is in reverse order and takes only seconds.–The barrel on BLR Takedown models is factory drilled and tapped for an optional Browning forward-mounted scout-style scope base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform, allowing you to remove the barrel for transportation and storage without losing your scope’s zero.–The aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.–The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.–The BLR has a rotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.–The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.–The BLR has a recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.–The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.–The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.–The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.–The BLR’s trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.–The fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.–The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.–Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.–Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.–The BLR’s laminated stock is sculpted from a satin gray finished hardwood for no-nonsense durability and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip.

Serial number N167289. Firearms is in excellent Condition.  Ready to Ship. Buy It Now!! When first introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1935 it was known as the Registered Magnum. The model was essentially a custom order revolver.  Each Registered Magnum came with a certificate of authenticity. 
Even though it was introduced in the middle of the Great Depression and was extremely expensive, Smith & Wesson found itself backlogged with orders for the four years that it produced the Registered Magnum. The Kansas City Police Department issued the Registered Magnum to its officers, and many other law enforcement officers across the United States carried the Registered Magnum. In 1939 Smith & Wesson stopped producing the Registered Magnum. It was replaced with the .357 Magnum. The .357 Magnum was available with barrel lengths of 3.5"", 5"", 6.5"" and 8.75"". Essentially the .357 Magnum was still the Registered Magnum, but standardized for ease of production and economy. The Smith & Wesson Model 28 ""Highway Patrolman"" was introduced as a lower cost version of the Model 27 in 1954, stripped of some of the features of the Model 27, such as polishing. 
It was noted for its durability and reliability. It was extremely popular with FBI agents from the 1940s through the 1960s. Skeeter Skelton considered the Model 27 with a 5"" barrel as the best all around handgun. General George Patton carried an ivory handled Registered Magnum with a 31/2 inch barrel (along with his ivory handled Colt Peacemaker); Patton called the Model 27 his ""killing gun."" 
This model features the target style trigger and hammer and the rare 5"" barrel. Single-action trigger is phenomenal on this piece, bright clean bore and smooth action.

One guy had that same pistol on here for $475 a couple of weeks ago.  If I want a brand new one bad enough, I'll just spend $250 and get a brand new one.  However, I just thought I'd check and see if anyone locally has one that got surprised by it's rather stout recoil and are looking to sell.  If you have a nice condition used one and don't have unrealistic expectations about it's value, drop me a line.  I don't mind stiff recoil for a pocket pistol.

I have a new in the box fully converted Soviet Saiga AK-47 in 7.62x39mm. The real AK-47 made in Russia because everything else are copies of these, and since they were banned from importation to the US they make an excellent investment compare to any other AKs.
This rifle was professionally custom converted with all the US parts that are required to comply to be legal. It accepts all standard AK mags and drums.
It has a factory installed side rail for scope mount, a Galil style metal side folding stock. Archangel pistol grip, the best grip for a AK in my opinion.
Also included a very nice new tactical case made by UTG.
Tapco trigger, considered the best trigger on the market. Tapco trigger group retaining plate, on safety bolt hold open, custom longer easy mag release, front picatinny rail to install a laser, flash light or a vertical grip. A tactical shorty vertical grip from CAA is also included, a AK-74 style muzzle break is professionally installed and secured on the threaded barrel in 14 x 1 LH threads.

It comes with 1 converted factory 10 round mag, 2 Tapco smooth side black polymer, 30 round mags, oil bottle, cleaning kit, cleaning rod, manual, and the box. All the parts, and accessories are brand new.
Cash only, No trades, buyer must be 18 or older, and have a valid Georgia ID. 
Priced for quick sale.
Thanks for looking."

I am also up for trading for ammo. 223/556, 12 guage, 9mm and 22LR specifically."

This is practically a brand new rifle. It was purchased a couple of months ago at Turner. It has exactly 180 rounds fired through it. I bought it for the indoor range and ended up getting an outdoor range membership for which I use larger rifles. This and the reason that the rifle feels kind of small in my hands is why I am deciding to sell it.

This rifle has a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. It is a solid rifle AND one of the very few in 9mm available anywhere and in CA in particular.

This rifle really shoots well. When cleaned and lubricated properly it is just a straight-shooting no FTF or FTE type of rifle. Cleaning and lubricating is truly all this rifle needs.

It has a fully adjustable rear sight. I've shot 1"" groups at 50 yds and, had I had a scope mounted on it, would easily have shot 2-3"" or better at a 100.

Brand new after taxes this exact rifle will run you about $690. The synthetic-stock one after tax = $580.

It comes with three ten-round magazines.

The strap on the picture is NOT included.

Go to Turners and check out the Citadel M1 Carbine 9MM 18"" Barrel Wood rifle. If you like it, this rifle is identical, at almost $200 the savings.

As per CA's firearms laws, transaction to take place at Turners at a mutually convenient time.

Thank you for looking."

(As a sidenote, no I will not ship, c'mon)

I have a Ruger SR40c, used once at the range; recently bought an M&P in 9mm and won't need this handgun. Handgun is chambered in 40 S&W and has a smaller body profile than full size SR40 (slide is the same size). Includes 2 magazines, full size SR40 (15-round with slide adapter) and compact SR40c magazine (9-round with thumb extender for grip). Compact design has the added perk of working with full size SR40 magazines. Handgun has several safety features, such as round loaded indicator, trigger safety (""Glock safety""), etc. Superior to SR9c due to higher caliber; argument is subjective to personal preferences. A better breakdown of the features and reviews can all be found online. 

Excellent slim profile and small size ideal for CCW holders/carriers. 

All original documents and box, including original safety lock (goes through the magazine slot when the slide is locked back), stickers, manual, etc. I can throw in a sturdier case for free.

For specifics, it's been used through 1 box of Federal ammo (50 rounds); cleaned it and don't get much use out of it. Price is fair due to associated tax/FFL transfer fees & background checks. I'm in no rush to sell, just hate to see this collect dust.

Will sell to Valid AZ ID holders 18 plus; CCW permit preferred. No shipping, trades, or sale to out of state ID holders."
