In fact, I take it the the range when I bring semi-automatics for unreliable  bulk .22's. It shot when my more expensive shooters did not. 
It's barrel is 4 5/8ths inches, and it is a six shooter. It has a hammer-blocking Safety, brass grip frame with black plastic grips with no chips or cracks. Get this, the chambers are recessed, a feature not found on many more expensive revolvers these days.  There is no rear sight, but it shoots to P.O.A. with the front sight aligned with the rear of the top strap. A fun plinker or trainer for your kids/ or grand kids. (The frame size is a bit small for me.) The finish is well worn, but that has no effect on it's shooting. 
 Sorry, no pictures, but my description is accurate. I don't want to drive around wasting time or gas, either.

This modification, sanctioned by the Indian government, was introduced to provide the indian police with a riot gun.

The magazine was removed and the magazine well fitted with a wooden plug, this acted as a filler and loading platform for the single shell. Finally the rear sight was pinned to eliminate adjustment.The chamber as stated, was designed to fit the British .410 shell unlike the standard 3"" .410 chamber. Shells for this rifle would have to be purchased in .410 British or fire formed .303 cases would have to be used and hand loaded, should the owner wish to go hunting.Built in 1942, converted in 1949.

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform.

The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot."

has proved it for years.  Now, the introduction of the Armalite SPR Mod 1 proves
it once more, in spectacular fashion.  The SPR Mod 1 is forged, one-piece upper
receiver/rail system with exclusive detachable side and bottom rails.
 
In true Armalite fashion, the SPR Mod 1 is like no other on the market.  With other one-piece systems, you're stuck forever with the rails you get at purchase, and stuck with their limits.
 
But Armalite knows you and your firearm often have more than one mission, and you want options.  Armalite gives you just that.  The SPR Mod 1's three o'clock, six o'clock, and nine o'clock rails are detachable.  That's right, you can change your 1913 rails to fit your changing needs for sights... lights...lasers...grips...or swivels.
 
Armalite takes that versatility even further.  Each SPR Mod 1 comes with three extra rails standard, at no extra cost.  We give you a 1913 rail with quick detchable sling swivel hole.  Each rifle comes with a low insert for when you need a bare rail with a low profile.  There's also a plain insert with a quick detach sling swivel hole.  Changing your rails...your add-ons...and your SPR Mod 1... is as easy as turning a torque wrench.
 
Ingenious versatility isn't the only reason you'll want an SPR Mod 1.  Its one-piece construction offers you a continuous optic platform (COP).  There's no gap to bridge between receiver and upper rail when you're installing your scope or sights.  This one-piece construction also gives the sighting platform extra rigidity.  It's a good, strong backbone.  That means your sights will stay zeroed in the most trying conditions.
 
The SPR Mod 1 typifies the ""Armalite Standard of Excellence.""  With us, quality comes standard.  There's no extra charge for: the SPR Mod 1's chrome lined, chrome moly vanadium steel barrel; its two-stage tactical trigger; the patented, extra strength steel bolt assembly; or the hard coated finish.  These are all things that the other companies consider options at an added cost.
 
The introduction of the new Armalite SPR Mod 1 is truly a new chapter in our history of innovation and our dedication to the quality you deserve."
