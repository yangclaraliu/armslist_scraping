Barnett's unique patent-protected, ultra-light, super-strong Carbonlite riser boasts an incredible 5-to-1 safety factor and provides the perfect balance of weight and speed.can ship also you can email me at REDACTED."

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

I also have about 500 more rounds of reloads but due to them being reloads, i dont think i can legally sell them with the pistol so id have to trade those off separate if you wanted them.  Its been my nightstand gun for a couple years.  I put a good 2000 rounds through it, then got a buddy of mine who works for sig to get me a free factory rebuild ( didnt need it, but it was free so why not) which is why it comes with the red case.  The barrel and all springs were replaced.  The new barrel has 400 rounds through it.  The light comes with a spare battery and is extremely bright.  It shoots great and other than a small scuff or two from being in the nght stand its in great shape.  If you want to test fire it before buying, i can meet at a local range and you can fire off a couple rounds to test function if you feel the need to.  I am asking 775 with the light, 700 without.  This des not include the reloaded ammo.  I dnt own another 40 so i would be willing to trade the reloads off if you want them, or ill end up holding on to them if you dont want them.  They are once fired brass loaded with titegroup and xtreme bullets.  I have the exact load data if you want it.  Id prefer to sell, but open to the trades below, or artial trades.  It shoots great and has a nice trigger, but i dont use it much anymore and really want to get a bolt action 223 so im using this sale to fund that."

BRAND NEW IN THE BOX , kel tec 9mm to 22lr upper conversion kit for kel tec pf9 , This kit is to convert your KelTec PF9 9mm hand gun into a Twisted Industries PF9-22 .22 caliber hand gun. The light weight construction reduces the firing weight by nearly a third (31% less). In fact, loaded with 10 rounds, the PF9-22 weighs .5 ounce less than the stock PF9 without a magazine. The Slide is made from aircraft quality 7075 aluminum. The 10 round magazine is also machined from billet aluminum. Practice for less money! Same gun, lighter weight and lighter on your wallet! Our kit is machined to the same basic dimensions and even uses the same sights as the PF9 to ensure you are getting the best practice for less money. No need to get a new holster or belt clip either. The one you have now will work with no modifications. Our kits are currently being CeraKoted at no extra charge. CeraKoting is much more durable and looks a lot nicer than standard anodizing. This kit includes everything you need to switch from 9mm to .22 LR in 20 seconds. The kit includes one aluminum magazine, but there is room in the box for two! Don’t forget your spare magazine! While supplies last, your magazines are CeraKoted to match your slide. Once supplies run out, all conversion kits will come with black CeraKoted magazines.

I also have about 500 more rounds of reloads but due to them being reloads, i dont think i can legally sell them with the pistol so id have to trade those off separate if you wanted them. Its been my nightstand gun for a couple years. I put a good 2000 rounds through it, then got a buddy of mine who works for sig to get me a free factory rebuild ( didnt need it, but it was free so why not) which is why it comes with the red case. The barrel and all springs were replaced. The new barrel has 400 rounds through it. The light comes with a spare battery and is extremely bright. It shoots great and other than a small scuff or two from being in the nght stand its in great shape. If you want to test fire it before buying, i can meet at a local range and you can fire off a couple rounds to test function if you feel the need to. I am asking 775 with the light, 700 without. This des not include the reloaded ammo. I dnt own another 40 so i would be willing to trade the reloads off if you want them, or ill end up holding on to them if you dont want them. They are once fired brass loaded with titegroup and xtreme bullets. I have the exact load data if you want it. Id prefer to sell, but open to the trades below, or artial trades. It shoots great and has a nice trigger, but i dont use it much anymore and really want to get a bolt action 223 so im using this sale to fund that."

This 1911 ELITE CARRY is the best 1911 carry money can buy.  Chambered in .45 it is an excellent personal defense weapon with a 3: barrel.  This gun is brand new and has never been shot.  I have shot many different Carry 1911’s and this gun holds its own against the know brands Kimber and Colt.  In my opinion its just as quality as a kimber but for less cost. It has a Stainless steel slide and aluminum frame. Stainless match grade barrel. Adjustable skeletonized trigger. Checkered mainspring housing (25 LPI). 2-dot dovetail rear sight and green fiber optic front sight. Beavertail grip safety. Black Ionbond/anodized finish. Cocobolo Double Diamond grips.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter and is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance."

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

THIS IS A PACKAGE DEAL ONLY. I WILL NOT SELL THE STREAMLIGHT SEPARATE SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK.

The only thing I may consider is keeping the Streamlight myself and selling everything else.

These Glock are very, very difficult to come by and they are no longer made or ever will make anymore. Gun broker has them going for $679.99+ tax stock with two mags

My price for everything is $900 and that is pretty firm. That’s including the $130 Streetlight and 6 extra mags that are easily $35 a piece. You’re welcome to do the math.

The gun belt is designed to hold cartridges. Willing to sell the gun separate from holster and belt. Asking $500 or best offer for revolver.Asking $80 for the belt and holster.

You must show me your LTC-A if you want to trade with me. We will follow the laws that Massachusetts has set up for residents, and we will comply with all of it. 

The magazine holster doesn't come with the gun (unless you have a single stack handgun, then we could trade). I will get more pictures later. To save us both money, we could meet somewhere to make the transfer and fill out E-FA 10 forms. It's easy and I've done it with my brother. If you would prefer to make the transfer at a gun shop, we can go to the one I go to in Uxbridge, but YOU will cover all transfer costs.

I'm mainly looking for another S&W, but let me know what what you have. I would prefer a 9mm over .380 ACP. The order of my preferences are as follows."

These Red dots provide a revolutionary step when it comes to red dot sights. These sights are the civilian model of the optics that are used by the IDF and other law enforcement agencies. They feature a large Eotech type window and also use a 1.8 MOA dot which provides rapid target acquisition. These optics are very well built, night vision compatible, and use a common AA battery! These optics have seen very little use and have only been zeroed for .223. The only reason I am selling is because I need to procure some funds. There are a number of great features to this optic that are awesome. Below is a more in depth description from the sights official importer.

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

I have a Sig P938 I would like to possibly trade for something else in 9mm,.357 mag,.44 special,.38 special,10mm,.357 Sig,or .45 acp. The Sig P938 has night sights that are still very bright.I might consider a .40,but it would need to be in something that is ported or has some sort of recoil system that significantly lowers the recoil because otherwise I find .40 to be more unpleasant to shoot than any other caliber I've shot.
It comes with 2 6 round magazines,Galco Leather OWB holster,and Uncle Mikes iwb holster.
