I'm selling off one of the guns to make some extra Christmas cash and this one would make an awesome gift for someone. 

Smith and Wesson M&P Shield in 9mm-- this one has hardly been shot at all. It's mainly just been sitting in the safe not being used. It's time for it to go to a new home. 
This one comes with 2 mags (one is 7rnd/one is 8rnd) the flush mag has the stock flush base plate and I bought a billet machined pinky extension base plate as well (currently mounted)
I bought it from another Armslist member and it did not come with the box or anything- just the gun and the mags. 

This sale includes the gun, 2 mags, and 100 rounds of ball ammo

Up for sale is a nice old 1933 Model 8 in 35 Remington Cal. (pretty sure that is the date from all the research I have done on it). This rifle does have an aftermarket recoil pad fitted, as well as an aftermarket Marbles Buckhorn rear sight. It has honest wear from being over 82 years old, but looks like it was well taken care of and not abused. I have fired a 3 shot group at 50 yards that was under 1 inch from a sitting position, so it is accurate. Always been reliable and they are known for being so. Bore is bright and shiny. These are takedown rifles as well if you didnt know that already. If you know your history, Frank Hammer used a Model 8 in 35 Remington to end the lives of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in Louisiana in 1934. This rifle was probably in someones gun cabinet at the time of that famous shooting. They are very cool rifles and still very capable of taking down any game animal in America if you know how to use it. I have some once fired brass for the rifle that will go with it at time of sale (dont know how much I have at this time yet).

The Douglas barrel offers more value and puts it in a class above the Thompson and Apex barrels.  I have no problems using 65gr IMR4198 or equivalent.   

I was not intending to sell the limb saver pad, scope or rings, but anything is negotiable.   Warne base goes with and trigger has had work to bring it to around 2.5lb.

4 various breech plugs will go with the gun. All 4 bp's are bored and threaded for a tungsten bushing. To buy the bp's separate would be 50 bucks each. They are all custom fit for this gun and are head spaced good with no apparent blow by.  They do not come with tungsten bushings or the lock rings.  

Also avail. is Swinglock dual form die with Full Form insert and Smooth insert ($200.00 value alone) also an 1 1/2"" barrel drop for bullet size testing. 

This is a turn key set up. If you're interested or have another offer let me know.

Asking $1000.00 for gun without sizing die, scope/ rings or limb saver butt pad.

If you respond or reply without including your name and other contact information, your email will be deleted as spam/phishing. I do Not Text! REad listing before wasting my time. Thank you. Factory built Romanian Dragunov sniper rifle in good condition in 7.62x54r (TGI FPK Dragunov). This rifle is a TG KNOX import NOT Century Int'l. As with all PSL variants, the bayonet lug is no longer intact and the barrel is threaded, but has a spot welded brake in place. These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are very reliable. The style Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a powerfull monster round similar to 30-06 ballistics. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. These features make the perfect long-range weapon for any situation. Nice condition with light surface rust due to in storage for a few years, fired approximately 20 rounds. Very reliable collector gun that will no longer be imported to the USA. NO SCOPE Not included. Only 1 10rd magazine included. Case also included as pictured. Nothing else included!!

Sometimes referred as the dash Two.

It was released in 2006 as an enhanced version of the Beretta 92, and is produced in 9Ã19mm, 9Ã21mm IMI and .40 S&W versions.Type F is a double/single-action (DA/SA) pistol with a manual safety that also serves as a hammer decocking lever. It operates in the same way as the Beretta 92F (M9) service pistol. Pushing the slide mounted safety lever down returns the hammer to its ""down"" position and also disconnects the trigger so that the pistol cannot be fired until the safety lever is pushed up into the ""fire"" position. There is also a half-cock safety notch.

The newly designed frame of 90two pistol ensures trouble-free insertion and holster extraction, thanks to its rounded and truly snag-free surfaces. Inside the frame, near the disassembly lever, a metallic recoil buffer reduces the impact of the slide assembly against the frame during the shooting cycle. By redistributing the stresses, the recoil buffer increases the service life of the firearm. Trigger guard is also rounded to ensure (when firing with two hands) the correct positioning of the supporting hand. 

 It uses 96fs magazines.

Has upgraded Trijicon night sights,removeable rail cover. Ambi mag release,ambi safety/decocker.
Comes with box(no manual or papers) 3 12 round mags, standard grips and extra slim grips.

As much as I love it, I've recently fallen into some financial difficulties so it needs a new owner that wonât neglect itâs needs of slinging lead down range!

This is the same version issued to troops in our armed forces, and as such it is the most tested combat optic on the market! Featuring bomb proof (literally) 4x magnification with a the red chevron style reticle along with the bullet drop compensating hash-marks that increase hit probability out to 800 meters for the 5.56/.223 cartridge.

Yes, I do have valid IDs and documents to prove it. If it makes a difference, you should also know that I'm an active duty Military Police Officer. I'm not a gun expert but I do understand the safety required when handling a firearm. I personally would like to purchase a Canik TP9SA or a Ruger P95. My reason is because they're pretty affordable and reliable. I'm a PFC in the Army, so that should tell you that I don't make a lot of money. But I'm still willing to spend a couple hundred bucks. Nothing over $375 though. Also if you didn't know, I feel that it's important that you do know that (According to Florida Law, a person over the age of 18 may lawfully possess a handgun, and may purchase a handgun from a private individual. However, Florida Law prohibits dealers from selling handguns to anyone under the age of 21.) If you don't believe me, take a look into it yourself. Please reply to this post if you're still willing to make a sell. And if you're not, please spread the word to anyone who you think will. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Once the budget-minded shooter has laid down his hard-earned cash for the SKS, heâs rewarded with a rifle whose quality is very disproportionate to its cost. If for some reason some manufacturer decided they were going to go into the business of building SKS rifles, new ones would undoubtedly be 6-8 times the price of what weâre buying now.

Total of 2070 rounds.

Asking .25 cents a round on the surplus TulAmmo
Asking .50 cents a round on the new Hornady

Questions about reloading...all is readily available on the web but briefly, here is what I found on these two rounds:
The Hornady has a Boxer primer and is reloadable.
The TulAmmo has Berdan primer and is reloadable but is more work than if it had a Boxer primer... Berdan primers are readily available for purchase.

Prefer local buyer that can pickup but will ship (shipping not included in this price).
The bulk cases should ship for about $20.00 to $25.00 apiece.
