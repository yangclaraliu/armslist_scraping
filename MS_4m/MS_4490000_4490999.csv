The bolt-action rifle was forever changed with the introduction of the Browning X-Bolt.

Most notable is an adjustable three-lever Feather Trigger™ system that offers the best feel on any Browning rifle ever. A bolt unlock button works with the top-tang safety to offer enhanced safety while unloading. Styling features offer more compact dimensions for a smaller, quicker, sleeker look and feel, and also trims weight. To ensure the stability of optics, scope bases are attached to the receiver using four screws per base. Innovation is the Browning tradition, and the X-Bolt is just the latest example.

I do have the box it came with as well as the factory barrel. I will be including the .40cal ammo I have which is around 100-150 target and 80-90 hollow points. The stippling was done by myself and took around 4 hours to complete. I do stippling as a side job so rest assured it was done correctly.

This is an arsenal refurbished rifle imported fairly recently by Group West from the Molot facility in Russia. Import marks are discreet and on the bottom of the barrel, hidden by the cleaning rod. No ugly importer's information on the receiver!

 The rifle itself is a 1943 round receiver M91/30 built in the Izhevsk plant. The rifling is sharp and bright, the crown is perfect, and the muzzle has not been counter bored. All numbers match on the rifle with the exception of the floorplate, which is a forced match [most likely replaced during arsenal refurbishment]. There are no signs of rust or pitting anywhere on the rifle. The scope and mount are authentic parts that were refurbished along with the rifle. The PU scope is properly zeroed using the mount for course adjustment, and the reticle is in the center of the field of view. Glass is clear edge-to-edge with no chips of cracks in the lenses. The scope and mount both match the original markings on the receiver, and none are forced matches.

 Included but not pictured are a complete soviet issue cleaning kit, a proper WWII sling [not a reproduction], and 150rds of Brown Bear 174g FMJ-BT ammunition. The scope is zeroed for this bullet because its trajectory most closely resembles the trajectory of the original WWII era 147g flat base ball ammo.

 Asking price is $800, or best reasonable offer. No trades please.

This rifle is all matching numbers to include the receiver, barrel, stock, bolt and magazine (magazine is a forced match, the others are not).  

This is not a Mitchell Mauser.  It is import stamped.

Previous arsenal and manufacture markings were scrubbed on this one, but are still visible.
Faintly below the 24/47 markings Royal Yugo markings can be seen, as well as the location of original manufacture (Artillery Technical Institute).  This makes original manufacture prewar (1928-31).  Hard to get a picture of this as it is so faint, but it is there and I certainly welcome anyone to inspect it in person if they wish.

There are also two scrubbed German acceptance stamps, one on the receiver, indicating that the action (not the rifle as it sits today) was seized and put into German service, and one on the bolt release.  So the action certainly saw combat during WWII.

The rifling is nearly flawless.  The rifle does have some surface rust on the receiver, but this is limited and there is no corrosion.  Not pretty but this rifle has been through a lot looking at the number/type of arsenal marks and stock markings.

Cycles great, shoots/groups dead on (though I don't have anywhere to shoot long range, so a little high at 100 yards as expected).

I have taken pictures of the rifle in and out, including all the markings should anyone wish to see more, ask questions etc.  

All and all would make an all matching good shooter with a little bit of history behind it.

This Ruger AR15 is a gas piston system, which is much cleaner than traditional direct impingement systems. This isn't your run of the mil average AR. Unfortunately, I'm moving and have to sell this fine piston-driven AR. 

It has adjustable iron sights, three sides of pic rails for accessories, and a hogue grip. It will also come with its original Ruger carrying case and a really nice (also pretty much new) three gun soft case (two rifles, one pistol), three (3) Magpul 30 round magazines (2 window mags, 1 standard), and sight adjustment tool. The gun retails for over $2,000, so this is a steal considering the gun is practically new (only ran 150 rounds through it).

OVERVIEW:

“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

Two gravity fed hoppers 
The marker has a Check It Spyder 15 Degree Assault Block Kit with gauge port and a pressure regulator. Upgraded hopper mount collar,I also have a complete spring kit (4 total) allowing for larger pressure adjustments than the range of the adjuster knob on back. Included also are the marker and tank fittings for a remote lone kit (the hose is not included was bad) with a new hose you have remote tank capabilities there are several paintball pods also. The following tanks are included but will need hydro testing before they can be filled and are sold as-is.
Nitro Duck 45 CI 3000psi HPA
20oz Aluminum Pure Energy CO2
12oz Chromoly Steel tank.
This would be good for getting into paintball with minimal expense before deciding to spend a fortune to play a couple times a year. Also fun for random stress relief on a piece of plywood in the back yard. 
Please make offer will accept reasonable trades. The DYE ultralight barrel alone is worth good money just look it up, almost half as much as I want for all of it."

The KSG is Kel-Tec's first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.


This shotgun is $1,000+Tax

If at any time you are unable to clean your Chameleon, send it to us and we'll clean it for free.SuppressionThe Chameleon series of rifle suppressors provide low weight, hearing safe centerfire rifle silencers that can be easily maintained and repaired. They will not disappoint.MaintenanceCleaning the Chameleon is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors.With the Chameleon full user servicability is truely a reality.The Chameleon core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Chameleon core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.Chameleon baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to disassemble your silencer is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Chameleon to ensure your safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Chameleon design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.SafetyThe Chameleon's Titanium exterior is fully protected by an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure."

This was an inheritance and I don't know exactly what it's worth... it is incredibly clean for a 50 year old American legend, and grandpa claimed it was worth a lot.

I've been watching gunbroker, armslist, facebook for weeks and I have yet to see one of these as old as this one listed anywhere, let alone one in this condition, so I guess only collectors know how much it's worth.
See serial number 504xxx in picture. I included serial number ranges at bottom too. (First tip is any 6 digit all numeric is pre-1970)

In other words, this is not a cheap one. It has been preserved 50 years.
NO lowball offers. (Lets just say $600 minimum).

Condition:
I was told not to clean it (have a pro do it). The barrel and cylinders are dusty but I did use a small toothbrush on small areas to confirm that the barrel rifling and cylinders look like new. 

The little bit of darkening on the grips is from me being an idiot and handling it... they were brighter so apparently I dirtied them by handling it too much in a couple weeks - it just feels so good to hold on to. Again would like to clean but feel I should leave this to a pro - the checkering is sharp and I don't want to wear it down.

The only noticeable flaw is a small scratched area about 1/2"" long on the right side of the frame above the cylinder (see pic).

Action perfect.
Cylinder release perfect.
Cylinder lock is tight... I thought maybe too tight but buddy says that is like new.

----------------------------------

Serial range indicates it was manufactured 1962 - 1969.
This does not have the ""flat latch"" cylinder release so it is 1966 or later.
And the original diamond grips mean it was before those ended 1968.
So it was manufactured 1966-1967, and by the serial we think '66."

$2,000 FIRM or trade for handgun(s) preferably 1911 or 1911 + cash but you never know, let me know what you have to trade.

I bought Every single piece on this rifle brand new and it took me over a year to acquire and finish the build. As much as it pains me to sell I would like to see it go to a good home. This rifle has never been fired and will stay like that till future owner decides to do so.

I have spent a lot of money on this Rifle buying top tier parts with the exception of a couple things.

This rifle is extremely light and the pictures do not do it justice unfortunately.

All parts that have been cerakoted in FDE are noted and are professionally cerakoted type H (heat treated)

I know I am missing some things, but I will try to keep adding as I remember.
