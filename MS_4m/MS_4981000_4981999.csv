I haven't done anything with it since so I know it's not broken in yet. It's practically a new gun. Also, it comes with a box of 25 Hornady critical defense ammo, 7 Corbin defense bullets, about 180 rounds of Remington .380 ammo, and a Blackhawk iwb holster. Buyer must have FL license and be of age.

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."
