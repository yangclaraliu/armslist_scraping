Higgins pump shotgun. This is a license-built variant of the Hi-Standard Model 200.

This shotgun is stamped 
""J.C. HIGGINS MODEL 20-12 GA.
SEARS, Roebuck, AND CO. 583.2002""
on the left side of  the barrel and
""PROOF TESTED 12 GA.
2 3/4"" CHAMBER""
on the right.

I'm going to be straight with you. The finish on this shotgun is not in the best condition. There is light pitting and discoloration on most exposed metal surfaces, and some areas where the pump mechanism contacts stationary parts are bare metal. There is some small object loose in the magazine tube that slides when you tilt it. I believe that this may be a loose part of the magazine plug. That being said, these issues appear to be purely cosmetic. The shotgun cycles shells and the hammer drops. The previous owner assures me that it fires and operates just fine.This shotgun does have a magazine plug installed. I only had 2 1/2 shells handy, and I could fit two in the magazine. There is enough further room where I am confident you could get two 2 3/4 inch shells in it. I considered removing the plug, but with fall and winter closing in I figure a buyer may want it.

This shotgun is a great way to get into home defense or fowl hunting on a budget. I have seen these shotguns trade for around 150-ish, and I have knocked that down a bit due to the aforementioned finish issues.

In 1943, the Argentine Military Small Arms Factory (FMAP - Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles) began to prepare for the manufacture of Model 1927 pistols under the 1927 licensing agreement. These pistols were known as ""Pistola Sistema ""Colt"" Modelo Argentino 1927, Calibre 11,25mm."" Production began at the Esteban de Luca Arsenal in Buenos Aires, with the first pistols actually being assembled at the Domingo Matheu plant in Rosario, Argentina in 1945. The pistols were manufactured in accordance with Colt's 1927 drawings. They were exact copies of Colt's 1927 pistols (identical to US military M1911A1 pistols) except for very minor differences, and parts were interchangeable. The only noticeable differences were the markings, grips, black oxide bluing, a sharp edge on the rear of the hammer, and a sharp edge on the heel of the grip safety. Triggers were solid as on the 1927 Colts , and the checkering on the mainspring housing was changed from Colt type cut checkering to indented checkering.
The Sistema Colt pistols were made for the army, navy, air force, government bureaus, police organizations, and commercial sales. They were normally serial numbered on the right side of the receiver, the grip frame under the mainspring housing, on the top and right side of the slide, on the top of the chamber and the bottom of the magazine. The presence of an Argentine crest on the pistol indicates government issue; pistols without crests were made for local police, non-government agencies, commercial sales and export. All Sistema Colt pistols bear the marking D.G.F.M. - (F.M.A.P.) on the left side of the slide, which indicates manufacture by the Direccion General de Fabricaciones Militares at the Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles. A total of 88,494 Sistema Colt pistols were produced.

I bought this one with a synthetic pistol grip and fore end (included w/ purchase or trade).  Later I found the wood furniture and made this thing into something of a modern Ithaca trench gun.  Everybody who shoots this thing loves it.  There's something about the wood stock that is so much more satisfying than the synthetic ""tacticool"" crap out there.  I will also include the guitar case that I made for this thing (as it did not come with a case) and about 30-40 (total) rounds of 00 and 0 buck (I think there's some #4 in there as well).

Anyway, it's a great gun, and functions as well and reliably as a pump shotgun should, but I'm looking for a nice carry piece now.  I live in apartments and small areas so if I were ever in a home defense situation I would go for one of my pistols before this monster (don't want to hurt my neighbors).

Not really looking to sell, but if I do, then I need enough to buy a carry piece, holster, and maybe a couple of mags.  I'm a poor student so I'm only looking for straight up trades or trade with cash on your end.

Specs:

Bead sight (can accept rear sights…planned on putting them on but never got around to it [they always seem to be backordered on the Mossberg website]).

Dad brought the rifle back with him after the war (no perceived story of “a bring back”, the honest truth). The rifle barrel is marked RA, ordnance bomb, 11-43.  The serial number is 4107083.  The wood inspection stamps, cartouches and proof marks are all crisp. It is all original and in outstanding condition.  The wood and metal are superb. Only the smallest of handling marks on the wood that I had to look hard to find.  The metal is in as issued, like new condition. The follower does not have any scrapes or scratches, thus I am not sure it has ever had a round loaded in it or even been shot.  This is a $1200-$1500 rifle by anyone’s estimate.

BUT!!!  When Dad brought it home, he wanted to make it into a deer rifle.  So he had the receiver drilled and tapped and put scope mounts on it.  Then, he grinded off part of the bolt handle so a scope would have clearance.  I know, I know …..  but remember back then there were thousands of these around so they were not special, even in outstanding condition. While Dad had the scope mounts installed, he never put a scope on it and never took it hunting.  He never even shot it.  So it has been sitting in his (or his son’s) closet for the last 70 years. Dad is in his last stages of life and his son does not want it.  That is why I am helping him find a home for it with someone who will appreciate the history of this fine rifle.

This rifle could be used in many ways.  Mount a modern scope on it and it would be the coolest hunting rifle on the range….. replace the bolt and scope mounts with the original bolt, scope mounts and scope from the war years…… replace the bolt with and original, put on an original rear sight (which would cover the rear scope mount hole) and fill the holes on the front of the receiver and return it to its as manufactured condition…… or just keep it as it is with a great story and a great piece of personal and war history.

I have many more pictures, just email me to request.... it is in excellent condition!"

Although this one is unfired, I’ve had several and they are remarkably accurate and solid shooters. The slide feels like it’s on ball bearings and the handgun is typical Hi-Standard: as in “heavy.”



What sets this one apart, besides the fact that it’s never been fired? Included is an extra barrel: 6-inches, professionally machined and modified to accept a muzzle brake or suppressor. This extra barrel is also in factory-new condition and the story passed down was that it was a “factory prototype”. Sounds far-fetched, except for one thing: the threaded socket which accepts the M-101s thumbscrew needs to be tapped about 1 – 2 more threads to snugly tighten down onto the frame of the handgun. Seems like a simple task, but I’ve chosen, over the years, to leave it alone because that one “flaw” attests to the authenticity of the story. 

Either of these two items would be unusual by itself. Together, they are a rare and interesting combination.

Handgun is in 10/10 condition. No marks. No wear. Ditto the extra barrel. Bluing is perfect except for the machined areas on the extra barrel. See pics. Again, it would have been simple to have it blued by a gunsmith but precision of the machining is evidenced by which areas are blued and which areas are not. 

Comes with 2 authentic (not aftermarket) High Standard 10-rd magazines, which show some minor wear from hand-loading, but otherwise appear to be brand new and unused. The outside of the box shows some wear, but S/N is intact."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Now available with either Contrast or SIGLITE Night Sights.

 This is a very rare and hard to find K98 in this condition.   The blue is still very strong with light freckling, every number matches, and it includes the sight hood and cleaning rod which are normally missing.   The rifle is duffle cut, indicating that it was a WW2 bring back.  The only negative I can find on this rifle is that the stock was lightly sanded, but it has a beautiful blonde laminate and it is the original, correct stock.  The serial numbers are still present as are the markings in the wood, but you have to look from different angles to see all of them.  Every mark and number on the metal is crisp and correct.   For those of you who collect K98s, you know how much these have been selling for.   The sling is original (not shown in photos, but included) and would bring well over a hundred dollars by itself.  

My asking price is more than fair and I will include more than half a ammo can of 8mm ammo to go with it.  

I am in Evansville and will allow the buyer to fully inspect, research, and photograph the rifle before purchasing.  I do NOT want to fully disassemble the rifle, but I will if the buyer has cash in hand and the deal is contingent on that.   I took it apart once to check serial numbers (they matched) but I don't want to make a habit of breaking down a high end, 75 year old gun for tire kickers."

The straight hand stock was select walnut. All were in caliber .30-30 Winchester. This is a rifle (26"") barrel length.

Processing offered for the 2013 at the rate of $100 per thousand. I could do the LR as well, but if your buying that I assume you want to do it yourself. This would include resize/deprime, swaging primer pockets, trimming to 2.005 +- .003, and tumbling lube off. Necks can be left a little long if you want to bump them back yourself, otherwise they'll be sized to properly fit a Dillon case gauge. A Lyman m die is used after the trim die to open the neck up without changing trim length. There may be a delay on processed brass of a few days as I build it to order.

This shotgun was my Grandfathers
It has a good stock with scratches  and loss of some bluing on the barrel. These guns are very hard to find and the ball bearing slide action is regarded very highly among many shotgun connoisseurs. The serial number is in the early run of 70,000. It's a good reliable shotgun and would be a good addition to anyone's collection."

This shotgun is used and shows signs of wear. However, It is in perfect working order and runs like a top. I ran 25 rounds of buckshot and 15 slugs through it yesterday.
The case is a Plano and is included. I configured it for the shotgun, a Glock 27, 2 magazines, 2 boxes of pistol ammo (stacked in that slot), 2 15 round boxes of slug, 1 25 round of buckshot, and 6 slots for individual shells. You can pull out a few more squares and make room for a larger pistol. The case has 5 latches, 1 that locks with keys included (was 2 but one broke), and 2 external lock points for padlocks. 

I am mostly looking to trade for handguns, and I am open to a wide variety. My primary caliber is .40 S&W and I like Glocks. Feel free to offer 2 cheaper pistols, or cheaper pistols +cash. Keltecs and Taurus  are ok, but please no jennings, brycos, mini revolvers, derringers ect...

While still marked ""1911"", these pistols had the new improvements that would eventually cause the pistol to be renamed ""1911A1"". This is one of the early transition pistols with the WTG monogram enclosed within a single circle formed by his initial G. Roughly 2000 pistols were marked in this manner and this is a very hard variation for the collector to locate.

he seriffed ""H"" proofs are properly matching on both the slide and frame. The intertwined HP barrel is also of the correct type and has the proper “K” stamping on the bottom. The barrel itself appears to have been refinished and the crown at the muzzle is more flattened than usual. The pistol wears a very nice set of 28 row full checkered walnut grips that were issued as one the transitional changes. This fine single circled monogram piece of history was shipped February 7, 1924 in a shipment of 1000 to the Commanding officer of Springfield Armory.
