Its a custom built A/R in 5.56/.223. Has a S&W M&P15 (not the cheap sport model) upper, a Rock River Arms lower, a Troy Alpha one piece free float rail, a Troy muzzle brake, a magpul MOE vertical grip, a BCM pistol grip, a magpul 6 position adjustable stock, magpul MBUS flip up fron and rear sights, a magpul BAD lever and more (as you can see from the pictures). It is in a genuine pelican case with custom cut foam (pistol not included with any sale, trade or trade + cash)

 Some of the extras I have that could go with it in the right trade include :
 - 6 magpul PMAG 30rd mags with windows (all new, unused, 2 unopened)
 - 6 magpul PMAG 30rd mags (5 new, unused, 2 unopened - 1 used 2 times)
 - 1 magpul PMAG 45rd mag (new, unused)

 Gun has about 40rds through it total since new. Shoots great. By far the best AR I have ever owned, but I don't believe in safe queens and that's what she has become. Obviously she is clean and frog lubed, ready for a new home if the deal is right. Cash, trade or cash+trade offers will all be considered. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions. I will not let it go for nothing, so please don't waste both of our times.

 I have many other pics, just ask. Posted price is at a loss of over $900 to me, but that's the gun game, and I am willing to negotiate."

This pistol was made in 1918. This would have originally been what is referred to as a ""Black Army"". When I purchased it it had suffered the indignity of a poor cold blue. I removed the cold blue and was going to have it parked but I have other projects that are more pressing at the time. Pistol is complete and appears fully functional. All markings are clear, would look really good reparked. The slide is more of a dull gray and the frame a little more reddish brown. Still has a slight cold blue smell. Once again, fine for a shooter or would be fine reparked. Im not sure who made the barrel, the symbol in the pictures in the only mark I see. Bore is fair-good, shootable but dark and a little fuzzy from corrosive ammo use. Comes with one 1980's contract magazine.

This pistol was made in 1918. This would have originally been what is referred to as a ""Black Army"". When I purchased it it had suffered the indignity of a poor cold blue. I removed the cold blue and was going to have it parked but I have other projects that are more pressing at the time. Pistol is complete and appears fully functional. All markings are clear, would look really good reparked. The slide is more of a dull gray and the frame a little more reddish brown. Still has a slight cold blue smell. Once again, fine for a shooter or would be fine reparked. Im not sure who made the barrel, the symbol in the pictures in the only mark I see. Bore is fair-good, shootable but dark and a little fuzzy from corrosive ammo use. Comes with one 1980's contract magazine.  There is a guy in brownsburg who will park a pistol for $80, I just don't have the time to get it done.

History:

George Kellgren, an Engineer from Sweden, moved to the US in 1979, and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987. In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded. The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company.

We used it for the first three years minimally, and then we drained and winterized it for the last two years. Its a. Catalina Spa, rated the best at the time. It holds 6 people, and has a lot of features. 

I just filled it up today with fresh water, to make sure that it is working properly. The lights, heater, pumps waterfall, all work just like a dream. A few plastic levers need replacing. They are a generic item. The door that covers the control panel has warped. Any handyman can fashion a new one. You can also order one direct from Catalina Spas. The spa has a radio/cd player with 2 speakers. The radio worked for a few minutes then? Most likely has loose wiring harness im guessing. I
Radio has power but no sound. Lastly, it needs a cover. The cover wore out, so we had it shrink wrapped for storage. They can also be purchased online for around $300. Comes with steps to get inside, all the chemicals you need. You just need a couple filters. 

We have NEVER had a problem with the spa. It has performed flawlessly. We are selling it because we never use it, and thats a shame. Someone with arthritis, fibromyalgia, or just for entertaining, its a lot of fun with minimal maintenance. 
It just needs a little tlc to be perfect. You can use it just like it is for sure, just need to purchase a cover for the winter. Im fixing to drain and clean it today. 10/5/15 1130 am. I just took these pics a half hour ago with it filled and running. Thanks for your time. God Bless. Have a great weekend. Trade for firearms of equal value. Thanks."

(The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, 1000yrd iron sights with a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeat ability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability. )"

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

It is right hand orientation.  You can email or text 843-345-nine840.  The holster sells for $109 and the information below is from Raven Concealment's website:

The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged. Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians.

The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile, in conjunction with our Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.

We construct the body of the holster from thin, high-strength Kydex-T. We chose to use a pancake-style design in order to minimize bulk and distribute the weight of the firearm over a wider area on the belt. The “outside” portion of the holster body fully enshrouds the weapon from ejection port to muzzle. The “inside” or “body-side” portion of the holster incorporates a full-length body shield. This enhances comfort and aids in re-holstering, while simultaneously protecting the controls of the pistol.

The Phantom ships with your choice of belt mounting option. All Phantoms are designed around the Eclipse Modular Mounting System, and are therefore compatible with all Eclipse Modular Accessories. Through the use of Eclipse Modular Accessories, the Phantom can be converted to one of over 20 different styles of OWB or IWB carry.

The Phantom Modular Holster has been proven under fire through heavy daily use around the globe for over five years. Since its introduction, tens of thousands of Phantoms have been used for everything from day-to-day concealed carry by civilians to offensive operations by Tier-1 military units. No other holster even approaches the versatility and functionality of the Phantom. Nor does any copycat product have the proven track record of the RCS Phantom.

Our Light Compatible models now allow you to comfortably carry and conceal your weapon with a light mounted to the accessory rail. No more fumbling with a tertiary light, or carrying a rail mounted light with the vain hope of mounting it during a stressful moment. Your light is on the gun and instantly usable when seconds count."

This is an old Browning Bantam XL compound bow.  It was given to me years ago in its current condition (unstrung) and I never got around to having it put together or tested.  It appears to be in good condition, but given its age I would urge a bit of caution when using it - definitely have it checked over first.  Comes with the vinyl case you can see in one of the pictures.  

Given its age and condition, I'm not looking for much, in fact I would probably trade it away for a box of ammo (9mm, 40s&w, .223) or black power supplies.  Make an offer, the worst I can do is say no thank you."

The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market.

When going to the range, she prefers to shoot .22 pistols or her .38 revolver. Less that 50 rounds has been shot through the pistol. It really is an amazing gun. The pistol has an incredibly low bore to axis ratio which  causes the gun to have very low muzzle rise and recoil. Grip is fantastic and fits your hand like a glove. I would keep but I already have a carry weapon that I have used for years. I researched 9mm pistols for a month before I settled on this one for my wife. It seems to be the softest shooting 9mm on the market. All of the reviewers speak highly of the Steyr. I paid $500 for the pistol, case and two 17 round magazines. I am also including two additional 15 round magazines that cost me $35 each.

The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

I've had tons of fun with it, but I'd like to get something a little more practical.

This is the original Mark I model from the 1980's. It was made by Israel Military Industries (Now known as IWI), and is built very solid. 

The gun is very lightly used condition. I'd rate it 9.5/10. Its been treated well and never abused. I've probably run 200-300 of my own handloads through it without one single jam. It runs great with Magtech, privi partizan, Hornady, or really any kind of hot loaded jacketed ammo from 225gr to 300gr. I've never tried anything below 225gr.

This comes with the original IMI formed padded case, cleaning kit, and 6 factory magazines, and one promag, which actually works believe it or not. lol. That's 7 magazines total! Each are worth at least $30 a piece. Many of these mags do have light rust on them, but they all work great.

I'll also throw in 20 rounds of 240gr XTP handloads.

Face to face sale/trade ONLY! No exceptions!

Buyers/traders must be willing to meet in the greater Dayton Area. Preferably near a gun shop.

If you're interested in Ammo, I have 200 rounds of 240gr Hornady XTP handloads I can add for about $25 for 50 rounds."

*Additional info*
The Geiselle trigger was installed and recommended from a technician at a local gun shop. If you know about these triggers then skip to the next paragraph, you already know this stuff. Anyway, Geiselle triggers are found on many of the champion 3-gunner's rifles. They are machined to intense standards and are now becoming the norm for competition shooters, as well as law enforcement and military. The break and smoothness of this trigger compared to any stock AR trigger is of no comparison. I'm not saying that Geiselle is the only trigger on the market, but when speaking with professionals, it is a name that comes up often. A quick Youtube search will tell you everything you need to know about these amazing trigger groups (and their equally interesting inventor). Last point, I have had a few friends (both law enforcement professionals) try the rifle after the new trigger was installed and they ordered ones for their rifles THE SAME WEEK (different models, but same company). Yeah, that should say it all.



If you can't tell, I set up this rifle package to be used for rifle classes to be taken in the summer/fall of 2015. Life happens and that didn't quite work out. The rifle is clean and well taken care of. Barrel was always cleaned/lubricated after firing and the upper and lower receiver are clean and rust free. Not interested in trades at this time. Thanks for looking. Have a great lunch!!

P.S. More pictures available. Just ask and I’ll email more. :)

The M70 AB2 by Century International Arms pays homage to its roots by keeping the same qualities and performance. Utilizing the same long-stroke gas piston system as the venerated AK-47 platform, the M70 AB2 is known for its reliable operation and has proven itself time and again. Despite the similarities, the M70 AB2 has special features that set it apart from its Kalashnikov predecessor. Most notably the M70's receiver is 1.5mm thicker, making it more durable with a longer service life. Unlike the AK-47, the M70 does not have a chrome-lined barrel, providing an increase in accuracy. Three cooling slots on the handguard dissipate the heat, allowing the user to comfortably operate the firearm even for prolonged periods of fire. An under-folding stock allows for compact and easy handling in close-quarter operations.

It has been shot and does have very minor handling marks (it was used for competition more than 20 years ago) but like I said, it is in great shape and is an original, Made in Finland Valmet... not a Finnwerk or Tikka. Also, this is NOT a 412, or a 412S; this is the top of the line 412ST. This shotgun has been described as ""a miser's Krieghoff"" as it extremely similar to a K. but retailed for $2K instead of $4K. Same designs... just a different country after the war. This model has a 3"" chamber and a whopping 34"" barrel.
