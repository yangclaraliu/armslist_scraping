The P99 was developed for law enforcement, security forces and the civilian shooting market as a replacement for the Walther P5 and the P88. It is a striker-fired pistol with a polymer frame and 'Tenifer' treated steel slide. The polymer grip has interchangeable palmswells. The striker-fired action is unique in that operates in a double-action (DA/AS) mode similar to that of hammer-fired pistols. Also unique to the P99 is a decocking button recessed into the top of the slide, rather than a conventional lever usually found on the side. Other features include an integrated accessory rail and both a loaded chamber and a cocked status indicator.

History:

George Kellgren, an Engineer from Sweden, moved to the US in 1979, and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987. In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded. The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company. He founded another firearms company, Kel-Tec CNC Industries, or better known as Kel-Tec, and began producing firearms once again in 1995. In 2011, Mr. Kellgren produced the PMR-30, which was modeled from his earlier P-30 design."

The short barrel and minimalist grips make this weapon surprisingly concealable, given that it is an L-frame revolver, yet the cylinder capacity, adjustable sights, and recoil-dampening weight make it much more effective, accurate, and versatile than the typical J-frame snubs that normally fill the role of concealed carry revolvers.  The holster I am selling with it is the PERFECT holster for this gun, and makes it dissappear comfortably under normal outerwear, without the barrel or holster being visible underneath, and without the setup bothering you while you are sitting down or driving.

The gun is new production (purchased 1 year ago), has had maybe 200 rounds through it or so, is in perfect mechanical condition, and has no corrosion or visible wear whatsoever.  I am selling it because I am hard up for cash right now, and, truth be told, I am personally quite comfortable concealing my larger handguns, and I just don't really need this piece, as much as I like it.

I'm dropping the price from $650 to $550. You're not going to get a deal like this at the gun store!"

This version of the SUB-2000 will accept Glock 22 .40 S&W magazines.The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16″ x 7″ to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:  ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   Product DescriptionThe CZ 75D PCR is identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $535.

this is a gas piston upper which means no fouling gas going back into your upper. make your rifle ultra dependent and run cooler!!!
info

The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the m4 style handguards. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward eject, like in the FN 2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Obviously, the bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable).The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations.

Timing and lock up are just like the day it left S&W.  The trigger pulls are as smooth or smoother than any gun the PC turns out today. Fit and finish are second to none and the stainless looks wet no matter which way you turn the gun. Its exactly like the day it left S&W except for the Black and Silver grips with the S&W medallions. Also comes with all front sight blades 8 of them that can be changed in a matter of seconds with out tools and case locking key still in factory envelope along with build certificate all housed in a beautiful Mahogany Case that's in mint condition as well. The most accurate 44 S&W ever made as well as a sought after collector gun. Will trade for items listed below and some may require add cash from you. Thanks for looking.

""The Covert Rifle Bag was designed at the request of armed professionals who were looking for the most discreet way to transport a ready to use weapons system in some of the worlds most dangerous environments where the consequences of being discovered would be dire.
There are only so many ways to hide an object with a fixed set of dimensions. Change the object or use a version of camoflage that  tricks the mind into thinking the object is something else.  With external bungees and daisy chain  for securing non gun items, rounded edges and designed to be carried over the shoulder like a quiver or backpack the CRB blends into enviornments where a traditional squared off discreet case might get ""Made"" more easily.  The CRB  looks enough like a sports equipment bag or hiking backpack that it does not immediately scream ""Gun Inside Here""  to bystanders.  We think we struck a nice balance here because you do not need tp dissasemble your loaded weapons, making them faster to get into action while also having a profile that gives you extra time if you are under scrutiny in a denied area.""

Unlike the current offering, the original CRB had an empty external pocket, so their shoulder utility bag (SUB) could fit in there.  The SUB has shoulder and leg straps to facilitate rapid reloading of the rifle and access to a pistol and other items within.

The current prices are $160 for the CRB and the medium SUB is $62.50. Used a couple of times, like new, but more covert and ready-to-go complete than the current model."

If you hunt coyote, this is a great tool. Find a road-killed critter and set it up 75 or 100 yards away; can be effectively used in complete darkness out to about 300 yards or more. Sight this scope in to that distance and wait for the coyotes to come in after dark. The IR illuminator will make their eyes blaze and the 4 power magnification will make finding your target a piece of cake.

It have NEVER BEEN FIRED!!! This is the Cadillac of the Sig p229 model line; you will not find a more beautiful and well made production pistol. The pics do not even come close to doing justice on what a work of art this pistol is, must see in person.

It has the short reset trigger so when firing in single action, the trigger pull is very crisp at about 3-4 pounds and resets after about an 1/8"". It has a steel frame so it's not light like the aluminum alloy pistols; extremely well built and absorbs a great deal of recoil. It is a great shooter and it has factory night sights installed. This gun is impossible to find right now and sells for around 1,300.00 new plus tax if you can find it. Comes with the pistol, (2) 15 round mags, carrying case, owners manual, lock and key, etc.

SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The P229 Elite is available in 9mm & .40 S&W. The P229 Elite Stainless features a stainless steel slide and frame in a natural stainless finish. 

Cash price is $1100. This is extremely fair considering the quality of this piece, it's availability (or lack thereof), if you can find it you are looking at around $1300, and the fact that it is never been fired. Low ball or trade offers will be deleted without a response.  I do not need to sell, and have no issues holding on to it. Only reason I am selling is to fund another project that has my interest.

This is the gun that started the DX craze. Its like new not a scratch and looks amazing. The timing and lock up are just like the day it left S&W.  The trigger pulls are as smooth or smoother than any gun the PC turns out today. Fit and finish are second to none and the stainless looks wet no matter which way you turn the gun. The gun is exactly like the day it was purchased from Hyatt's Guns in 91 except for the custom Black Silver Grips with the S&W Medallions. Comes with all front sight blades it left S&W with 8 of them that can be changed in a matter of seconds without tools plus build certificate and case locking key still in factory envelope as well as factory combat grips all housed in a Beautiful Solid Mahogany Display Case that's in mint condition as well. The most accurate 44 S&W ever made plus a sought after collector gun. Thanks for looking. Will trade for items listed below and some may require add cash from you.

It have NEVER BEEN FIRED!!! This is the Cadillac of the Sig p229 model line; you will not find a more beautiful and well made production pistol. The pics do not even come close to doing justice on what a work of art this pistol is, must see in person.

It has the short reset trigger so when firing in single action, the trigger pull is very crisp at about 3-4 pounds and resets after about an 1/8"". It has a steel frame so it's not light like the aluminum alloy pistols; extremely well built and absorbs a great deal of recoil. It is a great shooter and it has factory night sights installed. This gun is impossible to find right now and sells for around 1,300.00 new plus tax if you can find it. Comes with the pistol, (2) 15 round mags, carrying case, owners manual, lock and key, etc.

P229 Elite features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights, custom wood grips and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. 

SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The P229 Elite is available in 9mm & .40 S&W. The P229 Elite Stainless features a stainless steel slide and frame in a natural stainless finish. 

Cash price is $1100. This is extremely fair considering the quality of this piece, it's availability (or lack thereof), if you can find it you are looking at around $1300, and the fact that it is never been fired. Low ball or trade offers will be deleted without a response.  I do not need to sell, and have no issues holding on to it. Only reason I am selling is to fund another project that has my interest.

I have only used it once. I'm selling it because it is a little bigger than what I need. This bag is 100% Made in America at Tactical Tailor's factory in Lakewood, WA. This is high quality workmanship, with proper care it will probably last forever. If you need to get all your stuff in one bag this is the one for you.

When I bought it they were selling them for $425 + tax brought it to $463. Now Tactical Tailor has lowered their price to $300. So I've lowered my price also. My price is $250. If you buy it at their retail store it's going to cost you $325 with tax.
The one I'm selling is like new with only a few cosmetic wear marks.

Here is a link to Tactical Tailor's site showing the bag with all the info you need. 

http://www.tacticaltailor.com/rollingdufflebag.aspx

I prefer cash but I'm open to an ammo trade or a combo of cash and ammo. For example $200 cash and 100 rounds of 5.56. If you're going to offer an ammo trade I only want factory loads of FMJ 5.56/223 or 9mm. 1 round 5.56/223 = .50¢, 1 round 9mm = .25¢

I'll meet anywhere along I-5 between Exit 137 and Exit 111. If you want me to drive further than that the price will be higher.

I was told that the 4"" internal tubes are broken off and would need repaired for it to fire. The wood is not cracked and appears to be original, beed and both barrel inserts are in place and appear to be in working order. The gun does have various dings, scratches, and the finish is worn. Please look at the pictures closely. Condition is as you see it and please call or e-mail for any questions or want additional pictures. I am selling this for a family estate.

Below is a full description as well as a web page that explains it in detail.

This is a dandy little lightweight laser that will fit most any rail-equipped rifle, shotgun, or pistol, giving the shooter a very effective sight for use in most all lighting conditions, even total darkness. Now, Crimson Trace has introduced the CMR-202 Rail Master white light. This light is exceptionally lightweight and compact, but has a light output of 100 lumens, and is really useful for lighting up the night.

The CMR-202 comes with four different rail adaptors, to fit most any railed weapon. Activation is very easy, with ambidextrous switches to activate the light. The CMR-202 can run in three modes; constant “ON”, strobe, or pulsed; staying on only when the switch is pressed inward. On a handgun, the switch is positioned to fall right under the trigger finger as the weapon is drawn from its holster, providing an almost instant activation if needed.

The CMR-202 is easy to install, and comes with battery, which reportedly has a life of about four hours run time. All that is needed to install is a screw driver. I tried the Rail Master light on three different handguns, all with varying rail designs, and also on a Picatinny-railed hand guard on an AR-15. On every weapon tried, it fit well and worked perfectly.

This is a completely custom, built from the ground up AR-15, multi-cal (shoots 5.56 and .223 without issue). It was constructed with the expert help of Trinity Munitions in Littleton.

It has had only 30 rounds fired through it to test it just this week, and boy, is it fantastic. Other than that, it is completely brand new. All parts and accessories are higher end. Everything you see in the picture below, you get with it. Here's the package:

Upper Recieiver
 - M4 Profile barrel
 - Fortis RED Muzzle Brake 5.56MM F-RED
 - Fixed Front Post w/ sling mount, Carbine distance
 - Magpul Black MLOK carbine-length handguard, mount for light
 - Magpul MLOK Hand Stop Kit, Black
 - Surefire M620 Ultra Scout Light w/ M93 Swing lever clamp
 - Delton Multi-Cal Upper
 - WMD Nickel-Boron Bolt Carrier Group
 - Strike Industries Black Dust Cover, Multi-Cal variant
 - Vortex Strikefire 2 Electronic Red dot sight
 - Magpul MBUS Rear Flip up, cowitnesses with front post and sight
 - Strike Industries CH223 Charging Handle With extended latch
 - Mil-Spec forward assist

Lower Reciever
 - Trinity Munitons Custom Lower, drop magwell
 - Seekins Precision 60 degree Black ambidextrous fire selector
 - Seekins Precision Black Billet Release Button
 - Seekins Precision Black Enhanced Bolt Catch
 - Troy Ambidextrous Magazine Release
 - Magpul Aluminum Enhanced Trigger Guard
 - Mil-Spec Trigger group
 - Magpul MOE+ Pistol Grip
 - Magpul ASAP QD Ambidextrous Sling Attachment Point
 - Mil-Spec 5 position buffer tube
 - Magpul Black CTR stock, extended pad, mil-spec

Comes with
 - Magpul MOE Carbine Stock, Mil-spec
 - Standard A2 pistol grip
 - 2X Tapco 30rd Black Magazine Parts kits
 - 2X Magpul Gen 2 Windowed 30rd Pmag Parts kits, Ranger plates attached
 - Standard pmag floorplates and spare ranger plate
 - Magpul Maglink for the Pmags
 - Boxes for CTR stock and Maglink
 - The pile of .223 reloads, good to fire, you see below.

This price is very reasonable. The Vortex is about $180 in itself, and the Surefire is $529 from their site, and starts at $389 on Amazon. This is not a cheap rifle - there are very few ways one can upgrade it further. The accessories and parts are not cheap, and you get a fancy AR that is already assembled and tested.

If you're wondering why this is being sold, It is because this epic rifle is just sitting in the safe while I baby newer projects. It deserves some love.

Price is firm, in cash, no trades. If you want it, contact me through the site, and we can arrange a meet-up at an FFL somewhere in the Denver/Castle Rock/Colorado Springs Area. You pay transfer fee, and walk away with everything above."

A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.
The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.

Model 99 in action

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on."

The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition. PRODUCT SPECSItem Number: DB9FSCaliber: 9x19MMLength: 7.8”Height: 5.6”Width: 1”Barrel Length: 4.75”Distance Between Sights: 6.25”Weight (unloaded): 21.5 ozTrigger Pull: ≈5.5#Magazine Capacity: 15+1 RdsUPC: REDACTED86"

On rebuild all springs were replace with Wolf springs to include mags, and the gas piston and gas piston nut were also replaced.

It is an interesting one. It had an IBM receiver and barrel and all other components were Quality Hardware. Most probably during a group preserve or de-preserve operation, someone probably got the right receiver and barrel with the wrong set of parts. All parts and the Stock are Quality Hardware with the proper markings. Both cartouches on the stock (Left Slingwell and Right stock) are QH and very visible. 
It has the late style rear sight, but all other features like the barrel band, mag release, safety, etc. are all early feature and QH.

Comes with the rifle, 2 ea. 15 rd Mags (WWII vintage U marked (pristine), not Korean), Buttstock Mag Pouch (original WWII not a reproduction), Sling and Oiler which are reproduction, and the original I-BR marked barrel which I re-parkerized as well in case you want to reinstall it. Headspace with old barrel checked right at the edge of closing on a No-Go gauge. The new barrel is a Criterion.

Want a very, very nice, Real, M1 Carbine that is ready for the next 70 years? This would be a good choice. I can send more pictures via email.

Choose from wood or synthetic stocks. Blued or parkerized finishes. Magazine extensions for added firepower and quick-change barrels. Choice of bead, rifle, or ghost ring sights. To simplify field maintenance, all parts and assemblies are interchangeable, gun to gun. The trigger plate assembly is quickly and easily removed for inspection and cleaning. Double action bars deliver the smoothest, surest operation in the business. The breech bolt locks into the heat-treated barrel extension forming a rock solid assembly with constant head space.The Model 870 leads the field in safety and performance features. A uniquely designed action with balanced sear - plus inertia firing pin - prevents discharge unless the action is completely closed and the trigger is squeezed and released after each slot. The large, side-ejection port stays unobstructed when shooting over walls, car hoods, and other barriers; the blaze orange magazine follower also permits quick, safe inspection of the chamber and magazine. This positive, cross-bolt safety is conveniently located near the trigger for fast operation, even while wearing gloves.A recoil pad on the wood and synthetic stock models permit greater control by eliminating slippage while firing. The grooved, steel-lined fore-end provides a better grip, and sling swivel studs are standard on all 870s."
