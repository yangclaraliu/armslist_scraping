The Kobra is a truly unique pistol, Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative and popular Snakeskin metal treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering, Not to mention it just looks cool! Except for the snakeskin metal treatment, this pistol is identical to the Executive Elite in all respects. This no-nonsense design has an elegant simplicity that has yet to be matched. The Kobra is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. I am sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra!

Brand New-In-Box, in fact the bolt has never even been installed in the action, flawless (no scratches) This specific model seems hard to find. I looked around on the web for a long time and couldn’t locate one in stock so I had my local gun shop order one…it took 6 months for them to find one. Not only that, this price is cheaper than anywhere that I’ve seen it on the web. It finally arrived about 3 months ago but I have decided to hunt large game with a different caliber than 375 H&H. My loss, your gain.

Here are the details:
- Spikes dedicated upper with Midwest Industries full rail (early version of upper)
- Milspec AR-15 lower by ATI/Omni
- Sightmark Aimpoint Clone. This red dot is fairly accurate and I have been impressed considering the price I paid.
- Unopened box of AR tactical CCI ammo
- 3 mags

I have a lot more money in this than my asking price: $500

Full disclosure: I bought this last year from a fellow and was told this was in ""Like New"" condition and would run perfectly. Well, that wasn't entirely true. I could not get it to cycle more than three rounds before jamming. I finally had to send this back to Spikes and they fixed it (spring and weak extractor issue). 

Since getting it back, I have put several hundred rounds through it with no issues (with and without a suppressor). I average slightly less than one FTE per mag but I think that is pretty standard for these types of 22lr rifles and ammo. I have shot CCI mini-mag and federal bulk ammo through it.

This is a complete lower group so stick your current AR platform on top and you are good to go.

Would like to trade for cash or 22lr pistol (preferably revolver) or other pistols and maybe 22lr rifles. No deer guns.

Glock 22 2nd Gen 40 S & W - Has bright night sights installed by Glock at the factory when I had them refinish the slide and inspect replace any out of spec parts a couple of years ago.  Very good condition.  

Sig P226 - Standard DA/SA with decocker.  9mm.  Has some finish wear but shoots great, box and two mags.  

Mossberg 835 Ulti-Mag 12 guage any size shell- woodland camo - this is a hunting gun so it shows some love on.  Could use a cleaning.  Cycles and fires everytime.

Marlin 336 in 35 Rem.  - from well before the Remington buyout, very good condition.

Ruger Mini-14 Ranch Rifle .223 or 5.56 - hardwood factory stock.  I have an Archangel Sparta stock for the Mini-14 but it is not installed.  Will part the two if you just want the stock.  Four 30 round stainless magazines, and factory 5 round magazine.

Bushmaster AR15A2 Rifle - M16A2 clone, integrated carry handle, 20"" barrel, etc.  ALG Defense Combat trigger upgrade.  Otherwise looks, acts, feels like the old government issued M16 without the giggle switch.  Only one mag through this to test her out.  Excellent condition.

Bushmaster AR15 Carbine - M4 style with a few differences, mid length gas system, 16"" med con barrel, ALG Defense Combat trigger upgrade.  Has genuine Colt M4 carry handle, the handle has been through a couple of battles for sure, and it shows. Rest of the gun is in very good condition.  I just refused to pay money for a cheap carry handle, especially on something most people will discard.

Smith and Wesson M&P 15 MOE edition FDE - 16"" Carbine.  Made a couple of changes.  Has Adam's Arms Piston conversion - ALG Defense Combat trigger, MOE+ grip and CTR stock.  Has been through a couple of 800 round weekends, but she is a work horse.  With the piston setup she has been flawless.  Has the Mgpul vertical foregrip as well.  It has a YHM flash hider on it also.  Oh and it has Magpul Gen 2 Rear sight that came with it.  And a Troy HK style front sight on the gasblock."

Here is a link to Browning's site with specs and info:

http://www.browning.com/products/catalog/firearms/detail.asp?fid=020B&cid=011&tid=404

I bought this gun from my boys' trap club last April. It was part of the Midway USA promotion for youth shooting sports that year. It has a 28"" barrel and came with 5 chokes. The factory LOP is ~ 13-3/4"" and there are 3 additional spacers included that will add up to an inch in 1/4"" increments. For youth or small shooters, I have an additional Browning stock that was purchased and cut shorter than the LOP it came with. Just the bare stock measures 12"". I have a 1/2"" Kick-eez that was ground to fit this stock and a 1"" Kick-eez that was left full size so it could be offset for my son.

My son shot this gun for about a month, I'd estimate he shot no more than 6 flats through it. We stumbled into a Browning Citori O/U that was fully adjustable, set up perfectly for a shooter his size and priced to sell, so he shot that the remainder of trap season and the Silver has been sitting since.

I paid $1500 for it plus the additional stock. The gun has an MSRP of $1339. I am asking $1200 OBO for it. It is available in central Ohio for FTF. 

I am open to quality firearms trades only, full or partial.  I am looking for 1911's and HK's at the moment, but feel free to send me any trade offers.

I have many more pics, if interested, please contact me.

The Zastava M92 chambers and fires the 7.62×39mm round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, and selective fire firearm with an under folding metal stock.
It has three cooling vents instead of the usual two. This feature gives the M92 less overheating on full auto mode.
The M92 also features a shorter barrel. Unlike most rifle rounds which would otherwise experience a loss of velocity out of a shorter barrel, the 7.62x39 round loses very little velocity when compared to a full length barrel. This makes it an excellent round for short-barrel rifles.

The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation.

Higgins, was used by Sears, Roebuck & Co. from 1908 to 1961 and applied to a variety of items including sporting goods, camping equipment, firearms and luggage. Although some have speculated that J.C. Higgins was a fictitious name invented by Sears, Higgins was, in fact, a real person. According to SearsArchives.com, an employee named John Higgins began his career at Sears in 1898 as manager of the headquarters' office bookkeepers and worked his way up the corporate ladder before retiring as company comptroller in 1930. In 1908, John Higgins the employee became ""J.C. Higgins"" the brand name, after his name was suggested during a discussion among Sears executives who were brainstorming possible names for a new line of sporting goods. John Higgins consented to allow Sears to use his name, but because he had no middle name, the ""C"" was added for effect. At first, the name J.C. Higgins was applied to baseballs and baseball gloves made for Sears by Western Sporting Goods Co. in Chicago, but later also appeared on footballs and basketballs. In the 1920s and ¤'30s it was used on a variety of fishing, boating and camping equipment. Shortly after World War II, Sears consolidated all of its sporting goods under the J.C. Higgins brand name. Firearms bearing the name were first manufactured in 1946.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

I bought this for my wife at a gun show last month, but turns out she prefers a semi-auto. The gentleman I bought it from said he purchased it from a police officer, who used it as his backup weapon had the trigger modified to be a lighter pull. However, all the original trigger material was kept and will be included in the sale if you need or want it. The front sight has been painted orange for better visibility. 

Also included is a kydex IWB holster.

I forgot to take a picture, but the original blue Smith & Wesson case comes with it, along with original paperwork and safety lock. Test fire date from the factory is May 2014.

The UTS-15 has a 28.3” overall length with an 18.5” barrel, chambered for 2½”, 2¾”, and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer, the UTS-15 weighs 6.9 lbs. Additionally, there is a top mounted picatinny rail for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes. Inventory# G-I-8004The UTS-15 was developed as a result of a request to UTAS made by Smith & Wesson in 2006 to develop ""the ultimate police shotgun"". Smith & Wesson's criteria for the shotgun were: 12 Gauge, pump-action, less than 30"" overall length, and 13-round minimum capacity.The following features are standard on all UTS-15 models:  Bullpup design: pistol grip and trigger are located forward of the barrel breech and action assembly. This allows for the same barrel length as a traditional shotgun but shortens the overall length of the weapon. Top mounted picatinny rail: allows for the mounting of a wide variety of iron and optical sights. Twin magazine tubes: set above the barrel to allow for easy access to the loading ports.   Alternating or select tube feed: a selector switch located on the top of the tube/barrel assembly allows for use of multiple ammo types (i.e.: buckshot and birdshot; buckshot and rubber pellets; etc.). Built-in laser/light controls: the right side of the grip is reserved for controls (a button) for controlling the optional light and laser assembly. Threaded barrel: Beretta-style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to be adapted for any situation and a range of attachments.
