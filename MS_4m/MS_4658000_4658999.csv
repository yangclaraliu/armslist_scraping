I bought this rifle new in 1995; obviously before the Marlin, Remington merger.  It has the JM symbol on the barrel.  It does have the cross bolt safety. 

I have put a few hundred rounds through it.  .357 and .38, no glitches or malfunctions.  Never tried wadcutters though.

Unfortunately no pictures.  No way to up load them and yes I’m a little old fashioned.
The bore is clean and shiny.  There are two very small indents on the fore stock below the JM symbol, hard to see unless looking for them.  Overall in excellent shape.  You’re of course welcome to examine it before completing transaction.

Must be legal to own firearms in the state of Wisconsin of course.

Asking $850.00  
From looking on line the prices have a pretty wide range.  Anywhere from well over a $1000+ to lows of $600 to $700 for heavily used ones.  Plus of course FFL and shipping fees.  I feel $850 is fair but I am willing to listen to offers.  Not really interested in trades except for maybe a S&W 386, 327, 627."

Very nice rifle - Action is butter smooth. All matching numbers - except for the bayonet. Bore is flawless with excellent rifling. Seems like its been shot very little - I've fired it myself 20 times - very accurate. Nice trigger for a stock Mosin - Some creep, but feels really good for a surplus rifle. 

Hate to sell it, but have have to. Price is $200 - includes rifle, 20rds of ammo, leather ammo pouches, bayonet and cleaning kit (no oil can - it didn't come with that). Also I'll thrown in the soft case.

Due to the unfortunate fact that private sales are now illegal in Oregon, the purchaser will have to meet me at a local FFL so we can do the background check. I'm willing to split the transfer fee for the rifle."

The Warrior fixed blade is one of the world's most intriguing combat knives. Based largely on the groundbreaking research of close-combat icon Michael Echanis, the original Warrior was a radical design intended primarily for use with reverse-grip tactics inspired by the Korean martial art of HwaRangDo. Produced in limited quantities by the late Al Mar and later resurrected by the martial artist Bob Taylor and Echanis contemporary Randy Wanner, it is one of the most coveted combat knives ever made.

This pistol does have Blackwater stamped into the slide and it also has the bear claw logo on the top of the slide and the grips. The Blackwater Tactical was only available in 9mm. 

Comes with original case numbered to the pistol and all original accessories that came with it. I even still have all the plastic wrapping and bags that the magazines and pistol came wrapped in as well as the un torn grip wrap. It comes with an extra set of Hogue smooth/black G10 grips, an extra brand new Sig barrel, a Sig Tac holster and (five) extra matching factory magazines for A total of nine mags and 180rds if ever needed.

I have free floated the barrel, and stiffened the stock up a bit. I also added grip tape to key areas of the stock, since it was way too slick. I modified the trigger by polishing it up, and worked on the internal springs. It pulls at around 3.75 lbs. It currently has a champion swivel bipod, and Allen sling on it. I have shot about 400 rounds through it just to break it in, and find what kind of ammo it likes. I get sub-moa performance at 100 yards with Hornaday steel match 75gr ammo(I will include a box of 50 with the sale/trade). This exact model sells new for $525 after tax at Gander Mountain right now, and does not include any of the upgrades listed above. I would like to get $400 for it with the bipod and sling, or $350 without. Reasonable offers will be considered.

I believe this shotgun has modified chokes. Dual Shell Extractors with 3.5"" chambers and double triggers. Matte Blue finish with a tad bit of patina starting. Barrels are 30inch in Length with gold front Bead sight, some wear in the bores but no pitting or rust, just has seen a fair amount of shot. Barrels have no dings or dents, there are some light handling marks as you would expect on gun this old. Checkered pistol grip, nice wood stock and forehand with minor handling marks from over the years, very little blemishes on forehand stock. This Shotgun is all original and zero Modifications have been done to this amazing piece of history. Minor case color hardening has started on the receiver. All matching Serial #'s on Forehand Splinter stock, Receiver and on Barrels/barrel lug. Tight lock up on action and barrels, also with hammers and sears etc. Not much more to say except this is a beautiful American made shotgun that would go great in any real shotguners collection. I'm looking to get about $550 cash or trade or best reasonable offer. Will trade for items listed below and would do a straight trade for a Revolver chambered in .357mag as long it's a Ruger or S&W made Revolver. I agree to follow all Federal, State and Local Law as we can go to FFL dealer and Split fee or EF-10 form online FTF. Valid Mass FID or LTC required for sale/purchase. Please feel free to ask for more pictures as the ones taken are a bit dark in contrast, also any ?s or concerns please don't hesitate to email-Jake. Thanks for looking, God Bless"

This is an incredibly light gun and perfect for a first time CCW holder. The frame so thin and the length so small that you can hardly tell you're carrying it. this comes with a leather IWB holster, the original case, 6 round magazines (3 of them), and 13 rounds of .380 HP defense ammo (2 magazines +1 in chamber). I didn't take the time to post an original picture because it's a standard black P3AT without any dents, major scratches, or other visual anomalies. I've rarely shot it and I'm unsure if my father bought it used or new when he handed it to me (though from the looks of it, new), but I'll be upfront and let you know this is not a comfortable gun to shoot. Because of its size, the recoil is uncomfortable. However, safety is not always about comfort.

I'm asking 250 for the P3AT or if a trade is offered, a reduced price on another compact/subcompact firearm. I'm up for suggestions.

The part needs to be replaced - hence the low price. *** 
From what I can tell, this was made around 1938 to 1940. A very nice piece of history.
