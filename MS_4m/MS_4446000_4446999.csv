18.5-inch barrel, holds 6 rounds (1 in the chamber) of 2-3/4 shells, or 5 (1 in the chamber) of 3-inch shells.  All black, synthetic stock

I have the box and papers that came with it, and the optional pistol grip.  I have seen some models for sale on line with a slug barrel, this gun only has one barrel.

This is a good inexpensive 12GA, I have fired approx. 20 rounds through it and it works fine.  Finish is 100%.  The gun is ready to be amp’d up with after-market parts, and add-ons.  This is a decent opportunity to dabble in customizing without spending a fortune. 

I rate the gun’s condition at approx. 99.9%, and the value is about $300.00 new. I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $270.00.   I am 100% firm on the price

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS). In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.
 I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my Armlist encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.

I work nights so please excuse any delays in returning your messages.

It has hardly been fired and almost never carried. Basic trigger job has been done on it, as well as replace the stock springs with lower tension Wolff Springs. Currently has 10# hammer and 8# return springs. I have the stock springs as well as a couple other weight Wolff Springs that you'll get with the gun. 

Crimson trace grips work great, battery is still strong. 

It is in good shape, with no serious blemishes. Great little gun. I may consider trades for other guns, with preference to those in .357, but cash is preferred. Bill of sale and copy of ID is a must. $550.

This kit utilizes a premium “incandescent color” LED so you do not have to look at the harsh blue color most illumination kits use. Also, this kit puts the light where it needs to be, straight down out of the center of the turret so you can see into the cases. Most of the other kits put the light on the side of the press, all but useless for lighting the inside of the case or on a strip under the press, so you are looking at the glare of the lights while reloading!

NOTE: This kit requires you to be able to make four soldered connection to install.  You will need:

·         Low wattage soldering iron

·         A small length of solder

·         Electrical tape or supplied heat shrink tubing

·         A drill and 1/16” bit

·         Some silicone glue/caulk (E6000)

·         And of course your LM ® turret.



Included in the kit:

·         One custom size, premium quality, warm white LED

·         One high quality driver board (matched to the LED) including rectifier

·         A low voltage wall transformer

·         One low voltage electrical cord set for mating the transformer to the driver board

·         Length of heat shrink tubing



Reloading has inherent risks, adding lighting to your press may increase these risks. Only you can decide if you want lighting added to your press. Since I have no control over the installation of this kit there is no warranty including fitness for purpose sold. If after reading the instructions you feel that you are not willing or able to install this on your press, return the kit in unused condition and I will be happy to refund your purchase price!

DANIEL DEFENSE 300 BLACKOUT!!!!
Description:
Daniel Defense’s 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions. The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend. Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

Brand New in the Box, Ready to Ship. 

The new Daniel Defense DDM4v9 Lightweight is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

Strange request, but I'm looking to buy a few non-functional guns for converting to classroom training guns for home firearms safety courses that I help teach in the Boy Scouts. Rather than having them handle live firearms, I want to give them something they can work actions on and practice safe-gun handling skills.

These will become something like the ones that are sold by Mossberg where I'll be stripping them down and refinishing the wood with bright neon orange duracoat so they are clearly training firearms.

Looking for a rifle - could be a bolt action, semi-auto, single shot, etc...

I am not looking to spend a lot of money - if the barrel is rusted out and unsafe to shoot, this is what I want to get my hands on since I'll be plugging the barrels anyway.

If you have one that's sitting in the closet eating dust because you didn't want to pay for the repairs, I'd like to find out what you'd like to get for it - again - DO NOT want anything that is working since I will be making sure they are non-functional for my classes (unless you're willing to part with it for dirt cheap).

Don't care about brands or age, just had to be in at least good enough condition where my students won't need a tetanus shot form the rust :)
These will be used to show them true handling of the guns as well as operations (pump and safeties for example)."

The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob.BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits.After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant.
The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer.
Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles."

I shot one box of fifty rounds through it, cleaned it, and it's been its original box ever since. This pistol comes with original boxes, all parts, and original documentation. I paid $679 on 6-22-2013, and at $475, it's a steal!

The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm INOX double/single-action semi-auto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement.

Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Apart from the winning features of the PX4 line, the INOX offers you an attractive and durable stainless slide contrasting with the black frame.

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextrous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of military and law-enforcement groups around the world are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.

This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the dis-assembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary dis-assembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.

The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make un-holstering and re-holstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps.

The SIG SAUER SP2022 is the latest version of the popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols.

 Very rare! In fact Don Wilkerson's book on Colt SA Revolvers states that there was only about 100 sets ever produced in this cardboard box. I can't imagine there are very many left in this box. I did order Don Wilkersons book which shows this set. It is the only print that even shows this were ever made.  I will include this book, brand new.  


 I emailed back & forth with a guy on the colt forum to ask his opinion of value and he gave me great information. I am NOT desperate to sell nor do I want any trades. 
Cash money, no checks, money orders, your AK plus $800, just $2500 Firm cash!!!!!

 The paragraph below was posted by the Colt SA Scout gentleman on the Colt Forums.
 This info can be found in Don Wilkerson's book.
 ""There was a ""Matched & Consecutive Serial # Pair"" of '62 Frontier Scouts both in .22 LR caliber which was sold in a special cardboard box. These guns in their special box are quite scarce. In his excellent book on Colt .22 single actions (""Colt Scouts, Peacemakers and New Frontiers in .22 Caliber"", 1993 Walsworth Publishing), Don Wilkerson estimated that only about 100 of these sets were shipped. A great many more K nickel sets were shipped than the '62 sets, but the numbers are not known.
 The most common set of Scout revolvers is one k nickel revolver in .22 LR and one in .22 Magnum. The other sets are less often seen. 

I have the Colt Archieve letter on order with Colt, it should be here within a month or so.
After I receive the letter this set will go to auction, here is chance to get them now.
 If interested Email Daniel
 at the link above.
 or text/imessage: seven three four three zeronine nine 2 fourtwo

 Do your homework and you will see there isn't many if any of these out there to compare it to.  As a matter of fact, I would be willing to bet you don't find any.

They were called a Gibbs Quest, I bought this rifle with the intentions of doing a .45 cap conversion but sadly I never got around to doing it. As mentioned this rifle is a project, it is missing the sights the forend has been reshape by someone that has little understanding of woodworking from the looks of it, the magazine is just the outer housing, the internals and base plate are missing and the gun has been coated in a weird matte nickel plating, that being said this is a functioning rifle, it will fire although I  would not recommend doing so unless a gunsmith looked it over first because the bolt does not appear to be original since it is blued and the rifle is nickel plated, so it would imagine the headspacing is not spot on, this rifle is chambered for 7.62x51, although people do it I would certainly not advocate shooting .308 through it because these guns were not intended to handle that kind of pressure. I am in Tell City, Indiana Owensboro is the closest city to me so I listed it on here, I just wanted to make that clear. Feel free to contact me with any questions. Thanks for looking"

The rifle shoots VERY nicely - and is VERY accurate. I am selling it to pay off a new hobby. The included muzzle brake will make 150gr rounds kick like a .243, or less. If you use the ""Weighted thread protector"" (used to match the weight of the brake while protecting the threads), it will actually help deflect some of the blast and noise forward. 
The action is magnum-rated, though ""Long-Action"" sized.
