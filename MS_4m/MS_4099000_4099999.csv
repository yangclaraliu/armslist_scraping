Gun Tests, the independent testing organization for the firearms industry, rates ""Howa  most accurate, best trigger pull and most evenly balanced over Remington and Savage."" The American Rifleman states, ""Many of the groups pack three shots under 1 1/2,"" and one group with Winchester ammunition put three shots into .30. Accuracy makes this gun worth a closer look."" Whether you hunt, shoot targets, or just enjoy plinking, the Howa Rifles M-1500 has the superior accuracy, rugged durability and dependable quality craftsmanship to get the job done.

 The heart of the M-1500's superior action is a one piece, bind-proof bolt forged from solid steel. The fully adjustable Howa rifle trigger is famous for consistent, crisp let off. All models are drilled and tapped for standard scope bases and come with solid rubber butt pads and sling swivel studs. Howa rifles provide accuracy and reliability at an affordable price

Here is the text from the Fallkniven web page:  S1 The Forest Knife is probably the best hunting and fishing knife ever made. Its sturdy blade made of the new extremely strong stainless laminate VG10 custom steel is convex grounded for extra strong cutting power with no risk for edge breakage. The modified clippoint design works well for penetrating purposes, the long curved edge is ideal for skinning. The blade is long enough for lighter chopping and won´t break, it´s full 5 mm (0.2"") thick!

I put my decked out G21 on consignment at a local gun shop and when it sold I went in and bought this brand new for a little over 500 dollars which is still what this gen runs new. Buying it new got me a free range coin to use at the range once for free which you can see the little wooden coin in the picture still.

I bought it, took it home, and ordered everything you see in the pictures. Talon grip $18, KKM precision barrel $160, reduced trigger pull kit was $120, tungsten guide rod was $80. and misc titanium pins and extended slide release are on there as well that were a few bucks. When you add it all up, new, its over $900 retail before I even fired the thing. So all the original parts are in the baggy in the pictures brand new.

 The first time i went and fired it I went with a friend who was a member of the range so i got in free, hence why i still have my one time free range coin. I bought a box of winchester white hollow and FMJ rounds. 100 rounds. We had several guns there that day so we shot and I was sure to save ammo for my back packing trip, enough for two full mags. Those same rounds are still in the mag. I havent fired it in 1.5 years since my trip. It just sits around loaded for home defense.

 I understand that all these parts may not be of value to you, i know im not going to get $900 for this gun. But I am in no rush to sell it either. Anyway take a look at the photos and I think you will see its near mint condition. Any way get back at me if you want more photos ill happily oblige."

For out of state purchaser the gun will be shipped to and FFL dealer once funds have been received, the buyer is responsible for the FFL shipping fee which is usually 25-35 dollars depending on the dealer. 

For in-state sales I will meet in a public place or in a gunshop.

This is about as custom as it gets in the AK world. The rifle is chambered in 5.45x39. The ergonomics and handling of the rifle are perfect. The sights and longer hand guard allow for better ergonomics and true AR adaptability in an AK. The rifle was parkerized and finished in DuraCoat, which is extremely durable and gives it an authentic looking AK finish. Mag lock-up is nice and stiff with no wobble with a variety of mags. The action is smooth and crisp with zero slop. The rifle comes with one AK74 mil-spec mag as pictured. 

The parts used are the best available all the way through this build. Everything is built around a unused AK-105 barrel assembly, which you can't even find right now from K-var or anyone. The AK-105 barrel length is 12.5' to get the rifle to legal length a Tantal brake has been permanently attached, (pinned and welded). You can Form 4 this rifle no problem and have an nice SBR if you want. The Tantal brake is extremely effective in reducing recoil and muzzle flip. Even with the Tantal brake you can still attach an AK74 bayonet if you have one. Pictured in some of the photos is a Rifle Dynamics AR stock adapter that had some issues. It was swapped with the better and stiffer Canis Stock adapter. I would estimate the round count to be about 400 or 500 rounds tops

This rifle was built by Tim Foreman at Gewehr Werks from a Bulgarian parts kit and the parts listed below. Tim is a perfectionist and does outstanding work and did an amazing job on this rifle. If you’re not familiar with Tim check him out online at http://www.gewehrwerks.com and consider him for your next AK build, you won't be disappointed.

The barrel’s .742"" Back-Bored Technology works with the Invector-Plus™ choke tube system to provide consistent, dense patterns.

A website or any person cannot disclaim the practice of law.  Offering legal documents for sale IS the practice of law and you cannot trust any of the advice they give you because they are not licensed Ohio attorneys.  There must be an attorney-client relationship and consent form filled out.  This is a huge problem and they are putting you and your family at risk by operating against the law.

The Ohio Bar and Supreme Court of Ohio requires that ALL LEGAL advertisements include the attorney's name, address, and phone number.  If you do not see this information in the ad, it is a scam and you should avoid the company at ALL COSTS.  

There are licensed, experience, and qualified attorneys posting here on Armslist.  Look for their information in the ad and call them for your NFA Trust needs.  Do not trust these scam sights which are operating in violation of Ohio law.

NFA Trusts are legal documents that must be individually tailored to your situation, needs, and requirements.  Only a LICENSED and BARRED attorney can do so.  It is against Ohio law for ANYONE to practice law with first being licensed by the Ohio Supreme Court, Bar Admissions.  

Therefore, do not trust this site.  $80 for an entire trust package?  If you take that risk to save a couple bucks, you may well have a document that is not only not legally binding, but can open the door to the ATF confiscating your NFA items for failure to proper operate, create, and run a trust.  

It is a huge risk and I am posting this to warn everyone to stay away.

See the below law for yourself:

http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4705.07

A) No person who is not licensed to practice law in this state shall do any of the following:

(1) Hold that person out in any manner as an attorney at law;

(2) Represent that person orally or in writing, directly or indirectly, as being authorized to practice law;

(3) Commit any act that is prohibited by the supreme court as being the unauthorized practice of law.

(B)

(1) The use of ""lawyer,"" ""attorney at law,"" ""counselor at law,"" ""law,"" ""law office,"" or other equivalent words by any person who is not licensed to practice law, in connection with that person's own name, or any sign, advertisement, card, letterhead, circular, or other writing, document, or design, the evident purpose of which is to induce others to believe that person to be an attorney, constitutes holding out within the meaning of division (A)(1) of this section.

(2) Only the supreme court may make a determination that any person has committed the unauthorized practice of law in violation of division (A)(3) of this section.

(C)

(1) If necessary to serve the public interest and consistent with the rules of the supreme court, any person who is authorized to bring a claim before the supreme court that alleges the unauthorized practice of law in violation of division (A)(3) of this section may make a motion to the supreme court to seek interim relief prior to the final resolution of the person's claim.

(2) Any person who is damaged by another person who commits a violation of division (A)(3) of this section may commence a civil action to recover actual damages from the person who commits the violation, upon a finding by the supreme court that the other person has committed an act that is prohibited by the supreme court as being the unauthorized practice of law in violation of that division. The court in which that action for damages is commenced is bound by the determination of the supreme court regarding the unauthorized practice of law and shall not make any additional determinations regarding the unauthorized practice of law. The court in which the action for damages is commenced shall consider all of the following in awarding damages to a person under division (C)(2) of this section:

(a) The extent to which the fee paid for the services that constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of division (A)(3) of this section exceeds the reasonable fees charged by licensed attorneys in the area in which the violation occurred;

(b) The costs incurred in paying for legal advice to correct any inadequacies in the services that constitute the unauthorized practice of law in violation of division (A)(3) of this section;

(c) Any other damages proximately caused by the failure of the person performing the services that constitute the unauthorized practice of law to have the license to practice law in this state that is required to perform the services;

(d) Any reasonable attorney's fees that are incurred in bringing the civil action under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section.

(3) Divisions (C)(1) and (2) of this section apply, and may be utilized, only regarding acts that are the unauthorized practice of law in violation of division (A)(3) of this section and that occur on or after the effective date of this amendment.

Please note this is the Pro version of the striker fired popular LC9. There are important differences. Read this please just so you know the differences. Note this is the third option mentioned gun in the article.

Original Ruger LC9:
Bad-ass/lightweight/sleek carry pistol that fits just about anywhere
Great feeling double-action-only trigger pull keeps you from accidentally discharging your firearm
Manual thumb safety that kept you doubly safe
Magazine safety made the pistol inoperable with no magazine - triple the safety!

Ruger LC9s:
Exactly the same size and shape as the original LC9
Newly designed striker-fired action which lead to a trigger pull better than a Glock's
Fires without magazine in

Ruger LC9s Pro:
No thumb safety
Sweet trigger pull
Fires without magazine in
Trigger safety only
No fumbling for thumb safety on the small frame.

The LC9 features a manual thumb safety where the new Ruger LC9s Pro does not. The other major feature change is the Magazine Disconnect Safety. The Ruger LC9 has a magazine disconnect where the New LC9s Pro does not.

If you carry this gun I just wanted to know the feature and safety differences. 
This has a pretty smooth/improved trigger as noted above.  

Will come with the extra mag (2 total) that Ruger never supplies, box, fired shell casing and a  nice little Galco soft leather IWB holster."

The computer is used but in excellent condition. All marks/blemishes photographed. Includes MagSafe power adapter, extension cable, and a NiftyDrive + 64GB MicroSD card. This is like a mini external drive that fits in the computer's SD card slot. I upgraded to a refurb with a larger hard drive; this one wasn't big enough for me, hence the NiftyDrive. 

Everything works great. The entire screen/lid assembly was replaced by Apple when I started experiencing screen burn-in issues (you can read about these issues online - they affected a particular screen subcontractor). Since then I've watched it carefully and it hasn't shown the slightest issue. Power cable developed a crimp and hole in the lining which has been patched, again without issue.

This is like a mini external drive that fits in the computer's SD card slot. I upgraded to a refurb with a larger hard drive; this one wasn't big enough for me, hence the NiftyDrive. 

Everything works great. The entire screen/lid assembly was replaced by Apple when I started experiencing screen burn-in issues (you can read about these issues online - they affected a particular screen subcontractor). Since then I've watched it carefully and it hasn't shown the slightest issue. Power cable developed a crimp and hole in the lining which has been patched, again without issue.

I haven't weighted the pull yet but I would put it at 2.5-3lbs. And the reset is perfect. It comes in the original case, with 2 original mags, but I have plenty more 1911 mags laying around that I could throw in to sweeten the deal if needed and I mean quality mags. Chip McCormicks, Springfields, Kimbers, Colts, etc. And last but not least...... It's also equipped with a brand new Crimson Trace Rail Master Pro (the green laser/light and strobe combo). One of if not the best handgun combo lights out on the market. I paid $300.00 for mine and still have the original box with all of the paperwork. I will list the specs below. I have around $1300.00 tied up in this amazing handgun and it is very much worth it.

This Chinese Type 56 SKS is uncommon. It is a Sino-Soviet model from late 1956, as evidenced by its six-digit serial number. It also has carvings/trench art on the stock, likely done while it was in use by Albanian soldiers.

This rifle is 100% original. All I have done is clean the cosmoline (it was loaded with it, see picture below) and shoot it. Never shot corrosive ammunition, but cleaned after each shoot anyway. All numbers match, except the stock, which does not have any numbers on it that I can see.

The finish is worn but the bore is bright and I have put ~150 rounds through it without a hiccup. 

It comes with:

- 10 genuine military surplus stripper clips, not the crappy civilian market stuff from UTG and similar.
- 1 spring-loaded replacement firing pin (Murray's) 45$ new - This ensures the rifle does not slam-fire, but does not modify the rifle in any way. The original firing pin is also included.

Optional for 50$ extra: a military surplus fiberglass stock. NOT modern plastic stock, this is a red-brown fiberglass unit from the chinese military. I use it when it's rainy to keep the original stock and its cool trench art from getting beat up.

Will ship to all US states or meet locally. Shipping will require FFL, 25$ to ship."
