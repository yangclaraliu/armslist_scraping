The BUSHNELL Elite Limited Edition 3-9x50 SF Rifle Scope, Multi-X Reticle, Matte, Limited Edition (E3950SF) is another versatile big-game hunting scope. This model features extra light-gathering capabilities thanks to a large 50mm objective, so you can make the most of dawn and dusk.

The unprecedented low-light performance is taken to the next level with the addition of Ultra Wide Band Coating. Its fully multi-coated optics deliver an amazing 95% light transmission across 300% more of the visual light spectrum than before.

The Elite riflescope comes with PC-3 Phase Coating - a chemical coating, which is applied to the prisms to enhance resolution and contrast for the brightest and clearest images possible.

This model scope also features 1/4 MOA or finer windage and elevation adjustments with audible clicks for greater precision and fast-focus eyepiece.

Thanks to RainGuard HD, a wet lens or a misguided breath that would fog conventional glass will never cost you a view. This patented, permanent, water-repellent coating causes moisture from rain, snow, sleet and condensation to bead up and scatter less light, so you get a clear, bright view when other optics would be rendered useless.

With a one-piece tube recoil tested with 10,000 rounds of 375 H&H and 100% waterproof/argon purged, you can expect nothing less than unfailing reliability."

(unless I won the lotto).

So, I'm asking $5000 for all this stuff. I'm firm on that. If I need to add more goodies to get to where you feel that you are getting $5000 worth, I will, but I think I'm pretty close already.

What's included:

AR-15 based on DPMS lower and AAC 300 BLK upper. The upper is a 16"" middy with Knights Armament Rail and AAC quick attach suppressor mount. Yes, I have a suppressor for this but I'm keeping it.

Mostly Magpul furniture including: Angled Foregrip, CTR stock, Winter trigger guard, B.A.D Lever and ladder rail covers.

Optic is a Horus Vision Talon. I went through a few scopes before I settled on this one. I really like this one a lot and I'm actually having a harder time parting with it than the rest of the gun.

AN-PVS14 Night Vision. Generation 3+ from US Nightvision. I bought this from Ready Made Resources. They hand select their NV for the clearest resolution, hence the 3+. The night vision is in excellent condition and comes with all the original accessories (not shown).

The PVS14 is mounted on a LaRue LT133 mount and I have it set up to be co-witnessed with the Horus. This is not the preferred setup, but it works. If I had $10k for the preferred setup, I'd think about it. : )

Troy Rear BUI and the Rail has a front sight integrated into it.

I have a LaRue Bipod mount. I don't use it much but it's nice for zeroing.

Travis Haley InForce Light with 45 degree mount. I really like this light. I went through a bunch of lights before I settled on this one.

SureFire M1 IR Light on LaRue 606 Mount. (Can you tell I like LaRue stuff?)

Redi-Mag.

Gear Sector Sling.

Not shown, but I'll throw in 10-30 round Pmags.

I also have a bunch of 300 BLK brass that you can have if you reload. About 1500 cases.

Don't email me if you're not serious. I'm not desperate to sell this and, as I said, the price is firm.

I'm not interested in trades except maybe a partial trade for a G17 or G19.

The 5.56 PDW Tactical Elite 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper."

The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (.380ACP, 9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from SIG SAUER.

Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

The VZ-2008 is the new civilian version of the Czech VZ58 assault rifle.  The Czech VZ58 Assault rifle was the Czech's answer to the AK-47 which kept with their pattern of creating their own firearms chambered in Soviet calibers.   While the VZ-2008 looks similar to an AK-47 in appearance, it does not use any of the same parts or magazines."

I’ve shoot about 700 rounds through the gun and it is good and broke in.  I used this gun for long range, hate to get rid of it, but looking to maybe go a different direction.  I used this gun when taking a long range class and could bang steel MOA targets consistently out to 800 yards.  When we chrono’d the gun with Dallas Reloads 168gr AMax bulk loads we were getting an average of 2510 FPS out of 10 shots.  Not bad for a shorty 16” barrel.  All of my dope data will be included with the gun from 200 out to 800 yards for what MIL holds to use.  It is also taped on the stock.  Everything in pictures will be included in sale except bipod, suppressor, and suppressor mount.  The suppressor mount will be replaced with a competition muzzle brake.  I have changed the stock Magpul ACS-L stock to a long range fully adjustable Luth-AR MBA stock.  It is adjustable for length of pull and comb.  The gun comes with the rifle buffer tube, spring and buffer installed with the Luth-AR stock, but will also come with the carbine buffer tube, spring and buffer so you can switch it to a collapsible stock if you want.  Any AR15 milspec butt stock will work.  

Below is a breakdown of what is included in sale. I need to get $2300 or $2150 minus Geissele trigger willing to ship to your FFL or to your door as long as you're in Texas.

Only partial trades I’ll consider is a Mossberg MVP LR in 308 plus cash or Tikka CTR 308 plus cash or Savage FCP10-SR 308 20"" plus cash.

The Sig Sauer P238 is different from most other .380 “pocket” pistols on the market today. In terms of size and shape, the P238 is very similar to other comparable micro .380’s. Instead of a polymer frame, however, the Sig Sauer P238 uses an all metal frame with a single action design, and is almost identical in appearance to the legendary Colt Mustang.The Sig Sauer P238 operates with a locked-breech short recoil action. The hammer must be cocked either manually, or by the action of the slide, to fire each shot. The advantage to this method of operation is two- fold. First and foremost, similar to the Colt 1911 or Mustang, the Sig Sauer P238 has a superior trigger pull when compared to similarly sized double action only designs like the Ruger LCP, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard or Kel-Tec P3AT. In turn, this leads to greater accuracy. Second, the P238’s single action design allows Sig Sauer to incorporate a high ride beavertail grip frame, which leads to greater control under recoil by safely placing the shooter’s hand higher along the bore axis.In addition to being a great-looking pistol, the Sig Sauer P238 is much easier to load than other micro pistols on the market. For shooters that do not possess strong hands, the P238’s smooth and easy slide is one of its most highly appreciated features. There are also positive vertical serrations on the back of the slide that further enhance loading or unloading.The Sig Sauer P238 slide locks to the rear on an empty magazine, and the slide latch release is easy to reach with the thumb of the shooting hand. Similarly, the P238 has a user friendly manual thumb safety which further enhances shooter usability. The Sig Sauer P238 has stippling on the grips for a secure hold while firing the pistol. As mentioned, the frame has a generous beavertail to protect the web between the shooter’s thumb and trigger finger, and the hammer recesses into the beavertail section, to avoid any chance of hammer or slide-bite while firing the pistol. The Sig Sauer P238 is a very compact design, and while it may be slightly heavier than the polymer .380ACP pistols on the market, it is just as small.  We have 1 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $585 each.

Browning’s most lasting innovations – the Model 1911 and the 380 ACP cartridge – into a modern, lightweight pistol. Unlike most of the modern “pocket pistols”, that chamber the snappy 380 ACP cartridge, the 1911-380 is slightly larger to better manage recoil for improved control that makes follow-up shots faster and more accurate. The longer barrel increases bullet velocity for more downrange punch and improved accuracy. The grip is compact, yet it is long and wide enough to allow the shotting hand full purchase for added shooting comfort.The 1911-380 is 85% of the size of the original 1911 45 ACP model. It’s ideal for concealed carry duty, and for fitting a wider variety of shooters.FEATURES:Frame: Composite.Slide: Machined steel.
