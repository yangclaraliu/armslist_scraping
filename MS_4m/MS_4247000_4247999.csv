I've recently set up for a pistol (and any small stainless item) stainless refinish service.  You can ship slides and parts direct but a frame must be shipped to my FFL. 

I have the formula for S&W Gen 3 and Gen 2 semi-auto pistols, matte/frosted and brushed finish, and have done several of those (639, 659, 5906, 669). I would like a satin finish project, as found on revolvers. Photos available from my sales on GunBroker.

I can mask and frost the top strap on stainless revolvers if yours is too shinny.

Below is a 5906 agency trade I currently have as an example of my work. See that the serial number matches in the photos. I'll try to make it to the MVGC show on Saturday and leave the pistol on Old Trooper Gun Smiths table so you can see it in person.

Price of my service depends upon condition: how much hand work I have to do to eliminate scratches, gouges, cuts and such.

This is a ""really"" low volume service so I offer it twice per month (or less):

One slide or frame... $45. Both slide and frame... $75. Price includes small parts such as slide release, safety levers and such. These prices do NOT include hand working to eliminate defects, only the blasting service.

So, if you have a beat up stainless firearm you'd like to look new again, or bought one ""on the cheap"" and want to restore the finish, keep me in mind please. I have three 10 MM S&W's that need some ""touch-up"" at the moment to bring a higher dollar value when I resell them.  My next refinish run will be around May 1.  

Till then, enjoy...

I have an immaculate Glock 17 Gen 3. 

It was purchased brand new by me at Fin, Feather, and Fur in Canton in February 2014. I have fired less than 200 bullets on this gun and have only taken it to the range about 6 times. It hasn't been fired since October 2014. 

The gun is literally in brand new condition. I have the original hard case it came in. I also purchased a $229 grip activated laser by Crimson Trace. The laser is amazing. I get a lot of compliments on it. Soon as you grab the gun and have it ready to fire the laser is on. No messing around with a turn on switch.

I have about 150 regular target bullets and a small box of the more expensive Hornady hollow point bullets.

This is hell of a deal on this gun. I paid $530 after tax with the gun, $240ish on the laser, $55 on the extended 31 bullet magazine, and about $60 in ammo.

Again you will receive:
- Glock 17 Gen 3 with hard case and original docs
- Crimson Trace Laser (installed)
- 2 Standard 17rd mags
- 1 Extended 31rd mag
- Bullets

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy."

Only 150 rounds through, bought from a friend that shot it 50 times and I have shot 100 through it also, no problems shot amazingly (except one failure to feed on a winchester white box round, which upon inspection of the cartridge the case was longer than the others, my two CZ's and Glock 17 also FTF on it. I do not blame the gun in any way for the malfunction). No need for this gun anymore, sits in its case unused. Needs an owner that will get more use out of it than I do.

Not much else to say except it has always run well for me. Maybe 100 rounds of hard nose and hollow point down the pipe. No problems at all. The pistol has had favorable reviews for a relatively inexpensive (not cheap) gun. Hits stuff when aimed at it. Reasonably accurate at 50+ feet with the stock white three dot sights. It's not meant to be a target pistol...it's a good light self-defense weapon for small hands, ladies and it disappears under a shirt or jacket. Real easy to rack the slide. I especially like the aspect of having an actual hammer to cock the gun or, with a round chambered and the hammer down, just squeeze the trigger to make it go BANG. Has a left side safety/decocker. Alloy frame and Zytel grips. Field stripping is a breeze. Pistol comes with three mags: one stock 7 rnd. w/flat base plate; one 8 rnd. Mec-Gar with pinky base plate; and one 10 rnd. w/pinky base plate. It has a key to lock the gun to make it inoperable. Everything comes in an aftermarket case.

This is a sweet deer or hog gun (one hit drops the animal) and works very well on elk or bear with a good placed shot, lots of fun to shoot for practice and always turns head on the range since it is a rare gun.

Asking 2700$ for everything or best offer. Id be willing to drive a few hrs to meet serious persons only and if you'd like we can do a firearms transfer at your dealer or mine here in wichita or a bill of sale if thats good with you as well.

Thanks!"

It is the 4"" barrel version. I've only taken the pistol to the range three times and put about 150 rounds through it. It's in pristine condition.

I was hoping to use this pistol for work but was unable to. I ended up buying a G17 to fill that role and now I no longer have a need for the Walther.

All the reviews on this gun are accurate. Everything about it is fantastic. The ergonomics, the trigger, the styling, everything...except for the stock sights. But don't worry because this baby comes with a two month old set of Trijicon HD Night Sights (orange). The front sight absolutely pops in the daylight and in low-light conditions they are very bright night sights. But, if you are looking to maintain that stock look, the factory sights are included as well.

Also included with the pistol is a Blackhawk! Serpa Concealment holster. It's designed for the P99 but it works perfectly with the PPQ. I've used it and can confirm that it works. The holster comes with two attachments; one is a belt loop attachment and the other is a pancake style attachment.

Here's the bummer though: I cannot sell the 15 round magazines that came with the pistol. Nor can I disassemble the magazines and sell them that way (not anymore anyway). New PPQ factory 10 round magazines can be purchased at several online stores for $45. I know that this is an inconvenience, however I feel with the $150 sights and $50 holster thrown in it's still a great deal. Believe me, you will not be disappointed with this pistol.

What's included:

Walther PPQ M2 9mm 4"" Barrel
Blackhawk! Serpa Concealment Holster
Trijicon HD Night Sights (Orange) and Stock Sights
Walther Pistol Case w/ Owner's Manual
Two Additional Backstraps for the Grip

$800 for everything, cash only please. Buyer pays transfer fee/DROS ($35) at an FFL in the Vallejo area (Napa, Fairfield, Vacaville, etc.). Contact me for more pictures.

It's 62"" long and has a 50 lb. draw; factory string included, and the bow was never stored strung.  The riser is left-handed and the pad on the arrow plate/rest is still in perfect condition.  If the draw is too much for you, you can purchase lighter limbs from the manufacturer and swap them out.

I will include a half dozen brand new, unfired Cabela's Carbon Hunter arrows; these arrows were not cut or trimmed so they're full length, and have target points threaded at present.

A steel thread-protector comes standard to protect your barrel when the suppressor is not in use. Available through Nighthawk Custom, its Preferred Dealers or from Advanced Armament Corporation, this custom handgun is loaded with proprietary features. The first to catch your eye will be the lightening cuts on the top of the slide, mainspring housing and front strap that match the Advanced Armament Ti-Rant suppressor. As you can see from the pictures, it makes for a very attractive firearm. The slide sports new Heinie Ledge Straight Eight Suppressor Sights which are only available through Nighthawk Custom. These sights are designed to give you a complete sight picture over the top of the suppressor. The distinct ""ledge"" rear sight allows you to cock the weapon off of a hard surface if needed. The gun has about 250 rounds through it no scratches on the weapon. Comes with bag, test target and all other paper work, 2 mags. I would like to trade this AAC for a nighthawk predator, nighthawk enforcer, nighthawk falcon, heine signature competition, Might consider a bob marvel or high end wilson combat.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Mil Spec+™ Cerakote™.

These days I dont really do many IDPA matches and thought I would get rid of my gear. If your interested in taking up the sport then this package has all you need outside of ear protection and ammo. 

Glock 34 Gen 4 - I bought new and have customized for IDPA matches, its a quick, reliable and accurate shooter. Talon grips as well as thumb and fore grip tape for very positive trigger finger position and recoil retention. This can be removed if you prefer the stock glock gen 4 grip texture. Storm lake match grade barrel. Vogel trigger set at around 3.5lbs. This trigger replaced the entire trigger group and has really made the slide smooth to operate and speed up the follow up shots. Vogel sights black rear and fiber optic front. The sight picture is ideal. Grip plug to help with quick reloads. The G34 comes with its original case as that have the adjustable backstraps along with the usual Glock additions (paperwork, speed loader, etc.). Original barrel and trigger are included.

Magazines - 5 included with this, all Glock brand. 

Holsters - Blackhawk OWB holster, custom 2 mag OWB holster. 

Belt - 5.11 Black 

Vest - In IDPA matches you draw from concealment a lot of the time, which requires a vest or other concealment garment. This is a 5.11 Tan vest, which is 2XL. I took it to a tailor and had a professionally tailored in, if your a taller person this vest is perfect for your IDPA experience.

Range Bag - Older bag, I believe i got from the Sound of Freedom in Ozark. Great quality and can hold all you need for match day. This is in great shape as I bought another bag shortly after this one and as such its sat for awhile.  

So some things to note;

There is some slide wear on the Glock which you would expect from a gun being holstered and drawn alot. This is purely cosmetic and not even that bad. Never had a single FTE, FTF, etc, its a Glock so thats what you expect. Lead reloads have never been shot through either barrel, but you can with the StormLake if you wanted. That's originally why I bought it, but never got the reloading setup completed. As a result this firearm has only ever seen factory ammo. Extremely well taken care of, with cleaning and oil after every range trip. I shot maybe 5 IDPA matches with it last year, and it was a great performer. 

If your interested in doing some IDPA competition, or just looking for a plethora of range gear then this is a great deal for you. Send me an offer if you would like to see the firearm or need more information.  I am in no rush to sell, just testing the waters I guess. I can send additional pictures at your request. Thanks for reading through my posting.
