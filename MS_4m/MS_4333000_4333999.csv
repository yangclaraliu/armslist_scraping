The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

He’s also recognized as a premier single shot gunmaker who also makes barrels, bullet molds, and precision target sights. Ron also pioneered some .40 caliber rifles for all types of black powder shooting; the 40/60 and 40/65 being two of his favorites. 

We are pleased to offer an outstanding Ron Long Winchester High Wall. Ron didn’t trade mark very many of his custom rifles, but this is one of the rare few that he did. 

Chambered in his own .40-60 Long, the barrel is a straight-octagon configuration 30 inches in length and 1.250 inches across the flats. This handsome custom rifle weighs in at 13 pounds and the barrel is complimented with three Unertl scope bases.

Presentation-grade black walnut was used by Ron to stock this tack driver which displays full fiddleback curl of the forearm and continues through the butt, finishing into a wonderful crotch feather pattern at the rear of the comb. The checkering of the forearm and grip was executed perfectly  An ample shadowlined beavertail cheekpiece graces the left side and a fully-checkered and blued Neidner buttplate finishes the rear. 

There is a mar to the checkering at the top point of the left grip panel. There is also a chip in the finish on the lower right side of the buttstock, with very minor handling marks on the barrel.

The action is a coil-spring Winchester High Wall and is fitted with close-coupled set triggers. While the receiver is blued, the lever wears the beautiful colors of traditional casehardening. 

To say that this is a handsome rifle is an understatement.  

Priced at $6,850, this is a rare opportunity to own one of the finest target rifles from one of the most respected names in American custom gunmaking.

It's absolutely beautiful, however, I am more of a practical shooter and am looking for a 9mm subcompact replacement. I rarely shot this gun (less than 300 rounds) and it's more so eye candy collecting dust in its box, not doing anything. 

Some things to note: Very reliable and deadly accurate. It has night sights and a grip that fits like a glove. Everything is stock, no parts tampered with or changed out. What's probably the most important thing to point out, however, is that this particular gun is MADE IN GERMANY. From my understanding, Sig Sauer is no longer importing its firearms to the USA. 

Accessories: This weapon comes with the very box I bought it with, complete with purchase receipt and a lifetime warranty from the gun shop (Shooter's World, Tampa, FL). Inside the box there's a sample lube and gun lock.

I purchased this tin a few years ago from Aimsurplus’ website.

I feel the $180.00 asking price is extremely fair considering the prices posted by online sources that actually have stock and are shipping this ammo…J&G is asking $270 / tin (+ $30 S&H).  Classic Arms is asking $240 (+ $30 S&H).  Private offerings are almost as ridiculous with individuals asking upwards of $250 / tin.  This is a chance to snag a 5.45x39 Russian surplus tin for far less than current market prices.

Specifics on this particular Russian 5.45x39 ammunition:

+ 53 grain
+ Full copper plated steel jacket
+ Berdan (corrosive) primers
+ Packaged 30 rounds to a paper wrap ‘box’, 36 paper ‘boxes’ to a sealed tin
+ Produced / manufactured in the early 1980’s
+ ATF recently declared this ammo “armor piercing” and is banned from future importation

I am located in Northwest Indiana (closest major intersection: Indianapolis Blvd. and Ridge Rd.) and anticipate a fair amount of flexibility in my schedule regarding making buying/purchasing arrangements.  During the day can work, late evenings / early nights are preferable, and if need be I can try to swing meeting up in mornings.  If buyer is not in the immediate Northwest IN area (e.g., Hammond, Munster, Highland, Dyer, Crown Point, Gary, Lake Station, etc), I may be able to meet half-way (within reason) depending on buyer's location.

Thank you for your time in looking as well as your consideration. Happy shooting- Cheers!"

I bought this stuff a fair while ago when it was fairly cheaper than market prices for other surplus 7.62 NATO (before the price of pre-ban ammo hiked up and equalized with the rest of 7.62 surplus ammo).  This stuff definitely isn't Lake City match-grade ammo my any means.  That said, my experience (and my others- research this ammo online) is that it shoots/performs just as well as most other available berdan primed 7.62 NATO surplus.  'Haven't had any trouble running it through a variety of different 7.62 NATO battle rifles.

I am asking $8 per 20-round box ($0.40 / round), or (for the lot) all 8 boxes for an even $60 ($0.375 / round).  Cash only please- unfortunately I am not interested in any trades at this time as I am trying to minimize how much stuff I will have to relocate when moving time comes around.

Each box contains four Mosin Nagant 'chargers' or 'stripper clips'... 5 rounds on each clip.

Admittedly, I do not know much about the exact specifications for this ammo.  I think my father purchased this ammo in a surplus 'tin' (or 'spam can') years ago, and somewhere along the line the individual boxes where removed from the tin and the tin was discarded.  The headstamps (see photos) show ""22/78"", which based on what I have been able to find online seems to associate with Romanian 'light ball' surplus ammo, production year of 1978.

I am asking $50.00 cash for all 14 boxes (280 rounds total... coming out to $0.20/round).  Unfortunately I am not interested in any trades at this time as I am trying to minimize the number of things I will ultimately have to relocate when moving time comes around.

I am located in Northwest Indiana (closest major intersection: Indianapolis Blvd. and Ridge Rd.) and anticipate a fair amount of flexibility in my schedule regarding making buying/purchasing arrangements. During the day can work, late evenings / early nights are preferable, and if need be I can try to swing meeting up in mornings. If buyer is not in the immediate Northwest IN area (e.g., Hammond, Munster, Highland, Dyer, Crown Point, Gary, Lake Station, etc), I may be able to meet half-way (within reason) depending on buyer's location.

Thank you for your time in looking as well as your consideration. Happy shooting- Cheers!"

No scratches..dings..GUN IS NOT INCLUDED. 

Nikon Monarch 8-32X50ED SF Riflescopes are perfect for extreme long range hunting and target shooting. Like all Monarchs the three new riflescopes were developed to give shooters increased versatility and superlative performance with virtually any type of rifle, in any caliber and in any imaginable hunting situation. The Nikon 8-32X50ED SF is the first rifle scope to incorporate Nikon's exclusive and legendary ED glass. Nikon ED glass delivers superior sharpness and color correction for unmatched detail resolution. While still maintaining the American-preferred one-inch diameter main body tube, Monarch Riflescopes where developed to not only provide the shooter with a big, bright, sharp sight picture, but at the same time minimize the overall length of the scope-and maximize the mount ringspacing capability. The resulting line of rifle-scopespushes the envelope of optical performance withNikon's lead-and-arsenic-free Eco-Glass lenses and trademark Ultra ClearCoat anti-reflective multi-coatings, is fast-handling, pleasing to the eye and very importantly, allows for mounting on virtually any rifle-even magnum-length actions. 

Nikon Monarch Rifle Scopes come standard with a locking side focus parallax adjustment. Nikon's easy-to-reach dials allow the user to quickly focus from the shooting position, in addition to the enhanced ringspacing, the new scope design includes the monarch eye box design with its impressive 4-time zoom range and a very comfortable 4 inches of eye relief that remains constant throughout the power range without sacrificing field of view. The Nikon Monarch 8-32x50 ED SF Matte Rifle Scope's massive ocular lens also delivers both a large high-resolution sight picture and the maximum field of view corresponding to each power setting. As an additional convenience feature,Nikon Optics has placed rear-facing magnification indicators on the zoom control and included a quick-focus eyepiece on the eye box. 

All Nikon Monarch Rifle-Scopes utilize precise, repeatable, hand-turn reticle adjustments and feature an interchangeable turret technology system, which allows shooters to switch out turret knobs and caps for maximum convenience and versatility.

This top rated mace brand pepper spray gun is powerful, lightweight (8.7 oz.) and can be easily and legally carried in hostler, pocket or purse. Unlike a traditional pepper spray bottle it shoots an easy to aim strong narrow stream of pepper spray that travels 185 mph! This strong narrow stream is not only much easier to aim and no matter the conditions will not blow back at you or others around you, but also has a much larger range. This allows you to stop and defend yourself attackers well before they are within dangerous range. Once your assailants take a breath complete incapacitation takes place immediately and lasts 30 to 45 minutes. During this time your attackers will be wheezing, coughing and blinded from the powerful pepper spray giving you plenty of time to escape the scene and call 911."

Please look at my other listings after you peruse this one.

I have some really good, hard to find ammo (at least based on my searches).  I have some FACTORY Silver State Armory (SSA) Sierra Prohunter 110 grain soft point ammo that I'm getting rid of.  I've had this for a several years and just not gotten to use it.  This is factory loaded ammo and is not the Tactical ammo so you should be able to use it in SPC and SPC II chambers (it's up to you to determine if any factory ammo is safe in your firearm, I take no responsibility as it's listed correctly here).  As you can see there are 19 boxes of SSA and one box of Remington in the picture.  The Remington is free with the 19 box SSA purchase to round the count out to 400 rounds total.  

I'm moving to the 90 grain Federal Gold Dot (XM68GD) and 95 grain Barnes TTSX rounds.  I have enough of those and reloading stuff to keep me shooting in the 6.8 for years.  I've shot some of the Prohunters, but prefer a slightly lighter bullet.  

Please contact me if you have any questions.  I do travel on occasion to parts of SC and various parts of NC so just ask."

Purchased this stock kit for a build I'm working on but before it arrived I found a different kit I liked better.  As it is this kit is brand new and unused and ready to be installed. Comes with the buffer tube, spring, buffer, castle nut, and a mil spec carbine stock. Buffer tube is mil spec in dimension and the positions are laser engraved so you can see what position your stock is in by just looking at it.  Great choice if you're working on a build right now and it will screw into any lower receiver with standard threads.

I have no use for it so I'd like to sell it for $45, just looking to get what I have in it back out.  Would also consider trades for AR mags or ammo, 9mm or 40 glock magazines .
