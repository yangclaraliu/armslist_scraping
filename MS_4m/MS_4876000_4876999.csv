It is not the 320 model. The optics are 1x, but has 2x and 4x digital zoom. 320x240 resolution, 19mm lense, 30HZ refresh rate.

The unit was gone across by ATN and had all the updates done in August. It's been carried in the field three times, and has been to the range twice. It's rated for a .308 recoil. I did a few rounds of sighting in with a 6.8spc, but that's it.

I'm not interested in shipping this. Must be a US citizen to buy, and this unit cannot be exported."

The only difference between Gen 2 and 3 is that the Gen 2 has the more durable tenifer finish and no finger grooves. The pistol is in great shape with a low round count. It will come with 2-13 round magazines and a Glock ambidextrous holster. The sights have been upgraded to Proctor Y Notch sights that have a blacked out rear and green fiber optic front (also have red insert for it). The only other modification is the Talon grips, they are a rubberized stick on grip that can be removed, but they provide great traction. I can provide more pictures later today. I am looking to sell this pistol for $400 or 350 with stock sights or trade for a Glock 19. I will sell local (willing to travel a little) or I am willing to ship at your expense to your FFL.

The design for this rifle was originally based on the design of the Springfield model 1873, which is also a single shot rifle with a hinged breechblock that opens like a trapdoor. Often called the Trapdoor Rifle, this gun features adjustable sights for both elevation AND windage. This rifle is chambered in .45-70 caliber, but as the stock has a crack in it, it would likely be wisest to have it inspected by a gunsmith before firing it. This rifle is missing the original cleaning rod, but is in otherwise very good shape. Thanks for looking at our item! Georgia residents pay 7% sales tax, and shipping is only $35.

I'm not really rushed to get rid of the rifle. I've just come to a point where I may be interested in something else so I'm testing the waters.

I don't really have anything in mind, but I'm interested in quality handgun/long gun trades. 

No hunting rifles or shotguns and please no AR builds.

Because I get too many emails asking for a cash price I have posted one. If you do not like it please move along. I am not interested in selling outright unless you actually want to pay that price. I am primarily interested in trades."

Hello everyone,
 I am looking for a just right (JR) Carbine or Thureon Defense Carbine in 45 acp or 9mm that takes the glock Mags. I've been toying with the idea for a while and have decided that I want to go ahead and get one. I am open to most of the models they have so long as it takes the glock Mags including the Kel Tec and LDR2, etc. I can get them online, but would prefer to deal locally to keep business and cash in local hands. I have cash or various trade items for the right deal. 
 If you have one, please shoot me a message at REDACTED or a message on here. I would also consider other 45 or 9mm Carbines that take high capacity magazines, so if you have one of those feel free to contact me. Honestly, I would consider most carbines if the price is right. 
Thanks for your time and happy hunting!

It's in pristine condition and comes with the original box, 2 mags (one extended mag), and all the manuals.  I'm Looking to get $530 for it. 

The second Sig is the P238 tactical. It only has 19 rounds through it. It comes with the Sig Laser pictured, two magazines, and the original box. The main difference between the two besides the laser is that the tactical has Sig rubber grips, and a different guide spring (supposedly more corrosion resistant). I'm asking $600 for the tactical. 

So to summarize each Sig is coming with an extra $45 magazine. It's the extended magazine with the pinky grip. The tactical comes with a $145 laser. And I'm also giving 200 rounds of ball ammunition $30 worth and a box of hollow points $25 worth. I'm also throwing in a $50 Desantis Cozy Partner leather holster, and a $15 Desantis pocket holster. 

I think the deal is more than fair at $1,100, so price is firm.

I had this on lay-away for a while and inherited another in the interim. I paid $549 for it, just looking for a quick sale. Please have NH ID and carry permit.

Benelli's SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. At the heart of this pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong, and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn't just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from 2-3/4"" light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

This SuperNova Tactical comes with newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights (the harder to find version, sold out just about everywhere). The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. The top of the SuperNova's receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics.


Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical is a modular concept pump action shotgun, that can be configured to fit any defense or tactical situation. The ComforTech stock absorbs nearly 48% of felt recoil to dampen the recoil of heavy buck shot loads. In addition to taming recoil, the ComforTech system minimizes barrel climb, putting you back on target twice as fast as other comparable shotguns. For tight quarters when clearing buildings or in a patrol vehicle nothing beats the compact versatility of the SuperNova.

This Benelli Supernova Tactical (20155) is a pump action shotgun that fires the 12 gauge shell. It has an 18.5” cylinder chrome lined barrel, overall 40"" length, 2-3/4"", 3"", & 3.5"" chamber, with a matte black finish. 7.8 lbs unloaded. This is a brand new shotgun that holds 5 shells (4+1 capacity) and comes complete with a Comfortech stock, receiver, barrel, ghost ring sights, stock shims, etc., manual, warranty card, and a box. Complete! All Mint, NIB. Many options available.

5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.
Weight: approximately 38 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
All Ed Brown premium components are hand-fitted to the exclusive Ed Brown frame and slide.
Exclusive ChainLink treatment on forestrap and mainspring housing for the ultimate in durability, secure yet snag-free grip, and extreme use.
Integral lanyard loop mainspring housing with ChainLink.
Matte finished slide for low glare, with traditional ""square cut"" serrations on rear of slide only. Jeff Cooper's signature is engraved on the ejection port side of the slide. The right hand side of the slide is inlayed ""DVC"" in 24 carat solid gold, which stands for the latin phrase, ""Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas"", meaning ""Accuracy, Power, Speed"". This later became the motto of IPSC.
All sharp edges are gently and tastefully dehorned.
Ejection port is lowered and flared for improved ejection.
Polished feedramp, hand-fit extractor and ejector ensure feeding with high quality ammunition.
Ed Brown premium match grade barrel and solid steel bushing for the highest accuracy.
Ed Brown memory groove beavertail grip safety for a higher and deeper grip than any other on the market, reducing felt recoil and improves natural pointing ability, leading to better accuracy.
Ed Brown extended (single side) tactical thumb safety, ambidextrous tactical thumb safety optional. The most ergonomic design available!
Trigger guard is undercut to allow the knuckle to fully contact the bottom of the trigger guard as a definite stopping point, allowing a more consistent grip and thus better practical accuracy.
Fixed Novak low mount dovetail rear sight and dovetail front sight.
""Commander style"" slotted and chamfered hammer mated precisely with Ed Brown Perfection sear and Perfection disconnector. We are the only makers who fully machine each of these critical parts from the highest quality alloy bar stock steel, making for a light trigger pull and crisp break which will last for thousands of rounds.
Classic ""Three hole style"" long aluminum trigger.
Mag catch with 40 LPI checkered button.
Ed Brown seven round magazine with reliable steel follower. Extra magazines tested with gun optional.
Beveled magazine well for smooth magazine changes.

Info from Spike's:

The Spike’s Tactical CAR-1 Fake Can gives you the looks of having a 10.5” suppressed rifle but doesn’t come with all of the expense and paperwork that’s required for the real thing. This is how it works; The CAR-1 shrouds back over the barrel of your rifle concealing part of it inside of the CAR-1. This is what gives the illusion of a suppressed SBR and of course, no stamp is required. Keep in mind, this fake can is just for cosmetic looks and does not provide any sound suppression whatsoever. The CAR-1 should only be used with barrels with Carbine length gas systems. 

We CNC machine these fake cans out of solid 6061 Aluminum bar stock for strength and top them off with a durable Anodized finish. The length of the can is 5.5” and has a diameter of 1.25” that will fit under some rail systems (please contact the manufacturer of your rail system to see if our CAR-1 fake can will fit under your rail if you intend to do this). 

NOTE: The CAR-1 can is threaded for 1/2x28 barrels. If you are unsure of what your barrel is threaded for, please contact the manufacturer.
