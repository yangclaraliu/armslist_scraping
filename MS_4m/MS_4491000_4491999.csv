The GLARE® MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler, ocular interruption device [OID]) ideally suited for small-arms weapon integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright green dazzler beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that “you mean business”. Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan.  A hand-held kit is also available for non-weapons-mounted deployment."

The Christensen Hunter model is no longer in their catalog, they have a newer version for more money but if what you want are the essentials then this is a perfect  rifle.   I wont try to quote the manufacturers advertising but this rifle sold at suggested retail of shy of 3000.00 five years ago,  it is unfired, does not come with a scope or rings as I removed them for another rifle.   it still has the data card  dialed in for a Swarovski  Z5 on the butt stock and its possible the tape residue might be a PIA to remove but other than that its as new been in the safe and taken out for show and tell but never been fired. 

Carbon barrel, trigger, machining of action, titanium muzzle brake, skeletonizing of bolt are some of the things that are changed on this rifle

It also comes with the original stock, and it can be returned to its original state, but the sights on the barrel of the 10/22 have been filed down to fit inside the barrel extension of the nomad kit. 

Also, the barrel extension itself must be cut off to be removed, and if that was done, it would not be able to be reapplied. Keep in mind: When this kit is on, the barrel extension must be permanently affixed in order for the overall gun length to reach the legal limit for Oregon.

A base 10/22 goes for like $250, the kit goes for $200. I'm asking about $150 less than it's worth because as it is now I have noticed fairly frequent failures to feed. About one in every 10 shots gets jammed. It may be the cheap .22 ammo that I used, but more likely a piece of the plastic body may be hindering the feeding mechanism from the magazine. The base 10/22 worked fine before the conversion. Let me know if you're interested."

MTT stands for Mega Tanto Tip - an extraordinary design by Jesper Voxnaes, that combines elements of a Kiridashi with those of a Tanto. The pronounced hollow ground provides excellent cutting performance although the blade is 7mm thick. Due to the entirely flat back without scales, the MTT featuring a Chisel Grind can also be used upright on a surface in order to straighten it. Despite this asymmetry, the MTT provides a high level of grip. Thanks to the high material thickness, it even copes with coarse cutting chores.  A versatile and extremely rugged knife for the toughest chores. The handles are machined G-10. A multi-task tool whose application range can only be limited by a lack of ideas. Includes Kydex sheath.

Features a 3.00 in. 440C steel blade, 7.75 in. overall length. Serial Numbered! Black G-10 handle. Comes complete with a Kydex sheath.

This would make a great gun for bird hunting or skeet shooting and the 20 gauge doesn't beat you up like the 12 gauge, which would make a great gun for a youth and would be a gun he/she could keep for a lifetime. Even passed along to the next generation as these are well made platforms. It is almost impossible to find a gun with this type of accuracy for under $2K. Read the reviews, they are unanimous. It comes in pristine condition with two, still in unopened package, Invector Plus chokes. This is an amazing gun with craftsmanship hard to find this day and age although it was manufactured in 2004. Asking $1400 OBO. . Just let me know. I'm not very interested in trades although I am willing to trade straight out for an AR of equal value (Sig, Armor-lite and will add $if need be). Thanks for your time."

It is based on the M4 carbine, with which it shares 80% of its parts.

It features a proprietary short-stroke self-regulating gas piston system and bolt carrier/carrier key design, which prevents trapped gases from contacting the bolt carrier or receiver of the weapon, which reduces the heating and carbon fouling of the internals, simplifies field maintenance, and improves reliability.

The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon.

The bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

This M6A2 has a low- profile gas block and there is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device.

It also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with rail covers and a removable return-to-zero top so that any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail.

The rail has a monolithic profile so you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly and the longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

This M6A2 has a low- profile gas block and there is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device.

It also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with rail covers and a removable return-to-zero top so that any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail.

The rail has a monolithic profile so you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly and the longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

This High-End Rig is Topped with a High-End Nikon M-223 4-16x40 Sniper Scope with BDC.

It also has MOE Magpul Stock and a Magpul MIAD Pistol Grip."

Basically this gun has spent it's life in my safe. Double/singe action with American release. What's included: Comes with 3 seven round Sig Sauer Magazines (not cheap aftermarket ones). Original grips as well as SIG SAUER ALUMINUM GRIPS. These are a very expensive set of grips but I like these much better than the plastic factory ones it came with. Much more comfortable, smaller & better wet gripping capabilities if ever needed. I am including both so it's your choice which ones to use. Also comes with two guide rods. The original and a Tungsten TacticalPro rod. This heavy guide rod helps to reduce recoil and keeps you on target for rapid follow ups. Much better that the original in my opinion. Comes with Sig Sauer case (not the original), test target, manual and lock. Beautiful gun with the typical minor handling and storage marks. Additional pictures available upon request.

Shoots 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. It has rifle sights and I polished the bolt while it was out. This is an actual police gun used by a police department that I bought and completely disassembled and refinished. I replaced the synthetic furniture with wingmaster wood but the original set is included with the gun. This gun was made to work and it functions as it should, you will not find a better gun for home defense. I added a list below of some of the major differences between the police and express guns just to give those of you who dont know why the police versions are more desirable.

The 870 Police has:
 - An aluminum trigger group (vs plastic on the 870 express).
 - Old style magazine retention system (you can add mag extension w/o modification) 
 - The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts.
 - A military-grade parkerized finish.
 - A polished bore.
 - A one piece barrel.
 - A short police-length fore end. 
- The Remington “R3” super recoil pad that reduces felt recoil by 30%.
 - Sling swivels.
 - Heavy-duty magazine spring to ensure positive shell feeding.
 - Heavy-duty trigger-sear spring. to reduce the chance of accidental fire
 - Heavy-duty shell lifter spring which also improves positive feeding.
 - No use of MIM parts, the extractor is milled
 - Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
- The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
 - High visibility follower."

It likely started life as a blued model, and was sent to Parker Hale (England) to be fitted with their upgraded sight, anti-reflective rib, and nickel plating.  These jobs were done right, as the fixed sights are dead-on at 15 yards.  Frame and Swingarm are marked 1467, not a model number as you might expect to see.  There are a few cartouches that I know nothing about.

The single action beats any semi-automatic on the market, and the DA is on the firm/short side of things.  

The frame is overall lighter than a comparable sized .357M (I have a 65-3 in the safe that I'm not looking to sell)

Would make a great first pistol for a younger relative, a nightstand gun for a woman, or just a cool toy/trainer for the range.

The P239 rainbow is built with a black hard coat anodize alloy frame and a rainbow titianum stainless steel slide equipped with SIGLITE night sights and rainbow titianum trigger, accents and controls.

This is for the upper only ****edit To add ran about mag through it to test it an it ran like a clock. Rapid fire with no problems.

This is a unfired upper from andro corp. if you check the reviews on these they are awesome uppers. He has around 500 positive feedback score on ar15.com. Uppers comes with gen 2 magpul sights, quad rail, mil spec bcg and barrel. It's a very nice upper. I can add ammo or pmags to even out trades. Trade value is $425 with the sights or sell for $415. This is an excellent choice for a budget pistol or sbr build. Foregrip, sure fire an mount not included.

The benefits of using the DSM training breaching door is its ability to quickly reset for continuous breaching, remove the door from the hinges for transportation or service, and change the force required to breach the door. It's intended use is law enforcement breaching training, tactical training, or military enthusiasts.

This technology will allow the door to simulate the effects of breaching 3 classifications of doors using a battering ram or kicking. 

1. Interior Door w/o Dead Bolt (Kicking)
2. Solid Wooden Door w/ Dead Bolt (Battering Ram)
3. Metal or Reinforced Door

The door's materials include 1x2"" steel tubing for the structure and a 1/4"" steel plate for the striking plate. The frame's materials include 2x3"" steel tubing that is braced using 2"" angle. 3/4"" plywood is screwed to the door frame for aesthetics. The door can be removed from the hinges easily for transportation or service. The whole door assembly has an approximate weight of 350lbs. 

The reusable trigger mechanism is designed similar to a cam system. The ""Dead Bolt"" will be under spring tension and is required to pass two levels on the guard before breaching.

Featuring a 30mm tube, milliradian-based precision adjustments, and an illuminated EBR-1 MRAD reticle in the first focal plane, the Viper PST 4-16x50 from Vortex delivers top-tier performance for precision long-range shooters.

The Viper PST is configured with a high-performance optical system. XD lens elements have been employed to ensure maximum resolution and contrast. The entire optical path is fully multicoated with Vortex's anti-reflective XR coatings for optimum light transmission. Finally, the external lens surfaces have been treated with ArmorTek - an ultra-hard scratch-resistant coating that repels water, oil, and salts.

This scope was built to thrive amidst the challenges of rugged field use and abuse. The rugged 30 mm tube is constructed from a single piece of lightweight yet durable aluminum. The tube's exterior is hard-coat anodized, and then it is o-ring sealed and purged with argon gas to ensure a fog-resistant water-tight seal. The erector assembly has been thoughtfully designed, precision-built, and meticulously set into place. Special care has been taken to reduce wear and tear while enhancing durability and repeatability.
