I am getting out of the .45 game and onto a more streamlined collection for my handguns and have this beautiful and barely used pistol to sell.

This is the NEWER (read that as NON-recalled) Springfield XDS .45 with the 3.3 inch barrel.  It comes with all of the factory goodies including the case, new style paddle holster, dual magazine holder, factory paperwork, cleaning rods, 2 - 5 round magazines, etc.  Everything that came from the factory is here with this pistol.  It is like new with barely (if any) marks on the gun to speak of.  

She has maybe a box of ammunition through her and functions flawlessly.  As i mentioned, I'm just switching calibers for my entire collection to streamline things.

Now, the EXTRA goodies.  This set up also comes with an additional 5 Springfield magazines.  2 - 6 round magazines with finger extensions and 3 - 7 round magazines with finger extensions.  The last bit of joy that comes with this is an IWB holster.  This little tank is ready to use as a complete CCW package as soon as you buy her.

Asking $600.

Must be a legal resident of the United States of America, 21 years or older with valid photo government identification, and no prohibitive criminal background. The transfer will take place at Firing Line in Aurora, unless you have a REPUTABLE AND SAFE place in the Denver Metro Area that we can agree upon to meet. Buyer pays any and all transfer costs.

I am free afternoons, evenings and most of the time on the weekend."

I have for sale today 2 Brand New Glock 42's with factory cases, cleaning rods, and magazines.  I am streamlining my firearms collection and whittling down to only one caliber, so these beautiful babies must go.

One has never been fired, and the other only has one box of ammo through her.  DO NOT let the size fool you.  I was insanely accurate with these at 30 yards.  I felt almost no recoil and the design is just an amazing thing to behold.  I have never been a Glock fanboy but these... these have changed my mind on the product.

As I mentioned, each comes with the factory Tupperware and standard gear

Each pistol will come with AN ADDITIONAL 5 brand new, 6 round magazines.  One of these will come with an OWB holster as well as a dual magazine holder, and the other will come with an IWB holster.  Regardless of the holster you choose, you can barely feel that this thing is on your hip/side/ankle.  It is so light and sleek while still packing an accurate punch.  I hate to see them go, but I just have too much going on in my little condo.  I need some organization!

Asking $600 for each individual set up (with 5 mags and your choice of holster), or $1150 for both.

If you buy both, I'll throw in a couple hundred rounds of ammo.
Must be a legal resident of the United States of America, 21 years or older with valid photo government identification, and with no prohibitive criminal background. The transfer will take place at Firing Line in Aurora, unless you have a REPUTABLE AND SAFE place in the Denver Metro Area that we can agree upon to meet. Buyer pays any and all transfer costs.

I am free afternoons, evenings and most of the time on the weekend."

The scope is included and I'd really like someone to take it off my hands as a package. It is a Vortex Viper HST 4-16x44 MOA. I have the original box and accessories for the scope.

I have owned this firearm for a little over two years. I have put less than 100 rounds through the barrel. The only reason I'm selling it, is because it's too big for me. I weigh about 160 pounds and just recently got my concealed carry permit. For me personally I need something that's a little bit smaller. This gun is in great condition, the only mark on the gun is on the upper portion of the slide there's a small mark where the holster took part of the finish off of the pistol. I have tried to get the best picture possible so that you can see this slight mark. This pistol also comes installed with a Crimson trace 1911 full-size front activation LG 904 laser grip. I have found this laser to be very reliable, and I also have the stock grips that came preinstalled on the pistol when I first bought it. This pistol also comes with a 17 pound precision load rated conventional recoil spring. Inside of the case the pistol comes with two magazines one bore brush as well as the locks used to apply the safety on the pistol. I have removed the ambidextrous safety paddle near the rear of the gun. I've taken pictures so that you can see that safety has been removed I left the paddle on for a right-handed shooter however I still have the right side paddle in case you want to put the ambidextrous safety fully back on the weapon. Finally this weapon comes with a Black Hawk Serpa concealment holster as well as an open carry holster. I have used both holsters on the pistol, and I found that the concealed carry holster that comes with the lock on the side is by far the most comfortable to wear. I have receipts for just about everything that comes with this purchase and have sunk over $1000.00 into the holsters, grips, and spring. I'm asking $850.00/OBO. You can email me at REDACTED or contact me at REDACTED."

I work in a machine shop so I have access to lathes, mills, and other tools. I removed the barrel turned the diameter down to just about .750. I left the gas block section alone. Then I shortened the barrel, recrowned and then permanently attached the muzzle break with 1200 degree silver solder. It measures 16.1 from the end to the bolt face so completely legal. This was all done to remove some weight. Best I can tell it weighs just over 7lbs as configured. This is by weighing myself on a scale with and then without the rifle.

It was made in 1977 (SN 631xxE) and I believe it to be unfired outside of factory.  Since I am not the original owner, I will not make the absolute claim of “Unfired”, but it was purchased from a dealer in 2002 who claimed it was unfired and I know that it has not been fired since then.  It is a true safe queen.

No holster wear, great bluing.  Lock up is truly “Bank Vault Tight”.  No box or paperwork.  

I can email more pictures if you would like.  If you are serious about buying, I would be happy to meet so you can inspect it for yourself.  

I prefer face to face transaction (at FFL) due to the value of the firearm.  I live in Vancouver, WA, but am willing to travel along I-5 corridor between Eugene and Tacoma.  I also spend a considerable amount of time in central Oregon if you’re located out there.  I am hesitant to ship, but if you are a serious buyer please contact me and we can discuss.

Since there are extremely few 2.5” Pythons on the market I am asking $3150

This firearm DOES need a little TLC.  The finish is in good condition, but I do believe that the Guide Rod Spring needs to be replaced.  The spring will slip out of place during use, which in turn leads to the slide getting locked back.  I can provide a picture upon request of the spring/frame.  As of right now, the firearm will only shoot about 50 rounds after the spring is placed back in it's proper position before the spring will slip again. 

I am asking for $325 for this firearm.  The price reflects the fact that the firearm will need some TLC before it is 100% reliable again."

The stock has all K167 stamps and a visible Weimar Eagle indicating that it  originally came from a 1935 Mauser Oberndorf (S/42G) K98k. This rare stock alone is worth $300! Please note that there are some compressed areas (dents) on the right side of the buttstock. Most numbers match the receiver, but the floorplate, trigger guard and bolt do not.  However, the bolt is completely matching  to itself, all the way down to the firing pin, and it is a correct bnz bolt as indicated by the WaA77! WaAs and eagles have been scrubbed from the receiver and barrel, likely in an arsenal of the WWII German allies, Romania. Dark bore with fairly deep, reasonably sharp rifling. No shellac, no crossed rifles; not a Russian Capture. Look at the pictures here and in the link and please ask questions before committing to buy. I want the buyer to be content.

Overall, this is a great gun, and very accurate.  Using bulk .223 ammo, I can end a 40round range session at 100yds with a 4"" circle. The furthest I have shot it has been 300yds and the holdovers for the scope were spot on.  Very impressed with the scope.  I was debating between the Bushnell and the Nikon M223.  To my surprise, comparing them side by side, the Bushnell actually had clearer glass.  

The only reason I am considering selling is to fund my ultra light build.  It has only had about 500 rounds through it and has been a range toy.  Very well maintained.  I have over $1500 invested.  I'm asking $1200

If interested at a lower price, I can remove the scope and take $200 off."
