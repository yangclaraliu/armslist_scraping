As can be seen in the picture below, the ring caused by the rotation of the cylinder is not very pronounced, meaning the action has not been cycled very much.

Pre-war stock with faint cartouche and stamped letters, Finnish screw in sling hanger plates front and rear, very early style barrel bands. Lots of old bumps and dings, but no cracks. A prior owner sanded the lower handguard so it is lighter colored. Could use some more smoothing and stain/oil to match the rest, but I haven't gotten around to it. Price will go up if I do. I kind of like it, as it is unique and the sanding is part of the rich history. Bolt handle and barrel are Finn matched. No numbers on butt plate and lined-out numbers on magazine, as it typical of Finn Mosins. Probably about 70% bluing throughout with an interesting patina on the upper exposed metal areas. No rust! Bolt just disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled with Modern Spartan Systems Accuracy grease. Still had cosmoline in it prior to thorough cleaning. Good bore with strong rifling. Counter-bored, tang and receiver accuracy shims are intact.This one has some stories and is responsible for igniting my Mosin addiction. It will probably make you a Mosin addict. You have been warned. Prefer face to face in Burlington, but willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at buyer's expense. Open to serious offers. This is one of the more unique mosins I've seen.

CzechPoint does not produce these rifles on a regular basis. In the past, mind you they have produced around 12 per year. This is a fact that I have in writing from CzechPoint. That alone makes this unfired rifle (except 15 - 25 rounds to zero after manufacture) VERY Special Indeed. The Beech was used for a Very short period of time during 1959-60? You can find pieces and parts of un-matching sets on the internet, or even re-manufactured wood. This is original A Gradel wood used in assembly at the CzechPoint facility. After that time the Czechs found it more cost effective and faster to use a mixture of compressed wood and resin composite (most of what you see today).

Times are changing and who knows what the future holds for these rifles. The VZ stands alone in it's class. It looks like an AK, but just looks...it is IN NO WAY LIKE AN AK!  Do your research. This rifle will out perform any AK out there. Side by side. Not a SINGLE part is interchangeable. They also are milled receivers, short pistons and striker fired (like a Glock). There are many other differences, but looking them up is half the fun!

What else makes this listing so special? Well, I am also including a ""pimped out"" version by including FAB furniture as well! This includes the folding tactical Stock with all the adjustments and inside storage. You can have it your way. I have pics of both. I am listing the photo of the original in the CzechPoint box with it's 2 magazines, tool kit, bayonet and OH YES! the sticker! BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!  I am also including the rare bipod and a really really rare night sight kit / attachment that still holds a glow!

I paid CzechPoint $1,300 for the rifle. I did not fire it. I purchased the Zahal ""pimp out accessories""  and put them on and took some photos. I found individually the rare Bipod and night sights. I bought the magnetic rail mount for the receiver and a red dot. OH! I didn't mention that above. The rail uses a really strong magnet and supposedly returns to zero since it only has one place to rest.  Well... that's all for one price and it is a firm price. You will NEVER find a package deal like this again.

Sorry about the excitement I showed in my ad by using all the caps and stuff. I just wanted to be a LITTLE different in my wording. Note: send me a request for more photos. I have plenty.  I also am willing to trade for a CUSTOM 1911, or NICE Sig 1911, or perhaps a Presentation Colt 1911. In any case, it's got to be a 1911.  

This VZ is set up in the old Beechwood furniture at the moment. I will type up an instruction guide for the Zahal / FAB assembly if you would like. I will also throw in some ammo and stripper clips. I think I have 12 - 20, and they are holding ammo. This is what I have."

I won this rifle during the SCI Safari Club International gun raffle this past weekend. I have enough rifles and would like to trade or sell this one.

The rifle has a 20"" barrel, nestled in either the adult or youth (you get two) stock, both of which are manufactured by Houge and are a stiff rubber. The idea being a youth can start with a shorter length of pull, and as they grow up they can swap stocks. Both feature a Houge butt pad, which is about an inch thick and should surely quell the already light recoil of the 7mm-08 round.

Also negotiable is the Nikko Sterling Nighteater, 3x9-42mm scope with Leupold aluminum scope mounts, rings, lens hood, and neoprene scope cover. This scope might find a home on my AR-15, unless you're interested.

I'm open to trades, mostly interested in a 2-4"" .357 magnum, .308 battle rifle, cash of course. MSRP for this set is $756.00.

This rifle is based around a Springfield 1903 action that was manufactured in 1930. The action is in great condition and locks up tight... Especially for being 86 years old. The action is mated to a custom, single cut Douglas barrel. The barrel is a super-heavy profile (1"" diameter at the muzzle) 24"" beast. Handling .308 is easy for this barrel... It dissipates heat very well and should last in excess of 5000 rounds if not abused. All of this is glass AND pillar bedded in a Jim Cloward stock. Cloward stocks are the best you can buy... If you can find one. The LOP is adjustable with the Tubb 4 way adjustable butt plate. This rifle was custom built by C.T. Huston. Make me a reasonable offer.

SR-15 MOD 2
The Knight’s Armament Company SR-15 line represents the pinnacle of firearms based upon the Eugene Stoner designed operating system. The Mod 2’s 16” chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel is manufactured to military specifications, and features a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range."

For sale is a Springfield XD 357 SIG, 4"" service-size handgun. Comes with everything the gun came with: lock, cleaning rod, two magazines, a speedloader, a magazine holster, an OWB holster, and a clamshell case. I've also got a nicer quality aftermarket OWB retention holster I'll throw into the mix for good measure.

The gun has had about 500 rounds through it. It's been well cared for and cleaned after every use. It has been carried as a winter carry at times, but doesn't show signs of holster wear.

Shoots well, carries well. 357 SIG is a nice round. You can use Springfield XD .40 S&W magazines in this gun (loaded with 357 SIG of course).

Selling because I got a new gun and I don't think this will see as much use anymore.
I also have other things for this gun you may want: shoulder rig, hybrid kydex/leather IWB holster, and an OWB leather holster (""speed scabbard"").

For this price, you could buy a .40 conversion barrel and you basically have a brand new XD40, and an additional barrel, and you can use either caliber as you feel the desire."

Correct two line patent dated frame, matching numbers, except for the grips which are excellent replacements and could definitely use some aging to look more in context with the revolver, which has wear and scattered light to heavy pitting and bumps and dings. Some good traces of cylinder scene are still evident and markings are very good and legible. Bore is about a 6 on a scale of 10; it has good deep rifling but does have scattered light to moderate lead build-up and some pitting. However, the action is tight and works fine and it looks like it would shoot very well (after a safety check by a competent gunsmith, of course!) Originally these were 44COLT centerfire chambered, but as that ammo became obsolete, some former owner slightly reamed the chambers and loading port to accept the 44S&W Special (or Magnum) cases , which he then trimmed down to the 44S&W Russian length …as can be seen in the gun. This makes for a VERY easy gun to load for, as 44S&W brass is readily available. Ejector rod head is a home-made functional replacement, but these are available if the new owner decides it needs a better one. The California style Slim-Jim holster is also in very fine condition (being new new) and fits the gun like a glove. The belt loop is fully intact and of course it looks very usable. Sure makes a handsome combination. About G+/VG as described. $2350"

I travel the state a bit, and may be willing to travel for the right deal......
Thinning  the 6.5 herd.   Here is a very nice custom sporter  M96, converted by Kimber, and then someone else did some custom work to it. Kimber turned out the military steps in barrel into a straight taper, drilled and tapped scope base, installed after market safety, cut barrel to 22"" , recrowned, and installed bent bolt. Rifling is very stong, if it wasn't Kimber rebarreled them to other calibers.  Any other work was done after. Beautiful walnut stock, and hinge floor plate. Stock is shaped for right or left hand shooter, right has a full cheek rest, left had a partial. Has open sights and tapped for scope. (Correct Weaver bases and screws included) A really nice sporter  job on the best small ring Mauser made! Not a ""Bubba Smith"" job, but a classic sporter done right! Picked it up because I love the 6.5x55 caliber, but haven't really used it, so seeing if anyone is interested in it.  This is one built for use, it has what appears to be DuraBlue finish on it, and would be a great all weather hunter. This would be a perfect hunting rifle for the lower 48....if you dont know what a 6.5x55 is, Goggle it. Finish looks good, tight metal wood fit. I really prefer trades, but would sell it for $500.00.....partial trades, multiple item trades,  up or down, +/- cash, I'm open to all offers, Even lowball offers! Just don't get stupid if I don't accept it......I understand guns are only worth what you can get out of them, but there's nothing wrong with leaving them in the safe either..... 
I also have Lapua 6.5x55 brass and dies, that I would throw in for the right deal, but would rather keep them for my other rifles.  I can only post one picture, but if you are serious email me and I can text/send more, tell me if there is something specific you want to see.  Either no one replys to my emails, or they are not going through Armslist lately. If I don't reply, please email me directly at REDACTED.

This gun is a Excellent camp / Bug Out gun. It is light... Half the weight as a AR. Takes 28 Round Magazines + 1. Folds in half to be easy to keep in a back pack or in a vehicle. It is surprisingly accurate at 100 Yards.  I bought it as a wolf protection gun when I go back packing. With its 16 inch barrel the  165 gr 40 cal bullet can go faster than a short pistol barrel so it can hit harder than a subsonic 300 blackout.  You can stop a lot of wolf in a foldable package. It takes Glock 22 mags if you are like me you will get a G22 as well. I have one for sale below. I bought the G22 from a SWAT Team Member. Definitely a 2nd Kind of Cool there...

Both of Colt's “New Police” rounds were actually slight redesigns of existing S&W cartridges, the .32 S&W Long and .38 S&W with the bullet noses flattened, as Colt resisted providing its main competitor with any free advertising.

Intended to address deficiencies of earlier models such as the Single Action Army, the Positive Lock prevented an accidental discharge even if the hammer was struck or the pistol was dropped, allowing the revolver to be safely carried with all six chambers loaded
