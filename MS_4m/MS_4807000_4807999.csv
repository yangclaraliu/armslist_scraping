Selling a pair of low end 380 pistols - great for back up guns, glove compartment, BOB, tackle box, etc. These are not high end guns, but they don't have a high end price tag and if you actually read the manuals and follow the recommend ammo types, they are just as reliable as most anything else. Come with extra mags, holsters, and more ammo than you'll probably ever shoot out of them.

The first is a Kel-Tec P3AT with a 6 round and a 9 round mag (+1 in the chamber).

The second is a Jimenez JA 380 and has two 6 round mags (+1)

300 rounds of brass ammo, 150 rounds of steel cased Tulammo, and 60 rounds of defense hollow points... two more partial boxes of brass ammo.

2 Holsters - a Desantis pocket holster and an acecase ankle holster. Both guns work with both holsters."

Burris AR-536 Optic- the AR-536 is a compact, fast-acquisition optic designed for lawmen, military personnel, and competitive shooters who want additional range. The red or green illuminated reticle provides nanosecond response to immediate targets. It also allows for careful shooting at distant threats. A rotary, 10-position power selector accommodates all lighting conditions. The reticle runs on one CR2032 battery. The Ballistic CQ™ reticle features holdover dots good out to 600 yards. They work best with 5.56 or 7.62 ammunition. Picatinny rails allow piggybacking of additional sights, lasers or lights. And the Burris Forever Warranty™ backs the entire, rugged design.
JP Enterprises- JP EZ Trigger Kit: pull weight is currently at about 5lbs, and almost all the travel has been removed.
JP Enterprises- AR-15 Silent Captured Spring Heavy Version: Maintaining all the benefits of our polished buffer springs and proprietary LMOS™ buffer, this combination buffer-spring assembly eliminates the friction of standard buffer components resulting in outstanding smoothness and sound abatement. What’s more, the spring is removable from the assembly for custom tuning, and both the AR-15 and AR-10 versions of the JP Silent Captured Springs are functional in rifle- and carbine-length operating systems.
JP Enterprises- Standard Profile Compensator: Designed for competition this compensator reduces felt recoil and allows the shooter to get back on target faster

This is not the civi .7 mW version this unit is 5mW-35mW
This would be equivalent to a peq-2 but much more robust as it has a aluminum body no need for duck tape has a Arms mount 

The beam can be defocused for illumination out to 800 yards with your NV device and focused into a beam for shooting 

While robust and nice I have no need for such high power and would prefer a dual beam unit or $$$ to buy a dual beam unit I'll hear out trades but I need a dual beam unit not ammo...not guns....

Also another great thing about this unit is its not a peq 2-15 so it's legit

The AR is built with a Vltor MUR-1 upper, with removeable forward assist and brass deflector if that is your thing.
This is made with the 223 Wylde chamber and 1/8 rate of twist on a Ranier barrel.
The barrel length is 13.7"" with a permanently attached Noveske KX3 Firepig to make it a little over 16"".
Rainer 14"" free float rail system with FDE rail covers.
Magpul FDE flip up front and rear sights.
BCM large latch ambi charging handle, and an included RRA mpi tested NiB full auto bolt and carrier.

The lower is a Special Ops Tactical brand lower with a PSA lpk installed, along with a Magpul FDE pistol grip, and FDE Magpul stock.
For the right deal I can also throw in a Bushnell red dot sight that has performed surprisingly well, along with a FDE Magpul angled forward grip.

Noveske stopped making the Infidel model so I had RA build me an upper just like it and I paid $1400 for the upper alone.

The complete rifle has less than 300 rounds through it and was purchased new by me.

If you want to purchase instead of trading I would take $1100, and not a penny less, for just the upper, or $1275 for the complete rifle.

I really would prefer a trade of multiple guns and in no particular order, 2 basic ARs not too picky on brand, an AR with a Mossberg 500, 590, or 590a1, Mossberg Mariner.(Really would like to see one of these with the xtended magazine) All shotties in 12 gauge set up for home defense i.e. no bird guns please. I'm also interested in a Smith airweight NO LOCK in models 438, 442, 638, 642. I'm also a Glock guy and need a Gen 4 34, or 41, maybe a 43, 30sf, 30s, 21Gen 4 or SF, or even maybe a 36. Any combination of the above listed guns would be acceptable and let's remember folks the AR I'm offering was made to my specs and is not an off the shelf model. To get an idea of what it looks like Google images for the Noveske Infidel, or text me at REDACTED for cell pics


If you have only one of the guns listed above we can work out a deal with a little cash on your end.

This basically is coming down to the fact that I would rather have 2 ARs, or an AR with one of the handguns, or shotties I have listed.

As always I can text pics to those interested, and all offers need to be texted to REDACTED.

I'm in Choctaw but would drive a reasonable distance for a FTF deal.  Sorry about the long winded post.

P.S. Please no Olympic ARs or polymer lower ARs please, I just don't trust them, and I forgot to add I'd be interested in a Sig 320c especially in FDE, or a 10.5"" AR pistol with the Sig brace installed."

All TASER® models are an effective alternative to handguns. The most widely used stun weapon offered, the TASER® Advanced M26c is known worldwide for its tremendous take down power. This model is the preferred choice of many professionals, yet is now available for purchase by regular citizens. TASER® Advanced M26c devices use proprietary technology to incapacitate dangerous subjects who pose a risk in a manner that is generally recognized as a safer alternative to other uses of force. TASER® technology saves lives every day throughout the world. The TASER® Advanced M26c utilizes compressed nitrogen to project two small probes 15 feet at a speed of 180 feet per second. These probes are connected to the TASER® device by high-voltage insulated wire. A 50,000 volt, 26 watt electrical signal is transmitted throughout the region where the probes make contact with the body or clothing, resulting in an immediate loss of the person's neuromuscular control, balance and the ability to perform coordinated actions.

The quote at the bottom is from a statement by the Philosopher Seneca - pre-dating WW2 by two thousand or so years. 'Leben heisst kämpfen"" ... I dare to put my own Flemish (mothertongue, and certainly Germanic) against this original expression ... ""Het leven is een strijd"". Meaning nothing more as: ""Life is a struggle"" ... nothing to do with specific military talk of that era or this one. The fact that it was used on this statue is very interesting, and may have you thinking about the source of the title of the book the Austrian ex-painter wrote while serving time. A fellow obsessed with the struggle, the rise from nobody to somebody. regards to Hitler and his quotes it is very easy to simplify him or classify him as simple as that is what we see on forums, History Channel, Etc. and that is where some get their history. The language argument is trumped by the piece at least in this case and the arguments with language arguments are some of the most annoying I have encountered over the years when looking at an original piece. Hitler was not a simple guy at all, he absorbed massive amounts of text pertaining to history and photographed it in his memory, a very intelligent guy. So unless he specifically quotes a source of his words than its at best a monkey with a dart guess. To make it even more complicated he stole everything and never credited his sources in many cases. Every quote, motto, speech, physical mannerism is specifically choreographed to achieve a maximum response. Hitler was a politician and like most other politicians he took what he wanted and used it to fit his agenda, he just happened to be a lot smarter than people realize. Life is a struggle Life means fighting Translations of philosophical ideas are often like cover songs. If you hear Amazing Grace performed by a choir, and then hear it on a violin, you will know the tune, but also get a different feel from it. Words are the same. How many times has the bible been translated? Regardless, interesting plaque. Tyrants of old and new times seem to enjoy images of themselves. Posters, busts, stamps, whatever. I guess it's a way to build a cult of personality, to deify oneself. I would not get hung up on language too much, and there are people out there who still retain a personal opinion or some kind bias where they understand collecting guns or militaria but draw some kind of imaginary line on Adolf Hitler as if he can be written off as irrelevant to study and simply demonized with an end of subject. Does not work that way. *reply by email call or text 7205175213"

BARELY used (50 rounds) Canik TP9.  This is NOT the SA model.  This model is DA and SA.  3rd Magazine comes with the gun, but you will need to make a small adjustmentioned to make it work.  Needs to be filed/dremmeled to seat probably.  I didn't catch it before my return period was over.  I was sent an older gen magazine, and it didn't fit.

Manufacturer: Century Arms International
Exciting new, polymer framed, striker-fire, 9mm pistol made in Turkey by Canik55, designed with reliability and ergonomics as top priorities. Outer steel parts are poly coated to prevent corrosion and to help lubricate the slide and frame. 
The TP-9 also features a black chrome lined - cold forged barrel, an ambidextrous top-slide-mounted decocker for super-safe carry, click adjustable 3 dot sighting system, cocking indicator and a front accessory rail for all your bling!

I'm looking to find any farmers or land owners within an hour or so of Racine that need a hand with pest/nuisance control. Anything from dove to deer that are destroying property or crops. With a growing family and a busy work schedule I'm looking for places close to home to hunt. Figure I'd try to help someone out if I can. However you would like, whenever you allow, with whichever tool you prefer I use.

I am happy to offer planned weekends to offer help and services working on your farm or helping to maintain land however you wish. 

I was raised as an honest man by my father to have a tremendous amount of respect for other people and their property. You will feel no pressure or disrespect from myself at any time. 

If you have anything you would like to discuss or know of someone that could use help, but doesn't use a computer, please either email me, text or call me. Thank you for your time.

The stock is in excellent shape, but has a small nick in the pistol grip / wrist. The nick does not compromise the strength or integrity of the stock. This particular Mossberg has been shot many times and the action is smooth and reliable. It cannot be used with slugs, due to the C-Lect Choke feature, but handles all other 2 3/4"" 20G loads. This 185K-A was manufactured in 1950, which was the only year this specific model was produced by Mossberg."
