The 3.5-15 x 50 F1 NXS is the answer. The reticle is located in the first focal plane, which has distinct advantages in high-stress situations and when the user might encounter targets from upclose to 1000 yards or more. A first focal plane reticle remains in the same visual proportion to the target across the scope’s entire magnification range, making it especially appropriate with rangefinding reticles. Combined with Nightforce highly tactile and intuitive adjustments, it makes for a scope that is extremely quick, accurate, responsive and utterly reliable.

Polymer framed pistols are definitely not our forte or favorite kind of merchandise; we grudgingly admit, however, that the Kel-Tec is a good gun, strange and non-traditional as it is. The reason we stock these is because they’re popular, and the little company does deserve credit for innovation and simplicity. Since the late 1980s, we have personally sold more than 1000 Kel-Tecs, over the counter to local customers who actually use and carry them, and we have sent fewer than 10 of them back to the factory for service. Any time a product has less than 3% return ratio; any time, that is, that 3 or less out of 100 of any particular item ever requires repair or service, it is a good product. Kel-Tec is better than that. Factory specs are as follows: caliber .380 ACP; semi-auto double action only; 6 + 1 capacity; standard black ultra high impact polymer grip and grip frame; Cerakote OD Green finished slide; integrated sights; weight empty 8.5 oz; 5 pound trigger pull; 2 1/2 inch barrel. This pistol’s finish is one of the most durable that Kel-Tec makes. Photos show a Cerakote / black grip frame variant we had at press time.

The result of this second trial was that the Department of the Army announced on May 22, 1989 that Beretta had won again. This military contract with Beretta U.S.A. Corp. initially involved over 320,000 Model M9s (military designation for the commercial Model 92F) manufactured for U.S. military consumption in the 1990s. Actual delivery of commercial Model 92s began in January of 1986, while M9 delivery to U.S. Armed Forces exceeded 430,000 units, and was completed in 1999.*If you need this item shipped, there is an additional $9.99 fee."

Excellent condition. I've taken them on 2 trips to Montana for muley and antelope hunts, otherwise they have been in the safe. I do not have the rubber eye cups for them, but Swarovski sells them for $30, but I do have and I'm including the tripod adaptor that sells for $177.  Due to their weight, they are best used with a tripod or monopod. This is the best set of glass I have owned.  I've had their spotting scope and although this doesn't have the same magnification it is much easier on your eyes.  Cabela's had them on sale for $2250, I'm asking $1400 shipped tyd, paypal or cash.  Thank you"

Forward-ejecting allows theRFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup. The patented,dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment itleaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamberand lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, wherethey exit. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automaticrifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; thereciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safetydisconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpupconfiguration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than itscompetitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanismcross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast toexisting Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup developedbecause the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansionis directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shootershead and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threadedmuzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with Keltec's A2-style Flash Hider.A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It acceptsstandard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not needto be tilted in.

This is a bad ass drop in trigger with a 3.5lb pull weight. You can read the reviews for yourself but basically this is a top of the line competition trigger, and what is great about it is that it literally is made to drop in the trigger slot of your AR15.

This gun would be great for concealed carry because of its size, or a night stand gun because it is striker fired and the safety acts as a decocker also. This means you can put one in the chamber and not have to have the firing pin cocked, but with the double action- you are ready to rock in an emergency situation with you, or your family lives at stake.

So add one to your collection with the Beretta 92FS Trident Semi Auto Handgun. The 92FS is a double/single action semi auto pistol that employs an open slide, short recoil delayed locking block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open slide design practically eliminates ""stove-piping"" and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world's most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match.Specifications and Features:Beretta 92FS TridentSingle/Double action9mm Luger4.9"" barrel15 round magazine8.5"" overall length6.1"" sight radiusWalnut gripsTrident logoSkeletonized hammer33 oz"
