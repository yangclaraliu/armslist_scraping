The reloader simply inserts the case into the gauge to insure that it does not exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum allowable headspace. In addition, the gauge will identify a case which exceeds the maximum allowable case length .

Instead of screwing dies in, the Lock-N-Load system lets you change dies with just a simple twist. Die settings remain firm, and the die is held perfectly solid in the loader. The Lock-N-Load Classic is designed to make reloading quicker and give you the precision to create perfect, consistent loads, round after round. It's classic Hornady precision reloading with productivity that's better than ever.Features: 1. Lock-N-Load Bushing System. Load and unload dies with a simple twist of the Lock-N-Load die bushing. The positive locking action holds dies perfectly- aligned and rock-solid. This makes the Lock-N-Load Classic the fastest single action press ever. 2. Automatic Primer Feed (Not included) 3. Easy-Grip Handle. Uses the popular ball-type grip that's easier to use and reduces fatigue. 4. Super-Strong Angled Frame. This logical development provides the rigidity of the O-style frame with a 30 angle that gives the loader greater visibility and access to work. Guaranteed to never fail.5. PPS (Positive Priming System). Automatically feeds the primer through the center hold of the shell holder, aligning it with the primer pocket in the case. The primer is then seated at the bottom of the stroke. Primer arm comes with two sizes of interchangeable cups that can be removed when not needed. 6. Power-Pac Linkage. This unique design actually multiplies and accelerates the leverage you apply to the handle. Solid-steel arms rotate on steel pins that run completely through the cast frame. 7. Computer-Aided/Driven Manufacturing. Hornady machines the die and ram openings using advanced, CNC machining to assure precision alignment of the ram and the die. The case is perfectly aligned with the die whether you are depriming, sizing or seating bullets.Each Lock-N-Load Classic press comes with Primer Catcher and three Lock-N-Load die bushings. Dies and shell holders are sold separately.Warranty: No risk, lifetime warranty. Check it out Here Sign up for the Newsletter for Free giveways, Contests and gear updates."

This rifle is chambered for the 7.62X54R round, and features a 20 inch barrel, tactical forend, reinforced RPK receiver, integrated dust cover in the recoil spring, Tapco trigger, and Dragunov stock. I have a Midwest Industries scope mount, with steel tactical SWFA rings, with a SWFA SS 20X tactical scope with mildot reticle. I am including 2 five round mags, and 4 ten round mags. I have a Blackhawk cheek rest, to bring the eye to where it needs to be, and I am including a sling swivel, with Russian sling, and 150 rounds of loose ammo, and a sealed tin of 360 rounds of ammo. All ammo included is 185 grain steel case, new manufacture, and is what I have found to group the best from this system. I am including the original booklet with the rifle, as I have thrown the box out (yea, we all do this). Also, I have conducted the shot data for this rifle out to 1500 yards, and confirmed it at 100 yards, 200 yards, 300 yards, 500 yards, and 700 yards. All the data is confirmed and rifle is zeroed, so all you have to do is buy and shoot. And, as always, and for those of you who have bought from me before, I have no issues with anyone test firing the rifle prior to purchasing. I have tried to find this rifle online, and so far am unable to do so. Remember, it’s a factory rifle, not a local build, and its Russian manufactured. I am asking $2,200 cash, or, I am open to trades, for a .308 AR rifle, with optics, mags and ammo. I am offering a package, so I expect the same kind returned."

Accommodating shotguns up to 50"" in length, the SKB Dry-Tek Shotgun Bags features the patented ""Dry-Tek Difference"". The two-layer padding will work in tandem to draw moisture from the inner bag. The inner pad layer enables water to pass through to the outer layer where a remarkable one-way laminate membrane applied to the outer layer allows water molecules to exit the bag, but not to enter.

Don't over pay cause someone else did. This web site used to be great until it turned into a bunch of people trying to screw over the next guy because they made poor choices in a panic. Get real!! Buy your guns reasonably and legally and on sale. Then ad your own custom paint or lasers and then charge yourself a extra $100+

The rifle has a nice and bright bore, with rifling so sharp you could carve the bird on Turkey day. The trigger is like a 2 ounce benchrest trigger with an extra 3-4 pounds added to it. It breaks as easily as a captured Chinese spy being waterboarded. The stock would give viagra a run for its money. The bolt locks up tighter than Pamela Anderson. Being manufactured in 1936, its got more stories to tell than 90% of the 16 year old girls on this sight that are trying to sell used garbage at retail prices. According to my gunsmith, it comes equipped with the more desirable large ring action. Great for plinking, re-barreling project, or if you're just into riding them hard and putting them away wet, well..., she'll hold up to that as well. (Insert Pam Anderson comment here) 
Will sell for a hundred bucks or a night with Pam.  (Yes, I know she's not quite spotless)

I purchased it new. and I know I fired it at least once and there is a very faint drag line. As it turns out I really didn't care for 357 mags so it's been in the safe since and not used again, I did loose the original box and materials that came with it however I did acquire a supposedly new factory box with the foam and manuals many years ago and a couple years ago I acquired a Colt label with the guns information. It has never been holstered and the blueing looks perfect as do the grips. If you are looking for a nearly new Colt Python this is the one.

I bought this new in 2008.
It has been to the range on and off since I have owned it, still looks like new. I have added a GSG brand retractable stock to it, original stock is included as well.
Everywhere that there were two screws I installed HK push pins.
Added a scope mount and a sling mount as well.
I have boxes for everything and manuals. Comes with 4 mags, they hold 22 rounds each.
The Red Dot Sight is NOT included nor for sale.

Really fun gun to shoot, runs like a sewing machine. Great for kids of all ages.
Price break down:
GSG 5 $525
Stock $ 89
Mags $ 30 each (purchased 3)
HK Pins $ 20
Scope Mount $20
Sling Mount $20
Total $764 

Please do not confuse this with the GSG-522. My gun is mostly metal, with a poly lower. It is the one HK sued German Sport Guns over, because it looks and feels like an MP-5. It was only made for about a year, when it was pulled from the market and re-introduced as the 522, which isn't nearly as nice. Do your research before sending me ball busting emails.

IF THE AD IS UP, THEN YES IT IS STILL AVAILABLE
18 yrs or older with a valid IN DL, would prefer a LTCH (carry permit) but not a deal breaker.

HK Mark 23 V1 
Mint condition Safe Queen! Older version with factory HK camouflage soft case. Comes with 4 - 12 round HK factory magazines.
Cash Only: No Trades. 

The HK factory Camouflage soft case alone is now selling for over $300 on Gunbroker. 

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. 

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. 

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. 

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. 

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

Enhance precision and pinpoint accuracy when using the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope w/ Red Chevron BAC Flattop Reticle & Flat Top Adapter. This rifle scope by Trijicon is designed to be zeroed in using the tip at 100 meters and the width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. Trijicon TA31F ACOG 4x32 Scope w/ Chevron BAC Flattop Reticle features Dual Illumination (Fiber Optic provides daylight illumination and tritium illuminates reticle at night). The ranging reticle is calibrated for 5.56mm (.223 cal) flat-top rifles out to 800 meters. Trijicon TA-31F 4x32mm ACOG Advanced Tactical Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bind on Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Rifle Scope w/ Flat Top Adapter is designed for use with the tactical rifle family and every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries.
