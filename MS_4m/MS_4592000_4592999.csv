Info from Arsenal website below.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length stock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

It is a Double/Single action pistol with a safety, capable of being carried ""cocked and locked"", or double-action with the safety on or off.
Features the unique ""tilt-up"" barrel design which eliminates the need to rack the slide, which can be difficult for some shooters.  The small size of the gun, comfortable grip design, and low recoil of .22LR makes this a pleasant gun to both carry and shoot at the range.
Comes with three magazines; one is original, two are Mec-Gar aftermarket magazines.
Also comes with an Uncle Mike's Size 1 Pocket Holster.
Does not come with the ammunition as shown in the picture.
Gun is completely functioning, has some wear on the finish.

A single handgun to represent the entire company history, the most iconic desirable and collectible model though not some ultra rare variant of any but the plain iconic one. Ideally I'd be getting my mitts on a P7 or any of those crazy variants. This pistol is the most important design in the whole history of the industry for combining the words squeeze and cock without triggering any of the little German Ooters into giggling into their chocolate brautvurst off in their corner of the factory. Also Hans from Die Hard shot Jon McCain with one. I have the Beretta, the MP5, the Stay'ere, Ogg and that's the only Die Hard gun left I need make a film reenactment with myself in every role. This is my decree: I want a P7.

but hang on hold the phone I just turned over the wildcard. See I have this .45 suppressor that's about to have all the last of its red tape balled up paperwork filed away in the ATF's Guy's Who Have Suffered Enough drawer and I'll finally have a .45 pew pew can that gets even quieter when it's a .45 pee pee can though I hear water also works. I want a gun to put this on and no number of cock squeezings is gonna make it work on a 9mm P7 with a factory non threaded barrel.

This means I would also accept a Mark 23 as the coolest most iconic pistol H&K ever made, and I will consider any and all offers of anybody who wants to trade me this giant shiny beast even though it looks like an oversized cartoon gun from a 1980s Frank Miller comic book set in the robocop style future where all handguns must fit comfortably in the hands of a cyborg replicunt. It's super awesome for the fact that it was used by Navy SEALS as an ""Offensive Handgun"" as in a pistol you should use to attack the enemy army, presumably in a mission to free all the Navy's captured rifles so they can then put those rifles back to use as a last ditch defensive tool in case their pistol jams. Or by that old guy in Breaking Bad when he attacked all those guys with those balloons and one of these. It was an offensive handgun then all right. It could also mean ""offensive"" handgun in that every fifth or six shot, instead of a 120decible blast of sound, it simply screams I HATE (random slur for race, sexuality, or physical or mental handicap). Luckily my silencer should handle this drawback.

Would like to do a trade for it. Have an S&W 1006 10mm that's currently listed under handguns, an HK4, a Colt Trooper, and a four screw S&W Combat Masterpiece I'm currently planning to swap out but dozens of other items I might swing for the right example. Also, you know, money. Let me know and I'll try to come up with a more tempting offer if all those don't grab you.

So in summary, I want your P7 or Mark 23 or that little gimpy thing they think is going to replace the Mark 23, the HK45C Tactical.

I can trade a whole bunch of great stuff. I got H&K USPs, HK4s, CZ 97Bs with the high polish blue finish that makes it look like a thing of natural beauty. Freedom Arms revolvers. Colt snakes. Anacondas. S&W WW1 revolvers. Sphinx 2000s from Switslund. Manwhorins from Frenchland the best revolvers ever made because they're basically smith and wessons but with a bunch of snailjuice slickin up the triggers. Sig P210s with target sights and high polish blue and extra slides in .30 luger and .22. Man I got everything I can make yo a sweeet trade just let me know what you have and I will custom devise you a a deal of the century."

This is NOT the commercial version. 03-A3 action, Fajen Hand Checkered Tiger Striped AA European Walnut Stock with a Birds Eye Maple for end cap and grip cap, and Federal Firearms barrel. Fajen contracted Small Arms MFG. to build these rifles in the 60's and sold them under the model name ACRA. These guns are very rare, especially in this caliber due to the 250 Savage being a special order caliber. Most were made in 30-06.This one was built by custom rifle builder Norvy Hartley and is just about flawless. Receiver is drilled and tapped. Has bases, rings and 27 rounds and 13 once fired cases. The 250 Savage, originally called the 250-3000, was developed in 1919 and is the first caliber to break 3000 fps. The pictures don't do it any justice. I had it appraised by Jim Kaimann of Kaimann Firearms and Auctions. He valued it between $2000 & $2500. Valuing the stock at $1000. Appraisal sheet is available with the rifle.
I'm asking $1000 because I know it won't be an easy sale.
Open to trades.

It has 2 barrels a 24-28 inch (will measure tonight) and an 18.5 inch barrel with heat shield. I bought it for $275 with the longer barrel and replaced the action bars because it had problems with double feeding and misfeeding. It no longer does that. I built the gun to be styled like an old school riot gun hence the 18.5 inch barrel with heat shield i purchased for a $100 at a gun show.  Stocks are well worn. Trigger guard is cracked. Neither barrel has screwable chokes. The bolt and elevator have fish scales but is blemished. Finish is also blemished would think this would be the perfect cabin gun or great for a learning gunsmith to purchase.

 The gun did experience issues with the forend getting stuck back a few times, the solution was to lube the gun more and that stopped it from doing that for me. I got it working correctly but have only put 50 rounds through it since the tuneup. Has a nice leather sling attached. I have at least $400 in the gun thus far so I think  $300 is fair price. 

Comes with 1 1/4 boxes of buckshot. FTF transaction at Southern Armory as the FFL transfer location."

I have just moved to Kansas City and the move took a bit more out of my resources than I thought.  This is not a MUST SELL so serious inquiry's only.  I do require a bill of sale which means valid drivers license.  I file this in my safe for legal liability reasons.  Any questions, please ask.  I can send more pictures.  This was a project for me that I loved so much and she is the talk of the town at the range.  PERFECT for range/competitions and home defense.  All of the recoil goes straight back into the shoulder...next to zero muzzle climb.  I personally have never had to re-acquire my targets in between rounds. 

As always, I know what I have into it and what it is worth.  Make me an offer.  The worst that I can say is no."

less than 200 rounds for function testing. has minor scrapes and marks from being moved around in my safe and its an AK they work better the harder you beat them! i was gonna camo it or refinish with rattle can, but figured the new owner can make that call.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK light pull trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall crisp break. Typically striker fired guns have a pre travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. The VP9 you have a less than noticeable pre travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest state of the art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left or right handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine 15 and 10 round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 M700009-A5"
