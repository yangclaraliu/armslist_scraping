This pistol has the correct markings on the frame and slide but the serial number on the barrel does not match the one on the frame (6T99xx) and the barrel might be a replacement. The barrel bore is excellent and shiny with sharp rifling.
The grips are dark plastic or bakelite and are probably replacements.
Someone added two white dots to the fixed rear sight and i painted the dots green and the front sight blade orange for better visibility.
The 13 round magazine is not original as it says ""Made in Italy"". Also the lanyard ring is missing.
The dark blue finish is in very good condition and i would rate the pistol 90% overall.
I replaced the grips with a nice set of smooth walnut Altamont grips.
The pistol comes with (4) brand new 13 round Mec-Gar magazines, a brand new black leather belt slide holster and a zippered fleece lined pouch.

EDIT: Ok folks, this seems to be confusing a lot of you. The moon clip cuts on the cylinder were done at the factory. That is what a Pro Series is. Secondly, moon clips are a way to facilitate faster reloads by making all the cartridges one unit that goes in and out of the revolver. Yes, some revolvers use moon clips to fire non rimmed centerfire cartridges. No, this revolver will not fire 9mm. The pressures are different and the charging chambers are not milled for 9mm. I hope that helps clear up any confusion.
