These are pretty hard to find and they are a great compact if you are looking for something to carry. The PCR name stands for 'Police Czech Republic,' the group for whom the model was originally designed. Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. It has snag-free, fixed 3-dot sights. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.We buy guns and layaway is available! Sorry, no trades and all state and local laws apply. We are an FFL dealer so you must be able to pass a background check. 3% credit card fee. We can also ship this gun to other FFLs if needed."

The action is a slidelock, instead of the usual boxlock. The receiver is made of a single block of Nickel-Crome Alloy steel. This gave the gun a longer life, while also creating a smooth action. The barrels are 28in vent rib, made of Boehler Antinit steel. The barrels are fixed chokes. Top is full, and the bottom is modified. These shotguns are known for their exceptional engraving and detail. The SO2 was the middle level for engraving. The engraving is simple and elegant scroll work with some flowers in the center. The Release lever has a silver inlaid pigeon engraved on it. The stock and forend have hand checkering. The detail that can be seen in the work is impressive.

It's in good condition along with all the factory stuff (two mags, box, etc).  Barrel has been polished and magazine disconnect has been removed (can put it back if you really want it though).  Depending on what you have I also have a leather Tagua IWB holster I can include. I would be interested in trading for an LC9s or possibly similar single stack, pocket or subcompact 9mm's. Just looking for something a bit smaller and have been wanting to try out an LC9s for awhile. Will trade straight across for an LC9s with two magazines. Might consider similar single stack 9mm's, such as a SIG p290rs, XDs 9mm, Kahr CM9, or similar, but primarily interested in the LC9s.

Inspired by the lack of power offered by the 5.56 NATO cartridge used in the M4 carbine and the M16 rifle, the .458 SOCOM came about from informal discussion of members of the special operations community, specifically Task Force Ranger's experience that multiple shots were required to neutralize members of the opposing force in Mogadishu during Operation Gothic Serpent. Marty ter Weeme of Teppo Jutsu designed the cartridge in 2000 and Tony Rumore of Tromix was contracted to build the first .458 SOCOM rifle in February 2001. Tony Rumore fired the very first round of .458 SOCOM ammunition in the Tromix shop located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma on February 16, 2001, at 8:30pm.

The project sponsor set forth a number of specific requirements that led to the ultimate design as it stands right now[when?]: The cartridge had to fit in the M-4 carbine platform and magazines and be capable of firing heavy-for-caliber projectiles at subsonic velocity using suppressors. During the developments phase, various other cartridges were considered and proposed to the project sponsor, but rejected as not meeting all the requirements. The cartridges considered were 7.62×39mm M43, 9x39mm Grom, .45 Professional (which has since become the .450 Bushmaster), and .50 Action Express. At the time, the .499 LWR cartridge was still in development phase and had not been chambered commercially.

The .45 Professional was ruled out because in an interview with industry press, the developer of said cartridge stated that steel proprietary to General Motors was used in the bolts and extensions to withstand the high operating pressures. The .50 AE and .499 LWR were ruled out because in 2000 only two bullets were offered in .501 diameter, both developed as pistol bullets for the .50 AE and not heavy enough for the subsonic suppressed role. Research had indicated that a short belted cartridge called the .458 × 1.5"" Barnes had been adopted for use in suppressed bolt action rifles for use in SE Asia during the Vietnam War. It was shown as effective in terms of ballistics, firing a 500 grain bullet subsonically, but not ideally suited for its role due to the size and weight of the platform. Combined with the wide selection of bullets available in .458 diameter, this cemented the choice of caliber.

The cartridge case design was finalized based on discussions with Tony Rumore at Tromix suggesting a lengthened .50 AE case would work well in the magazines as well as be the largest diameter case to be able to feed through the barrel extension. The rim size was chosen for compatibility with other platforms, primarily bolt action rifles, as the .473"" diameter rim is arguably the most common rim size globally (all bolt actions chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser, .30-06 Springfield or .308 Winchester share this rim size). The case length was chosen to be compatible with the Barnes 300-grain X Spitzer bullet. In 2009, Barnes developed a new bullet specifically for use in the .458 SOCOM, the 300 grain Tipped Triple Shock X, also known as the TTSX or TAC-X.

As noted above, the cartridge was designed to be 100% compatible with the M4 platform. This included the buffer, buffer spring, GI magazines, many aftermarket .223/5.56 magazines, and magazine well. In .223/5.56 caliber, cartridges stack in a staggered (double stack) fashion.

Anyhow what I am looking for is a caliber in the M77 for 600+ yard shots and at the other end of the shot bring down a moose. I have shot the 7mm Remington mag and the 300 Win mag, I liked both.

Here's the deal got a moose, caribou and sheep tags in Alaska. My Buddy that lives up there tells me I will enhance my ability to bag animals, especially the Moose, If I can shoot effectively up to 600 yards.

I will listen to any good advice you may have on caliber and/or make.

""It has been 20 years since the fall of communism in Eastern Block. During the Cold War Era CZ pistols could only be sold to the ""friendly"" communist countries. The Soviet Army left their post in Eastern Europe in 1990-1991. To celebrate the 20 years of freedom CZ-USA offers 999 pcs of the Cold War Replica CZ 75B. This is a 9mm Luger, Cold War Commemorative Edition, black polycoat, original spur hammer and round trigger guard. It also features a Soviet Era Hammer & Sickle symbol as well as Soviet Red Star, and Russian lettering."" 
There were only 999 of these made for the entire world.  Special serial number starts with CCCP.  Includes the original box, manual, serialized warranty book and the factory test target.  I have several CZ 75-Bs and none of the others have test fired like this one--look at the factory target!  This gun was shot by its previous owner and has a few small marks on the Polycoat finish.  I would rate it as a solid 95%.  I prefer a face-to-face sale in the Columbus, Ohio area so you can see the gun in person before buying it.  I would also consider a trade for the right 1911.  Please tell me what you have.  Insured shipping to your FFL will be an additional $25.  If you live in a state where it must ship from my FFL, shipping will be $60.  Face to face sale must be in cash.  If I ship it, payment must be made by U.S. POSTAL MONEY ORDER ONLY.  No MoneyGram or American Express money orders.  No sales to California, New York, or anywhere else where a sale is prohibited or complicated.  Thanks for looking."

The upper is used and has <800 rounds through it. The lower and parts to this rifle are all new and in unfired condition. The lower receiver itself is a new unused closed trigger Anderson Manufacturing AR15A3. If you are not familiar with closed trigger lowers they provide extra strength you can not get from open trigger types. The LPK is a new unused LRPK-1 DPMS kit. The bolt carrier group is brand new and unused from DS Arms.  The bolt itself is made from 9310 Super Alloy Steel and is stronger than Carpenter No 158 that most everyone else uses these days. The bolt carrier is made from proper 8620 steel. It is shot peened and chrome lined. The buttstock buffer and buffer spring are Bushmaster A2 and are used. The price for this build is $600. Anyone who knows AR's would know the upper receiver on this rifle alone is worth about that much depending on who you ask. Local sale only FTF with valid ODL or CHL.

The ""Taurus Judge"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 3"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law."

>>>here is some Description of this gun<<<

The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.

Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters

Beretta Website:
Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use.

Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering."

Manufacturer's Description:



Designed for practice shooting and training with the pistol you are already familiar, the 92(*) Series Practice Kit includes a steel .22LR barrel, aluminum slide with FS manual safety and firing pin block device, recoil spring guide, recoil spring, magazine loader and 10 round techno-polymer magazine. The slide features a fixed front sight and fully adjustable rear sight. The locking system becomes blow-back. The finish is matte black which matches factory Bruniton pistols.


(*)The Kit can be mounted on ALL SERIES 92 PISTOLS WITH STANDARD FRAME - MODELS 92SB, 92F, 92FS, 98F, 98FS and 96 as well as MODELS 92G, 96G, 92D, 98F CAL. 7.65 MM PARA and on the TARGET, BRIGADIER, CENTURION AND ELITE versions.
However, the practice kit cannot be used on models:
- COMPACT L and COMPACT L ""TYPE M"", due to their shorter frame and slide,
- COMBAT, STOCK, and BILLENNIUM versions due to their totally different safety systems (frame-mounted safety),
- 90-Two (9mm/.40S&W), 92A1 and 96A1 due the different frame dimensions.

I have too many AKs and am getting rid of some that just sit in the safe.  The Yugo is completely unfired and all I did was change out the plastic pistol grip for a wood pistol grip, but if you wish I can switch it back before purchase. I am asking $650 for the Yugo which is the cheapest I can find them online, and you're saving on shipping and transfer fee.  You must have a valid driver's license, but I would prefer a concealed carry ID (not required but preferential).

The Norinco is an NHM-91 RPK clone without bipod.  I have the original furniture but swapped out the handguards for a bakelite lower and wood upper, and the buttstock with a wood AK style buttstock.  The finish has some wear spots from the previous owner but the action is smooth and the trigger pull is very nice (NHM-91s have a lighter, crisper trigger than standard AKs).  Please do your research if you are unfamiliar with these, as they are very high quality rifles.  I am asking $700 for the NHM-91 with both sets of furniture if you would like to convert it back to the original configuration. 

If you have any questions or would like any more specific pictures, please text me at REDACTED.  I would be willing to ship to an individual within the state of NC or to an FFL outside of the state, but you will cover shipping costs and provide proof of FFL if out of state.

It's a Norinco 1911A1 clone with some nice patina and in good functional shape.  I got this on a trade but realized I just won't shoot it much as I prefer my Glocks.  

It will come with a Plano handgun case and two magazines (one is promag, the other brand is unknown). I am asking $450 which seems to be a good price on these, as they are getting hard to find.  I am not looking for trades as I am trying to fund a different project.

The dust cover has been drilled and tapped by a previous owner for a rail section.  I have the rail section and screws that go with it and it's fully functional.  I mounted a TLR-1 on it and it's comparable to my full rail 1911.

If you are unfamiliar with these, look them up.  They are one of the few brands Wilson Combat will do custom work to due to their quality (http://www.wilsoncombat.com/faq_handgun.htm).

Edit: I flipped the picture of the right side of the pistol, so it looks kind of odd, but it is a standard right hand 1911.

First up is a pelican 1400 case in good shape with two layers of internal foam.  If you'd like to make it a custom cut case you would need another layer of foam, but it works great for transporting things as is.  I am asking $50 for the case.

Next, I have a set of tactical recover grips for a 1911 government size in woodland digital camo.  I am asking $40 for these as they are like new and come with the original packaging, tool, and everything you would get from the store.  They are unused.

I also have an AK side rail mount that I believe was made by UTG but may be made by another manufacturer.  It has a top and side rail for mounting optics or lights and WILL ONLY WORK WITH AKs THAT HAVE A SIDE RAIL ALREADY RIVETED TO THE RECEIVER.  If you are unsure if it will work with your rifle, just shoot me a text. I am asking $20 for this.

Finally, I have a box of 7.5x54 French MAS ammo with 10 rounds in it.  I would like $10 for the ammo as it is pretty hard to find (not recent production).

I even had my friends and my wife go to the store because they would not sell it all directly to me ( such a55holes at this particular store ). Now that I have all the 22lr in my area I'm going to try and double my money. In my eyes a 20% return on investment is rubbish I'm going for 90 to 100%.
