Beautiful nickel finish has only a faint hint of imperfection on the frame beneath the cylinder release, but, it is so minor it can't be seen in the photos. Other than that, the gun is perfect and gleams like a mirror with hardly even a turn line. The grips are flawless as well. While I've not shot it, I can't say that the gun has not been fired, but, you'd be hard-pressed to say that it had very much use, if at all. Sorry, no box or papers with this one , but, it is a beauty!"

Vepr in .308 winchester features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 20” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

See Colt Collectors for general information: http://www.coltautos.com/1908vpusn.htm   NOTE: IMO, their guns are not in as good of condition as this one.  When I got it, I assumed this went to a madam in a New Orleans brothel or to the mistress of a big-shot.  No such luck, it was delivered to a now defunct hardware wholesaler in Texas, but maybe they sold it to one of the afore mentioned.  The finish is near perfect and it shoots--I have tested it.  About the only fault is the bore is not great, but it is shootable."

I am selling my POF P308 and 2 of my P415s, 14.5"" (brake is pinned) to fund another build. Sorry, but no trades...

P308 has less than 100 rounds through this upper and I followed the break in process illustrated on POFs website. The 556s have roughly 250 rounds through each, some suppressed.  

P308 Rifle - $1700 ->16.5"" NP3 7.62/308 M Rail w/ GEN3 lower

P415s - $1300/ea -> 14.5"" Black 14-11T Gen 3

Buyer pays shipping, but I we can discuss the amount at sale as I think I can get a discount on package deals.

I'll throw in the modular rail on both 556s and still have the tactical rail as well. Scopes, bipods and AAC brake not included.

 P415s - These are the best 223s I have owned.  They are tack drivers as they run with factory loads and I have put 2 rounds through same hole at 100yds.  They run all ammo flawlessly, suppressed and non-suppressed.

 P308 - Since I have a man crush on my P415s, I went and bought this P308.  Unfortunately I do not use it at all and it should go to a good home to use it as it was meant to.

Very nice .22LR, far more accurate than bulk .22LR available now. While it isn't Match Grade ammo, it is Target Grade, and worth every penny.
Sold through Norma USA, a Swiss-owned company, this ammo is made in Germany by RWS, another manufacturer of high quality rimfire ammunition.Please read online reviews of this Norma TAC 22 ammo, it has been found to be quite accurate, more so than CCI Standard Velocity, and is providing groups previously only found with much higher priced Match Grade .22LR ammo.This ammo carries the RWS headstamp of an 'R' inside a shield, and it has the same RWS plastic trays, boxes, and slick bullet lube, so it is essentially RWS ammunition. Frankly, Norma and RWS are both considered upper-end ammunition manufacturers, so you have a Swiss company selling ammo under the prestigious Norma name, being made by RWS in Germany, another premium brand name... suffice it to say that this is QUALITY ammo. Nothing like Rem Thunderbolt or Federal Bulk Pack rimfire .22LR, this is not plinking ammo, even though it is priced at plinking ammo levels.ONLY TEN BRICKS LEFT!!"

Very nice .22LR, far more accurate than bulk .22LR available now. While it isn't Match Grade ammo, it is Target Grade, and worth every penny.
Sold through Norma USA, a Swiss-owned company, this ammo is made in Germany by RWS, another manufacturer of high quality rimfire ammunition.Please read online reviews of this Norma TAC 22 ammo, it has been found to be quite accurate, more so than CCI Standard Velocity, and is providing groups previously only found with much higher priced Match Grade .22LR ammo.This ammo carries the RWS headstamp of an 'R' inside a shield, and it has the same RWS plastic trays, boxes, and slick bullet lube, so it is essentially RWS ammunition. Frankly, Norma and RWS are both considered upper-end ammunition manufacturers, so you have a Swiss company selling ammo under the prestigious Norma name, being made by RWS in Germany, another premium brand name... suffice it to say that this is QUALITY ammo. Nothing like Rem Thunderbolt or Federal Bulk Pack rimfire .22LR, this is not plinking ammo, even though it is priced at plinking ammo levels.ONLY TEN BRICKS LEFT!!"

2010 Remington Shotguns
Overview:
The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

For 2010, our new Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

    Action design based on the venerable Model 870 - ultra-smooth and reliable

You've been asking for a couple +P 45 AUTO RIM loads for a long time, so by popular demand, here they are. Both loads are using high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated a flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the equivalent of +P+ 45 ACP ammo or as it is also known, 45 Super. These are very stout loads, but will not harm modern 45 ACP revolvers, nor will these loads harm any post war 45 ACP revolvers. Feel free to safely shoot these loads in any post war 45 ACP revolver that is in normal good operating condition.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun gives speeds almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 and 6.5 inch barrels. This is NOT a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel. Also, we are aware that the 1937 manufactured model 1917 we used as a test gun, (see below velocity chart) is not post war.

Item # 32B - 200gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1197 fps
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 1080 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1203 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1249 FPS

Item # 32B was designed for expansion and massive terminal damage, with less than 1/2 the penetration of item # 32A in flesh and bone. Expect about 14 inches of penetration from this load on live flesh and bone."

I got this in a trade not too long ago and haven't put any live rounds through it personally. The ergonomics of this CZ are terrific, but I think I may stick with my full-size pistols. The PO claimed to have shot it very little, and judging by the lack of a wear on the barrel I would say it hasn't been shot much.

The pics should give a good indication of the condition, which I would consider very good, if not LNIB. While the paperwork is there, the medium & large backstraps were not with the pistol when I received it (they only run $9/ea from CZ, though.)"

It has about 300 flawless rounds through it. 

It comes with one extra magazine ($50 value). 2 of the mags have a pinky rest and one is the flush-fitting. All three are 10-round mags. 

Installed is a Apex polymer trigger shoe. Note: This is not a trigger upgrade, but only the trigger shoe itself, as I did not like the factory, hinged trigger shoe. Although replacing the trigger shoe did reduce the trigger pull by about a pound or so. I would estimate it breaks at about 5.5 lbs or so. Still safe for carry and feels much better the mushy, hinged factory unit. This Apex trigger was also $50 after shipping.  The original is also included if you ever want to swap back to the factory unit, although I don't know why you would. 

Included is the original S&W hard case with additional back straps (small, medium and large). 

Also included is a box (of 20) Hornady Critical Defense 165gr FTX hollow point ammunition. These run flawless in this gun. I have shot about 40 rounds through the gun with no hickups. This pistol recoils surprisingly mild for a .40 compact.

Also included is a Galco leather IWB holster. I have been carrying this pistol in this holster for about 18 months. Works great and very comfortable. 

As you can see from the pics, the gun is flawless. No scratches, gouges or holster wear whatsoever (I rarely remove from holster to keep it nice). 

The barrel has a brushed, satin stainless finish that I did myself. I do this to most of my pistols. You can see in the picture. Gives it a little flash, like a 1911, but nothing stupid. Rust is not an issue. These are stainless barrels. 

Gun = $500 or so new (realistic price after taxes and background check fee)
Extra mag = $50
Apex trigger shoe = $50
Galco IWB holster = $35

Total investment = $635

Asking $550

This thing is ready to go. Buy today and start carrying it today! 

Low ball or stupid offers will be ignored. 

Willing to drop off if within 30 minutes of me, otherwise we can work something out.

This is the one that was *just announced* and released at SHOT Show in January 2015! I'm one of the first in Alabama to own one, and it's a GREAT gun.

This unit is the fully-accessorized model with factory Tritium Night Sights and three factory mags -- a 14-round extended mag (my favorite) and two (2) shorter 10-round mags, one with and one without pinky extension.

I put 30 rounds through this gun for the first time yesterday -- 20 Brass FMJ and 10 White-Box BHP -- without a single issue. The other one is my new CCW over my Glock 27. 

I prefer FTF meeting in the Gadsden area but can meet a little north (toward HSV) or south
(toward BHM) and cash. Not interested in trades at the moment.

A Bill-of-Sale is optional upon buyer request. I'd prefer to see either (a) your current CCW or (b) LEO credentials, but an AL driver's license at the very least and a good sense that it'll be going to an ""eligible"" buyer. No funky business, no bad vibes.

These are ACTUAL PHOTOS of the one I'm selling (taken just a few minutes ago)! The shiny area on the slide is from the factory lubricant.

One has the Seekins logo on magwell, the other doesn't. $250 each

Precision CNC machined from solid billet 7075-T6 aluminum, the SP223 Billet Lower is the first step to building the best AR possible. Mil-Spec is just a starting point for Seekins Precision. Specifically designed for serious tactical shooters, the SP 223 has features not found on standard AR lower receivers that significantly improve handling and performance. The Seekins Precision Enhanced Bolt Catch comes standard on the SP223. Shooters can easily drop the bolt from either side with our ambi-bolt release feature. Custom screw in dowel pins are used to secure these components, eliminating the use of roll pins, hammers, and pin punches for installation.
An oversized winter trigger guard allows the use of gloves while maintaining precise trigger control, and the trigger reset adjustment screw allows fire control tuning for optimum performance.The quick access mag release and beveled mag well assist with rapid, positive magazine changes and works with most all magazines including Magpul P-Mags and Surefire high capacity magazines.
To assist with exact, no hassle assembly, the rear take down detent has also been relocated under the grip. All of the features and superior design combine to make the SP 223 lower receiver a significant upgrade over common mil-spec lowers.

Bought this scope mid last year from Optics Planet directly from one of the sales persons.  Mounted on a Sig 308 716 3 Gun Heavy.  Did a lot of research and counter talk before purchasing and it is truly all the scope you could want at a very reasonable price.  At the range I had the opportunity to compare it to a $2700.00 (per the owner) Swarovski scope and yes the light was ever so slightly better but not @ $1700.00 better.  I got started distance shooting later in life and found that the MOA recital was hard on my old eyes after a couple hours and the new -H offered some relief.  This scope comes with a continued Sightron life time warranty.  The scope has been twice to the range and kept mounted and in a safe.  It is offered in as new condition $925.00 (including shipping) currently at Optics Planet $969.99

This is an awesome rifle that redefines modularity and combines the best aspects of the AR and AK platforms. Mine was purchased and upgraded less than 2 months ago and has only had precisely 5 shots fired from it (just sighting it in), so it is in absolutely perfect condition! I’m only selling it because my wife and I found out we’re pregnant. With twins. Which means that our budget priorities have suddenly and dramatically changed!!

Check out www.sigevolution.com/sig556xi for tons of info on the incredible number of upgrades and mods you can do with this platform. No other weapon lets you change out the caliber from 7.62x39 to 5.56 or 300BLK, or change the stock, magazines and controls with such ease. And the gas-piston system is recognized as being the most reliable operating system among military-style rifles. These guys thought of everything! This gun comes with a Swiss folding stock, cheek riser, ambidextrous controls, 16-inch barrel, upgraded 2-stage trigger, 3-position adjustable piston system, ergonomic grips and much more. 

I also dropped an extra $99 on an AAC Blackout Flash Hider that not only eliminates muzzle flash, but also serves as a the fast-attach base for AAC's high end silencers like the 762-SN!! So whether you shoot suppressed or loud, this rifle is ready for you! It’s a joy to shoot and will absolutely complete any true gunman’s collection.

List price on the 7.62x39 Sig 556xi SWAT is $1800.00, I bought mine 2 months ago for $1699.00 and spent another $99 on the flash hider. I’ve seen this rifle/caliber listed for as low as $1649.00. Because mine has 5 rounds through it I’m offering it for $1400, OBO. Cash only (of course), and I’d prefer not to ship it but if you have a dealer you work with and are willing to pay the shipping fees, we might be able to make that work too. I’m based in the Eugene, Oregon area, so any place within a reasonable drive works for me. We can meet halfway if you’re from further out. Any questions, please let me know by responding to this post or by calling Adam at REDACTED. Sorry, but absolutely no trades, thank you."
