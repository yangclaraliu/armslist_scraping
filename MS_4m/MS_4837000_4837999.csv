Not scared to try and shoot it. No indication it wouldn't fire all 5 consistently. Would also make a nice, framed antique in the mancave too.

The Colt is worth $600 alone. I'm selling both at such a great price to pay my phone bill.

More pics available.  Can meet today."

comes with 1 mag and sports case, original paperwork and case not included. will also include a box of target ammo.

I owned it for quite some time, no longer interested in this gun, although it has never jammed and the recoil is like that of an air pistol, I like to get some money and invest in some other fine guns.

I have plenty of pics upon request, there is some holster wear but other than that the gun functions flawlessly. Since I'm adding a box of ammo, I am asking 400, it would be 375 without the ammo but I'm reluctant to sell the ammo separately, 
so $400 is my bottom line.

I'm the second owner, I put 200 rounds through it, the first guy put around 6 thousand, the lifespan of the locking block as stated by berettas website is 30 thousand rounds, and you can replace that afterwards, all the other parts are virtually indestructible.

 The pistol itself is in good condition, not brand new, has some scratches and holster wear. Previous owner said it runs 100% reliable and he cleans and lubes it with only using ballistol. Still has plenty of life left.
NOTE : I will not ship the gun. You must be willing to drive to a gun store in the delaware county or Montgomery County area, ( areas ranging from Pottstown to Philly ) 
You will pay the transfer fee 

$400 obo

I have a Waffen Werks AK74 that was checked by DDI, who bought WW. There are other rifles I want instead of two ak74s. Unfortunately, DDI did not cut the middle grove in the scope rail as I had asked so a simple cut will need to be made if you want to mount optics. The rifle has the ""B grade"" furniture but the finish on the metal is beautiful. Great AK74 to use with irons with a nice, clean metal finish to protect from the elements complimented by surplus wood to give it that rough look. This one will come with the orange tapco mag that I originally received with it. I only ever fired wolf, never corrosive ammo."

I am way too impulsive sometimes. I was originally looking to get the larger SP01 Tactical model. While I like the P01 for what it is, it is not what I really need so I am looking to trade. I would like to trade for an SP01 Tactical straight across (depending on what's included with the SP01, of coarse) or a CZ P09 with extras or a little cash from you. Not really looking for anything else. The P01 will include 4 mags, 3 CZ with rubber base pads and one flush Mec-Gar & original case and paperwork. I installed some Cajun Gun Works goodies too. It has their trigger return spring, 13# hammer spring, reduced power block & firing pin springs, floating trigger pin, firing pin retaining pin, and I will include a reduced power recoil spring. All original springs included if you want to bring it back to stock. This is a 2011 model P01 but is in great shape and looks to have been shot very little. Trade value with the extra 2 mags & CGW goodies would be around $575. I will sell for $550 cash. I will post more pics later. The pic below was taken before I installed the new trigger pin."

Selling Face to Face ONLY to holders of a current Florida Concealed Carry Permit willing to sign a Bill of Sale (Ammo in pic not included).  Will only Trade for a similar condition Browning Hi-Power or CZ-75B. 

The Browning BDM is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by the Browning Arms Company up until production ceased in 1998. Similar in appearance to Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 model ""Hi-Power"" pistol, the BDM was actually a new design created to compete in service trials as a standard issue pistol for the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

The Browning BDM was developed in 1991 by the Browning Arms Company, and unlike Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 Hi-Power model, was manufactured only in North America. The pistol is a magazine fed, self-loading, hammer firing type which was designed with a trigger ""mode"" switch installed on the left-hand side of the slide (actually only a flush inlaid disk with a bisecting groove), toggling between double-action/single-action(DA/SA) pistol mode, and the double-action-only (DAO) or ""revolver"" mode—though, of course, other than the similarity of the trigger mode, the BDM has no resemblance to revolvers. This mode switch is what gives the handgun its name, with BDM standing for ""Browning Dual Mode"" or ""Browning Double Mode"".

The BDM has an ambidextrous slide-mounted safety/decocker lever, which when operated always returns the pistol to the hammer down double-action setting. After the next fired cartridge cycles the pistol's slide, subsequent rounds are fired in the single-action mode, until the decocker is used to drop the hammer to the ""safe"" position."

First, I used ""slickguns"" to search the gun, its like a search engine that checks lots of places for the cheapest prices. After you find the cheapest place, you click on it, buy the firearm(though it helps to find your FFL dealer youd like to have it shipped to first because it will need their address, fax number, etc.) Most FFL places will charge $20 or so. Also, they are doing a contest too so if you register, please use my link! There still are good deals on guns out there and this will help you from paying outrageous prices, while it still does help the local dealers because they are getting FFL transfer fees.

963,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4837963,For Sale:  BERETTA M9A3 FULL SIZE 9MM PISTOL,"Englewood, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,099","Listed On: Friday, March 25, 2016",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"With the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design convertible from safety-decocker to decocker-only, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition. The Vertec-style vertical grip of the M93A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent. One of the most salient benefits of the M9A3 is its universal slide, which is easily convertible from FS to G mode. This means that the M9A3s safety lever can be used in a safety-decocker mode or it can be converted to perform a decocker-only function for those who prefer this configuration. More versatility is also offered in the form of a removable front sight, for tactical shooters who have a distinct preference in terms of sight picture, material or construction. In addition, a variety of accessorization options is possible thanks to the built-in 3-slot Picatinny rail located in front of the trigger guard, which enables the easy attachment of a variety of tactical lights, laser devices and more. The M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds (10-round standard), and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over. Action Single/Double Barrel length (mm) 125 Barrel length (in) 4.9 Caliber 9x19 (PARA) Grip Width 1.3"" Magazine 10 Overall height (mm) 137 Overall height (in) 5.4 Overall length (mm) 216 Overall length (in) 8.5 Overall width (mm) 38 Overall width (in) 1.5 Sight radius (in) 6.1 Sight radius (mm) 155 Weight unloaded (g) 961 Weight unloaded (OZ) 33.9"
