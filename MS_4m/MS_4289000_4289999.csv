This holster is really sweet for appendix carry, which it is designed for. The kydex has a soft fuzzy coating on the outside which makes for more comfortable carry against the skin. Also has very solid, positive retention, which is adjustable. 

This holster has been slightly modified. I cut off the second belt clip (along the sight side of the holster), which digs into one's thigh when carried at 1 o'clock position. This clip removed makes the holster similar to what G-Code is now selling as the ""Eclipse"".

Features include the Max-4 camouflage finish, Comfortech recoil system in the stock, Crio 28 inch barrel, drilled and tapped receiver,  includes 5 Crio choke tubes, Red fiber optic front sight bead, mid sight bead, Semi automatic action, Manual safety, 3.5 inch chamber, and the inertia bolt system. The Super Black Eagle II is one of the most popular shotguns on the market with duck hunters! The 3.5 inch chamber allows shooters to shoot 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 inch shells reliably. Meanwhile, the comfortech recoil system stock reduces recoil by nearly 50% making this a pleasant shotgun to shoot magnum loads from. Condition on this gun is Like New with the factory case, owners manuals, chokes tubes, and choke tube wrench. Check out our pictures to see just how clean the gun really is! There are no scratches or dings in the camo finish as well! The magazine cap is also without a mark, which tells me that this shotgun was hardly ever assembled, meaning it was used very minimally. The barrel and action also show very little dirt or use. Message or call our store with any questions. Thank you for shopping with The Sportsman's Shop!"

This listing is for ONE magazine, but winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here is Mec-Gar's blue steel 7 shot magazine for the Beretta model 21 Double Action Pistols chambered in .22 Long Rifle affectionately known as the Bobcat. We began stocking Mec Gar Magazines 20 years ago, not because some flashy sales rep came by, but because our knowledgeable local customers had tried them and endorsed them. Serious Combat and Target Handgunners of all types, from recreational target shooters to veteran police officers and Armed Services personnel, know and respect Mec-Gar's magazines. After all, they are the primary suppliers for Browning and Sig, and a major supplier for Smith & Wesson and Walther. Mec Gar magazines, writes the factory, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is specially treated to ensure high corrosion resistance. Them work like they're supposed to: they insert smoothly, free-fall eject, and lock the slides open on big autos. We cannot say that about any other aftermarket magazines. They WILL NOT work on any other Beretta or Taurus Pistol besides the M-21 rimfire. On small rimfire pistols like these, it is even more crucial to have a reliable magazine. As our old teacher Joe Lowe used to say, without a magazine, it's just a single shot. And in our experience, without an original factory magazine or a Mec-Gar, there's a good chance it will be a single shot even with a magazine. Don't take that chance. Own One of them for only $ 24.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.Shipping.  Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Serious Combat and Target Handgunners of all types, from recreational target shooters to veteran police officers and Armed Services personnel, know and respect Mec-Gar's magazines. After all, they are the primary suppliers for Browning and Sig, and a major supplier for Smith & Wesson and Walther. Mec Gar magazines, writes the factory, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is specially treated to ensure high corrosion resistance. These fine magazines work like they're supposed to: they insert smoothly, free-fall eject, and lock the slides open on big autos. We cannot say that about any other aftermarket magazines. Here is Mec-Gar's blue steel 9 shot magazine for the Beretta model 21 Double Action pistols chambered in .25 ACP. They WILL NOT work on the model 950 or Jetfire Single Action. On small pistols like these, it is even more crucial to have a reliable magazine. As our old teacher Joe Lowe used to say, without a magazine, it's just a single shot. And in our experience, without an original factory magazine or a Mec-Gar, there's a good chance it will be a single shot even with a magazine. Don't take that chance.

This listing is for ONE magazine, but winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. We began stocking Mec Gar Magazines 20 years ago, not because some flashy sales rep came by, but because our knowledgeable local customers had tried them and endorsed them. Serious Combat and Target Handgunners of all types, from recreational target shooters to veteran police officers and Armed Services personnel, know and respect Mec-Gar's magazines. After all, they are the primary suppliers for Browning and Sig, and a major supplier for Smith & Wesson and Walther. Mec Gar magazines, writes the factory, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is specially treated to ensure high corrosion resistance. Them work like they're supposed to: they insert smoothly, free-fall eject, and lock the slides open on big autos. We cannot say that about any other aftermarket magazines. Here is Mec-Gar's blue steel 8 shot magazine for the Beretta 950 or Jetfire pistols chambered in .25 ACP. They WILL NOT work on the model 21 Double Action. On small pistols like these, it is even more crucial to have a reliable magazine. As our old teacher Joe Lowe used to say, without a magazine, it's just a single shot. And in our experience, without an original factory magazine or a Mec-Gar, there's a good chance it will be a single shot even with a magazine. Don't take that chance. Own One of them for only $ 25.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

This gun has fired less than a box of target ammo at this point. Bought on an impulse buy because I always wanted a 1911. After less than a box of ammo I discovered that a 1911 is not my cup of tea. It does not fit my hand as well when firing as I thought it would just holding the gun. Wish to get a FAIR price from the gun. I do not expect to get all my cash back but I will not take 75% of its value either. It's brand new without a blemish anywhere to be found and clean as a whistle. If you want a good deal on this kind of gun then this is your winner."

Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation.

This gun has fired less than a box of target ammo at this point. Bought on an impulse buy because I always wanted a 1911. After less than a box of ammo I discovered that a 1911 is not my cup of tea. It does not fit my hand as well when firing as I thought it would just holding the gun. Wish to get a FAIR price from the gun. I do not expect to get all my cash back but I will not take 75% of its value either. It's brand new without a blemish anywhere to be found and clean as a whistle. If you want a good deal on this kind of gun then this is your winner."

Also have approx. $1K in reloading components and factory ammo.  Would like to trade all for a shotgun which I WOULD shoot. Here is the old sales listing:

http://www.gunsamerica.com/918035884/CZ-550-Custom-375-H-H-Magnum.htm

""A very nice CZ 550 with custom work by AHR. The stock CZ set trigger has been replaced with AHR's great single stage trigger. The barrel cut to 22 1/2"" and recrowned with a banded front sight and ivory bead with a standing leaf rear sight. A properly bedded McMillan stock rounds out this great rifle. The rifle is in exceptional condition with a superb bore! 
McMillan Stock Cheekpiece 22 1/2"" Barrel Banded Front Sight w/Ivory Bead Standing Leaf Shallow ""V"" Rear Sight AHR Single Stage Trigger Straightened & Filled Bolt Handle""

Not a rifle similar to that one, but that very rifle.  I purchased it without the scope and rings for $1700 about three years ago, and thought I got a great deal.  Check out the AHR website to get an idea of the quality of their work!  I previously had 4 .375 H&H rifles: a Remington 700, Wichester M70 (one of the new FN-built ones from South Carolina), and two Ruger No.1's.  This rifle is head and shoulders above any of those.  A true, proper ""dangerous game rifle"", not a wannabe pretender.
I would like to trade for a 20 or 28 gauge Citori, but would consider almost any nice over/under suitable for skeet or sporting clays (already have a trap gun).  Would also consider a Remington 1100 or Beretta gas auto with cash added, or an interesting handgun (S&W 52, East German Mak) with cash added.  Or will sell outright. 
The reloading stuff includes LOTS of jacketed and cast bullets, lots of new and fired brass, 3 sets of dies, several thousand LR and LRM primers, jacketed bullet powder (4064,4895,4350), cast bullet powder (5744, 4759, RL7), and more.  Have about 5-6 boxes of premium factory ammo.
Again, pictured scope is not included.  Great rifle for Alaska or PNW.  Only rifle I've ever owned with a fiberglass stock; heavy and solid - nothing like the typical injection molded plastic stocks you see on most new rifles."

Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. In our experience, factory magazines work best, especially for Colt pistols. Like the pistols themselves, the factory mags are smooth and slick; they work like they're supposed to. For Colt Pistols, the factory magazines enhance their value for resale and collectability. That holds true for any other brand or clone of the venerable 1911 pistols; and this magazine works in any 1911 Government Pistol, including Colt Clones Armscor, Detonics, Kimber, Smith & Wesson, and Taurus. Manufacturer is most likely Check-Mate Industries of New York, principal factory magazine supplier for Colt Pistols and arch-competitor Smith & Wesson for many years. Construction is entirely stainless steel, from the top of the stainless cartridge follower to the bottom of the Rampant Colt factory logo floorplate. Each Magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP / 45 Automatic Ammunition. Our onesy twosy single mag price is $39 each, and we usually have a separate ad on single mags. We're offering them, the real thing, in lots of 3 or more, however, for only $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

Here are representatives of the Mec Gar 16 round blue steel magazine for the tried and true CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols that were manufactured after 1991, and chambered in 9mm caliber. They will also fit the EAA Italian Made Clones and their ancestors the TA-90 Excams. Also, they will fit the Israeli Baby Eagles marketed by Magnum Research. They will fit Bernardelli P01 and P18 Pistols, with some protrusion. They may not fit a Pre-B CZ75 manufactured before 1990. Manufacturer is Mec-Gar s.r.l. of Brescia, Italy. Importer is Mec-Gar USA of Meriden, CT. Mec Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is as slickly blued as a Colt Python, as the photos show. Each magazine holds 16 rounds of 9mm Ammunition – 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Our single mag price is $29 per. We’re offering these, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where 16 round or higher capacity magazines are restricted to law enforcement only.

For a person, law enforcement or civilian alike, to entrust his or her life to an extra magazine puts a strong responsibility on us. For as long as we have been in business, the best magazines are factory magazines for semi-auto firearms. We only trust One name in aftermarket magazines: Mec-Gar. They free-fall like they're supposed to; they lock the breech open on the last shot like they're supposed to; we've never had One stick a spring or follower. They are, in short, vastly less likely to mis-perform than any other aftermarket magazines. Mec Gar manufactures the factory magazines for many brands, including Browning, Beretta, Rock Island, and Kel-Tec. That is the reason, for example, that the cheap little Kel-Tecs are so reliable. Here are representatives of the Mec Gar 17 round anti-friction Teflon blued steel magazine for the tried and true CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols made in Czechoslovakia. They will also fit, we are quite sure, the EAA Italian Made Clones and their ancestors the TA-90 Excams. Also, they will fit the Israeli Baby Eagles marketed by Magnum Research. Mec Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate.

Really nice little .380 ACP. The Argentine knock off of a Walther PPK. This is a DA/SA pistol that I bought new and still have the original box and everything that came with it, including the factory mag with finger extension. The Thunder 380 has a light aluminum alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil. The blowback, fixed-barrel design aids accuracy, and the nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine results in reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are also several safety features built into the Bersa Thunder 380: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and an integral key-operated trigger lock. I also have 3 extra pro-mag extended magazines. These run ~$300 with only 1 mag. The extra mags run $20+ each, so I figure the value is ~$360-375. Looking for $350 for everything.

	Hey all, 
I have an old but great revolver for sale. It is a Ruger Security Six 357 magnum. It is the 4 inch model with adjustable sights. This one was one of the first run produced in 1972 and is a  low 4 digit serial number. It has normal blue wear from holster and a drop mark/ding on the rear sight. Its not too big of a deal and could be replaced pretty easily and cheaply if you wanted. I just had this at the range a day or so ago and it shot fantastic with no issues. I would keep this, but i have a security Six in 6 inch already, so it would just be a duplicate! haha.
	This is in good shape overall and the gun shoots great. As far as trades are concerned, I have a few. I would consider trades for a PMR30, a marlin 357/38 lever action, a 44 magnum revolver, “maybe” a SP101, etc. Honestly, just shoot me an offer. worst I can say is no! (Please no 22s, black powder, or shotguns). Rifle wise, aside from the lever 357/38, I am mainly looking for semi-auto, but would consider others if the deal is good. Best bet is to message me on here or shoot me a text at 4058212160. I can add ammo or cash on my end for certain trades, but prefer to trade even or trade with ammo/cash on your end if possible. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Gamo Whisper Silent Cat .177 Break-Action Rifle. This is one of the nicest Air Rifles for Pest Control/Small Game Hunting you can buy. It has a built on silencer that reduces 52% of noise (Legal on an Air Rifle), a Fluted barrel, Fiber Optic Iron Sights (green in rear/red in front), skelatanized stock, and recoil pad. It came with a cheap scope but I was at Academy one day and found a Display no-name scope I got them to sell me that is a 3x9x40 with BDC and finger turrets for $50 (they wanted $120) that is sighted in perfectly with the Benjamin pellets and is crystal clear. It has a scope riser to get above the iron sights as well I bought online. I also have several containers of high quality hunting ammo. I bought this for quiet pest control in my shop... it did well. This is in no way a BB gun toy, It is made for small game hunting and is more like a silent .22lr. It shoots 1200 fps with standard ammo and I believe 1400 fps with PBA pellets. I shoot regular because PBA goes supersonic (breaks the sound barrier) and makes the cracking sound the silencer cant help. It will come with some PBA ammo, but I use regular for the quietness and it is still very effective.

2. Streamlight TLR-1s with strobe/on/off. Less than 5 min of run time. I have just installed a new battery anyway when I took it off of a 1911 and installed on AR. It is like new and shows zero sign of performance or cosmetic ware. Perfect condition.

Hello;

I have a Marlin 39A for sale. I dated it to 1956. .22 LR

This gun is in excellent shape considering the age. There is some slight spots here and there on the barrel, but nothing that looks major. The action is nice and tight, and the chamber contains nice deep bluing like it was not shot alot. Bluing is nice and dark. Hooded front sight.  Left side of barrel looks to have a scope mounted one time, but very small screw holes have been filled with proper fitting screws and not that noticeable.

The wood is in excellent shape with a couple of tiny dings in the stock. No cracks. It has a satin finish to it.

Can send more pictures to SERIOUS buyers.

Also has the original sheepskin case that came with gun when I got it used many years ago. Nice and heavy duty suede leather outside with brown wool inside lining.

These older 39A's are getting harder to find as most people keep them when they find them. And this is of course a JM marked model. It is also a take-down. I've had this one for quite a few years myself.

FTF. I live just west of Grand Rapids, Michigan or will ship CONUS except California.

NO TRADES and PLEASE do not ask.

Just the pistol and three (3) 15-round mags. 

Looks and shoots like every other 40 S&W GLOCK you've ever seen. 

GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this 15-round .40 caliber pistol.

One notable feature of the Glock 22, is the ability to change the caliber to .357 Sig with a simple barrel swap. This is possible due to the similar operating pressures of both rounds, and the fact that the .357 Sig is based on a .40 S&W case, necked down to accept .355 inch bullets. The Glock 22 can also be fitted with a converted .40 S&W to 9mm barrel and can operate as such using a Glock 9mm magazine. A .40 S&W to .22 LR conversion kit is also available for the Glock 22. (though NONE of these conversions kits are included with THIS pistol)

I'll take $475 for the pistol with all three (3) mags."

This gun is for all intents and purposes a bolt action rifle shooting a slug delivering 1975 ft lbs of energy at the muzzle. For an Ohio slug gun, this is as good as it gets, a great tackdriver, and has about 20-25 rounds through it max. It's taken a deer every time I've pulled the accu-trigger in the field.

Using the included Remington Accutip Sabot Slugs, I literally shoot 3 round groups touching at 50 yards, 1.5"" groups at 100 yards and 3-4"" group at 200 yards using the BDC reticle zeroed at 50 yards, can't be beat for an Ohio Deer gun.

This Gen 3 subcompact size pistol is a proven sidearm and a great option for either a back-up or concealed carry. 

Comes with original clam shell box, Galco Matrix 3x Kydex holster, a couple of regular (10-round) mags, and one extended (12-round) mag (plus the flat floor plate to convert it to a regular 10-round mag) [and everything else you see in the picture].  

GLOCK introduced the G26 in 1995 as a 9×19mm ""subcompact"" variant designed for concealed carry.  It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a ""shortened"" Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring.

I'll take $525 for this 9mm ""subcompact"" GLOCK in the box with all of the extras."

Most Smith & Wesson Revolvers manufactured after 1996 have Round Butt Grip Frames. If you aren’t sure which yours is, please see the comparative photo. Photos show representatives of only a couple dozen Italian Walnut grips we found in an old Southern Warehouse for any Smith & Wesson J frame revolver with a round butt grip frame. These include models 34 and 36, and their stainless counterparts models 63 and 60. These are excellent grips, and we sold lots of them during the 1960s until 1980s. These were imported by distinguished New York Importer Sile, Inc., and all of them are new, just occasionally with some slight signs of shelfwear from their years in the warehouse. What these do, shooting wise, is to increase the size of the grip on a J-Round and give the shooter better control, especially in Combat situations under stress for concealable revolvers. These grips’s heyday in the 1970s and 1980s saw them compete favorably with the much pricier factory Smith & Wesson grips that were hard to get at the time for any price. Photos show a vintage Michigan Police Supply special order Airweight Bodyguard with a set of these installed. Apart from that, they look good. These are all genuine cut-checkered Italian Walnut with stainless screws and screw escutcheons.
