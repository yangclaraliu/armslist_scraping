Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Century's semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Will not operate with AK 47 mags. Comes with Three 30 rd. mags, Sling and Cleaning Kit.

Collector’s Treasure!!!

When you hold and inspect this incredible AK you will marvel at its quality, unlike any AK you have ever seen before.

During 1988-1989, Poly Technologies from China made the Rolls Royce of AK-47s, the AKS-762. These carbines were hand-crafted to Chinese military specifications and easily had the best quality of any AK-47 made before or since. Receivers were milled out of blocks of high ordnance steel using modern CNC machinery which guaranteed ultra-precise tolerances on all the components. All parts were then carefully polished before the high luster bluing was applied. The wooden furniture was nicely finished blonde hard wood, and metal and bakelite side-folding and under-folding stocks were also available. When these came out they cost twice as much as any other AK one could buy at the time.


Super Rare, bakelite stock - AKs RED SIDE FOLDER, semi-auto AK type rifle, caliber 7.62 x 39mm.) an original pre-ban AKs (AK-47) rifle. Super RARE, thumb button release, side folding metal stock assembly. This rifle features the scarce and very desirable red fiberglass furniture and a  Chrome bore. This style of AKs was one of the last versions imported by Poly Tech prior to the 1994 assault rifle ban. It is estimated that less than 400 total of this model were ever imported into the US prior to the ban, which disallowed several features, one of them being the folding stock. These AKS762 rifles were all manufactured by the Poly Tech which was the commercial side of the Chinese State Arms factory which produced the very best AK rifles. Made with threaded muzzle, and with the bayonet lug like the milled ""Legend"" versions. A rare chance to get a premium, highly collectible, pre-ban AK-47.

The gun is in like new condition. Maybe 50 rounds fired since new. Bakelite is perfect, no cracks, small scratch in the bluing from the sling metal rubbing. No problems, no issues. No rust. All parts with matching numbers. This gun has been kept in a climate controlled gun safe since new."

Multifunctional Thermal Imaging Monocular Q14 ..

Armasight is proud to introduce the Q14 Long-wave Infrared Multifunctional Thermal Imaging Monocular (LIMTIM) representing the latest evolution in our never-ceasing quest to reduce size, weight, and power (SWaP) while maximizing the number of available features and functions. The LIMTIM’s remarkably compact size ensures that it can be concealed in a shirt pocket and its featherweight mass at 240g with battery gives claim to it being the lightest fully multi-functional thermal imager currently on the market. The LIMTIM has a wide range of features incorporated into the unit that put it at the forefront of all other miniature thermal imagers in its class. It can be equipped with either a visible or near-IR laser pointer intended for handing off targets of interest to non-thermal equipped assets in the field. It has two integral rail mounts so that it is not necessary to disengage the head/helmet mount interface in order to mount the unit on a weapon as a stand-alone short-range weapon sight. The mini-rail design allows for mounting on a wide variety of in-service head mounts, helmet mounts, reflex cameras, digital video recorders, and MIL-STD-1913 weapon rail systems using the optional quick-release interfaces. The mini-rails are non-invasive enough where handheld operation is comfortable and ergonomically optimized to the operator’s hands - NOMEX gloved or not. Equipped with digital compass and inclinometer, the Q14 LIMTIM offers the operator the tools necessary to interpolate accurate distance to target and target orientation. Additional Armasight proprietary hyper-image processing (HIP) code provides the LIMTIM with a robust library of software features to tailor the image to the optimum standards required of the operator. These features include direct button functions such as display brightness, palette selection, electronic zoom, manual non-uniformity correction (NUC) using a simple, intuitive three button keypad. Menu driven features incorporate desirable operator-specific adjustments such as palette selection, reticule selection and color, weapon boresight, scene-related imaging corrections, stored rifle caliber profiles, format selection, compass calibration sequence, and a “factory settings” default option. The wireless remote capability and Bluetooth features prevents the Q14 LIMTIM from becoming obsolete as new applications and software reaches maturity and comes to market. The nine-pin connector on the Q14 reveals the dynamic nature of this mite-sized powerhouse. Through the multi-pin connector, the operator can record video using the Armasight Digital Video Recorder (DVR), augment the battery life by attaching to external battery options, inject target range data from an externally mounted Armasight laser rangefinder and update/upload new software revision and applications from personal accounts associated with the Armasight customer access web sites. The Q14 LIMTIM is designed from inception to be waterproof to 20 meter and meet all the established environmental requirements of MIL-STD-810(G). Operating off a variety of 123A format commercial expendable and rechargeable batteries, the Q14 LIMTIM offers a respectable 1+ hours run time for the 640x512 focal plane array format. With a diopter range of -5 to +5 diopters and a focus range of 20cm to infinity, the LIMTIM demonstrates its operational flexibility for all mission applications.

Comes with all factory goodies. Try finding one for what Im asking, you wont. I paid $699 for it about a year ago, shot it 2 times, now selling for $500 firm. I will include 100 rounds of ammo too. Only reason Im selling this rare Glock is we just had a baby and need the cash, however we are not desparate to sell. This gun keeps its value. Again, this is a GEORGIA MADE Glock 17C, it has the GA proofs on her instead of Austria. No disappointments here. All slide, barrel and magazine engraving is color-filled in white. NICE :)

I would not be afraid to shoot, but have not.  Serial no. is ATF supplied.  Original serial had been removed and replaced by a gunsmith with the ATF supplied number, or done by the ATF.  Even Bonnie Parker's Colt .38 Detective Special now has an ATF serial no. so it could be sold at auction for $262,000.00.  Only minor handling marks from before or after the refinish.

Gun dates by serial number to 1978, and is in very good condition. Stock is very good, with few dents/mars/scratches. There is wear on receiver, but it IS a 37 year old gun, after all. Chambers 2/75"" only, 28"" bbl, choke is modified and is fixed - can NOT change it. Seller is a certified Remington armorer, and I take care of my guns. I got this in a trade a few years ago, and have taken it both squirrel and dove hunting a few times. It's much too pretty of a gun to do this with, and is better suited to a trap or clay pigeon shooter. Gun is very well balanced and very enjoyable to shoot. I'm selling, because..well, I have no real need for ""pretty"" guns. I am in the field a lot, and prefer synthetic stocks that won't crack or chip, and can take abuse. This gun - it's not meant for that.

Manufacturer: IWI USA, Inc.

Model: TAVOR SAR-B16

Caliber: 5.56X45mm NATO or .223 Rem.

Capacity: (1) 30 Round Magazine

Barrel: 16.5"" Mil-Spec, chrome lined, cold-hammer forged CrMoV barrel, 6 groove 1:7 RH twist

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles

Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR® SAR parts

Uses standard AR-15/M16 magazines

Last round hold open on empty magazine

All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance

Integral rubber recoil pad

Assembled in the US from Israeli and US manufactured parts

Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use

	Hey all,
I have available for trade/sale a used but great condition Bi-Tone Springfield XD-45. I just picked this up on trade It is in great condition with on a ding on the front sight and some blueing wear on that barrel. This also comes with a never worn Uncle Mikes paddle/belt holster and two magazines. I also have defense/target ammo i could include for extra. This gun is still nice and tight and would be a great piece for anyone wanting a reliable and quality piece. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this due to my schedule. 
	Mainly looking for cash, but would consider trades if they happen to peak my interest. I can add ammo or cash for certain trades, but some trades will need boot on your end. I am somewhat open to trades, but no 22, BP, or non-gun items (unless it is for a large LED TV heavily in my favor, that i would consider. Im a guy, sue me. haha.) would like another M9, 92fs, or ATI clone if possible. Would also consider a pair of Tokarev pistols and boot. Would consider a GP100 4 inch stainless (or blued if it really clicks with me). A Ruger Security Six 4 inch. A Kel Tec PMR30. Possibly a Glock 20sf or ""maybe"" a 20c or regular. Honestly, shoot me a message, worst I can say is no. 

If you have any questions or anything shoot me a message at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
1303 fps  -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel
You’ll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

Other features include a tactical sling attachment slot, drop-tube adapter and five swivel studs. Mounting hardware included. Made in USA."

Yankee Hill Stainless Steel Gas tube Rifle Length from Troy Industries. Black Dawn Flat Top Quality Forged Upper receiver (marked) with monogram for .300 Blackout. All ""T"" marks for easy removal and replacement for optics, etc. This kit is simular to the Colt CRB-16RR but with major improvements and or upgrades.

Comparison with Colt's CRB-16RR- UPGRADES HIGHLIGHTED:
Upgrade- HBAR Barrel, compared with standard .300 AAC barrel
Upgrade- UTG-PRO instead of the Knights Arm handguards, more mounting surfaces for attachments, UTG made in the USA
Upgrade- Troy Industries Gas Block no more need for adjustments or getting knocked out of adjustment for supersonic loads ONLY, since this is a 16"" barrel there is no need to shoot subsonic loads, takes full use of the supersonic round and is adjusted for this. Also makes a lower report (quieter) 

This kit is designed to use the T Handle and BCG from your 5.56 or .223 (but it is advised you make sure its an auto-grade bolt) and make sure you have a standard GI buffer spring and a carbine buffer in your lower assembly. 

I decided to include 200 rounds of supersonic ammo and two C-Products Stainless Steel 30 round mags (black nitrided)

$750 Dollars Firm with all of the above

Remember this brand new never fired (on my part) except from the factory when assembled. When I got it it came with a target and 5 shots made (to test) grouping under .86 inches at 250yds. 4 of them were within a 1/2 inch group. This is a ""FULL-POWER"" RIFLE KIT with a low report (no need for supressors) You can take advantage of all supersonic loads as well as the subsonic (but really why?) This is a Semi-Automic Sniper Rifle (kit) that will shoot a round capable of dropping most North American Wild Game (or?) at 250 yards. Just add your favorite Optics and your good to go!"

Just as tough inside, the SuperNova sports dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, giving you a gun that is rock solid to the core.

The excellent ergonomics and slim profile of the PT-809 set it apart from all other polymer pistols. The PT-809 has all the features you expect to find on what is the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful 'Taurus OSS' pistol designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an External Hammer and Decocker that has been requested by so many users. The Taurus PT-809 is ready with 'Strike Two' capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the PT-809 gives you instant 'Strike Two' capability by resetting the trigger for automatic Double Action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the PT-809 is again a Single Action pistol. The PT-809 is one of very few polymer pistols available with an external Hammer, Decocker and Safety. If it falls on a dead primer, rack the Slide and you're loaded and ready again.

All Taurus firearms feature a LIFETIME WARRANTY. It doesn't matter if you buy it NEW or used years later, it will always have a LIFETIME WARRANTY.

The arms company Zastava released the M76 in the mid-1970s. Since then it has become the standard issue sharpshooter rifle in the Serbian army and its predecessor the Yugoslav National Army (JNA). It is designed to fulfill the same role as the Soviet Dragunov SVD, which is to provide a designated marksman capability to the infantry platoon. During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, it was used by several sides; it saw action in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.[2] In Serbian service it is reportedly being replaced by the Zastava M91. The Zastava M91 uses the 7.62x54mmR cartridge which is replacing the 8x57mm IS (M-49) cartridge in Serbian service. Design details[edit] The M76 is similar in concept to the Russian Dragunov SVD sniper rifle; a semi-automatic rifle using a full-power cartridge from a 10-round magazine. However, the M76 is closer to the AK-47/RPK design than the Dragunov, similar to the Romanian PSL. Being derived from the AK design it is simple and reliable, and like other Zastava AK-derivatives it is of high-quality manufacture. Accuracy is typically around 1.5 MOA, which is good for a Kalashnikov design and entirely acceptable for the designated marksman role. Macedonian special policeman holding a Zastava M76 sniper in his hands. ZRAK ON-M76 4x 5°10’ reticle layout. The top center ""chevron"" (^) is used as the main aiming mark. The horizontal hash marks are for windage and lead corrections and can be used as mil marks for ranging as well. In the bottom-left corner is a stadiametric rangefinder that can be used to determine the distance from a 1.75 meters (5 ft 8.9 in) tall person/object from 200 m (2) to 800 m (8). Rather than being a Dragunov clone, it looks more like a lengthened AK-47 with a heavier barrel, an impression strengthened by the separate stock and pistol grip rather than the Dragunov's thumbhole combination stock. Instead of the Dragunov's 7,62x54mmR chambering it uses the 7.92x57mm Mauser a.k.a. the 7.9mm or 8x57mm IS round. The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) adopted a 7.9mm Cartridge, Ball M49 variant, designated as M49, as infantry ammunition at the end of the 1940s and later a 7.9mm Cartridge, Sniper, with Universal ball M75, as sniper ammunition, designated as M75.[3][4] Instead of the Dragunov's separate gas piston, the M76 has an AK-type piston attached to the bolt carrier.[5] The receiver is a milled forging like that of the original AK-47 to give greater rigidity when firing a full-power round and it is longer to suit the 8x57mm IS chambering. The AK-type rotating bolt, bolt carrier, barrel and other parts are also longer and heavier to suit. Feeding is via a 10-round steel box magazine, which has a follower that holds the bolt open after the last shot. Since there is no device in the weapon to hold the bolt to the rear, the bolt will move forward when the magazine is removed, which increases the difficulty of removing the magazine. Fire is semi-automatic only, so the AK-47-type safety on the right side of the receiver has only 2 settings - 'safe' and 'fire'. The barrel has a tapered profile with a Dragunov-type combination slotted flash suppressor and foresight housing. A standard AKM bayonet can be fitted to the bayonet lug below the foresight. Like the Dragunov, but unlike the AK-47, the M76 features an operator-adjustable gas regulator enabling more propellant gas to be vented to the piston in marginal operating conditions and even blocking the gas from pushing back the bolt, making the rifle a manual repeater. The furniture features a straight comb butt, which has a rubber pad similar to that found on the Zastava M70 series of weapons, and a well-shaped contoured pistol grip. The fore-end is also reminiscent of that found on the M70 series. There is no butt trap for cleaning kit storage in the wooden butt. In newer production models the wooden furniture is replaced with synthetic polymer material which offers some storage space for accessories like a cleaning kit and reduces the M76 overall weight by approximately 0.5 kg. With the exception of the gas regulator, disassembly and operation are similar to that of the AK-47/AKM family of weapons. Though the M76 fires its bullets at a relatively modest 730 m/s (2,395 ft/s) muzzle velocity, the 8x57mm IS cartridge loaded with aerodynamically efficient 12.8 grams (197.53 gr) military sS ball bullets still offers a supersonic reach of ˜ 950 m (1,040 yd) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ? = 1.225 kg/m³). To mount the optics, a side-rail is permanently attached to the left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the locking lever open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give easy access to the receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place. ZRAK ON-M76 elevation turret with bullet drop compensation markings and warning for the radioactive illumination The typical scope used is a ZRAK ON-M76 4x 5°10’ scope originally produced in the ZRAK factory in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[6][7] This optical sight is similar to the PSO-1 4x24 sight used on the Russian SVD rifle and the Romanian I.O.R. LPS 4x6° TIP2 4x24 sight used on the PSL rifle. The ON-M76 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge (the 7,9 M75 sniper ammunition) at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical adjustment control of the reticle, the windage or horizontal adjustment control of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc. The reticle illumination of the ZRAK M-76 4x 5°10’ is provided by (radioactive) tritium. The tritium light source has to be replaced every 8–12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay. The reticle features a PSO-1 type range-finding reticle. Performance[edit] The M76 is relatively accurate for a semi-automatic rifle. It can achieve 1.5 to 2 Minute of angle or MOA consistent accuracy with appropriate ammunition. Under normal conditions a maximum effective range of 800 m (875 yd) against man sized targets for an average sniper is achievable. The dispersion at 900 m (984 yd) is described as 50 x 50 cm (19.7 x 19.7 in), which is ˜ 1.9 MOA. Under optimal atmospheric and environmental conditions excellent marksmen might use the M76 up to 1,000 m (1,094 yd). Recoil is described as being modest.[1][8] It has the reputation of a reliable and capable weapon and has seen extensive combat service.[citation needed] There is a known issue, however, with the magazines of the M76 being unreliable. Due to the bolt hold open property of the magazines, the bolt will slam forward when the magazine is removed, putting considerable pressure on the follower. This can result in the follower being jammed in the forward position, rendering the magazine inoperable."

I have a hunting size magazine I purchased with the upper that is included. 
The barrel is the 26 inch barrel offered when these first were made available from Alexander Arms. I opted for the attached muzzle brake as well, as can be seen in the pictures. They listed some sort of industrial adhesive for attaching it. There are 4 set screws around it as well. 
I haven't fired it that much. I purchased it to hunt with, hence the small capacity magazine. I purchased the Alexander Arms lower with it, though I am keeping that the build this sale is funding. You can see the brass marks on the underside of the bolt carrier and the face of the bolt, and the lack of any real marks on the face of the shell deflector to substantiate few rounds fired.
This upper was carried into the woods on a number of hunting trips, so it is not a safe queen, in pristine showroom condition. However it wasn't beat up, dropped, or dragged, either. I had a scope mounted on the flat top, so there may be marks from that.
I'd like $750 or BRO.
