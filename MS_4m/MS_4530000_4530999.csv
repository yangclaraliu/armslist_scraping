According to the date stamp it was produced in 1989. The side of the slide says West Germany inside of just Germany like todays Sigs do. I took thiis gun on a trade so I am not sure how many rounds have been ran through the gun total. I know I personally have ran a box of 50 through it. I have just one magazine for this weapon at the moment. I recently purchase a P220 Parts kit directly from Sig and replaced the internal springs on the gun. I also added a neww set of Hougue grips with some brand new screws and washers that were in the kit from Sig Sauer.

This one also has what is known as a “low shelf” receiver. Most civilian AR-15 models will have a “high shelf” meaning that the metal has not been carved out, like it normally would be on an M-16. A low shelf is desirable because it allows for addition of a “DIAS” or “drop in auto sear”, which allows the gun to operate in full auto mode. Civilians can legally buy DIAS units, but only those that were manufactured prior to 1986, and only those that are registered with the ATF, with the approval of your local sheriff."

The trigger guard, bolt, and internals are all SA. The trigger guard is correct for the date of the rifle. It has NM op rod. The stock is original, untouched, with excellent cartouches, and a great color to it.  
I believe the muzzle reads a 1 and the throat a 3.
The rifle has always been kept clean, properly greased, and well cared for. I have no doubts that if you will be as happy with this rifle as I have been.
I'm thinning out my collection a little to pay bills and maybe another toy if the better half doesn't find out about it. 
This one shoots a little better than my 43' SA, and looks a little nicer, but I have more of a sentimental attachment to that one. 
I will be sad to see it go, but it's time to move on. This is a great for any re-enactors wanting to be as authentic as possible for earlier battles. It will also make a great rifle for as issued shooting competitions. 

The picture might be a little dark to show the good detail and quality of the rifle. If you want a different picture I can try to use a simple photo editor to brighten the color enough to see it better. Dark, aged, walnut tends to be hard to photograph.

The only trades I might consider are antique firearms, but I prefer cash, or at least trade + cash. I've been looking for a Colt 1903 hammerless (.32ACP) for a while. M1 carbines, P-38s, C96, and lugers also interest me, but I would have to do a little more research on the lugers to be sure a fair deal is worked out. You can always offer some kind of trade, and the worst I can say is no.

I communicate by email unless we are planning a meeting in which case sometimes it is easier to contact via texting, or phone call. I'm usually busy during the day, so I may not respond until after 5pm some days. I don't meet at any residence. I only meet in public places. If you want me to ship then I will receive payment first, wait for it to clear the bank, and then you will also cover shipping costs. Only after that will I consider shipping. I prefer local FTF. If someone wants it FTF, they have preference over anyone wanting to ship. I just don't need the extra hassle with as busy as I am.
