Up for trade is my Shocker NXT paintball gun. This a tournament grade paintball marker. It has an installed virtue board for a fully configurable playing experience with multiple modes of firing, and you can cap the rate of fire at whatever you want.

Cosmetically this gun is near perfect, except some scratches visible on the side where my friend's keys dug into the gun years ago. This very obviously doesn't affect the performance in any way whatsoever. 

This gun has only seen approximately 5 cases of paint through its whole life. My friend bought this gun brand new in 2008 and it has ran flawlessly. I have torn the gun all the way down and cleaned and greased it. It's ready to take names at the field. It has lots of life left and is a reliable, fast shooting, and comfortable gun to use on the speedball field or in the woods. 

I am only trying to move this because right now I don't play paintball often, because I've gotten more into shooting real steel and when I do paintball, I play with a pump nowadays.

The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.""*Cash prices shown.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.""*Cash prices shown.

I originally wanted to carry it but it was relegated to nightstand duty where it's been ever since. Only reason for sale is that I have another P30L, and have no need for this one to sit in a drawer.

The gun shows virtually no sign of wear. I painted the HK P30L and 9mmx19 inlays on the slide, but it has been untouched otherwise. Comes with Meprolight night sights, interchangeable backstraps, (3) 15 round magazines, original box and accessories, as well as the original invoice if I can find it. It had the V1 LEM Light trigger from the factory.

Price for an outright sale is $875 (paid close to $1,100), but am open to a good amount of trades. Located in Greenville, SC and would prefer local transactions. E-mail me with any questions or for additional pictures.

I have a brand new Chaos titan quadrail and dustcover rail for the ak.

I brought it to my gunsmith and it will not work on my c39v2.

I purchased these parts from carolina shooters supply.

The part on the quad rail that fits into the receiver has been shaved down 1/32nd of an inch on each side.

No other modifications were made to the rail or the dust cover.

These are brand new parts, never used.

I did not receive instructions or original boxes from carolina when i bought them. So this is how you will also receive the parts.


Im gonna take a big loss on selling these but it will help with the funds towards a rail that will work.

I originally paid $256 plus shipping 

Because of the minor modification im letting this full setup go for $160 shipped.

Installed once, but I decided to go a different direction.
This is the new trigger group that comes with the New Century US made AK's. 

Improve your shooting, your rifle, and get compliant all at the same time!
• 100% American made single stage trigger group with machined release surfaces that offers a smooth and consistent trigger pull unlike anything you will find on standard AK triggers. 
• The top profile of the hammer has been optimized to eliminate the bolt carrier hang up that occurs frequently with other hammers and provides a smoother operation without the need of polishing the hammer. 
• The trigger uses a double hook design with an innovative relief cut which allows it to be used in receivers designed to only accept single hook triggers. This gives the operator the option to have the strength and control of a double hook trigger in firearms originally designed to only accept single hook triggers. 
• The disconnector has also been optimized to eliminate trigger slap and “folding” of the engagement surface seen on many other trigger groups during high round count tests. 
• The RAK-1 Enhanced Trigger Group has been properly heat treated and hardened to minimize wear and passed a 15,000 round endurance test. 
• Each trigger group will include a Hammer, Trigger and Disconnector which count as three U.S. 922r compliant parts. The RAK-1 Enhanced Trigger Group will also include a Hammer Spring, Disconnector Spring and a Trigger Sleeve which allows the Trigger/Disconnector to be pre-assembled before dropping into the rifle. 
• The RAK-1 is a great upgrade to any AK style rifle while maintaining the traditional reliability of a stock trigger. 
• Fits CENTURY ARMS WASR, C39, RAS47, AK63D and many other AK rifle and pistol variants."

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) - AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

From Keltec:

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included).

Excellent deer rifle with long range capabilities.  Includes detachable magazine, scope bases, scope rings.  Scope pictured is NOT included in the sale.

The classic Browning A-Bolt (often referred to as the A-Bolt II) delivers dependable, pinpoint accuracy that exceeds the stringent standards of the modern rifleman. The renowned A-Bolt has been produced in popular chamberings, materials and finishes to satisfy your needs in any hunting or shooting situation.

A very sophisticated bolt action - 
With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt II feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.

Barrel -
The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.

Trigger -
A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.

Magazine - 
Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine.

Magazine Capacity - 
WSM: Three in magazine, one in chamber."

I refuse to obtain a pistol purchase permit or ccw because I will not be on obamas list of registered gun owners. He can go to hell. That's all I have to say about pistols. 
Open to Multi-gun and gun-plus-cash trades. Cash will be king on this one because I have a few mounts from last season at the taxidermist that will be done soon and I have a hunting trip coming up in November to save up for. What I don't want is your homosexual 'squatted' Chevy with purple headlights pointing clear into outer space. Nor do I want your civic that your so proud of because you put a cold air intake and a fart can on it all by yourself. Go you. I won't be interested in your subwoofers and food stamps, homeboy. Other things I won't be interested include your tv, couch, lawn mower, computer, or your nagging wife/girlfriend... I already have my own. Also, Multi-gun trade doesn't mean I'm going to jump on your hi point 9mm and your grandaddy's beat up and shot out 30-30.

They're not.

Normally I just ignore it, because its not like anyones MAKING me buy your gun for such prices, but this is getting silly people.


For example, is the Bersa Thunder .380 listed for next to $400.Those guns, USED, aren't worth more then $300 (and thats being generous), period. 

I hate to call ya out, but c'mon, thats ridiculous.
For $400 bucks, someone could go over to gunbroker and have their choice of these guns BNIB, with the baseline model not being over $280, again- BRAND NEW.
The particular model in question with the gold goes for $315, BNIB.

Theres no way those grips make it worth such a high premium.Your basically saying you have $100+ dollar walnut grips. On your USED $275 gun.

 Seriously?

And this guy aint alone, by any means.

People come here to find a bargain on used guns, not pay more then they would at the FFL. NOT to pay more then retail or MSRP and THEN cover YOUR FFL tax. And plenty of folks like me love shopping here, have cash and like to add nice stuff to our collections- but then some people wonder why their listing is ignored, sitting on the list month after month...... 

When you drive a car off the lot, it immediately loses value. Same with when you shoot your gun, the moment you do that, its USED, it may be LIGHTLY used, but its still USED. 

Nobody sells used cars for retail. Take a hint.

Please, unless your gun is (actually) RARE, as in, not being made any more, collectors items, professionally customized, absolutely BNIB (the LNIB stuff is still USED, guys), or otherwise has accessories that come with to add value, be FAIR about your prices, and if you do not know the value of your gun, LOOK IT UP before listing it.

Before you list your stuff, do yourself (if you actually want to sell your gun, and aren't just listing it to appease the 'ol lady) and everyone else a favor and go check out what your USED gun sells for over on gunbroker.

That said, I certainly hope that you do enjoy shooting it since you're looking curiously at my ad and debating if you are more of a man than I am. The short answer is yes if you buy it from me. 

The gun functions with 100% reliability and hasn't so much as jammed up on me once. It comes with a couple of additions like a sling, Magpul sights and vertical grip, a Hogue grip sleeve, Hi-Tech CC extended top rail and tube selector (originals included), a shotshell pouch, original box and paperwork, three boxes of Brenekke K-O slugs, and a couple other boxes of shells. Anyways, text me at REDACTED if you want to talk shop. Otherwise email me.

This is the real deal. This scope is no longer offered by Leupold. New, this optic cost me $1879.00 from Optics planet.  I do realize it is no longer new, hints the price drop. $800.00 is a very fair deal, probably too fair, but that is my bottom dollar cash price. As far as trade value goes, I'm still holding at $1100.00-$1000.00 trade value.  This is your chance to own the same exact optic the U.S. Army uses in their MK24 Sniper System. As far as trades that I'm looking for, I love S&W revolvers, Ruger Security Six's(with both cylinders preferred), quality 1911's, and other quality handguns.  As far as long guns that I'm interested in trading for, I'd love to add another M1A or M14 to the collection, or possibly another AR platform, but I don't want your Custom pieced together AR, only stock models will be considered. Other quality long guns will be considered as well.  The specs for the optic can be found below, and I have every turrett cap; 308, 30-06, .556/223 and 300win, the original box, paperwork and sunshade that came with the optic new. All low ball offers will be ignored. Thanks for looking and God Bless!
