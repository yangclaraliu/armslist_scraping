All bra3ss starts off as once fired Lake City head stamped 5.56  brass and we hand sort all brass and any damaged brass is discarded.  The brass is then wet tumbled,  then processed using a Dillon Super 1050.  The primer pockets are swaged and the cases are cut formed with a Dillon carbide die and an RT 1500 carbide cutter to an overall length of 1.357” +/- .005”.  This will allow for multiple reloads without trimming.   The brass neck is then expanded to .308” it maybe necessary to chamfer the case for some projectiles or further neck expansion for cast bullets.  The last step is for the cases to be tumbled for a minimum of 1 hour to remove any case lube.  The cases are once again sorted for quality assurance.

Quality Assurance
We hand sort all of our brass and discard any defective brass.  Every batch we check every 25th case by using a Sheridan Gauge to ensure it meets SAAMI spec and prime the case to certify proper fitment.

Here's a snip of the review of Ruger's SR9 on Chuck Hawks. Links are broken here, so google ""chuck hawks SR9"" and you will find this article, or cut n paste the URL below without the quote marks. 

""The Ruger SR9 is the most pleasurable, thoroughly satisfying, 9x19mm pistol I have tested in many years. Everyone who shot this pistol had the same reaction: I have to get one. The build quality is confidence inspiring and the SR9 is about as ambidextrous (including the magazine release) as one can hope for in a pistol."" ""It is hard not to wax enthusiastic over this pistol. It lacks nothing and if you try it, you will want to own one. The 2011 version of the Ruger SR9 is simply outstanding.""

As many know, Vernie Reed was mentored by the master knife maker, Jerry Corbit, who is now retired. Vernie made a handful of these, of which at one point I owned three, each unique. Vernie carries on with some of the characteristics that Jerry was known for, full file working of the liners, back strap, part of the blade, and with the characteristic coordinated inlays that appear on the back strap. The knife has a 2.9” blade with an overall length of 6.9”. The scales are a blond mammoth with gold screws. The blade appears to have been cold blued, and has a bit of red/purple coloring in some light, but I’m not sure about the bolsters. The thumb stud sports an inlay as well. Even, the in the interior of the knife the back strap is also file worked. This is one of the last knives I retained after liquidating most of my custom knife collection. I always liked the contrast between the steel and the mammoth scales. The knife was sharpened by the previous owner.

The serial numbers ranging from 4,200.000 TO 4,399.00 are the ones made during the war and they are very rare indeed. The balance of rifles for the wartime period were made by IHC and HRA to about 200,000 between them. The rest AND by far the most used in the war were rebuilt WW2 rifles.

Benelli’s R1 big game rifle features simplicity, strength, and ingenious design. It’s built around the patented Auto-Regulating Gas-Operated (A.R.G.O.) piston-driven system.
A.R.G.O. piston-driven system provides significant recoil reduction

Picatinny rail for mounting optics.
Detachable box magazine for convenient and easy reloads. 
Complete assortment of shims to perfectly adjust the stock to fit any shooter.
The Benelli system has interchangeable barrels/bolts that change calibers and adjust gas feed to make the gun more versatile. Any of the calibers can be changed out quite easily.
The barrels are hammer forged and are then cryogenically treated to relieve surface stress and increase accuracy.

Serial # starts with S1 for Sar 1 and ends in 2000 for the year it was built. Shot about a full mag per year, so the round count is somewhere around 500. Not one failure to fire or eject with this weapon.
Well fitted Romanian, good equal rivets, parallel scope mount, good sight picture and great mag well, most mags steel and plastic lock tight with little to no wobble.
Have to mention the front sight tower is missing a pin and the bayonet leg was ground down. Why? not sure. I picked this one from a rack of 10 and they were all like this. Had always planned to replace it, just never did it. Doesn't effect anything and doesn't  look bad. Yes it had wood furniture, but that is long gone.

FOR SPRINGFIELD MOD.2 9mm

INCOG is a joint development project between Haley Strategic Partners and G-Code Holsters. 

The INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. 

The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. 


All INCOG holsters come with either a Tactical Fuzz or Camo Coating are available with black, gray or green Kydex. 

All INCOG holsters come with two mounting clips installed
 with the necessary hardware. 


MAG CADDIE 
The HSP INCOG Holster system enables the addition of the optional Mag Caddy. The Mag Caddy attaches to the holster and allows a GSM series magazine carrier to be incorporated into the system. This spare magazine attachment is intended for those carrying the INCOG in the Appendix carry position. The patent pending Mag Caddy is removable and also allows a range of adjustment. The mag Caddy can be ordered with the INCOG holster or purchased as an add-on here.
If you have a right handed INCOG, you will want to select a right handed Mag Caddy, and if left, choose the left handed mag caddy.
The Mag Caddy comes with the hardware necessary to mount to the INCOG holster. The Mag Caddy also comes with a magazine carrier of your choice.
All Mag Caddy Magazine carriers can be ordered with the same color options as the INCOG Holster.
The Mag Caddy is intended ONLY for use with the INCOG holster system and is not intended for stand alone use, or for use with any other G-Code holster at this time."

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. 

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. 

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™."

I built this gun with the intention of seeing if I could build a reliable and accurate lightweight AR-15 pistol. Mission accomplished. It's a 7.5 inch barrel (1:7 twist), A2 flash hider, slick side upper receiver (to keep it lightweight since it's a pistol, and let's be honest, you don't use the forward assist anyway), 7"" quad rail, ATI Omni hybrid lower receiver (lightweight polymer reinforced with metal in the high stress areas). 
This thing shoots cheap brass and steel case ammo all day, tested with 100 rounds without a single hiccup in performance. Great little gun. Other than the test this thing is brand spanking new. 
I'm offering this thing for sale in 3 different configurations to meet your needs/budget:

1) AR-15 owners special:
Just the gun with no sights, magazine, bolt carrier group (BCG), or charging handle (CH). Great option if you already own an AR and can share the BCG CH and mags until you want to spend the money for those parts. $400

2) Optics Ready:
The gun, the black nitride BCG, CH, and P-mag that I tested it with. No sights, ready for your sights or optics. 
Gun is ready to fire. $520

3) As Pictured:
The gun as pictured with BCG, CH, p-mag, reflex red/green dot sight and lightweight polymer folding buis sights that co-witness beautifully, and an angled foregrip. Sights have been zeroed and shoot on target ready to go. $620

I am not a dealer, nor do I have an FFL license. This is a private party sale, buyer must show AZ drivers license or CCW permit and sign a legal bill of sale. No felons!"

I’d rate the finish as 60%, as there is significant finish wear on the slide.  I will note that the frame is in much better condition than the slide, which is very important with Sig Sauers (ie, the quality of the frame rails is something to watch when buying used).

Round count is unknown as this pistol was purchased used, but It functioned perfectly, for the 50 rounds I put through it.  It has Sig Sauer straight 8 sights.

I am not interested in trades, with the exception of AK’s featuring combloc receivers and CHF, chrome lined barrels (cash to be added on either end depending on value of items being traded).

I am most interested in a face to face sale, which would take place in the southwestern suburbs.  Cash is the best form of payment.  Although I’m willing to ship, all associated costs would be on the buyers end, and I’d require either a USPS or Walmart money order before shipping to an FFL.

Although I am not requiring an FFL transfer for a face to face deal, I do reserve the right to use one if I see it as necessary.  In the event I ask for an FFL transfer, I would pay the full cost without increasing the purchase price (ie, I’ll foot the bill for it).  Having sold a few items through Armslist/GB, I’ve encountered situations where I’d feel more comfortable with an FFL performing a formal transfer.  It’s nothing personal, and very unlikely that I’d request this – after all, it will cost me money and time."
