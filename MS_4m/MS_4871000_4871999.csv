It will get you to the 1000 yd line with some match ammo as it sits right now. 

I started out with a Barreled Howa 1500 action (the same thing as a Weatherby action--they buy theirs from Howa), a 20"" CHF varmint barrel with match crown, 1-10 rifling, varmint profile, and custom adjustable single stage HACT trigger [Cost: $515]. 

I set that down in to a Bell and Carlson Medalist Tactical (what an amazing stock!) [Cost: $270].

For bottom metal, I purchased a Legacy Sports removable box magazine conversion kit [Cost: $48] 

A 5 round magazine, and 2x 10 round magazines [Cost: $120]

I then bridged the receiver with a 20 MOA one piece base made RIGHT HERE IN THE USA by Evolution Gun Works [Cost $60]

Next I mounted the Bushnell Elite 3200 Mildot 10x40 with MIL (MRAD) turrets and Mildot reticle (a MidwayUSA exclusive!) [Cost: $250]

In Vortex Viper 1-inch low rings to keep the optic as close to the bore as possible [Cost: $55]

I brace the rifle with a Caldwell XL 6-9"" Notched Leg bipod [Cost: $30]

Finally, I topped the build off with a pair of Butler Creek flip caps front and rear [Cost: $20]

With 168 gr Federal Gold Medal Match 308 Win, at 100 yds, this setup shoots a .5 inch group all day long.

That's a total of $1368 in parts alone, before shipping or transfer fees if you build it yourself.

I'll sell it local for $1000 even, that's MORE than a fair price, given that the rifle has shot one box of ammo since it was built.

The APECS is constructed with a proprietary GORE-TEX® fabric that's 40 percent quieter than previous ECWCS fabrics - to help you operate more effectively in the field. It's engineered to remain durably waterproof even after exposure to contaminants, such as jet fuel, gasoline, hydraulic fluid, DEET, and other petroleums, oils, and lubricants. And that means your gear will last longer.

I do have a bi-pod for it but wont be able to get it until Saturday afternoon.
 Unlike many AR-10 platforms the engineering of Sig ensures a dependable weapons platform. It is operated from a adjustable Gas Piston system that is adaptable to your favorite suppressor, full auto (if it were so setup) or regular operation. Factory free floating quadrail, ambidextrous mag release, multiple QD mounting points and collapsible factory Sig stock.
 It has a box or .308 down the pipe and is flawless. I have the Docs but have no idea where the box is. Asking 1895 for this superior weapon which is a fantastic deal considering MSRP on this weapons system is $2399.99 without sling, extra mags, bi-pod or glass.

IHC manufactured approximately 337,623 of the total 5,468,772 rifles produced since 1936, if you believe Scott Duff's research into the matter. This one bears a date of the 307th day of 1954 from the Julian date stamped into the inside of the stock when the wood was tooled out by the Frank Overton Company. Line Materials made the barrel. They set out to produce among the finest barrels ever put on a Garand. This is arguably the scarcest Garand to be had and this one is just about as-issued in 1954, save probably the handguards have almost assuredly been replaced at some point. The MW is a 2.8 approximately and the TE is a 4 and the bore is shiney from one end to the other. Obviously this particular rifle never saw a hostile environment in its 61 year history."

It has been stripped and cleaned, loaded and carried a couple times but as of yet is unfired and is in like new condition. Will come with everything it came with new, the case, mag loader, and 2 Mec-Gar 15rd magazines.
I'm primarily looking for something that would be more practical for conceal carry. Mainly in the market for a single stack 9mm. Would really like a basic (Armscor, RIA, etc) 9mm 1911, but would also be interested in a basic officer size 1911 of any caliber. Otherwise would be interested in other single stack 9mm pistols (LC9S, BP9CC, Sig P290, etc- NO Shields though). Would also be interested in a S&W J-frame. I would also consider a trade down plus some cash for a Kel-Tec PF-9 or Taurus PT111 G2.
Looking to make a trade only at this time so please refrain from sending ""what's my bottom dollar"" requests. FTF transaction in the Winfield/Wellington area, have my CCL and can sign bill of sale if desired. Reach me by PM or text to REDACTED."

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of various accessories. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I would trade this for a .357 Mag or a good sized, medium gripped 9mm. .380 is possible, too, if it isn't too small.

Don't look for a lot of checkering in the wood, or scrollwork in the reciever. This was a gun my grandpa used 4-7 days a week (in season) for nearly 40 years.

The capacity is 15+1 and includes TWO spare 15RND OEM mags.  Carried with a 2-mag pouch, you have 46 rounds available.  This handgun has been cleaned and lubed after every shooting session and has never experienced a jam or failure to fire.  It has been fed all variety of ammunition ranging from reloads to generic to name brands.  This pistol has a reputation of being rock-solid and outperforming its successor (the P89).  I can confirm the superiority of this P85 over the P89, having challenged a P89 owner at the range.  We both, using the P85, handily outshot the P89.

Will sell ONLY to Wisconsin CCL holder.

The U.S. Army gave consideration to the P85 as its standard issue sidearm to replace the M1911A1.  The P85 met the Army's performance requirements, including the military's requirement for a 20,000-round life expectancy.

The P85 was adopted by the Wisconsin State Patrol as its standard issue sidearm., leading the way for numerous other organizations across the country and internationally as well. The P85 quickly earned an enviable reputation of being able to digest any 9 mm load—from NATO M882 FMJ cartridges to hollow points—without a hiccup. Plus, it was as rugged as an M1 Abrams tank. There are many substantiated reports of guns being dropped, kicked and even run over, yet still coming up shooting.

This handgun is in almost excellent shape with only some very slight slide wear on one side of the muzzle.  This pistol currently has a Blue Book value of $350 for NIB.  As this is not NIB, I have set the price at a FIRM $280 (cash)

This pistol comes with the original hard case, original padlock, 3x15 OEM mags, and loader.   Will coordinate face-to-face transfer within Milwaukee County or nearby.

The following questions have been asked by interested parties:

Am I the original purchaser?  YES. THIS IS A SINGLE-OWNER FIREARM.

Is the original instruction manual included?  NO.  I THOUGHT I STILL HAD IT, BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE.  THE LINK FOR THE ONLINE MANUAL HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE POSTING.

Is there any rust at any location on the handgun?  ABSOLUTELY NONE.  THIS FIREARM HAS BEEN CLEANED AND LUBED AFTER EVERY SHOOTING SESSION.

Does the P85 accept +P loads?  YES.  RUGER DOCUMENTATION SPECIFIES +P LOADS ARE ACCEPTABLE.

What is the material used in the Fobus holster?  IT IS A SORT OF KYDEX FEEL.  THE HOLSTER IS SPECIFICALLY MOLDED TO HOLD THE P85 SECURELY, YET EASILY RELEASE WITH A QUICK FIRM DRAW.

What is the condition of the magazines?  ALL THREE MAGAZINES ARE LIKE NEW.  NO RUST.  FULL SPRING COMPRESSION/POWER.  THE MAGAZINES ARE ALSO CLEANED/LUBED AFTER EVERY SESSION.

Have any parts been replaced, repaired, or upgraded?  NO.  ALL COMPONENTS ARE FACTORY OEM, INCLUDING THE MAGAZINES.

Have you fired anti-personnel rounds with the P85?  YES.  I HAVE RUN A VARIETY OF DEFENISVE ROUNDS OF VARIOUS DESIGNS.  NONE HAS EVER CAUSED ANY PROBLEM.  THIS IS A RELIABLE FIREARM THAT GOES ""BANG"" EVERY TIME YOU PULL THE TRIGGER."

The Grips have a matching serial number to the gun. Date of production for this revolver was late 67 to early 68. The diamond checkered magnas were discontinued in 1969, for some unknown reason this revolver was not fitted with a pair of diamond magnas but the checkered magnas are none the less numbered to the gun and in very good condition. This offer also includes the original matching box but no papers or tool kit. I will be also including a box of .38 specials to offset the back round check which is now necessary by law. I use H+H Firearms on Greenwood and 8th for the check.

This revolver has to be seen to fully appreciate the Carbonia Bluing. It is of the blue/black variety and is no longer offered by S&W. It is in excellent condition. This gun also comes with a Allen gun glove for protection.

Additional photos by request, just send me your email and you will have them the same day. I have many to help you make a decision. All questions will be addressed promptly.

On the right side of the slide, it features “30 Years of service,” while just behind the breech face, a Beretta Trident logo is also inscribed in gold inlay. The wording “1 of 30” is also featured, highlighting the highly-limited availability of this collector’s pistol. The grips are premium wood and contain the 30th Anniversary Exclusive gold medallion. The whole comes with a velvet-lined premium wood box with a Beretta-logo plaque, a gold limited-edition coin and a certificate of authenticity featuring the pistol’s serial number. In all, this pistol offers an opportunity to own a piece of history as well as a highly-collectible, one-of-a-kind model.  Built to Exacting US Military StandardsWhen we talk US military standards, we talk hard numbers, not opinions. The M9 has been put through impossibly-rigorous durability and reliability tests that greatly exceed any kind of real-life situation--and it has passed them all with flying colors. For instance, it will keep functioning in temperatures as low as -40 F and as high as +140 F, and it consistently fires over 35,000 rounds of commercial ammunition before a failure. It will keep functioning reliably even after being buried in the sand or snow, or being repeatedly dropped on hard surfaces like asphalt or concrete. Beretta’s engineering experience and the quality of the steels used enable this kind of reliability, on which America’s servicemen and women depend every day.Fully Functional, Super-Accurate Another official test that the M9 had to pass was at the firing range. Even here, the demands of the US military far exceed most conditions in which a handgun is used--and even here, the M9 delivers. As per government testing guidelines, this pistol is capable of firing 10-shot groups of 3 inches or less at a distance of 50 meters (approximately 55 yards), with consistency and reliability. With other brands and models of premium pistols, this kind of accuracy may only be attained with extensive (and expensive) modifications and customization with after-market parts, while the M9 offers it right out of the box. Tactical Features that Speak for ThemselvesThe Limited collector’s model offers the tactical features that have made the M9 equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release enables the use of either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes the pistol flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. After shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it simple and quick to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features have made the M9 the choice of the US military, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection."

It has a few small handling marks on the frame but otherwise very clean and little wear.Includes 5 - 7rd Magazines and Soft Case .Click Here to Purchase or Check AvailabilityThe Beretta 3032 Tomcat is a Double-Action/Single-Action pistol that shoots .32 Auto ammunition. With a maximum capacity of 7 rounds. The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.The controls of the 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide while also preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand."

This is a great gun, I purchased it through a dealer in Darien who took in the gun as part of a Divorcee's collection; I've put maybe 500 rounds through the gun. Tried it for pocket carry in a nylon holster and only swapped it out because I had another .380 that I have owned and carry forever (Cannot fix what is not broken...)  The only notice of wear is the results of the first owner's attempt to move the take-down lever (pictured)

Additionally, I have paperwork from S&W to prove that I had sent the firearm back to the manufacturer to replace the battery and replace/tighten the screws in the built-in laser.  

To sweeten the deal, I am throwing in a rubber grip; I have one on my TCP and love it as well as an IWB holster that I used for a total of two hours.

The price reflects the current condition on the gun,  the added bonuses and your savings off of the retail store rate for a gun of the same condition (Plus no taxes or fees!). Make me a reasonable offer if you want or workout a layaway plan."

Gun is in excellent condition. Purchased it new a few months ago and have only put 2 boxes of ammo through it. Has all the factory stuff that it came with.

Gun comes with the following upgrades:

Trijicon night sights (2015 date code on sights)
APEX Tactical DCAEK trigger kit

Have two holsters for it, one is a leather IWB holster and the other is a kydex IWB holster that is adjustable for both cant and retention. 

In addition to the two factory 12 round mags I have purchased an additional 6 mags for it, 1 is another 12 round with pinky rest, the other 5 are 17 round full size mags, also have 2 x-grip adapters for it as well. 

Paid $450 for the gun, $100 for the night sights, $85 for the trigger kit, $30 for the 12 round mag, $25 each for the 17 round mags, and $12 each for the x-grip adapters. Kydex holster was $30 and the leather holster was $50. ($894 spent not including what I paid in shipping/tax)

I have ZERO interest in splitting up this package, I will not sell a single item separately, I know this will limit my potential buyers, but I don't want the hassle of making several deals. 

$700 takes it all. This price is 100% firm, I've got over $200 more than that into this. Please do not waste my time or yours by offering me less, the answer will be no."

Installation is simpler yet - just slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact.   MSR shooters that desire a larger cartridge will be excited to find that a replaceable barrel kit chambered in 300 AAC Blackout is available on ShopRuger.com. This range-ready barrel's headspace is set at the factory and comes complete with a metal flip-up elevation & windage adjustable front sight and two, 30-round metal magazines marked with ""300 AAC BLACKOUT"" to ensure easy differentiation.   Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.   The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 lb. trigger pull. The Ruger Elite 452™ features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers.   With front and rear folding iron sights, the SR-556® Takedown is ready to go to the range right out the box.

And sadly I have no where to put it where I'm currently living, and honestly lost intrested in it so I'm gonna try and trade it for a few guns.. 

But first let's be real here.. I am already taking depreciation, and that fact parts arnt new anymore, The cars beat up and ugly an it still need a tune into the price wich is more then fair. I have about 9k into this car. We're both tryin to trade somthing for somthing and both wana feel like we both came out on top. When you offer me an ar15 that you built for no more then 1600-1800$ realsiticly maybe more. I'm gonna value it around 1500, give me 2 ars 3k and a 6/700$ pistol and shotgun and an some rounds I'll be more then happy to trade..  

I'm hoping for 5k-4500$ trade value wich is very realistic considering the parts and money I have on this car.. I know in just repeating what I just said but just wana be clear befor I get a text and my time waisted. I'm hoping for 2 ARs between 1k-1.5k 1 shotgun an 1 pistol. I'm not asking top of the line pistol or shotgun but would prefer a top of the line sporting rifle!  PLEASE SONT EXPECT ME TO TRADE MY CAR FOR YOUR 1 riffle with an optic.. Be realistic. The only riffle I will trade stright across for is a nemo omen in 300 win mag 

The car was a project Iv had for a while and lost Intrest in it. It's built. It made 330rwhp on 18lbs of boost but I had a bad ground on my fuel pump assembly so it wasn't pumping enough fuel during pulls. and the tuner said fix it an come back, and it should be making close to 450whp safely The car is 99% done. Just needs another tune. It runs and drives as fine as is. Right now,  But kinda Spudders when you really lay into the throttle and hit boost
