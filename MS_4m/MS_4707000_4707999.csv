I have 100 rounds of this Hornady 155 Grain .308 Winchester Boat Tailed Hollow Point ammo in 50 round boxes. If you do not know what this ammo is… it is the super accurate 155 grain load from Hornady packed in a polymer coated steel case rather than brass. Before anyone sends an email… the bullet has no steel in it and is safe for your range but instead of brass cases Hornady used polymer covered steel as a cheaper alternative. This stuff is super accurate. The last few groups I fired with this stuff out of my Savage 110 LE with a 20” barrel were 0.75” to 0.83”. The round is the same one they load in their other match ammo but you are paying about 40% less because of the steel casing.

I paid $44.99 plus tax for each box at Fuquay Gun just last year. This stuff is not that easy to find and I am not looking to make any money on it so the first $90 get's both boxes. Lowball offers are not necessary. I am not in a hurry to sell it and will keep it before I give it away. It has been kept in a cool and dry ammo safe so this stuff is in the same condition as it was on the gun shop shelf.

If you are interested, I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at it please let me know and I’m sure we can work something out. Thanks for looking."

I bought this several years ago from an older gentleman that claims to have brought this home from England.  He was the US Air Force stationed in England after the war, and picked this up while he was there.  He claims it was an actual ""war"" rifle.  I do not know what year it was made, as I see different things on every forum, but if an 84C rifle was dated at mid 43 to early 44.....my 53C rifle should be late 41 to 42.....

I was given paperwork that was so thin, it was literally falling apart showing the import in the early 50's.  It has since faded into nothingness.......

So, now about the rifle.  This is a pretty good example of an early lend/lease Savage built Enfield stamped US PROPERTY.  There is a good amount of original green paint on the rifle.  Flip up rear sight, the rifling is still good and strong.  The bolt is smooth.  Matching serial numbers.  I have an old sling around here somewhere, and it does NOT have a magazine.  When I got it, he said that it was confiscated when he had it imported, and I do not believe that he ever shot it.  I have not shot it.  It is possible that this has not been shot since the 1940's.

I can only get so many pictures on here, but I have more if you want them.

I am open to working something out for this rifle.  I will be out of town starting Monday, 21 September, so I would like to try to work something out on Sunday, 20 September.

Let me know if you have questions."

It does look like it has been fired but from the looks of it very little. Also has a faint turn line on the cylinder and some slight wear on sharp edges of the cylinder it's not bad but it is there. Now for the blemishes, has a faint scratch behind the horse, and another below the hammer. Looks to have some slight wear on front right side and is pictured below, very hard to even see need the right lighting to even tell. Overall the condition of this gun is good, it's not flawless but for a gun made back in 1978 it is great. Please ask for more pictures, I could only get three to post but I have many I can email you. The gun is honestly in good condition I'm just trying to be extremely thorough incase I have to ship there will be no surprises.

On a side note if you have a colt python 357 with a 6 inch barrel and it has been used as a shooter. Let me know I'm sure we can work something out. 

All reasonable offers will be responded to. Multi gun trades or partial trades will be considered as well. 1600$ trade value 1500$ cash price. And I'm firm on that.

Selling my 1970's French MAB PA15. Uses a 15 round magazine. The 9mm double stack Baretta mags also seem to work, along with the CZ-75 if you cut the notch out. The 36.6oz weight reduces a lot of recoil. The only physical damage is a very small crack in the grip near the safety. And some cosmetic damage from typical use. Replacement grips can be found online for around $35 and remanufactured magazines for around $45. Overall it is a very durable,accurate, and unique gun that is getting hard to find.

Info
MAB PA-15 is a delayed blowback operated, semi-automatic pistol. It featured Savage-type, rotating, but not reciprocating, barrel, which has two lugs: one under the chambers is engaged in the frame and allows to the barrel to rotate but not to move back or forward. The other lug, on the upper surface of the barrel, is engaged in the curved-shaped notch inside the slide. When the pistol is fired, the barrel inertia and the bullet torque acted against the blowback force of the slide via the slope-shaped part of the notch. When bullet leaves the barrel, the slide rotates barrel and retracts to cycle the action. MAB PA-15 has a frame mounted safety, on the left side of the frame, and also internal magazine safety, which does not allow the gun to be fired with magazine removed.

Includes:
Handgun
1 Magazine
125 9mm rounds
Bore snake
Hard shell case

Serial number dates the pistol around 1935. ALL MATCHING, even down to the grips, which are the rare early gold medallion grips (worth nearly as much as the revolver just by themselves). Beautiful grips. The pictures don't do it justice. The revolver feels amazing in the hand. This is a shooter through and through, and an accurate and smooth one at that. Great bore, extremely tight lock up and solid action. Double and single action work smoothly and function flawlessly. Trigger is awesome; not an old heavy trigger like a Nagant! Smooth.
This is definitely a tough shooter and reliable revolver. 
The nickel has been refinished at some point in time, but I have no idea when in history this took place. It was professionally done, however, perhaps by Smith and Wesson factory later.

Overall great condition, with minor specks here and there on the finish simply from age. 

Open to trade offers (anything except .22s, really), ESPECIALLY military surplus weapons. Shoot me an email, worst I can say is ""no thank you"", but I'll consider all offers and always give a reply. 

Available for sale for $320.

This is an early Buchele poor boy .45 caliber flintlock.  It's a one of a kind made by one of the original great American craftsmen.  I also have a House rifle but it's not for sale.  The balance and feel of this rifle is amazing.  When you shoulder one of the truly well made rifles you instantly know it.  The furniture is all hand forged, stock is smooth and simple and the bore is perfectly clean and in great shape.  I was taught early and well on how to shoot, clean and maintain black powder guns.  I'm listing for $1800 or best offer.  I'd also prefer to do a FTF here close by but would consider shipping if you are willing to pay it.

This really is a one of a kind rifle and I'd love it to go to someone who appreciates what it is and is a true black powder shooter, collector and aficionado."

I can't remember, bit I think the serial number is from the early\mid sixties (101916). Everything functionally and physically is terrific. There are no leaks, and the pressure curve is stable up to 7 pumps, which is all this ol girl has ever been pumped by me. 

The stock is in original condition with only a few bumps here and there. The sticker on the stock is original. I also have almost 1500 pellets that will go with the rifle.

I might entertain a turret style press or a garand op-rod that is in spec as partial or full trade depending on what it is. However, I am really hoping for a high quality break barrel. I would place value in the 250 range."
