I have for sale a Polish tantal. 
Mechanically everything runs flawlessly. Has the grey, non-key holing barrel, G2 internals with the spine of the hammer filed so that it does not get stuck back when slowly pulled back (meaning smoother cycling) has Krebs peep sight and a knurled round charging handle. 
Cosmetics, however, is a completely different story.. It came with a cleaning rod that was too big, so that's laying around somewhere. You can have it with the gun if you'd like, but it is useless. The wood stock is pressed in with no screws, holds just fine, but still..
The handguard is a galil style tapco Han guard that had to be filed in certain places and then pressed into place by me taking a torch to the receiver and forming the handguard into it so there are marks on the receiver and the hand guard is now a little loose after about 300 rounds heating it up (cheap plastic pos) theres also a hole in I from where I over filed it to get a comfortable grip. Easy part to swap out, but i don't have the motivation if I'm just going to sell it any way. 

The way I see it, the gun is 400, you can get new furniture and some alumihyde (or krylon if you want something that wont last) for under 100. So that makes a decent 74 for under 500. Or you can just have a rifle that functions flawlessly and looks like crap for 400. Great truck gun.

Custom-grade accuracy is now within reach of virtually every hunter. Using the expertise that's dominated bolt-action technology for more than 50 years, the engineering team started from scratch and combined their most advanced, accuracy-enhancing features to create an all-new platform. This sleek, hardworking tack-driver is even built differently.
Crafted in our newest manufacturing facility using proprietary methods that create the tightest tolerances from rifle to rifle, by the most efficient means possible. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp new CrossFire™ trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. The 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch. Standard calibers have a four round capacity and magnum calibers hold three rounds. Like with all Remington bolt actions, expect a lifetime of rock-solid reliability. From the next generation in a legendary bloodline.
Key Features:

New CrossFire™ trigger system, factory set at 3 1/2 lbs. and user adjustable from 2 1/2 to 5 lbs.
Carbon steel magnum contour button rifled barrel
22"" standard chamberings and 24"" on magnums
Pillar-bedded stock and free-floated barrel

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

The slight increase in the weight gives the pistol better stability while firing. The reconfigured front profile also allows for a removable dovetailed front sight. Special designed side gripping surface provides fast, easy racking of the slide.----------- Frame mounted safety: 92 Billennium pistols feature a manual safety on the frame that locks the sear and the slide in the closed position. Safety can be inserted with hammer lowered or cocked. Frame mounted, ambidextrous for easier thumb access. Extended length and width.----------- Single action only: The short and light single action trigger pull allows for faster, more accurate discharge of subsequent rounds.----------- Carbon fiber grips: The use of carbon fiber gives the gun a highly technological and innovative look. The central portion of the grips is finished with a thin layer of soft-touch anti-slip material, to increase resistance to wear and abrasions.----------- Micrometric adjustment of the trigger: 92 Billennium pistols feature a competition-tuned trigger with screw to adjust the extra short let-off and over travel..

The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability."

When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.  The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability."

This is a very nice handgun and it was purchased to replace a stolen USP. Decided to give a striker fired pistol a whirl. While it is a nice pistol with a surprisingly good trigger, and even though I can ring steel at 100m with it, I just really miss my .45 and DA/SA.

The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit.

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

18-ounce Bat Bottles, Coors Light and Original Coors 
The first ""Limited Edition"" Bat Bottles were available for three months, in 1996, coming out on Opening Day of Baseball Season. The next year they had bottles with some players names but these are from First Limited Edition with no players names

The amber bottles are 11 1/2 inches tall and nearly 3 inches wide. They feature a simulated wood-grain texture that is molded directly into the glass. The Coors Light and Original Coors labels are located where a trademark would be on a real bat, on the bat's barrel section.
The bottle's neck, shaped like a bat's handle, is decorated with stripes mimicking the tape used to enhance a batter's grip. No paper labels are used on the bottles. They instead are decorated in a process known as applied ceramic labeling. Minute ceramic particles, called ceramic frit, are applied by silk-screen then oven-baked into the surface of the bottle creating a finish that looks as if it were painted.
Even the bottle's cap features a simulated wood grain along with the number 18, in this case the number of ounces of ice-cold Coors beer inside the bottle.

Extremely rare Traditional Nightmare. These aren't even listed on Sigs website as an available model and took me forever to find one. It has the round slide top traditional to 1911s which not only makes it look better but gives you a whole new world of holster compatibility versus the typical square slide Nightmares. This gun is in near perfect condition, maybe 99%. Has only had about 500 rounds through it, maybe less but definitely no more. Sights are night sights and flow very bright. Comes with two stock 8 round Sig mags with the plastic bumpers and one Chip McCormick flush fitting 8 round mag for carry. This gun has never been carried, never bolstered, was meant to be a carry gun and never worked out. Only selling to downsize and hate to let this go. Any questions just text me. Very accurate gun as well. Thanks

I've got over $2,000 invested, but don't expect to get full retail value for it unless you want full retail value for your firearm in a trade. It's in excellent condition with less than 200 rounds through it.

MIDDLE: this middle AR has a Salient Arms billet upper and lower receiver, Salient Arms titanium nitride bolt carrier group with the gas key built into the carrier, and a Salient Arms marked AXTS Raptor charging handle.

Hammer forged chrome lined barrel with a 15"" SLR Rifleworks Solo Lite Keymod handguard, SLR Sentry 7 adjustable gas block, SLR black nitride midlength gas tube, and Lantac Dragon muzzle brake. It has a JP Enterprises Evolution trigger group with the Armageddon trigger pad. (Look on JP Enterprises website for the details on this AMAZING trigger group.) It has the JP Emterprises safety Selector, Phase 5 Tactical bolt catch, Hera Arms pistol grip, JP Enterprises polished flatwire buffer spring, Black Rain Ordnance buffer, KNS Gen 2 anti rotation pins, Strike Industries mag release, Strike Industries pivot pins, and Magpul UBR stock. The glass is a Leupold VX-R Patrol 1.25-4 firedot reticle scope sitting in an American Defense high Recon mount. I have over $3,000 invested, but don't expect to get full value for it. It is brand new l, and has less than 50 rounds through it.
