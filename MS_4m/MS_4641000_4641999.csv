This is the variant with the adjustable rifle sights. This shotgun is brand new in box, with all factory paperwork. Remington's 870 is a legendary pump action shotgun today that needs no introduction. It has served sportsman, law enforcement, and even the military alike for over half a century. It is simply put, one of the best shotgun designs of all time, with a track record for reliability and durability. The Police Magnum 870 variant takes an already great firearm, and insures it is even better. Remington builds these in a special section of its factory with only skilled workers doing the assembly. Each individual part is inspected before it is used, and each completed weapon goes through a 23 point QC process before going out the door. The 870P is built on a forged steel receiver, which is smoothed of any inperfections before assembly. Both the extractor and ejector are also made of forged steel, to insure they will have long service lives. Extra power springs are used in the magazine tube, carrier, and trigger group. In otherwords, although the Police Magnum isn't cheap, Remington cuts no corners during the entire manufacturing process. After all, these shotguns are intended for use by law enforcement officers, who could one day depend on their shotgun to save their lives or the lives of others. This shotgun 100% new, factory fresh, and in its original serial matched factory box. It has a factory part SKU# of 24401. The receiver is marked Police Magnum, the barrel is 20"" long with an improved cylinder bore, and the trigger guard is made of metal (not polymer). Other features include factory adjustable rifle sights, standard 4+1 tube (will accept a +2 extension without any modifications), and front sling swivel stud. All of the metal parts have a factory milspec type parkerized finish, which is extremely rust resistant. This is a Remington 870 Police Magnum in a modern tactical configuration, assembled with quality partsWE Have just received some brand new in the box Remington 870 Police Magnums, 20"" IC barrel with rifle sight.

Before I could take it out I saw the newer one ($299.99), and decided to go to that version for the modular stock/grip options. Two screw installation is simple and surprisingly stable (yes - it uses the regular AK trunnion). I look on this website often for them for sale and this is the first I've seen in Columbus. This is probably a fairly rare opportunity to get simulated full auto capability for less than a C-note! These work best with a forward vertical grip (I learned shooting the new version); I have a couple extra if you need one. Pick up in Upper Arlington preferred.

The Level IV is NIJ Certified multi-hit .30-06 M2AP tested by an NIJ certified laboratory and can defeat between 5-7 M2AP rounds.

RMA has no hesitation in claiming that their level IV rifle plate is the strongest of its kind on the market today. The reasoning is simple: RMA uses a patented ceramic tile array to greatly reduce crack propagation. Conventional level IV plates use a monolithic piece of ceramic, which, when hit by an M2AP round, produces 'spiderweb' cracks across the plate, greatly reducing the plate's ability to defeat multiple rounds.

RMA's patented tile array essentially tells the ceramic where to crack upon impact, mitigating the damage and integrity to the rest of the plate and ensuring full protection to armor piercing rounds on other parts of the ceramic.

This patented process undeniably provides world-class safety to military and law enforcement personnel across the globe that is unmatched by any other manufacturer.

The Steyr Match pistol ws designed in parallel with their AUG rifle but not ""issued"" until 1990, many of the fundamental design features of the AUG are incorporated into the Match Pistol (and conversely). PROBABLY SOLD.  Listing to be deleted in a few days, if buyer accepts item.  Hammerli 120 will be available... roughly $1000 range.  Feel free to ask before these are listed.  Like the Steyr, the Hammerli 120 is considered an assault weapon in some places, but in some of them, has an ""Olympic Pistol"" or other competition gun exemption (CA for example).Armslist does not always forward inquiries successfully.  See my Hammerli 208 listing, or the images of my GSP listing for other contact routes, if needed.IF you are comparing this gun to other Steyr Match pistols available, be sure to check their accuracy.  Not all of these guns were ""created equal"" and be sure you can get the weight bar and set.  For my other free pistols, please see the OSP with 10"" .22lr barrel at   http://www.armslist.com/posts/4760564/illinois-handguns-for-sale--walther-gsp  or you can reach these via the Listings By This User at the UPPER LEFT near the account type, Walther GSP with the image of multiple pistols in one picture.  This pistol, unlike ANY other handgun, has the barrel precisely at the level of the index finger. As a result, there is no rotation of the gun after the cartridge is fired but BEFORE the bullet leaves the barrel.   It can fire any velocity .22lr ammunition. The muzzle brake can be removed, but is essential for high accuracy with supersonic .22lr ammunition. The weight system is used to tune the gun and remove unwanted harmonic vibration. If the weights are not used, the gun does tend to develop a bi or trimodal impact point. However, these pistols usually have a 0.15 MOA accuracy at 50 meters. The firing mechanism, surprising perhaps, derives from the one used in the SAKO Finnmaster, but the gun has many advantages over the SAKO.  The bar also helps in aligning the gun vertically. That noted, this is perhaps the only gun that is designed to be fired in ANY POSITION or degree of cant or rotation. That includes inverted, or the ridiculous ""on its side"" position used in lots of movies and TV shows now.  Several different grips are available, including a laminated LH grip Rink factory, a XL Rink RH grip, Morini M grip, and perhaps one or two others. Factory case included.  The first image is the Morini Medium grip. The second is the Rink grip, large which is not available.  Price varies a bit with which grip is chosen. The listed price is with the factory Morini grip, as illustrated.  Close offers considered, but they must be ""close"".  Shipping within the USA is included in the price of this gun.  If other guns are combined, there is no shipping charge for the additional guns, and there is a combined purchase discount for most of them.
 IL-FOID with state police confirmation is ok for pickup in IL with 3 day wait, but pickup can only be in locations where the gun is are not classified as an assault weapon. Pickup also is possible in NH for those qualified for receipt in that state. Confirmation with local police authorities will be requested, however, if FFL transfer is not used in NH. Shipping to any FFL is possible, if desired.   This gun IS legal in CA, but is a banned assault weapon in some states and communities.

With an absolutely instantaneous ignition, the trigger pull is incredibly clean because the trigger is an electronic switch; a no pressure explosion makes for the cleanest of trigger pulls. Thanks to this, you don't end up with accuracy robbing charge displacement allowing you a full, consistent burn of the powder charge at the base of the barrel.

719,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4641719,For Sale:  Two sets of sights for sale (AR ad M&P),"Reno, Reno, Nevada",$ 50,"Listed On: Thursday, August 27, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a set of novak competition sights for the M&P series of handguns and a mismatched set of Gen2 MBUS sights by magpul.

The Novaks are great sights, but I got a great deal on some other sights and swapped them out. There are some marks on the rear sight from pulling it off the gun, but you would likely make them same marks installing them yourself. The front is fiber optic and really bright, the rear is blacked out. These sell for 70$ new on midway, so I would be happy to part with them for 50$.

The MBUS sights are mismatched in color, but that never bothered me personally. I decided to mount a scope on my rifle instead. I've had them for awhile, so they have use, but I dont drop my rifle or beat it around, so they are perfectly functional. I would gladly sell these for 50$ as well.

It is a great choice for anyone looking for a fun tactical .22LR for only around $250-$300.

There are two main models with an additional two other variations. The Mossberg 715T flat top and the 715T tactical carry handle. They all have the great M4 adjustable stock and fit the 10 or 25 round magazines. The 715T carry handle is not only the handle but it is also where the rear sight is located and of course is where you place your optics. The carry handle version does not have muzzlebrake. The one up for sale is a flat top.
