Hopefully someone on here will be able to help me with what I'm looking for..... I'm fire forming 6.5 Grendel brass from 7.62x39,  and am looking for someone with a Grendel chamber reamer, that would be willing to make me a 12 gauge chamber insert.  Fire forming could then be done without a bullet, in a cheap single shot without shooting  junk down a good barrel.

Do you know the guy to make this? If you are him, how much am I looking at to get this made?
Lastly if you shoot a Grendel, and this interests you as well,  shoot me a email, and I will let you know what I find out.  Maybe they will be cheaper by the dozen.

It has a sink with 80 gallon tank. I bought a new electric water pump that you can have if you don't want to manually pump the sink faucet. Everything works. It has like 8 lights inside that all work. Fridge gets nice and cold, the range works great, there is a mirror over the sink and a lot of cabinet space. Comes with the 3 stands, I just recently painted it camo and used RV tape to wrap every space to prevent any drafts of water in the future before I painted it. It can sleep 3 people comfortably. The only reason I'm letting it go is its not big enough for the family and I. It's ready to live in or use for a ultimate hunting retreat. It will keep you warm and dry and it has a couple electricle outlets inside along with a place to plug in a antenna for a tv. It also comes with a fire extinguisher and other things I'm sure I'm forgetting. I would trade for quality firearms. Things on my list, quality AR, Glock 43, Kel Tec sub 2000 9mm, Sig P226 MK Navy seal 9mm, open to other quality firearms and a 870 or 500 pistol grip -2 gauge with 18 inch barrel and heat shield and shell saddle would be my ideal one.

It's off list, and doesn't even appear on Beretta's website,Â because as mentioned aboveÂ it's usually sold to law enforcement. It's designation is the Type C (constant action), also know as ""slick side"" because it has no external safety.

It was made in 1977 and was part of a run of 780 revolvers.  500 went to the FBI and 280 to the Michigan State Police.

The gun came with two holsters. Unfortunately they are both left-handed holsters and I am right handed. Both are in mint shape with minimal signs of use. The first is a Safariland 6280 with a Sentry III retention lock. This is a nylon holster with a soft fabric lining. The retention and lock function flawlessly. This is holster only. You can buy a Safariland belt loop adapter on Amazon for about $18. This is made to fit the full size HK45 (gun only - no lights or lasers attached). Along with the safety retention it has an adjustable retention screw to adjust the drag on the gun. The second holster is a beautiful hand made leather paddle holster by High Noon. The original owner told me that this holster cost about $200, and it looks it. Beautiful medium brown leather with contrast tan hand stitching. The holster has a retention strap held by a large snap that operates very smoothly. $100 for the pair of holsters. Open to trades for ammo (9mm or .45 - factory loads only, no hand-loads, brass onlyâ¦ball ammo is fine).

 This was the family boat for 33 years. I have original paperwork. It was always garaged when not used. Saw minimal usage the last 10 years. Last year we had a cracked head repaired by a professional mechanic. Unfortunately when we were skiing this summer it started to act like the head was cracked again. The head and block could use rebuilding or swapping out.

 Put a different motor in it and you have a new, good looking, 50mph ski boat for 1/10th the price of a new one

I bought this in the hopes it may get my wife to join me at the range.  No go.  I've enjoyed it for a few months but realize I probably won't shoot it much as I prefer larger calibers.  I purchased it brand new in mid August of this year and it probably has about 200 rounds down the pipe.  Absolutely drop dead gorgeous gun. This is the 6.8"" barrel target/hunting version of the MK III and is hard to find in this form. It has the target grip - MSRP is $749â¦street price is around $600 if you can find one, and then of course there's sales tax.  Mine comes with all the papers, the factory box, two factory ten round mags, a factory mounting plate for optics, several replacement front sight fiber optic inserts in orange and green. $500 FIRM including an unopened box of 325 .22 LR Federal Target ammo.  Buyer pays FFL unless you are willing to come to my FFL up north in which case I will pay the FFL fee."

if you're looking for a less expensive rifle, go with a delton pos, or something made of plastic and see how that goes for you. i'm not coming down on the price as the upper alone was 475 without the furniture upgrade. it's better than a delton, equal with bushmaster, however it's not a sig, or ruger piston. but the price reflects that. if you want a solid rifle, here it is. if you don't have the money to buy, don't contact me. if you found a less expensive rifle somewhere else and you decided to talk to me, you know this is a better rifle than the cheap pos you found at a lower price. if you want to play 20 questions, i won't respond."

It's chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that's coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. It's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.The receiver is also coated with Teflon for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in two finishes; Black and Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo Pattern.

It is an adaptable scope that fits well with a variety of shooting requirements. Easily mounted close to the rifle due to its 33mm objective bell, it is a superb choice for those seeking a low profile optical sight.

These are pretty rare in the sense that you don't see them very often. Colt made them in 1994 only and they were Law Enforcement/Military rollmarked. It is a .223 caliber and features the collapsible stock as well as a flat top with a detachable carry handle. It is an HBAR with the flash hider and bayonet lug as well. These guns were known to be very accurate and well built. I haven't fired the gun since I acquired it so that's the only reason I'm considering parting with it. The gun does include a factory Colt 20 round magazine that is rollmarked Law Enforcement as well. This would make anyone an excellent shooter. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

 Designed basically by Fedor Tokarev in 1938, and refined in 1940, The SVT40 rifle cycles by means of a gas-operated short-stroke spring-loaded piston, with a tilting bolt. This weapon has a MUZZLE BRAKE, NOT a flash supressor/hider, and is legal to own and transfer in California. 

  The Izhevsk ""arrow in a triangle"" and ""1940 stamp on the receiver identifies the arsenal and date of manafacture. The original arctic birch stock shows a bit of wear, but has no cracks or repairs. Serial # xx102x is stamped on the stock, receiver, and triggerguard as well as Â electropenciled on the plum colored bolt. The electropencil numbers and plum-colored bolt are signs of an arsenal rework, which is common with SVTs that went through this rebuild process. Like many SVTs, the receiver has the milled grooves for a scope mount, but no top notch to lock the scope mount in place.

  The barrel has the later 4 slot muzzle brake.Â  Standard 100-1500 meter sights. The rifle and stock are in very nice condition overall.

I bought it earlier this afternoon from Sheels in Grand Forks, ND. I got home, took it to the range and put about 100 rounds through it. I love the gun, it shoots beautifully, but my monster hands need a full sized gun to be completely happy it seems, haha. 

I'm selling this to immediately fund the 4"" barrel service model Xd Mod 2, which I didn't know existed before I bought the 3"" sub compact.

This gun feels amazing in the hand, the Grip Zone is really amazing, really does make a difference from normal hand gun grips. The trigger on this gun is light and glides smoothly. It was really a joy to shoot, just too small for me. Would be perfect for a wife or gf, or even yourself for concealed carry.
