I am leaving for the marines soon and am looking to sell one of my guns. This is the GSG 5 22lr, they do not make these anymore!! Very rare gun. Due to the ability to easily convert the detachable fake suppressor to a real one. Also features the double sided safety. This is not your average plastic light weight GSG. Very solid gun, with a good amount of weight to it. It is not in perfect shape, it needs a couple touch up paint spots on the stock slide. Just put a brand new $120 weaver low profile red dot sight on it, hasn't even been shot with it on yet. Comes with 2 magazines, a soft black tactical series case, and 500 rounds of ammo.

asking 450 with the weaver red dot and 500 rounds of 22l.

350 for the base gun and 2 magazines and case.

This the the extreme model with front slide serrations and night sights.  
The gun has a manufacturer date of June 4 2012.  This gun has about 300 rds through it, I am original owner.
I have had 0 malfunctions.  I did replace the grips a few years ago with custom rosewood grips as the ones that came on it were too thin.  I no longer have these grips.  You get the ones in the photo, which are superior.

I have carried this some, but there is little to no wear marks, email me and I will send high resolution images.

Comes with one 6 rd flush magazine and case with original lock and user manual.
I did have night sights replaced by Sig in february under warranty, the front sight had failed.  They are bright and perform perfectly.  

The trigger is excellent on this gun I have seen 938s some with gritty heavy triggers.  This one breaks about 5.5lbs and is very smooth.

I am not interested in trades at this time, I would only trade if it was heavy in my favor and it was something I could turn around and sell quickly.

As of the time of the listing the cheapest extreme p938 is $600 on gunbroker, I believe my price is very fair.

It’s the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is chambered for the popular 7.62×39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. Both cartridges offered in the 527 Carbine model are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage.Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. Designed to shoot .311 bullets, some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters.

The Mil-Spec 4150 chrome moly vanadium steel barrel comes equipped with 1 in 7"" twist rifling, M4 feed ramps, a low profile steel gas block, and is finished inside and out with a protective black nitride treatment for superior durability and corrosion resistance. The muzzle is threaded with a 5/8""-24 pitch for easy installation of a silencer, and is topped off with an effective AAC 51T Blackout flash hider. 

The upper features a forged M4-Style flat-top receiver onto which a Knight's Armament free floating URX 3.1 Quad Rail System is rigidly attached.

Most subsonic and supersonic loads, fired from either a suppressed or unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration.

I acquired it recently and decided I would rather carry a stainless gun than risk rubbing off the blueing on this nice old one.  The pistol comes with the original Walther mag and two MecGar mags, a like-new Uncle Mike's IWB holster, and a hard case. 

I am looking to sell outright or trade.  When these old Walthers pop up on GunBroker you find folks asking all kinds of prices with the high ones wanting $900-$1000 (for some reason).  I am looking for $650 or best offer.

I am leaving for the marines soon and am looking to sell one of my guns. This is the GSG 5 22lr, they do not make these anymore!! Very rare gun. Due to the ability to easily convert the detachable fake suppressor to a real one. Also features the double sided safety. This is not your average plastic light weight GSG. Very solid gun, with a good amount of weight to it. It is not in perfect shape, it needs a couple touch up paint spots on the stock slide. Just put a brand new $120 weaver low profile red dot sight on it, hasn't even been shot with it on yet. Comes with 2 magazines, a soft black tactical series case, and 500 rounds of ammo.

Description: Rainier Arms Custom
We just built upon the years of research and improved upon the already great RUC platform. We are so excited to introduce to you our new RUC MOD 2.

When we first introduced our original RUC, our focus was to develop a rifle that integrated a lightweight design while using the highest quality components. What we created was a high performance AR15 that took the market by storm. Introduced on the rifle was our ambidextrous charging handle, the Raptor as well as an ambi safety selector set up.

The RUC MOD 2 has slimmed down from it's predecessor and now weighs in at 6 lbs and 1 oz. It features our new Rainier Arms Force Rail 15"". We also redesigned our new Rainier Arms Compensator (RAC) which offers enhanced recoil management and almost fully eliminates muzzle rise. We needed a heavy duty barrel and we achieved it. Introducing our Mountain Series barrels. They are CHF Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel 5.56mm Nato barrels - the toughest out there, period.

All materials used are of industry-leading standards, each weapon carefully and meticulously assembled with a limited lifetime warranty.

This is the older rifle, manufactured about 10 years ago.  Shot ONCE with roughly 100 high grade German 22 Match to site in and test (bulls eye accurate) then put into storage because I busted my foot that summer before the winter season started.  It has been stored dry and safe (it is New Mexico) and is in like new condition with the exception of one very small nick on the fore grip that can easily be concealed with paint (came this way from the factory).  An awesome rifle.

Asking 1300 obo and will consider a part trade and part cash deal."

790,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4435790,For Trade:  P-26 M91 Dragoon Mosin Nagant,"Westerville, OH, Columbus, Ohio",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 17, 2015",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for trade ONLY, my P-26 M91 Dragoon. I don't want to get rid of this one, but considering my collection revolves more around Civil Guard related items, especially M24s, I figured I'd put this up to see if there's any interest. If not, I certainly have no problem keeping this one in the safe. ;)

This one was a pre-bubba rescue. The previous owner was going to refinish the metal and wood, make a pretty ""shooter"" out of it. With the help of a very good friend, this one escaped that fate.

This one I would say is in overall fair condition. There's not much finish left on the metal surfaces, has a nice patina though. The stock is in good, solid condition, no cracks - a Finn-made stock, rear portion was part of a one-piece Russian M91 stock that saw use in Austria-Hungary, you can see the plugs under the escutcheons and on the bottom of the stock. Has solid M91 Dragoon bands and what I've been told is a modified Japanese Type 38 cleaning rod - has the same age/patina as the rifle, I'd imagine its been with the rifle for quite some time. It does have a Finnish makers mark stamped onto the wood. The bore is poor condition, visible rifling, but looks very neglected - may clean up though, I've done a couple soaks with CLP and the rifling shows more definition with each cleaning - considering the rarity, I'll leave it to the next owner to try and clean it more if they so choose. I have not shot this rifle. The rifle originally came with a canvas M1 Garand sling on the hangers, I've replaced it with an SA marked Soviet M91/30 sling, but if a trade is done the next owner is more than welcome to the Garand sling that was on it.

These are very rare, this one is one of only a handful of known existing examples. Only 1490 M91 Dragoon barrels were relined along with the P series M91 Infantry rifle barrels. This would be a fine addition to any Finn/mosin collection, even with its issues. Not that it matters much other than for shipping purposes, but the receiver is a 1902 Tula.

Here are a couple pages with a bit more info on these:

http://www.mosinnagant.net/finland/M91inFinland.asp
http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinMPseries.htm

If you need more pictures, please email me.

Alright, now what I'm looking for in possible trade - in order of preference:

NSD marked M24
Updated M28 (M28 with M28/30 upgrades)
Civilian M28
Possibly other Civil Guard related rifles - though NOT the more commonly seen variants of M24s, M91s, M28s, etc - If I let this go it will ONLY be for something of near equivalent rarity/value/etc.

This will not be a for sale listing, no price will be added. This is for trade ONLY. 

If you're interested and have something you'd be willing to offer from the list above, please email me. I can provide my cell number from there if you'd prefer to discuss over the phone rather than email. 

Thanks for looking!"

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies around the world."
