I am selling my as new BT-99, 34'' barrel, standard configuration (no adjustable comb). Born 2012 and purchased in 2013 and not a mark on it. It has less than 200 rounds through it and I just don't have the time or money for shells to get where I need to be at competitively. I shoot much better with my Citori O/U as I have owned it many more years. Comes with everything you see, manual, chamber lock and choke wrench. No box, didn't need another one laying around. Comes with factory full choke. 
 Description:
 INVECTOR PLUS™ CHOKE TUBE SYSTEM
 The Invector-Plus interchangeable choke tube system provides consistent, dense shot patterns in the constriction needed for your shooting situation. The longer choke taper inside an Invector-Plus choke tube works with Back-Bored Technology to produce patterns with more uniform densities and fewer flyers. The superior design eliminates gases slipping between the choke tube and barrel that could damage the choke tube and the barrel. CHROME CHAMBERS
 The BT-99 features a chrome-plated chamber to resist the toll thousands of shells can take on lesser quality guns. Corrosion resistance is also greatly improved.
 VECTOR PRO™ LENGTHENED FORCING CONE
 Longer, tapered Vector Pro dimensions minimize shot deformation and maximize pattern uniformity, consistency and density. Back-boring increases bore diameter specifications and decreases friction between the shot cup and the bore to maximize shot pellet velocity and reduce felt recoil. Reducing constriction from the forcing cone on the shot column results in fewer deformed pellets for more uniform patterns, and keeps more pellets in the central part of the pattern where they’re needed to smoke clays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barrel - The BT-99 features a back-bored barrel and utilizes the Invector-Plus™ choke tube system to provide more consistent patterns and reduce felt recoil.
 Chokes - Interchangeable Invector-Plus™.
 Forearm - Bold beavertail forearm helps absorb recoil and assist hand-eye coordination.
 Extractor - The BT-99 features an extractor only.
 Rib - High-post, 11/32"" rib.

•Aftermarket Replacement Trigger Unit for the 10/22®
•Easy Upgrade
•Improve your Accuracy with a Great Breaking Trigger




Experience the preferred manufacturing of Kidd Innovative Design's Single Stage Drop-in Trigger Unit.  This quick upgrade will give you a superior break without any needed gunsmithing to install.  This aftermarket 10/22® trigger is designed to adjust from 1 1/2 pounds to 5 pounds with the turn of a screw. It comes standard in silver or black anodized aluminum with our redesigned auto bolt release and interchangeable magazine lever system. 




Our single stage trigger guard is CNC machined from billet to Tony's specifications.  Always following the KIDD Quality of closely held tolerances enabling the cleanest breaking single stage in the industry.




 How is this different from our two stage? This single stage more closely matched the traditional function of the factory trigger except with a refined feel and adjustability. Our two stage has a travel stage where the trigger blade moves rearward for about a 1/4 of an inch before it comes to the breaking stage. Because of this travel stage our two stage trigger is able to be reduced in weight to only 6 ounces versus the lowest weight for our single stage is 1 1/2 pounds."

Apex M&P Polymer Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit 

The Apex Polymer Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit features a solid polymer trigger body, with center pivoting safety. This kit will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as, significantly reduce the uptake and over travel. It produces a trigger pull very similar to that of a 1911 but in a polymer frame striker-fired pistol. The Polymer Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break. The rounded trigger face provides the user with a comfortable surface for the firing finger. The kit comes with two (2) trigger return springs; one designed to produce approximately a 4.0 lbs trigger pull (silver spring), and one to produce a 5.0 lbs trigger pull (green spring). These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs.

Expected Results 
– Reduced trigger pre-travel and over travel to produce a feel similar to a single action fire control system 
– A smooth trigger pull all the way through to the break 
– Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety values 
– 4.0 lbs (silver spring) or 5.0 lbs (green spring) trigger pull weight, depending on which trigger return spring is installed

Apex Trigger:
Features & Specifications 
– Lowers trigger weight to approximately 4.0 lbs (silver spring) and 5.0 lbs (green spring)
– Smooth uptake and reset 
– Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety values 
– Works with all Smith & Wesson M&P pistols in centerfire calibers (excluding the Shield) 
– Easy to install 
– Requires use of sear housing block designed for large size sear plunger and spring"

Right now I do not currently have any vests however I will soon.
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

Purchased at Cabela's about 1 1/2 years ago.  Low round count, maybe 500 down the pipe, gun has functioned flawlessly out of the box.  Comes with pictured case and four seven round magazines.  I did also install standard Trijicon night sights.  My sight pusher did mar up the finish on the right side of the rear sight in the process.  I've covered this over with a black Sharpie.  However, these sights were purchased brand new from Kahr, have plenty of life left in them, and are perfectly functional despite the blemish to the paint.

191,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4165191,For Sale:  Trijicon ACOG TA11H-G with JPoint Reflex Sight,"Goldsboro, Jacksonville, North Carolina","$ 1,050","Listed On: Sunday, March 22, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I would like to sell my Trijicon 3.5x35 ACOG. This ACOG is one of the more sought after ones because it has a green horseshoe reticle , extended BDC, and longer eye relief than most of the 4x32 ACOGs out there. Also, this ACOG has an added bonus of a JP Enterprises JPoint 8 MOA red dot that is mounted above it. I bought this ACOG for my wife because she loved shooting her AR, but she is more of a ""twice a year"" shooter, so this scope stayed mounted on her rifle in the safe for 99.9% of the time since I bought it new. 

The ACOG, JPoint, and mount were all purchased new by me a little over a year ago and are all in great shape. I purchased the ACOG and JPoint at Opticsplanet and the mount at Midway USA. All combined, I paid around $1575 for all of it. There are a few minor scratches on the JPoint mount, but nothing too detract from the overall appearance or functionality. The ACOG is virtually flawless - especially the glass - with only one or two barely visible scratches on the body and minor mounting marks on the mount.

Included are:

- Trijicon ACOG TA11H-G  3.5x35
- JP Enterprises JPoint 8 MOA reflex sight 
- JP Enterprises Mount Adapters (Top and Lower)
- Flattop Adapter for Military Style Rail (TA51)
- LENSPEN® (TA56)
- ACOG BAC Manual
- Warranty Card
- No box - Used in shipping (I thought the wife loved the ACOG and would not let me sell it!)

You may be wondering why I am selling so cheap. Again, I bought the ACOG for my wife and she never used it. The JPoint was mounted on my other ACOG, but realized that I don't really use that either. We are now Spring Cleaning and I would like see that someone else can enjoy it without paying new prices for used items currently sold elsewhere. 

This is a 100% authentic ACOG from Trijicon - not a cheap knock-off. Please feel free to call Trijicon at 1-REDACTED to run the serial numbers in the below pictures for authenticity.

Price of ACOG without the JPoint - $950. No trades please.

I prefer face-to-face in the Eastern NC area, but can ship via UPS ground for $20 more and a certified check mailed to me prior. Any questions or need for more photos, please ask."

a less experienced shooter.

The gun was sent in to S&W in june and had the laser unit and buttons replaced with the new version. This slide has the harder to find Laser Engraved trademarks. I think the look much better than the stamped trades. After I got it back I had the Barrel, Frame, and Trigger done in Burnt Bronze ($150).

It is a .22 long rifle and likes about everything I have fed through it. These were made in the US when the Walther version was banned from import because of the 1968 Gun Control Act. They were just too small to import. So being Americans, they were just made in the US under the Iver Johnson name. Magazines and parts are about interchangeable. So back came the TPH - just named the TP-22.

You will get the case as pictured and one magazine. I will also include a VERY nice flap holster that fits it well in case you want to use it as a fishing or a trail gun. This pistol is about 2/3 the size of a Walther PPK. Tiny. But comfortable to carry and shoot. It might also make a nice pocket pistol for concealed carry or a nice purse gun, since it's very safe with its hammer block safety and double action. I'd use CCI Stingers in that case, and this pistol likes them very much.

I am in Santa Fe and can meet you about any time. Email through Armslist or text me and we can meet. You will like this one. Did I mention this is tiny AND reliable? LOL!

I am not interested in a trade at this time. Thanks for reading my ad.

I prefer to sell locally face to face, but I will ship to an FFL."

I had the upper, lower, handguard, and gas block Cerakoted a beautiful grey color.  Then I installed a Jard single-stage 3lb adjustable trigger, a Vltor IMOD buttstock, a MagPul ASAP single point sling mount, a set of three 3"" rail pieces, and Mission First pistol and folding forward grips.  For a little extra flair, I added custom pivot and takedown pins that each picture a hand giving the middle finger as well as a ejection port cover that reads ""Yippie Ki-Yay Mother F***er!"".  Finally for optics, I mounted a EoTech 512 and  a UTG 3x magnifier with a ""flip to the side"" Quick Detatch mount plus a set of MagPul MBUS flip up sights.  I topped the whole thing off with a 1"" light on a detachable mount and a Blackhawk! single point sling.  It comes with Ruger Tactical Carrying Case and one MagPul 30 round P-Mag.  I have put around 300-350 rounds through it and it has always functioned flawlessly.  I can usually shoot 1"" or better groups at 100 yards.

Wood has various dings and dents, but you can replace the stock with a new one if you wish.  Has a ""V"" stamp near the pistol grip and 4 digits inscribed on the side.  Other than that, I do not see any cartouche marks, although it is the stock that it came with from CMP.  New barrel installed by Springfield Armory in 6-42.  Date and flaming bomb stamp on barrel.  Serial # 1045180, which makes this a ""high"" serial number 1903, so you can shoot it.  The numbers on the receiver, bolt and stock do not match.  Comes with certificate of authenticity from CMP.  I prefer to meet locally and sell face to face, but I will ship to an FFL.

763,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4165763,For Sale:  Glock 9mm extended magazine NY Safe Act compliant for Glock 17 19 26,"downtown, Syracuse, New York",$ 20,"Listed On: Sunday, March 22, 2015",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The following is a unique Glock 9mm magazine. It is a KCI brand Glock 9mm extended magazine originally intended to hold 33 rounds. However, it has been modified to only accommodate eight rounds. This has been achieved using a magazine block that has been permanently welded to the follower and the magazine spring (see picture). As well, the +2 round extended base plate has been replaced with a flat base plate. If you wanted the maximum 10 rounds currently allowed by the NY Safe ACT you could simply replace the base plate.

Why would I do this to such a magazine? Personally, at one time I was interested in the aesthetic of the ridiculous protruding magazine to have my Glock 17 fit the profile of a G18 seen in certain movies and video games. However, I only use standard 10 round magazines now, and am doing some spring cleaning and looking to sell the magazine.

$20 for the magazine, either FTF or shipping is additional.

NY SAFE ACT compliance source: Since 1994, magazines sold in New York could contain up to 10 rounds. This continues to be true today. You may buy, sell, and possess any magazine that can hold up to 10 rounds, regardless of when it was manufactured. If you have a magazine that can contain more than 10 rounds, you have until January 15, 2014 to permanently modify the magazine so that it holds no more than ten rounds, responsibly discard it, transfer it to a law enforcement agency or officer, or sell it to a dealer or an out of state purchaser.

It's in excellent condition, with approximately 50 rounds fired since new.  I still have the original box it came in.

The Remington 7400 is known for its reliability and accuracy.  The gas-operated action, along with the generous recoil pad,  helps to tame the recoil.

The blued metal surfaces are perfect, no rust, and the barrel bore is bright and shiny.  There are hunting scenes engraved on the sides of the receiver, elk on one side and sheep on the other.  The beautiful dark walnut stock has actual cut checkering, not pressed, with factory sling swivels.

I have the original 5-round magazine, and two metal 10-round magazines.  Also included is a good hunting sling and a padded gun case.

The rifle is complete with a mounted Leupold Vari-X II, 1-to-4 power variable scope.  The Vari-X delivers the performance and features that serious hunters demand.   The brightness, clarity, and contrast will allow you to hunt even in low-light conditions.  The Vari-X is also popular for its, ruggedness, absolute waterproof integrity, and famous Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee.  I even have the box the scope came in. 

If you've ever wanted a good all-purpose rifle, this is your chance to score a Remington 7400, with accessories.   I'll take $495 for the entire package.  Reply to this ad with your phone number and let's talk about it."

From Advanced Armamanet Corporation (AAC):
""At 300 meters, 300 BLK has 16.7% more energy than 7.62x39mm. Max effective range, using M4 military standards for hit probability, is 440 meters for a 9 inch barrel, and 460 meters for a 16 inch barrel. 300 BLK from a 9 inch barrel has the same energy at the muzzle as a 14.5 inch barrel M4, and about 5% more energy at 440 meters - even though the barrel is much shorter."" This supported my decision for going with the 9"" barrel. 

I've put 25 rounds through it, sighting in.  Fun to shoot, but I'm now wanting to get into longer range. Decided to use the lower from this AR.

The photos picked up some whitish hand prints... the upper is perfect.

It was passed down to relatives after his death in 1986, and I wound up with it a few years ago. It had been stored in a case for decades, and probably had not been fired since the late 1960s. I cleaned it up and test-fired it. I shot a 2” group at 100 yards the first time out… but your mileage may vary!

Here is what I know about the gun’s condition:

- It shoots well

- There was some missing finish (lacquer or shellac) on the stock near the butt end. I lightly buffed this area with a fine scotchbrite pad to remove the loose flakes, and applied a light coat of linseed oil followed by carnauba wax. There are some color variations remaining, but the wood is in good condition and I think that a full refinish would put things right.

- There are some light rub marks in a couple of areas. See photos. I think this is from the sling buckles rubbing during storage and making slight impressions in the wood. The finish is intact in these areas. These can likely be sanded smooth during a refinish.

- It has a Weaver K4 60-B scope. There is a scuff on the top and a small dent on the underside as shown in the photos.

- There is no rear sight. The sight was likely removed and the filler block installed when the scope was added.

- There was some rust on the butt plate. I applied rust remover, followed by a cold bluing treatment. It looks OK now, but a professional restoration would make it like new.

- In general, the bluing is in good condition. The exception is several areas on the top right of the barrel. There is some light pitting which is shown in the pictures.

- The serial number is from 1949 per Winchester. The underside of the barrel is stamped “1906 49.” The bolt carries the full serial number, which matches the receiver number.

- The sling is included, but it’s rough. There is a missing rivet at one end, and the leather is very dry and stiff.

I decided to cover it with a Odin Works 15.5"" extended rifle length K-Mod handguard.  For stability, I installed a ACE brand skeletonized  fixed stock and A2 buffer tube kit as well as a Atlas Acu-Shot bipod.  Finally, to increase the reliability of a trigger pull, I replaced the mil-spec trigger with a Geissele Super Semi-Auto (SSA) two stage trigger. It has a 2.5lb take-up and a very crisp 2lb break.  I have run approximately 150 rounds through this gun.  With a Millett 4-16x50 scope and I have shot sub MOA groups from 200 yards. However, that scope is not for sale with this gun.
