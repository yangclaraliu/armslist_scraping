 My gun is a factory built upper and lower. The lower has never been shoot and the upper only has approximately 500rds through it.   I'm looking for a AR15 pistol of the same build quality.  I might consider others with a cash offer but you need to make the offer up front.
The trade value is whatever we can agree to trade each other. It's really that simple.  If your interested, tell me what your will to bring to the table.

I just got this .45 to the place that I love, and I am struggling to get my fingers to type because I am not quite ready to sell it. I have owned this pistol for 10 years and have taken meticulous care of it. It has seen less than 500 rounds in that time. I just bought another Kimber, and am selling this one to compensate the costs.

I have upgraded the grips to the Crimson Trace Rosewood Red-dot lasergrips LG-404 P10 and still have the original wood and ambidextrous safety. I will send the original CT box with the purchase.

I also have the Bianchi style 82 locking quick release hip holster that fits this gun perfectly. I am 6'0 and 150lbs and it fist perfectly on my hip for concealment.

I have included 2 firing pin duds, 3 clips, and original Kimber lock and slide release pin.

All of this fits beautifully into a Pelican 1400 foam inlaid dust-proof, waterproof, dirt-proof, lockable case. I have modified the bottom of the case to be able to hold 103 bullets safely. (Ammo not included)

Please inquire with any questions via email. All of the other specs on this gun can be found at kimberamerica website

The last few pictures show the wearing that has taken place from the slide movement and on the chamber ramp for the bullet. Thank you for looking and I hope it goes to a nice home ;)"

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines specified to the model. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the rifle can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. Rifle can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools. This is in 9 mm Luger, and comes with one Glock 17rd."

It's only had about 100 rounds put through it, and has been otherwise well taken care of. It was purchased to be my CW, but i ended up not carrying.  

Included in the sale in addition to the firearm is the original Springfield hard case & kit which includes a holster, standard (13+1) & extended (16+1) capacity magazines, magazine rapid loader, and magazine holster. I will include at least 250 rounds (i most likely have more) of 9mm ammunition ranging from target rounds to high-end Hollow-points. Ammo has been properly stored and is 100% safe to use with any compatible firearm.

I paid $600 for just the gun a while back when everyone thought the government was cracking down on guns. I dont expect to get that $$ back.  I love the gun & honestly don't want to get rid of it so i will not be moving on price much, especially since I'm including the ammunition. If you are in the market for a springfield XD, you likely already know how awesome these are. I'm starting grad school in the fall and am in need of money which is the only reason for the sale. Gun is in fantastic condition.

For the retail price of the gun before tax, you get over $100 worth of ammo included, which is a pretty sweet deal.

$520 takes it all. Bill of sale will be signed at time of sale.

Would consider trade for Glock 30 Gen 4 SF or regular. Obviously, the Glock would have to be either new or like new with night sights or money would need to be added. May also consider a Gen 4 Glock 33 in same condition. Per HK, the specifics on the pistol are as follows:

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds."

has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended
range compared to a handgun. The superior
precision is also very useful against small or

bolt can be locked in the rear position by the

push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and
interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the
barrel upwards and back, the rifle can be reduced
to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage
and utilize the internal deployment lock which is
operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of

Additionally the chassis includes four Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rails, three ambidextrous sling mounts, a removable Kydex forend with a built in palm swell. Rigidity of the chassis increases accuracy and reliability and is achieved through the use of barrel tension adjustment screws. Precision machined receiver lug recesses also eliminate the need for additional bedding.""

I am the third owner. The second owner told me there where 500 rounds fired thru it and judging from the amount of wear I would say that that is a fair statement. I have owned this for almost a year and have shot it less than 50 times.

Up for trade is a beautiful ruger security six, 4"" heavy barrel stainless version. This revolver comes with the original Box, paperwork, hogue grip and the orginal factory wood grips. From what I can find it was made in 1980. It's in very good shape. I just picked this up in trade an figures I would see if I can find something else I was looking for before I decided to hang onto it. It was part of the personal collection of a local gun store owner. Trades are listed below.

Quality bolt rifle in 308, 30-06, possibly .270. No savage axis or ruger Americans please. Prefer wood stocks but will consider synthetic. Rifle must be in new or near new condition.

Manufacturer was United States Arms, originally in Riverhead, NY.  These were near-handmade items, and this one is in very good shape (excuse the random cat hairs in the picture - they really adhere to an oily surface!).  The trigger is very light, target-type trigger, and I understand they came that way from the factory.  It should make a very good deer pistol this fall.

heres a little info i got from keltec webpage....

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."
