The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.

And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.

An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.

It was released on July 2, of 2015 and is hard to find. Features:The takedown barrel is removed from the upper receiver by simply moving the slider bar towards the breech, rotating the barrel and pulling it free - no tools required. Installation is simpler yet - just slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact.MSR shooters that desire a larger cartridge will be excited to find that a replaceable barrel kit chambered in 300 AAC Blackout is available on ShopRuger.com. This range-ready barrel's headspace is set at the factory and comes complete with a metal flip-up elevation & windage adjustable front sight and two, 30-round metal magazines marked with ""300 AAC BLACKOUT"" to ensure easy differentiation.Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 lb. trigger pull. The Ruger Elite 452™ features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers.With front and rear folding iron sights, the SR-556® Takedown is ready to go to the range right out the box. The front sight is both elevation & windage adjustable, meaning that when you swap barrels, the zero stays with the barrel.The lower receiver is fitted with the Magpul® MOE grip and MOE SL collapsible buttstock on the mil-spec buffer tube. With a length of pull ranging between 11.1""-14.4"" the fit can be perfect for most any shooter.Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.Supplied with three Magpul PMAG® 30-round magazines (a lightweight 556 NATO magazine).Also includes a rugged, ballistic nylon case; three rail covers and lock."

The full-length, free float quad rail handguard keeps your hands cool and provides plenty of room for accessories. As an added touch, Radical Firearms has included the Sig Sauer Stabilizing Arm Brace!

  If you're looking at this ad, I assume you know the deal on the Saigas, but for general info, the Saigas are made in Russia, in the same factory as their military AK47, but come in a ""sporterized"" configuration to conform to import regulations. Once imported, they are often converted to legally accept regular, hi-capacity AK magazines of all types. Doing this is not expensive or very complicated.
  These are widely acknoweldged as being among the highest quality AK variants around, and are buit using brand-new,chrome lined barrels, no used,surplus parts whatsoever.
Also, last year the ""Administration"" banned any future imports of Russian made weapons, adversely affecting price and availabiltiy of these rifles. It is unlikely in the extreme that this ban is ever rescinded, so once they're gone......they're gone.
  I think I've fired the rifle only one time with some freinds a couple years ago, and we may have shot 4 whole boxes through it, surely no more than a hundred rounds. It is dead-nuts accurate, and flawlessly reliable.
I have at least 4 of the factory 10-round magazines for it (I may even have 5 total). 
  I had another Saiga that I converted a while back, but sold it, and kept this one unconverted intentionally, being that it's 10-rd capacity would hopefully keep it under the radar from any future hi-cap bans,which I think will be a possible benifit of rifles like these (and SKS's).
  These are curently selling in the $600+ range, if you can find any in-stock at all. SKS prices on the other hand, have been falling like a stone, with very clean Chinese versions running consistently at about $350 on the local used market ( and that's before even counter-offering), so you do the math. 
  As usual, prospective traders must be legal to own firearms, be a Georgia resident over age 18, and have valid ID to prove it (of course, I'll show my DL and carry permit,as well.)
The photo is one I just snatched off the interwebz, but my rifle is identical, you seen one, you seen 'em all.
I will also sell the rifle outright, but since I'm after an SKS, I thought I might do better shooting for a trade+cash.
Thanks for looking......."

Most modern silver dealers like MCM and Silvertowne are selling one-ounce rounds at about $17.50 in lots of 100 or less. That is a fair trade price against used value for most weapons.
Trying to get retail plus 10% and trade at 20% below market for silver is just plain stealing and those doing it are cheats and thieves. Dont like the terms, up yours you a-holes. Just remember, if you cant trust a pawnbroker to be honest who can you trust? lmao."

They do still offer a similar AR-10(T) rifle, with the main differences being the rifle is an A-series with a 20"" barrel.  I did manage to save the specs though before it disappeared from their site:
	• 7.62 NATO & .308
	• 7075-T6 Forged Flattop Receiver with Picatinny Rail and Forward Assist
	• 16"" Stainless Steel Match Barrel with an advertised 1 MOA accuracy

	• A2 Flash Hider
	• Aluminum round free-float handguard
	• Picatinny Gas Block (.398"" lower than receiver rail)
	• Forged Lower Receiver
	• A2 stock

I did not buy the rifle as a whole unit - I bought the complete upper receiver directly from Armalite last year but picked up the lower receiver used a few years ago.  I'm not sure what kind of life the lower receiver went through before I had it but it's performed flawlessly for me since I've had it (it does have a scuff at the bottom of the magazine well though).  The upper receiver has less than 500 rounds through it and is in perfect shape except for the tool marks that I so bone headedly inflicted on the barrel upon switching back to the factory flash hider from my muzzle brake.  The charging handle has been upgraded with a Badger Ordnance lever but the original lever is included in case it's not to your liking.

If you're not familiar with the Armalite AR-10s, they have two different series - this one is their B-series takes only Armalite steel magazines while their A-series will accept either their old waffle magazines or 308 PMAGs.  The receivers between the two series are NOT interchangeable.

I'm asking $1550, including two 20 round magazines and the Plano hard case Armalite ships their rifles in.  Cash offers only, please."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.Overall length: 6.26inSlide length: 6.06inLength between sights: 5.20inWeight (inc. empty mag) 17.95ozWidth: 1.02inSlide Width: .87inHeight: 4.25in"

The rifle operates and shoots decently well;  I have recently shot it.  The serial number is 24481, bolt number 704, and its chrysanthemum is ground off.  From the research I have done on this rifle based on its markings, it is a Toyo Kogyo series 30, which puts its date of manufacturer between mid 1941 and late 1942.  It is most definitely not a ""last ditch"" model Arisaka;  has the safety on its knurled bolt end and metal butt plate.  It does not have a bipod, the ""anti-aircraft wings"" on the sight, or the bolt dust cover. 

The wood of the stock is in relatively rough cosmetic shape.  Obviously in its history, a previous owner cut wood off the stock in an attempt to convert its appearance to a more modern rifle stock design, and obviously I know this seriously detracts from this guns value.  The bluing on the metal parts also has wear, but I have seen considerably worse.  The action is very smooth and everything functions perfectly.  I have seen a few near mint Arisaka rifles, but the vast majority of the ones I've seen are in similar condition(other than the chopped stock on this one).

This is a cool rifle, a fun one to shoot.  It was kind of an impulse buy.  Had I done my homework, I would have found that the 7.7x58 ammo is not found much of anywhere(though completely available via online order; I buy it from The Brass King out of MI).  Its relative rarity means ammo is expensive, @$40 per box of 20.  I don't reload so its just not economical for ME to shoot.  I'm including 14 rounds of ammo, $28 worth. I fired the other 6; that brass is also included.  For someone with a stock of 7.7x58 or who reloads, this is not an issue.  It is for me, hence this listing.

I went twice to a shooting range in the Park Ave Armory, which then got closed down because of poor ventilation.   Although I don't know much about guns, I know this pistol is in great condition because my friend who is a gun collector saw it and could not believe it had ever been fired.  He was laughing at me when I told him I didn't know how much was the right amount to clean it, so I just kept cleaning with a soft cloth until it seemed perfect. 

This gun comes with all the original paperwork, box, pamphlets and if you want, you can even have my receipt from 1995 to show provenance (does it work like artwork?)

In the end, NY city won taking away my ability to own a gun by making the license $350, which is too expensive  for me as I am an artist and jewelry designer, and business is not good now.  

So there you have it- a beautiful gun in perfect condition.   

Here is the thing- if I lived in a house instead of a NY city apartment, I would want a gun like this.  The long barrel makes it really easy to shoot straight.  Even not knowing about guns, when I went to the range it was easy to hit the target near the center even though I didn't know how.  Even if I were afraid and my hands were shaking, I think this long barrel would shoot pretty straight. 

Also, because it is so simple to use, there is no worry about the gun getting jammed.    Some bad, violent things have happened to me and if I were alone in a house and someone broke in, this is the gun I would want.  You should get one like this for yourself or your sweetheart.

The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS.

Dimensions:

Inside: 14.00"" H x 12.50"" W x 12.20"" D
Interior Cubic Feet: 1.24
Weight: 256 Pounds

Body:

The door is constructed with an overall thickness of 4"" with 2"" of outer and inner steel plates to deter burglary. The body of the AMSEC CSC1413 is made from a high density composite fire resistant material and measures 2"" in protective thickness. So, while this safe is small it is about as tough as they get.

Fire Resistance:

The CSC1413 has a 2 hour fire rating that can guarantee an internal temperature of 350F or less with external temperatures up to 1700F (an average house fire is around 1000F). Additionally, and quite a nice touch, is the intumescent seal on the door that will expand if there is a fire to further protect the interior of the safe from heat and potential fire damage.

Locking and Security:

This safe has a tempered glass relocking mechanism to prevent weak point drilling burglary attempts. The CSC1413 comes ready with an anchor hole and mounting equipment to prevent it being lifted out and reinforced heavy duty hinges to protect against forced entry."

The first one is a Type 38 training rifle.Its missing a butt plate screw and has some damage on the butt shown in the picture. Has really neat marking on the stock and receiver that I believe indicates the school or training facility that it was used. Since its a training rifle it has no serial number or rifling.

Second I believe is a type 99 ""short"" in 7.7. This is a late war with wood butt plate and non adjustable sights. This is a very clean example and looks unissed, but I could be mistaken. The bore has very strong rifling and is bright. The mum is still intact and I believe that's the Tokyo arsenal mark.

This rifle was manufactured in 2013 after Century changed management and began putting better quality in their rifles. The front sights are not canted and there are no sharp edges or excessive mag wobble. 

This rifle looks great and has not been fired by me. The bore and operating parts are very clean and show no signs of firing. The exterior is also very clean and shows very little wear. The factory handguards and stock were stained a nice red mahogany by me.

Also included is a Midwest Industries Railed Scope Mount that attaches to the factory side mount. This quick detach mount has a 6.75"" picatinny rail that sits above the dust cover, but does not touch it or affect the zero. The inside of the mount received a small Dremel mod in order to mount it to a Yugo N-Pap AK, but it is not noticeable and does not affect mounting to the WASR. The TAPCO AK-74 Style Muzzle Brake, factory slant brake, and 30 round magazine are also included."

Here is some info and what has been done:

The frame is from an unfired German P229. The serial number places its date of manufacture at 2006. So this part is NEW.

The folded carbon slide/barrel is from a Made in Germany P228. The serial number from it is a 2001, with approximately 100 rounds through it total, and has been a safe queen part (the frame was sold long ago, so had been an extra slide in the safe when I decided to take on the project). The guide rod and spring are like-new as well.

The 9mm locking block insert is NEW, just purchased. I replaced the .40 insert for it so that it could be properly converted to 9mm.

The aluminum grips are the older style OEM version. Very difficult to find. They have been used on a couple of range trips and are immaculate. They, too, are LNIB. Finding a pair in this condition typically sets one back $160.

Comes with 1 OEM P228 13-round magazine. Essentially there is no real difference in this version versus the last run coming out of Exeter in 2009, except maybe the price. Need to sell to fund an upcoming trip. Will come with owner's manual, lock and a red CPO box for transport.
Asking $650. Can send more pics of barrel and other parts if need be. It is all pristine.
Call or text REDACTED only if interested. Can meet virtually anywhere in the Twin Cities. Thanks."
