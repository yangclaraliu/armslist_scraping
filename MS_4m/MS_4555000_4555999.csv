A lot of high-end components were used in this build and researched thoroughly before used. I am a engineer and understand the importance of tolerances, torque values, and in general doing a job correctly.  All components were assembled to spec using the proper tools.  Here are some highlights of this rifle:

The barrel is a 1/7 twist as opposed to the more common 1/9 twist found on most commercial AR15 pattern rifles.  1/7 is the current military twist rate used in the M4 Carbine to shoot the 69gr XM855 rounds currently in service. The 1/7 twist rate is better for shooting these heaver .223/5.56 bullets (62-77gr).  Heavier bullets generally mean longer range, more energy, and greater accuracy.  While the barrel is not match grade (which is reflected by the price), it is better suited for shooting 77gr match ammunition (think Federal Gold Metal Match).  You can definitely still use the cheap-o ammo (Independence, Federal AE, Prvi, etc...), which is typically 55gr, but Tula and other Russian made ammunition MAY have issues with cycling the action from time to time. If you want to shoot varminting rounds, i.e sub 55gr bullets, I would avoid this rifle as it will over-stabilize those lighter bullets.  

This rifle features a mid-length gas system.  Compared with the carbine gas system typically found on most AR15 rifles, the mid-length gives the shooter a lighter recoil.  This combined with the Spike's muzzle break and ST-T2 Buffer almost entirely eliminate recoil on this rifle, making follow up shots much faster.  This is also the reason the ultra cheap, steel cased, typically Russian made ammo doesn't cycle reliably 100% of the time; but I wouldn't recommend shooting that stuff in ANY rifle.  If your bottom line is cost, and you are willing to sacrifice smooth shooting and accuracy then go buy an AK and go to town on that Russian stuff.

I am including the Troy Dioptic Aperture flip up sights (Originally $199 on Primary Arms). This is a very well trusted set of flip up sights.  The Dioptic aperture design is very interesting and you can read about them here: https://troyind.com/products/dioptic-folding-sight-blk

This also includes the AXTS Raptor ambidextrous charging handle that is all the rage right now.  While I like the handle a lot I don't see the justification for it's $89 price tag.  So if you're not into that kinda trendy stuff I'll replace it with a standard milspec charging handle and knock $50 off the price, but let me know beforehand if you're interested in that.

I'm selling the rifle with Troy flip up irons for $1200.  So I'm losing $250.27 on this, which is the equivalent of you getting 20% off a used rifle.  CASH ONLY, no paypal or other B.S. like that.  If you like the red dot/magnifier combo I'll throw that in for $200 (originally $297.86 from primary arms), otherwise I'll use it on my next build.  I've seen a few good deals here on armslist, but I've also seen a lot of people selling waay overpriced rifles that are not close to the quality of this one.  I'm selling because I want to fund a different build that would make this one a little redundant. Rifle comes with 2 Magpul PMags.  This rifle has approximately 500-800 rounds through it.

Thanks for reading.  Please contact me if you have any questions."

First and foremost this rifle is NOT a Noveske factory built rifle although in my opinion it looks as good or better than most. This rifle was built by myself with some work performed by my local gunsmith (cerakote and machine work on the muzzle device). Rifle is in excellent condition and functions flawlessly. The rifle has less than 150 rounds down the tube. 50 rounds of MK262 mod 1 and less than 100 rounds of Federal ball ammo. The rifle is incredibly accurate and has absolutely no recoil or muzzle rise.  Rifle is cerakoted a dark burnt bronze color.

II rifle that not only has never been cut down or refinished, but also has it's US Property markings.

Before I go any farther, let me state that the Ross rifle with the negative reputation is the later Ross Mk. III. The Ross Mk. II does not have the problem that the later Mk. III has in which you can re-assemble the bolt incorrectly. The Mk. II is a perfectly safe rifle, and is considered to be one of the strongest actions out there.

This is one of the Ross Mk. II rifles sold by Canada to the US Army for training purposes during the First World War. As such it's seen some use from garrison and training duties. The metal parts are aged with a brown patina, while the receiver and bolt still show some of the color case-hardening. The walnut stock is red with age. The bore is in good shape, with good rifling. The action works smoothly. Has a vintage Kerr NoBuckl sling installed. Comes with front sight hood.

Chambered in .303 British.

I've put a few mags through it, but I've recently bought another rifle I prefer a bit more, so I haven't shot this one much at all. I've kept it cleaned, but if I'm not shooting it I'd rather see it go to someone who can use it, rather than collect dust in my safe.

The rifle would come with the TAPCO magazine that shipped with it, as well as 3 Yugo steel mags."

THIS IS A PACKAGE DEAL ONLY. I WILL NOT SELL THE STREAMLIGHT SEPARATE SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK.

The only thing I may consider is keeping the Streamlight myself and selling everything else.

These Glock are very, very difficult to come by and they are no longer made or ever will make anymore. Gun broker has them going for $679.99+ tax stock with two mags

My price for everything is $900 or best over. That’s including the $130 Streetlight and 6 extra mags that are easily $35 a piece. You’re welcome to do the math.

This rifle was purchased from Classic Firearms for $214 (with shipping) recently, crate was $234 from AIM Surplus. These rifles have dried up on Internet websites and are down to private sales now. This rifle would make a great shooter or refinish project. Plenty of rifling and left and no counter bore. Comes with a bayonet and ammo holder.

The P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. 

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. 

With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.
