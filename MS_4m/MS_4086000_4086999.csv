I am asking 350 for it since the lower quality wolf/tula are selling for 275 or more when you can find them and THIS is NOT AVAILABLE anymore.  Look for it for sale even online!

In response to the person who posted the tula from CTD it is over 275 shipped to your door for much lower quality ammo.  Golden Tiger is better than the other offerings in many ways. 
1) It has a higher velocity by over 100 FPS
2) It has a boat tail for better accuracy and distance shooting
3) It has sealed primers and projectiles for a round that does not have issues with moisture and storage over time similar to mil spec ammo.
4) The ammo also has a much more consistent powder charge.
5)  One addition feature is a there is an air pocket built into the nose of the bullet which causing tumbling once entering target and will do far more damage which is good for hunting or self defense.

Again if you feel that Tula, Wolf, Bear ect are good enough for you do not spend the extra cash for better quality but do not pretend that these are exact equivalents!"

Constructed of 100% stainless steel and 360 degree circumferentially welded the Turbodyne produces less noise than a .22LR. The bullet impact can be heard and is the primary source of sound while the lack of concussion allows for hours of comfortable shooting.

The Turbodyne X can be fitted to most semi-auto and bolt action .50 BMG rifles, mounting directly to the current muzzle break threads without modification to the gun.

Here are a few things about this rifle from the manufacturer:

""Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Its re-engineered muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make the 82A1 comfortable and, dare we say, exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it is transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

This rifle actually will fit in the case fully assembled, which is a nice advantage. No need to mess with assembly while out in the field. Also, the chrome-lined barrel will make it easier to clean."

This is a great rifle for long range shooting. The .300 Remington Ultra Mag round is very powerful with a super flat trajectory. .300 RUM ammo is available in multiple power levels and a variety of bullet weights which makes it equal to shooting a .308, a .300 win mag or a full powered .300 RUM, so it's like having three rifles in one. This rifle has had less than 50 rounds fired through it. The scope is included along with a rolling hard case and about 50 rounds of ammo. I do not have the original stock. It's a fantastic rifle but I have a wedding to pay for. The rifle is worth double what I'm asking for it and I'm not looking for a firearm to trade, but i will take 9mm ball 115 gr. and/or .223 55 gr. ball brass case ammo of a quality brand."

This is factory sealed new production mil-spec. 62gr M855 'Penetrator' ammo. from Federal. XM855LC1 AC1 meaning Lake City brass, 1st quality level - meaning this is NOT the ""Not for military/duty use"" quality control overruns. The can is marked SMQ13H####### indicating I believe August 2013 production. 420 RD CAN

Factory seal is intact and can shows no signs of storage wear or dents/dings. If you're looking for this here, it is assumed you understand why the market has shifted so drastically for this item. Nonetheless I suggest buyers educate themselves as to the current market (via gunbroker, ammoseek, etc.) conditions specific to this item. Rather than explain it here and stir anyone up further.

Can is ORM-D marked, and I believe shipping can be arranged for through UPS Ground, with additional hazmat fees - out of area buyer to pay actual shipping cost.

""Local"" buyers, I will meet you for face to face transfer.

Important note: This is 5.56x45mm NATO mil spec ammunition, this is not loaded to .223 spec which uses lower pressures, different primers, and may not function in your rifle without causing damage/harm to yourself or others. If you don't understand this, educate yourself.

I am selling the entire can for $299, which comes out around .70 cents per round - meaning the mag loader, stripper clips, and ammo can are included in the per round cost.

If you need a smaller quantity and simply cannot find anyone else, I will break it out in lots of 100rds at $75. (to include the clips and their packing boxes)

Personally I think everyone should try fishing, it's cheaper and can be just as enjoyable, but I understand from a buddy in Florida that some people are still paying $2/rd for this ammo - figure I'd rather see someone enjoy it than continue to store it.

You are welcome to email - I'm happy to call or text if you include a contact number.

Thanks and stay safe."

This is a low serial number gun that was most likely caught in customs when the 1990 ban was enacted and restamped from an 84s to a Mak 90 to meet import requirements. Serial # is 9005xx where the 90 part was added to indicate the import year. This Mak 90 DOES NOT appear to have been defanged. It has the 'fangs' on the bottom of the front sight block and the original threaded barrel with original flash hider. Virtually all Mak90's have had their barrels turned down or welded to remove the threads and had the fangs/bayonet lug ground off. As you can see this has original threads and the fangs/cleaning rod still intact. A very few Mak 90's early in the import ban process got through customs without being defanged. This appears to be one. 

For those not familiar with the Mak 90 they are Chinese AK's manufactured in a regular Chinese military arsenal for export. They are not like the crap AK's you can buy in stores today. They have chromed bolts and chromed barrels and are much heavier built and more durable than the versions imported today from non-military arsenal manufacturers.

This Mak 90 has one original Chinese steel magazine which feeds perfectly. It has a square cut, stamped 1.5mm receiver, and all numbers match. Side-folding poly stock, 4 way picatinny rail foregrip, Hogue ergo pistol grip, and 'grippod' front grip with spring loaded bipod.

Everything works as if new, and is in like-new condition.  The scope is clear and high-quality.  The HPA Sports muzzle brake serves no purpose other than it looks cool and it protects the crown. It does NOT silence the report in any way.  The gun has never been dropped, mishandled, jammed, or had any issues. I have probably only put between 5 to 10 CO2 cartridges through it.  It produces 30 - 50 high power shots per cartridge (depending on temperature), before the POI starts to drop (when shooting at 25 yards or more).  I have found it to be very accurate up to 35 yards.  This is a smooth shooting gun with no recoil.

Its a browning X-Bolt varmint special in 22-250. Very limited run on this rifle in 22-250.  I do know this rifle is built and put together very well. As closed to a custom build as you can get with out going full custom. Detail to build is top notch. Its hand chambered with a target crown. Barrel is button rifled and triple checked for quality and it shows by the way the rifle shoots. Its a 26in med heavy barrel. The action is glassed bedded from the factory and barrel is free floated. Trigger is adjustable breaks like glass and is just a top notch trigger. The 60 degree bolt throw is just awesome makes for quick follow up shots if its needed. But i doubt  you will need one because this rifle will flat drive tacks. The custom made laminated stock is designed for hair splitting accuracy from the bench off a bi-pod or off hand shooting. Hunting coyotes punching paper or take it to a prairie dog town. short range or long range this rifle will do it all and impress ya while its doing it. Its a very comfortable stock while shooting. solid cheek weld every time. No searching for cheek placement its there every time you go to shoot. I have shot prone,off the bench,and off of pole cat bi-pod with no problems just to make sure everything felt good if a shot ever presented its self from any position.  This rifle has very low round count i bought it new about 9 months ago. has maybe 35-40 rounds threw it. Has a few safe dings in the stock but nothing i would call major. bore is excellent. Rifle will shoot sub MOA at 200 yards. i have shot 1/2-3/4 inch group at 200 yards with 55gr silver ballistic tip ammo. with a good load development worked up on the rifle im sure it will shoot even better. I bought the rifle for mainly coyote hunting but only went a couple times do to work.  Plus i got a few irons in the fire i got to fund so my loss is your gain. You will not be disappointed in this rifle one bit. Im not and im very picky on how a rifle preforms. Heres what im asking rifle with scope rings for the X-bolt 850.00 OBO the scope on top is a zeiss HD5 lockable target turrets with the varmint ret. Excellent glass very clear spot on adjustments. has the zero stop feature. its a 5-25x50 just a high quality. Built like a tank way better scope the the zeiss conquest. Not even in the same league as the conquest. I would do 1700.00 OBO for the rifle with scope ready to shoot. Or would sale the scope separate for 900.00 OBO i bought the scope new and its got a life time warranty as well.  I belive i still got the factory boxes for both rifle and scope. I need to sale as quick as i can so if ya have any questions please ask and i will get them answered thanks. give me a call or text for any info REDACTED im located in Eldorado


Heres some information i found  on the rifle. just in case i forgot something.

The X-Bolt Varmint Special pushes the concept of function driven design with extreme style. The specially designed wood Laminate stock is crafted by Altamont Paladin, a renowned designer and manufacturer of firearms stocks and grips. This stock, designed to be fired from the prone or bench, is crafted to provide a comfortable firing position for the shooter, reducing fatigue and increasing stability. The ""hook"" on the bottom of the butt allows for an isometric grip with the non-firing hand and can be used in conjunction with a ""rabbit ear"" style sandbag.
The ergonomic features of the grip angle, thumb hole stock and cheek rest, are purposed to promote a proper grip that won't shift when firing, and allow excellent alignment with your optic. The vented free float fore arm promotes uniform barrel cooling for minimal Point of Impact shift as more rounds are fired in quick succession.The Paladin stock is designed for advanced varmint shooting. Special attention has been placed on eliminating any weakness that could possibly compromise flexural strength - the end result being a stock that is a superbly accurate platform for shooting from the bench or prone supported positions as well as from the off-hand. Each stock is hand finished, fitted and bedded to each action individually. The resin impregnated wood Laminate is sealed to make it impervious to moisture and temperature affects that can cause warping effects that change Point of Impact and barrel harmonics.The vented free float fore arm promotes uniform barrel cooling for minimal Point of Impact shift as more rounds are fired in quick succession.
• Custom grade Altamont Palidan wood Laminate stock designed for accuracy from the bench, off a bipod and off hand.
• Butt stock hook for isometric grip or use with a sandbag helps to provide steady aim.
• Pistol grip features sharp checkering to reduce movement of the firing hand while squeezing the trigger - the right hand palm swell and ergonomically angled grip promote proper trigger squeeze and a comfortable firing position.
• Thumbhole Stock with raised cheek piece maximizes the surface available for a firm cheek to stock ""weld"" in different positions - standing, kneeling, sitting and prone.
• Forearm vents are designed to add style while uniformly cooling the barrel - vital to accurate sustained fire.
• Angled fore end palm rest is designed to position your non-firing hand in a comfortable position during off hand shooting
• Heavy barrel causes the rifle to lay in the rest or on a bi-pod with much more stability, also controls barrel whip, vibration, recoil and barrel heating/cooling, further enhancing accuracy.
• Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
• Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
• The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
• Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
• Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
• Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
• 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
•Detachable rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
•Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
• Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

The upper is in fantastic shape. There are no scrapes or blemishes, the barrel is clean and shiny with only 250 rounds through it. This upper was very well maintained and it shows! This upper is made of the following parts:

-Rainier Arms Nickle Boron Match Grade BCG

-Rainier Arms Ultra Match 223 Wylde 20 inch Stainless Barrel

-Rainer Arms Ultra Match Billet Upper

-Hogue Overmold Rifle Length Handguard

-Wilson Combat Rifle Length gas tube and hardware/springs




There is some very slight pitting around the exhaust ports on the muzzle brake. I have done my best to try and photograph, however it is hard to see. This is the only blemish I have found on this upper.
This upper was built as a high end target gun, however being in NY I can no longer take it out in public to shoot (big scary threaded barrel!). I have other toys to play with so this can go to somebody who will get some use out of it. This setup is much more accurate then I am. With 77gr SMK, I was shooting 1/2 groups at 100yds. Obviously this setup is capable of shooting far beyond that.


I am willing to do a full or partial trade for some other firearms. Specifically I am looking for:

New style Ithaca 1911

Smith and Wesson 57 or 657 with 6"" barrel 41 mag

Possibly other interesting guns. Anything must be in tip-top shape.

A friend of mine was in his store the other day when the dealer was raising the prices on his AR'S by $100. He was telling everyone that all 223's were going to be banned and you better get your AR now before they go up.

First of all, only the Green tip 61gr 5.56 is the only ammo being considered to be banned.
And if you think about it, even if all the 223 ammo was going to be banned, why would you want to buy a rifle when you couldn't get the ammo?

It's people like this dealer that started the ammo panic and drove prices up, just so they can profit by it. Anyone that is paying overinflated prices on an AR is a fool. Just go to any Academy and look on their shelves. There are currently over 2300 of them for sale on Gunbroker . People like this dealer- Trust them as far as you can throw them."

Here's the story with this rifle, the receiver was made by rock island but when rock island closed down after ww1, they sent their left over receivers back to Springfield to be numbered, heat treated, and made into complete rifles. They finished these rifles in 1928. Factoring in this info according to serial # and other production databases, I believe this rifle to be all original. Good bore and rifling, shoots great.

This is a 4"" gun that was going to be used for matched shooting. The shooter that traded it in just do not ever use it. He had trigger, hammer work done to it. This comes with a small bag about 30 new brass in it for the .460 rowland. He said this would still shoot the 45 ACP and comes with moon clips, moon loader, and un-loader. 

Once I get back to the shop Monday I will get more pic. of the pistol and what comes with it. I will also get a count on the new brass that comes with it.

Just picked this up this week.  I placed a nonrefundable deposit on it several weeks ago, but I recently purchased a LC9S Pro 9mm after it was just released (hallelujah no safety or mag disconnect!) -- so I am not really in need of this .380 now.  This little gun is awesome, but it would likely just end up collecting dust in the safe, so I would rather just sell it to someone who will actually shoot and carry it.

They are selling for $399 at Gander Mountain and Cabelas.  I paid about $360 total through my dealer.  

I am asking $290; open to other offers too.  It has never been fired, never chambered a round, mag has never been loaded.  I actually don't even own any .380 ammo at the moment.

Also included is a brand new nylon/rubber-backed pocket holster.

Original owner, bought new in 2013 (it's a 2014 model), used for 3 months of practice then winter came. *This bow was made with the now unavailable Dymondwood.*

Up for sale is my 55 pound draw right-hand recurve bow. The string has good life left in it and also has two fur string silencers the new owner could move to the next string when replaced (held by twist in string). The bow also has two pre drilled threaded holes (factory) for a Bear brand bow quiver. I am selling because I've recently become interested in shelf-less bows and moving my resources to the ""horse bow"" style bows, this would just sit around and not be used. These run about $380 new.

This rifle was built at the Zastava Arms factory in Yugoslavia and imported by C.A.I. Georgia, VT. It has a gas piston shut-off system with grenade launcher sight package for shooting grenades with blank cartridges. The gun will not fire in semi-automatic mode when the grenade launcher sight has been raised and engaged. Blanks will fire only one round at a time in this configuration after the gas piston port has been turned off to raise the sight. This rifle is a piston driven 10-shot, stripper clip fed attached magazine type weapon but can be converted easily to 30 - round detachable magazines. It has a full size wooden stock with a rubber butt pad installed. It is a numbers matching rifle with the magazine, receiver, bolt face, & stock all stamped the same. It has a 50"" hard plastic Hoppes Protecto case with egg shell foam lining with 4 latches to hold the case shut to store the weapon in. I have owned the gun for about 10 years now and it has been shot very little in that time. I am not looking to make any trades for this weapon and would only take cash offers for this weapon at this time. I have dropped the price by $50.00 dollars as of 03/12/2015."
