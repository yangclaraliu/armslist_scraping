The only difference between the compact and mid size is the length of the grip. Mid size hold 10 round mags and compact holds 7/8 round mags. With the x grip extenders on the 10 round mags it gives you a full grip length just the same as a mid size. So you are getting the best of both worlds with this setup. 7/8 rounders for easier concealment or 10 rounders for range/house.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request for an additional $20.00 Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc. Thank you for viewing!"

The Chest Armor are measured 10""x12"" and are 1/4"" in thickness they are $80 per each plate. The Side Armor are measured 6""x8"" they measure 1/4"" in thickness. The Side Armor = $20.00 each!

Front/Back/Side Vest with complete Set of Plates = $300
(If you purchase 3 sets or more a discount will be offered)

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request for an additional $20.00 Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc. Thank you for viewing!"

Wylde chamber info:
 .223 Wylde is a hybrid .223/5.56 chamber designed by Bill Wylde to yield the accuracy advantages of the match .223 Remington commercial chambering but without pressure or reliability failures when using high velocity 5.56 NATO spec ammunition. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56 but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same."

There usually aren't too many for sale around Knox anymore, so if you want more pricing comparison, please check out the Dan Wesson's in United States section on Armslist and I think you'll find this gun and related items to be priced very fair for the brand, size, and quality. I also have a box of shells for buyer. Cash only. Please, no trades!"

Our Pro-Billet series strut spacer lift kits are precision engineered from 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum, then anodized for a superior finish. Billet aluminum is a great material for use in suspension applications as it has an immensely high strength to weight ratio along with a superior level of corrosion resistance compared to many other metals on the market. Unlike steel kits that are cut-out and welded together, our Pro-Billet kits are machined from a solid piece and will not bend or warp under even the most stressful conditions. Our Pro-Billet Series rear lift kits are precision engineered to lift and level your truck. The rear lift blocks are machined from 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum, then an anodized coating is applied to protect from rusting. Unlike steel blocks that are cut-out and welded together, our Pro-Billet kits are machined as a solid piece and will not bend or warp when under high stress loads. We complete this kit with high grade hardware and extended OEM spec zinc plated U-bolts. Our Differential Drop Kit is highly recommended for 4WD model trucks with independent front suspension. This kit will lower your front differential and reduce the excess wear on CV joints and axles by correcting the driveline angle changes caused by lifting the front of your truck. Machined from billet aluminum, these spacers will never compress, making sure your diff stays put and always in the right location. This is a perfect complement for trucks with lift kits from any of our product lines, as well as vehicles with pre-existing coil spring spacer lift kits installed. With our skid plate spacer kit, you can forget about any problems with contact being made between the plate and any of your new or modified suspension components. These are machined from the same material stock as our Pro-Billet series of products so you know theyﾒre strong, designed to take a beating along with your skid plate to help protect your vital components. These skid plate spacers will never compress, crack, deform or break, and provide you with the extra clearance you need."

The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection. Gun Weight: 6.5 lbs"

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location.Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel.Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:Manual thumb safetyGrip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firingFiring pin blockEach UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted.

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.Magazine Capacity14Magazine TypeDouble StackWeight1.750 lbsOverall Length7.200 inBarrel Length3.800 inHeight5.030 inWidth1.380 inFrameAluminum (7075 T6)GripRubberBarrelCold Hammer ForgedReceiver FinishBlack PolycoatTrigger MechDA/SASightsFixedSafetyDecocking LeverSafety Stop on HammerFiring Pin Block Safety"

Also included as a bonus is a stainless steel BT guide rod (not installed), which adds a little extra weight to the muzzle to further reduce the minimal muzzle flip this pistol has.

For those not familiar with the M9-A1, here are some facts and some comparisons with the ""Other Austrian Pistol"", the Glock 19:  The Steyr has a similar grip angle, but a smaller diameter and much more ergomonic grip shape. The Steyr has a 4mm lower bore axis, for less muzzle flip and less perceived recoil. The Steyr has a steel frame incorporating longer frame rails and the trigger / sear mechanism (very solid and precise).  This steel frame fits into the polymer grip as a module.  The glock uses its polymer grip as a frame to locate & hold the trigger mechanism, and the shorter frame rails are molded into the polymer grip. The Steyr uses unique fast acquisition trapezoidal / triangle combat sights which are made of steel (easily replaced if you prefer standard rectangular or night sights).  The glock has plastic sights. The Steyr has a shorter trigger pull, with a quicker reset. The Steyr has a two round greater standard magazine capacity (17 rds versus 15). The Steyr has a built-in keyed trigger lock as an additional safety feature. The Steyr was initially designed for the .40 S&W, and then adapted for the less powerful 9mm.  The Steyr's barrel  has a fully supported chamber, and standard rifling to allow use of non-jacketed bullets, while the glock's chamber is not fully supported, and their rifling requires jacketed bullets.  
My price for everything listed is $525.  I prefer to sell, but would consider trades for other firearms, specifically for a full-size 9MM pistol such as a stainless steel 1911, Browning Hi-Power, CZ 75 or SP-01, Canik clones, etc. +/- cash.  I will also consider other (mostly ""tactical"" type) firearms, but generally not hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, or antiques.  I am not desperate to sell.  Thank you."

With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down. For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made. As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Ordinary great-shooting handgun from yesteryear exemplifying American craftsmanship. Comes with never-used one-off factory prototype 6-inch threaded barrel with thread protector shroud. 

If you're into High Standard handguns, you already know these things are as solid as can be. No stamped metal in these babies - it's all solid, machined steel.  The slide feels like it's on ball bearings. Striker fire is much more dependable than cheap firing pins in modern semi-autos. This thing's a beast. 

Also comes with xtra 10 round mag (for a total of 2 mags), and all paperwork that came from factory is in box. 10/10 condition (no fingerprints, no rust, no marks, no wear - bluing is perfect - except for the areas on the spare 6"" prototype threaded barrel where secondary machining was done; they left the metal bare naked where the threads were cut on the front of the barrel and where the front sight was modified; the thread protector also has yet to be blued). 1 picture limit sucks; this firearm is perfect inside & out! Threaded long barrel prototype is totally bizarre - I've never seen another one like it in all my years of collecting H/S handguns. Together they are one-of-a-kind. This barrel (unsure of thread size - I have many more pics available) is ready for suppressor and/or muzzle brake.

It would make a great safe queen or a great plinker. The handgun with 4 1/2"" barrel was standard production run; should should perfectly first time out of the box, but the 6"" barrel was obviously a work in progress. I cannot vouch for it since it has never been attached to the handgun and had a round fired through it.  Its value as a collector's item is certainly much more than its value as a 6"" barrel. 

I don't know why I'm selling this thing. It just keeps calling out to me from the closet to ""take me to the range"" and I'm afraid one day I'm gonna do it. Get it away from me before I take it to the range and it's not new-in-the-box any more!"

This is premium, state of the art law enforcement grade ammo, bonded for superior barrier penetration without shedding the jacket.  Accuracy is outstanding. This ammo is extremely hard to find in small quantities, I had to buy a whole case to get it, thus the reason for this sale. This is Q4392, which is Winchester's government contract designation for RA9B.  This batch is from the overrun from a recent government contract order. 


From Winchester's site.
""Ranger® Bonded handgun ammunition was specifically created to deliver maximum penetration through the toughest of barriers. This effectiveness is made possible thanks to the Winchester proprietary core/jacket bonding process—and is enhanced with a special hollow point cavity that acts in unison to control expansion, leading to maximum weight retention and deep penetration through hard and abrasive barriers including auto glass.

After 30-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down. For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made. As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot. *************contact me if you're interested"

I’m the original owner and I bought it on 06/20/2015, but it just doesn’t fit my hand the way I need it to (arthritis problems).

It has only 13 rounds fired through it (to verify function of gun and each magazine). As expected of Glock pistols, it performed flawlessly.  Otherwise, it's brand new and has never been carried so it has no wear marks or scratches.

It’s small and light, ideal for concealed carry.  You’ll especially like the Glock trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and very accurate.

This gun comes in its original factory box with all paperwork and all other items from the factory including unopened test fire envelope (dated 06/05/2015), speed-loader, both factory mags (one with pinkie extension and one with the original flat baseplate), childproof lock w/two keys, plus the Glock cleaning brush & rod.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit.

Cash only please so I can buy something else to fit my hand.  Price is firm and I’m not looking for a trade or low-ball offers.

If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Thanks!"

After 30-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down. For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made. As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot. *************"

I'm selling my Waffen Werks built VZ. This was the same company (along with TGI) to build Czechpoint guns before they took operations in house. Interestingly, Czechpoint is still using receiver blanks that were imported by Waffen Werks! This gun is built on a D Technik receiver and a D Technik kit. It features the original issue, cold hammer forged chrome lined barrel, and patented push down plate on the carrier. A few very nice features on this rifle, it has the bayonet lug and muzzle brake! Features many of the early builds did not have. Like all VZ rifles, it features a last round bolt hold open and milled receiver. They come in a full pound lighter than a stamped AK! It operates via a short stroke gas piston and fires via striker. It is also done in a finish that is a closer representation of the original. This rifle is and was very innovative for the time, and is considered a gold standard for auto loading simi auto 7.62x39 rifles! As always with used guns, there are light handling marks around the knob on the carrier and a few other spots. The barrel is bright and shiny with very strong rifling. The lower handguard on the bever barf has also been fitted with a Chris Stone heat shield. You will also receive a original issue bayonet and scabbard, sling, instructional DVD, cleaning kit, and two 922 compliant magazines. Have questions, please ask!"
