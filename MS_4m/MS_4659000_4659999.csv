""NOVA H2O PUMP TACTICAL 12 Gauge, 18.5 in. Barrel with Standard Stock

""Special purpose"" means different things to different Benelli users. Personal security afloat requires a special shotgun — the Benelli Nova H2O. The Nova's largely polymer exterior makes a corrosion-resistant start, and the special metal treatment of the H2O version completes the puzzle. The barrel, magazine tube, magazine cap, trigger group and all other inner metal parts are nickel-plated to survive the wettest, saltiest environments. The heavy molded-in grooving of the pistol grip and fore-end mean your grasp will be secure, regardless the sea state, and unlike wood, polymer won't swell when wet. The Nova can swallow just about any ammunition you can feed it: shot, slugs, rubber ball loads or pyrotechnics. Whatever the challenge you face on open water, the Nova H2O will be ready for action.
With a chrome-plated rotary bolt head and a matte nickel-finished bolt body, the Nova H2O is ready to take on the harshest weather and keep on firing.
The barrel, magazine tube, magazine cap, trigger group and all other inner metal parts are nickel-plated on the Nova H2O to survive the wettest, saltiest environments.""

Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else. The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, (9+1 of .40SW) with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®. If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

Designed both by and for undercover LEO agents, the STI Shadow is a compact aluminum framed pistol with everything anyone needs in a backup pistol.

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable. Comes with a quality IWB holster and two set of grips, one set original to the pistol.

The classic slide is 3.0"" in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot Heinie straight 8 tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system. All external features are KG coated black."

Though it is a New Model, with transfer bar safety after 1972, it does not have the horrid liability warning on the left side of the barrel; they started that in 1981 or so.  It has a 5 1/2-inch barrel and, since it has a hooked grip frame, could have been an original 7 1/2-inch.  It looks to be shortened and beautifully recrowned.  The finish has some slight scuffing on the cylinder and shows a bit of muzzle finish wear.  Otherwise, the bore and chambers are spotless and shiny.  Like a typical Ruger single-action, it is tough and accurate, and will make a perfect hunting or woods companion!  Due to file size limitation,  I was limited on photos; I have several more."

Can't say exactly how many rounds I've put through it but it is about 1000 rounds. Very accurate with Primary Arms 1-4x Scope. I've cleaned it with diligence so it is LNIB. I want to get a different AR-15 and can't justify having two sitting in the safe. This is a fantastic rifle if you want your first AR-15 from a brand you trust, or if you want a spare reliable accurate rifle, if you want a cheap gun that you can leave in the back of your truck or in your cabin, if you want a black rifle before the next AWB this is a great fit for you. This comes with a 10 round P-Mag. When I bought this rifle new it was $720, the furniture cost me $30, the scope is nearly brand new, got it last month(August) for $120, and the Mount was $50 which is very nice machined aluminum holds zero very well. This rifle would cost you $890 to assemble today but because it's used I want to give you a fair price. Please ask me for any additional pictures or info. I have a OD Green magpul STR stock, OD Green MOE pistol Grip, MOE rail attachments, and MOE VFG available if you want."

FROM THE TAURUS WEBSITE:
This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going. Also comes with (3) back straps and magazine loader..

The Lee–Enfield bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle was the main firearm used by the military forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.
Rifle No. 4[edit]

Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I

Canadian rifleman during Battle of Ortona, December 1943
By the late 1930s the need for new rifles grew and the Rifle, No. 4 Mk I was first issued in 1939 but not officially adopted until 1941.[31] The No. 4 action was similar to the Mk VI, but lighter, stronger, and most importantly, easier to mass-produce.[32] Unlike the SMLE, the No 4 Lee–Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. The No. 4 rifle was heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel and a new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a spike bayonet, which was essentially a steel rod with a sharp point and was nicknamed ""pigsticker"" by soldiers.[32] Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed, originally intended for use with the Sten gun—but sharing the same mount as the No. 4's spike bayonet—and subsequently the No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets were issued for use with the No. 4 rifle as well.[33]

During the course of the Second World War, the No. 4 rifle was further simplified for mass-production with the creation of the No. 4 Mk I* in 1942, with the bolt release catch replaced by a simpler notch on the bolt track of the rifle's receiver.[34] It was produced only in North America, by Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the USA.[34] The No.4 Mk I rifle was primarily produced in the United Kingdom.[35]"

Of course a collector might not want to use it as its in that nice of condition.  I believe Browning quit making this model in 1998.

Browning A-5 Light Twenty with the Invector Plus Choke system and vented rib barrel.  Comes with three chokes and the tool.  You can also easily adjust this shotgun for light or heavy loads depending where you put the ""Friction Ring"".  Very simple and the instruction manual has pictures.

I've looked this shotgun over trying to find flaws and it is near impossible.  The blueing is flawless, cant find a chip or speck or scratch.  The stocks are near perfect, showing a couple very light handling marks.  They won't show up in pictures.

The bolt and loading port don't even have use marks.  This was someone's baby and didn't get used much if at all.  It even had the sticker on the end that I removed and put on the invector choke manual because I didn't like the look of a sticker on such bright and shiny blueing.  Gun looks way better in person.  

It has the 28"" barrel and weights right at 7 pounds.  I have the 34th edition Blue Book of guns and this at $1225 in 98%, $975 at 95% and $900 at 90%.  I'm no expert, but the BB I have shows example pictures of their grading on guns and just happen to have an A-5 as their pic for a 95% gun.  This one is definitely nicer than their pic and explanation. I won't ask the suggested price of 98% even though it is that nice.  I can take pictures of any part of the shotgun.  Closeups, whatever is wanted.

$950.  Inspection is encouraged as I would hope anyone buying this nice of Browning would be as picky as I would.

New Pirelli Scorpion tires, chain, and sprockets.
Team 2 Racing changed the brake pads, replaced all fork internals, adjusted the valves, and changed oil. After a season or two the gasket may be changed. The bike just sits because I have two Harleys I'm trying to justify having. The bike never fails to start and run great as I expect all my bikes to do. It is always tethered to a trickle charger to preserve the battery. I may also throw in the charger and KTM lift stand if I decide to.
This bike has plenty of power and easily pulls wheelies through the gears. A blast to ride, but can get you into trouble. Those are my words-of-wisdom. And therefore only serious buyers will be able to test ride it.

The triggers are smooth, bolts move freely, sights are straight and wood is very nice.
