Newly released in 2014, the 715 is as it was before -- designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6"" barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357's recoil very well. 

The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715. 

Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers. 

The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715. 

While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy above other revolvers, it's the consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design."

LaserMax' innovative laser sight, designed for the most popular semi-automatics, simply replaces your recoil spring guide assembly. It includes a customized take-down lever which performs its original function, as well as serving as the laser's on/off switch. This easy fingertip activation allows for a natural point-and-shoot motion, assuring that LaserMax is ready whenever you are. Once installed, LaserMax adds less than one-quarter ounce of weight. But it adds a great deal when it comes to aiming accuracy and confidence. The Only NATO Approved Internal Laser Sight.

LaserMax' innovative laser sight, designed for the most popular semi-automatics, simply replaces your recoil spring guide assembly. It includes a customized take-down lever which performs its original function, as well as serving as the laser's on/off switch. This easy fingertip activation allows for a natural point-and-shoot motion, assuring that LaserMax is ready whenever you are. Once installed, LaserMax adds less than one-quarter ounce of weight. But it adds a great deal when it comes to aiming accuracy and confidence. The Only NATO Approved Internal Laser Sight.

*Totally internal-cannot be knocked out of alignment 
*No permanent modification to gun-remove it anytime 
*No need to change holster or give up your rail flashlight 
*Compatible with your favorite grips and aftermarket accessories 
*Drops into place, replaces original recoil spring guide 
*Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever 
*Deliberate on/off activation-no squeezing the grip, no shaking 
*Pulsating beam for increased visibility 
*Factory aligned (1911 models are also user adjustable for fine tuning) 
*Quality assurance includes live test firing

Been in the family since new, and I know the history. This pistol has not been shot much, at all. I would be surprised if it had 100 round through it, ever.

This is a Single/Double Action, with a decocker. You can safely leave a round in the chamber, and have the gun decocked.The first trigger pull will cock and shoot, double action. It is regular Single action after that. Or if you do not decock it, it is single action all the time. This just has that extra option.

This is a nice full size metal frame pistol. It shoots straight, and I have never seen it jam or have any issues, it is in great shape."

Stevens 12 gauge shotgun with pistol grip-- $175
Less than 50 rounds through it. Holds 5 in the magazine +1 in the chamber. have some cleaning attachments with it and a soft case. 

1931 Mosin Nagant (HEX Bolt)---$275 
Very good condition. ALL matching serial numbers comes with original cleaning kit and bayonet. Rifle shoots very well, very accurate. This is the rare HEX bolt that is said to be more reliable than the original bolts. comes with a soft case but the case is very good, well padded, pouches. Also comes with 15 boxes of ammo. Each box has 20 rounds for a total of 300 rounds. 

If you are looking for the whole lot ill part ways for $650. All prices are negotiable. If you have a good condition AR platform very willing to trade (must be chambered in 5.56 NATO). If good trade will throw cash on top. Considering everything, each gun comes with its own case, 2 come with ammo, and they were always cleaned and taken care of after every shoot.

This frame is stippled, has slight grip reduction, double trigger guard under cut and mag release scallop cut. Internals are polished, but I can swap trigger groups if you don't like that. It really is the ultimate ""fighting pistol"" with these mods and the gun is so much more comfortable and easy to shoot.

VIPER HS 4-16X50 LR RIFLESCOPE
Want to extend your effective shooting range at distances where bullet drop and wind drift become critical? Take a look at the Viper HS LR riflescope. The LR stands for long range — and we mean it. This riflescope features an exposed target-style elevation turret built for dialing elevation at extended ranges. The capped windage turret maintains the scope’s sleek lines and prevent it from hanging up on clothing, rifle cases or pack scabbards.
Viper HS LR riflescopes feature an advanced optical system highlighted with a 4x zoom range for magnification versatility. A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily. Built on an ultra-strong 30mm one-piece machined aluminum tube for increased windage and elevation travel and optimal adjustment.

Need a good beginner's training or defensive pistol? Realized that the gift you bought your loved one is really more a gift for yourself?

Well, you're in luck- just in time for the holidays!!

The older brother of the fan favorite P22 (and younger sibling to the the P99), the Walther PK380 is the sleek, ergonomic and cult classic middle child that you've been looking for.

With great looks, better feel, superb action and accuracy, the PK380 is a very forgiving sidearm for beginners and seasoned shooters alike. Just pop eight rounds into the single stack magazine and get to work!

Not only is this firearm well stored and maintained, it comes with over 100 rounds of target ammo (91 and 95 grain FMJ) as well as Federal Hydra-Shok Low-Recoil 90 grain defense ammo. That's two free trips to the range if you are a ""one-box-drill"" kinda shooter, with more than enough defense ammo to get you there and back.

Need a holster? Done! This baby comes with a fobus OWB paddle holster, so you can drill to your heart's content. In addition, the PK380 comes with a blank warranty card, original casing, brush and hard case, possibly a bunch of candy-canes if you're cool.

This great sidearm deserves trigger time it just didn't get to have. Make it yours today!

...like, now.
