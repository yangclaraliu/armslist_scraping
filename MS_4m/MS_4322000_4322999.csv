Most of the websites I've looked at are asking $100 or more but this has been used so I'm asking $50.

Here's a link to a youtube video that demonstrates the product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjRFoj7QMck and the description from the manufacturer's website is pasted below. I don't have the extra batteries mentioned nor do I have the allen wrench tools that originally came with the unit, but otherwise have all the other parts listed. 

Description from the manufacturer's website:
""LaserLyte® Introduces One Side Mount Laser that fits nearly all Taurus Revolvers and all S&W J-Frames; the LaserLyte® CK-SWAT

The side mounted laser fits on all of the Smith & Wesson J-frame revolvers ever made and nearly all Taurus revolvers, except the Taurus View. And now, the Taurus Judges including the Public Defender finally has a laser system to call its own with the CK-SWAT laser. 

The new LaserLyte® CK-SWAT laser mounts easily underneath the grip and is the only laser system available that allows the customer to retain the factory grip and comfortably and easily holster the firearm. The CK-SWAT is also compatible with many aftermarket grips including Hogue® and Pachmayr®.

To install the LaserLyte® CK-SWAT, simply choose one of the four included base plates that fit the revolver, remove the grip and screw the unit into place. Replace the grip and sight in the firearm with common X and Y adjustments. When ready to activate, simply press the button located at the back of the laser as you draw the firearm from the holster. The laser is easily programmable to either constant on or pulse mode. 

Another great feature is the “auto-off” feature that displays a unique flash after 5-minutes of operation and automatically turns the unit off after 6-minutes. This feature can be reset at anytime to prevent accidental activation and battery depletion.  The LaserLyte® CK-SWAT unit can also be easily removed and placed on any other compatible firearms.

-Product Number: CK-SWAT
-Compatible Firearms: Fits all Smith & Wesson J-frame revolvers and all Taurus revolvers, including the Judge.

Also comes with a trigger job from Springfield which has resulted in a very crisp and ideal trigger. This model comes with Novak night sights.

He also told me that 59% of the guns on here are stolen. Also you have to keep in mind that when the Newtown shooting occurred everyone panicked and ran out to POPS Gun Shop and got bent over the table in the back room. Now they are trying to get there money back especially the AR style rifles. The bottom line is the NRA owns every politician in Washington. There will never be a ban again.

Anyways, I have the following:

1 brick Aguila Super Extra (500 round brick)
1 brick Aguila Rifle Match (500 round brick)
3 bricks CCI Standard Velocity (500 round bricks for 1500 total)
4 sleeves CCI Mini-Mag 36gr HP (100 round sleeves for 400 rounds total)
5 boxes Federal Auto Match (325 round boxes for 1625 rounds total)
7 boxes Federal Gold Medal Target 711B (50 round boxes for 350 total)

Price is $500 for the entire lot, with the buyer to pay actual shipping via Fedex Ground if you aren't local (message me if you need a shipping quote).  Sorry, no NYS shipments due to SAFE act, any NYS sales must be completed FTF.

Price is FIRM, since it's with a few bucks of what I paid at retail for it over the past 12 months, which means it's probably below retail price now, assuming you could actually find it...  And for anyone who thinks I'm gouging on this ammo, please take the time to research the actual retail prices of this ammo, it is TARGET GRADE ammo, not run of the mill bulk brick plinking ammo.

I would really prefer to sell this as a complete lot so I don't have to make multiple shipments, but will consider breaking it up if it sits for more than a week or so."

Included are two additional flat mag floor plates which can provide better concealment when carrying.  Also comes with box, manual.  Have had ZERO malfunctions. Amazing firearm but need to narrow the collection down.

From the H&K site...

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols.  Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

914,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4322914,For Sale:  Kahr CM40,"Randleman, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 319,"Listed On: Monday, May 18, 2015",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"NEW UNFIRED!

The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
- Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy and reliability found in all Kahr pistols.
