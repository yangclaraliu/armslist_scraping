Hi, I am here to tell you about the most amazing deal to hit the Missoula Armslist classifieds since that one guy sold a Yugo SKS for $175. 

I won't speak for the quality of the gun so much as the gun's novelty. Not of the highest quality, actually, these guns were made by Rohm RG, and Rohm RG's were pretty much a let down and I am almost positive this one is as well, though I did shoot approximatly one magazine's worth of ammo and only one with no problems. Beyond that, I won't comment or guarantee anything besides the fact you might feel like a New Orleans pimp out walking his beat or instantly turn into a small time thief holding up gas stations, or maybe just have buyer's regret. 

Given that these were made and the ceased to be imported a number of years ago when ""Saturday Night Specials"" became a bad moniker, this might have relevance to someone looking to collect a niche piece of hardware. 

The gun is in great condition, and comes with the original box, manual and warranty. 

I am asking, for the gun and accoutrements, the amazing low price of $79.99. 

But wait!

If you are the first one to actually risk buying this thing in the next 20 years, I will throw in 45 rounds of .25 Auto for free! 

That's right, FREE. 

For $79.99, you get not only the gun, magazine, original box, and manuals, but also a box of .25 Auto! The world's finest self-defense cartridge for the everyman looking to score something illegal in a bad neighborhood of LA, Winchester .25 Auto is proven to at least be entertaining if not terribly amazing. 

Don't miss out on this amazing deal! Operators are standing by. 

No COD. Cash, check or money order is fine. Must be a Montana resident to buy private part. Contact me to discuss shipping and FFL fees for out of state buyers. No liability, refunds and returns not available. No lowballing or low offers. 

Don't miss out on this amazing deal today!"

That's right, the one gun to help you escape the modern world and delve into a time where Sean Connery had hair, the women were willing and beautiful, and action was in. 

Much like a midget trained in tae kwon doe stuffed into a microwave box, this little guy brings a lot of heat in a little package, and will provide endless hours of entertainment. 

Years ago, this gun was acquired as part of an inheritance from a relative who also had it for many years. After some field testing, the gun was then put in the recesses of a gunsafe for over a decade before being rediscovered. And now, it is available to you, my finest customers. That's right, this gun represents a time capsule from when you wanted to have a Saturday Night Special but wouldn't settle for less. 

I myself have shot this gun, and found it much like the women in a given Bond movie: easy to operate, willing to shoot, but often unforgiving when it comes to the ammo being used. To that end, I suggest trying a multiplicity of brands, to include higher end types such as CCI Mini-Mag and similar products to unlock the full pleasures of owning this otherwise average firearm.

How much you ask? Well, for the amazing price of $230, you get the gun, original magazine, and one spare magazine. 

But wait, there is more: be the first to actually buy this thing at the offered price, and you will receive a free 50 round box of Norma Tac-22 .22LR ammunition. 

That's right, a free box of 50 rounds of .22LR, a valuable find at any time. 

For $230, you get the gun, two magazines, and a small box of .22LR. 

""But Billy, why would I want to buy this"". 

Because this is America, and you want to, that's why.

I'm selling my Polytech M14s built into the Juggernaut Rogue Chassis. This combines the reliability of the M14 platform with the portability and maneuverability of a 26.5"" bullpup.  The Polytech M14s is renowned for its durable forged receiver and chrome-lined barrel.

I had Benchmark shorten the barrel to 16.5"", then add their Tactical brake. This reduces the felt recoil to something akin to a 5.56 AR, allowing for accurate follow-up shots. This rifle shoots very well, reliably feeding and ejecting without fail. The rifle comes easily to the shoulder, with a balance point just behind the grip, making it exceptionally easy to move. 

I purchased the rifle used, and I have run 300 rounds through it. 

In its current configuration, the rifle comes with the following:

Ambidextrous charging handle
OEM barrel, custom shortened and threaded by Benchmark Barrels out of Arlington, WA.
Benchmark Barrels tactical brake with pinch bolt.
Cobra Tactical AFG
900 lumen LED Ultrafire flashlight in rail mount. Comes with remote line.
Diamondhead polymer flip-up battlesights
Full polymer rail covers
Magpul Rail Sling Attachment
Two extra sling swivels
3 x 20rnd steel magazines

Pistol had a handful of failure to ejects in the 2-300 rounds I've put through it. Steps have been taken to attempt to fix it, but haven't had time to test them (hence the numbered magazines).

Fixes that I've done:
Reduced diameter and chamfered rear of firing pin - had a slam fire first trip out
Shimmed FCG - Hammer wouldn't reliably reset
Changed hammer spring - more reliable primer strikes, and slowed the bolt slightly to improve ejection
Cleared a little of the stock (pictured) - brass was hitting the overhanging metal and bouncing back into the chamber.
Charging handle - Had my brother make an aluminum charging handle, greatly improves the feel of the original popsicle stick.
Mags - the original 7.62 mags work fine, but the 9mm mags would bind the follower when at ~20rds, so they were chopped down to a 10rd and a 20rd capacity.

466,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4559466,For Sale:  5.56 Green Tip ammo (XM855) LC/FC in Bandoleers/strippers,"Northeast Suburban St. Paul, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 60,"Listed On: Monday, August 24, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Packed in proper cans and bandoleers, I am selling this by the Bandoleer....$60 cash for one bandoleer of 120 rounds.

This is the green tip steel core ""Penetrator"" stuff that the Feds tried to ban but backed off. It is available commercially in boxes at stores and gun shows or bulk from a couple wholesalers and this is packed carefully in surplus USGI bandoleers, stripper clips and the cans too, and is pretty close to how it comes packaged for our troops.
120 rounds to a bandoleer, seven bandoleers packed in a .50 caliber can (840 rounds total) that is properly marked for these bandoleers of this ammo. 

Each bandoleer has four pockets.
Each pocket contains a cardboard sleeve that holds three stripper clips, with 10 rounds each so you can fill a 30 round magazine from each pocket. There is also a ""loading spoon"" in one end pocket to load M4/M16/AR15 magazines with the strippers. Works with Mini-14 and other.223/5.56 magazines too.
The bandoleers have a strap so you can carry them over a shoulder and there is a safety pin on each strap so you can adjust them to suit your carry needs or to repair your clothing.
Not only that, the bandoleers can be modified by pulling the loose end of the white thread, which opens up the pocket a couple inches deeper, allowing you to store a loaded magazine in each pocket (after you load them up!).
This arrangement is really pretty cool and versatile, and the empty bandoleers can be used to tote around lots of other gear too, or you can shoot up the ammo and sell the bandos to someone else who wants to repack their own....just a repack kit goes for 5-10 bucks and these are in perfect shape!

The ammo packed in these is LC with the green tip, and Lake City is the best you can buy IMO.
62 grain steel core projectiles loaded up in boxer primed reloadable brass that is also an industry standard for high quality.

5.56 Ammo doesn't get any better than this!

$60.00 cash for each bandoleer (120 rounds)....I only have a couple cans packed like this.....if you buy all seven bandos in the can I'll toss in the can for free so you will have the whole GI package....$420 cash for the whole can of 840 rounds)

Prices are firm (I don't need to sell this) and NO SHIPPING (Don't ask!!)
Cash purchase face to face is how it works, no criminals, felons or terrorists.
I will ask you for a drivers license only to make sure you are 18 years old and not an illegal alien but I keep no records myself. I don't sell ammo for a living, just have a couple excess cans of really, REALLY good ammo that I probably will never get around to shooting up and can use the cash this summer for travel.

Thanks for looking!"

Beautiful 1911 Bicentennial anniversary gun sold only by Colt direct At the Sam Colt Bicentennial Birthday celebration on July 19 in Samuel Colt Park in Hartford. The second offer was made exclusively to Colt Manufacturing Employees and are highly prized by the few employees that had the foresight to add 1 to their collection. The 3rd and final offering was made at the Colt Collectors Association meeting in October at their annual meeting and show in North Carolina, and again these are prized pieces by those in the association that were smart enough to pick 1 up. In all less than 150 have been produced and this is the only offering I find any where on the internet for this very exclusive edition.

I have a lightly used, and in very good condition Shepherd 3-10x40 scope. This scope has 2 reticles, a SFP crosshair and a FFP range finding reticle with 18in circles. More information on the scope can be found at: www.shepherdscopes.com

The glass is clear and the scope functions as it was designed. It is lightly used, but in very good condition. The person I got the scope from did not remember which model scope it was, but told me the reticle was calibrated for .308 Win. Based on the ballistics of my .223 handloads, I believe it is the P3 model.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.SpecificationsChambering: 9mm LugerMagazine Capacity:18Magazine Type:Double StackFrame:SteelGrips:RubberTrigger Mech:DA/SASights:Fixed Night SightsBarrel :Cold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length:4.600 inWeight:2.400 lbsOverall Length:8.150 inHeight:5.790 inWidth:1.460 inSafety:Decocking LeverSafety Stop on HammerFiring Pin Block Safety"

-------

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It achieves this using a powerful infrared illuminator (invisible to people and animals) to literally illuminate the target area immediately in front of where the rifle scope is aiming, allowing clear target identification up to 100 metres (110 yards) away. The infrared image is then captured through the rifle scope by a compact digital camera unit attached to the scope’s eyepiece and then played back live to the hunter via the unit’s integral 3.5 inch LCD screen. A video out jack enables recording of all night hunting activities. Like all NiteSite products, the Viper utilises infrared illumination in a unique way, making it more affordable, reliable and user friendly than traditional light amplification technologies, delivering crisp, ultra-clear night vision, regardless of ambient light conditions.

It achieves this using three powerful infrared illuminators (invisible to to people and animals) to literally illuminate the target area immediately infront of where the rifle scope is aiming, allowing clear target identification up to 300 metres (328 Yards) away. The infrared image is then captured through the rifle scope by a compact video recording unit attached to the scope’s eyepiece and then played back live to the hunter via the unit’s integral 3.5 inch LCD screen. A video out jack enables recording of all night hunting activites. Like all NiteSite products, the WOLF utilises infrared illumination in a unique way, making it more affordable, reliable and user friendly than traditional light amplification technologies, delivering crisp, ultra-clear night vision, regardless of ambient light conditions.
