For sale: I have a new Century Arms C39V2 100% American made AK-47 with $160 in extras included. I am not interested in any trades. This is a cash sale.

First of all the C39V2 was produced to improve on the original C39 and it is a MAJOR improvement for sure. The V2 has had nothing but outstanding reviews by hard core AK-47 devotees, including the AK-47 Operator's Union. This is one of the finest AK-47s you can get today. The quality fit and finish are outstanding. The C39v2 is 100% American made without the use of any imported parts. It is built on a milled receiver machined from a solid 11-pound block of 4140 ordnance steel. Enhancements include a T-shaped magazine catch, compatibility with AKM furniture; bolt hold-open safety, enhanced dust cover and standard AK sights. The C39v2 is coated with black nitrite and uses a new enhanced trigger group. The C39v2 barrel has a concentric left hand 14×1 metric thread and is ready for a variety of muzzle attachments.

These rifles are very much in demand and are being bought up so that they can be hard to find.

As a bonus, I am including the just released Magpul Zhukov-S adjustable and side folding stock, a Magpul AKM handguard and an Ergo grip. Altogether the combined REAL WORLD sale price (not full retail) of this package would be about $900 PLUS tax or shipping and lets not forget that FFL transfer cost you will be saving. 

This is a great deal on an outstanding rifle. Everything is NEW with the original packaging included. The original beautiful hardwood stock and fore grip are included as well if you want to go back to the original configuration."

An extremely rare unit marking! This gun is in overall good condition but it does show a lot of wear and that includes some pitting around the chamber date and on the left side. The muzzle also shows considerable wear. Since this is a prewar gun and it has unit markings it would be relatively easy to follow its use in the war by the 17th Corps. The unit marking is particularly rare as most unit marked guns are marked at the regimental level. It is rare to find guns marked to a Division, Corps or Army level. The marking alone adds several hundred dollars of value to this gun. This gun is truly an old soldier!

Firestar pistols are recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy. The .45acp M-45, unlike their 9mm brother, are double action pistols with similar frame mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry (hammer is cocked and safey is applied). All Firestars featured automated firing pin safey and magazine disconnect safety. Single column magazine holds 6 rounds.

 Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their respective calibers, but, obviously not the lightest ones. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable, despite the powerful ammunition and small size of the guns.

 It is a great concealed carry pistol, and comes with a low quality holster, 2 magazines (one with extended finger rest). Extremely accurate. Read all the positive reviews online. Price is on the low end for these. Only selling to buy a truck

In excellent condition with original box and all paperwork.  
 
Rifle is in excellent near new condition.  Wood and metal are perfect.
 
Technical data: CZ 452-2E ZKM
Type: repeating bolt rimfire rifle
Operating principle: manual repeating bolt
Receiver: steel • Calibre: .22 LR
Ammunition feed: removable magazine • Capacity: 5 rounds
Barrel length: 630 mm • Overall length: 1,083 mm
Weight: 3.0 kg
 
 
CZ reliability, endurance and accuracy is embodied by the repeating bolt rimfire rifle model CZ 452-2E ZKM. This rifle, which is mainly taking care of kitchen supplies in Africa (the rifle is an ideal solution for hunting of gallinaceous birds, hares and other kinds of small game) thanks to its accuracy, is also the most frequently used arm at sporting competitions. The stock and forend are made of a single piece of material which is the usual practice for this type of rimfire rifles; this piece is made of quality walnut wood. The stock is made into a crest resembling ""wild bore backbone"" without a shoulder piece, terminated with a butt made of synthetic material. The Lux version is provided with checkered grip, while the Standard version features a smooth grip only. The forend is long enough and terminated with Schnabel shape. The surface finishing of wood is perfect, even at joints between wood and metal, this is an actual demonstration of careful and detailed finishing.
 
It is common practice for this brand of rimfire rifles that the barrel is made of forged steel, which guarantees its long life. The barrel length is 63 cm – it might seem long, yet that is exactly the reason (together with bore twist quality) for its excellent firing accuracy. Shot dispersion from this rimfire rifle at 50 m (as well as 100 m) is thrilling; this characteristic can be matched by Olympic shooting rimfire rifles only. When using 40 grain CCI Standard Velocity ammunition combined with a fitted riflescope (Tasco 3-9 x 42), the dispersion of 5 shots will be 15 millimetres only. Using 40 grain Federal Gold Medal UltraMatch ammunition will reduce the dispersion (with 5 rounds fired) to 12 millimetres.
 
Sights are formed by a ""U-shaped"" rear sight with scale for ranges from 25 to 200 m (slide setting) with optional windage correction and the height-adjustable front sight with its protective guard. The receiver is made of steel, with matt phosphorus finish and two lateral openings for gas escape in case of overpressure. The round ejection window is wide allowing small cases of .22 LR calibre to pass without any hindrance. The design of bolt on this rifle is a bit unusual – its front part is of semi-circular shape with a groove in the centre. Front part of the sliding bolt is then shaped as semi-circle with its extractor and case holder on either side respectively. The bolt of this rifle is simple (monolithic) to enable smooth control, yet showing no play during lateral operation (lateral slippage). The rear part of bolt (acorn) houses the safety for direct blocking of the firing pin. When the safety is deactivated (released position), red mark is visible.
 
The detachable magazine is made of steel, its bottom is made of synthetic material. The magazine capacity is 5 rounds, however a 10-round magazine can be purchased as optional item. The trigger features a significant curve. The trigger is smooth (with no play or slippage) and the shooter can feel no friction. The default trigger pull is set to 1,750 grams. This pull setting is probably too high for competition shooting, yet it can be reduced. The trigger pull can be altered using the adjusting nut (spring resistance), it can be reduced to 1,350 grams. Polishing of friction surfaces (performed by a qualified gunsmith) can contribute towards reduction of the pull weight down to 700 grams."

This gun was definitely used as a hunting rifle by at least one of its previous owners but looks like it was taken care of for most of its life. The bluing is great as there are only a few spots worn off mostly on the front and rear sight mounts. The stock has some dings and is worn a bit in a few spots but is in very good condition. The action is very tight just like this model is known for and the rifling is still strong. The scope is a weaver 330. It has 90% bluing and the glass is 95% clear except for a slight crack on the right side. If you are a collector or just interested in building a custom rifle with ""The Cadillac of Enfields"" than you should definitely look at the history of this rifle and what people have said about it.

I am most interested in trading this gun for at least $500 cash and another gun or two. The cash price for the gun is $1500. I am very open to all sorts of trades."

This is literally the best .22 pocket pistol you can get. The double action trigger, tip up barrel, and cocking hammer make it so you never have to rack the slide, and you can carry in any ""condition"" you want. Small and lightweight, while still allowing a full 5 finger grip. Ambidextrous safety and low profile sights are streamlined for a quick and easy snag free draw. 
I purchased this for ccw but never ended up actually carrying it. It's in superb condition with only 300 rounds thru it. The finish is perfect, no visible wear, not one malfunction. Price is $350 FIRM these are hard to find especially in this good of condition. The Taurus pt22 is total junk, ask anyone. The beretta bobcat is proven. I'll include 50 rounds of cci stingers OR 100 rounds of cci minimags, OR 100 rounds of cci pistol match. I have more 22 ammo I'll sell to the buyer of the gun for the price I paid for it in the store (stingers $8/50rd, minimags $9/100rd, pistol match $6/50rd) . If you want to buy stingers, mini mags, or pistol match ammo without the gun, it will be double what I paid for it. Not gouging here, it's just more worth it for me to keep it than if I sell it for less.
