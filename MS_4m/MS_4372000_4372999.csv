I realize that this may have to go on Gunbroker, but I'm gonna post it here in the hopes that there are some local AK aficionados and I don't have to ship this beauty.  This is a FULLY converted Saiga 7.62 x 39.  This is not one of the half-assed conversions that I keep seeing for $1200-$1300 that just have the pistol grip and AK mag parts done with a bolt on rail.  This is as close as most of us will ever get to owning a true Russian AK-47.  It was made at the Izhmash factory, where the original AK-47s were made.   This is gonna be a long description so grab a cup of coffee.... or 8.

This started out as a new in the box Saiga 7.62 x 39 in it's ""hunting"" configuration.  This was done so it could be imported from Russia.  These are no longer being imported IN ANY CONFIGURATION!  These rifles are sweet as-is (and are going up and up in price,) but they're no AK.  Here's what was done:  The stock and the trigger were removed and the trigger group was moved to it's intended location, right behind the mag release and a pistol grip was installed.  It's a Tapco grip and is one of the few US made parts that are present because they are required for 922r compliance.  A bullet guide was installed and the mag release modified so that it will take 30 round AK magazines.  The original gas piston was removed and a Tapco piston installed (again, for compliance.)  It has the correct ""wiggle"" as it was installed with pins rather than Loctite and force.  Next, the handguard and gas tube were removed and a Bulgarian gas tube and handguard retainer were installed.  This is an actual surplus retainer with a lever, NOT a bolt on retainer.  The gas block and front sight block were removed and replaced with surplus Bulgarian and East German respectively.  I went with the AKM front sight block so that the barrel could be threaded to 14x1 LH and a slant brake with detent installed.  Then a surplus cleaning rod was thrown on and she was ready to get pretty.

The rifle was taken apart again and a set of surplus furniture was refinished in a nice ""Russian Red.""  The rifle itself was refinished in a black semi-gloss bake on coating.  I went back and forth between matte and semi-gloss about 600 times.  After installing the furniture, I topped her off with a surplus Romanian bayonet with matching numbers sheath.  The bayonet is in excellent surplus condition and when attached to the bayonet, doubles as a wire cutter.  I'm totally serious!  A cleaning kit came with the rifle, so I kept that, but added a blank firing adapter and found a surplus oil bottle to make it authentic.  It will come with the plastic oil bottle that came in the box as well.  It will also come with the 10 round magazine that came in the box and a Hungarian surplus 30 round AK magazine.  The original box and all paperwork round out the package.  A couple of final notes..

This rifle has 10 foreign 922r parts as it sits.  You DO NOT need US magazines for compliance, so you can use the surplus steel mags, which are preferred IMHO.  The rifle will have 20 rounds through it for testing, so I'm not calling it ""new in the box,"" but it basically is.  If you would prefer a matte black finish (like I said, I couldn't decide myself,) I will break the rifle down, strip it and recoat it in matte for an additional $100.  Some people prefer one over the other.... I don't judge.  Ok, ok... here's what you've been waiting for..

I’m asking $1500 for the whole package and I am in Twin Falls.  I am not opposed to taking a trip out Boise way to the West or Idaho Falls way to the East or anywhere in between for a serious buyer, so don't kick the dog if you're not in Twin.  I will be listing the rifle on Gunbroker if it doesn't sell locally, but I will be waiting a few days.  I'd much rather her go to someone local, as I have a lot of Idaho blood, sweat and tears into her... not to mention Idaho dollars.  I really need the cash on this one, but I will consider partial trades, so get in touch with me if you're looking for something that would make General Kalashnikov proud.  I could only post 3 pictures, so please contact me for more.  I have LOTS!  Thanks for looking!"

102,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4372102,"For Sale:  .308 or 7.62x51 NATO plastic training ammo, 4400 fps! 498 rounds","Lincoln County, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 80,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 27, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is some pretty interesting stuff, it's German-made training ammo for the G3 battle rifle. This is not a blank or a dummy round, rather it's a real firing cartridge with an 11 grain plastic bullet that has an advertised muzzle velocity of 4400 feet per second. 

The case head and primer are metal while the majority of the case and bullet are a single-piece case plastic assembly, upon firing the bullet cleanly separates from the case. These were designed to be reduced-lethality training rounds for European military cadets who were almost all totally unfamiliar with firearms, as such they are marked as dangerous out to only 200 yards.

I shot a couple cartridges out of this case after I finished my previous one so it's got 498 rounds instead of 500, but only that one individual box has been opened. These should work fine in bolt or break action rifles chambered in .308 or 7.62x51, but as I've found they will not cycle any semiauto that isn't a G3 with a special lightweight training bolt.

The low recoil and limited range make them good for training newbies, and eradicating pests or plinking in places where you might have concerns about proper backstop length with regular ammo. (That said as _always_ it's your responsibility to check behind your target and make sure it's clear before firing, even if it has a much shorter dangerous range than a heavier metal bullet it can still kill or injure at close range.) They're fairly accurate out to about 50 yards, but after that the light bullet is heavily affected by drag and wind drift. Here's a video demonstrating the sort of report and recoil you can expect out of these rounds:

Straight grip with a ""Perch Belly"" Steel rifle butt that is curved, schnoble tip knife edge dovetail. As you can tell in the pictures this gun is beautiful. 

Model 99's are rare and in this condition its even more rare. Model 99's used a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges. The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. It also has a counter to indicate how many shots are left. This guns counter works perfect and functions flawless. 

The rotating magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. Another safety feature was that upon cocking the rifle, a small pin protrudes above the top receiver to indicate the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. This design was ahead of its time.

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

This weapon is covered by the Taurus Life time repair warranty.  It follows the gun not the buyer.  It covers the inspection, repair, test firing, cleaning and return. Your only cost is sending to Taurus. No risk to any buyer.

With the hammer pulled back, it has super light trigger pull and this gun is very smooth and balanced well.  This is how I purchased the gun for over $800 so I do not have the original wooden grips (have an extra pearl one side) and please do not ask if ""Will you take...."".  Those emails will be ignored.  Very excellent condition.  Early 70s serial number.    1969 - 1982 In the late 1960s, Colt began to be concerned with a decline in its market share because of price increases brought about by the high labor costs inherent in its manufacturing processes. In response, an entirely new product line of revolvers dubbed the MK III series debuted in 1969. Intended to be the first major advancement of Colt’s designs since the beginning of the 20th Century, the MK IIIs used a new ‘J’ frame and had no parts interchangeability with older models. The new revolvers were considered groundbreaking as they were the first modern revolver designs to employ a state of the art transfer-bar lockwork system. This lockwork was not only more sophisticated, but inherently safer due to its superiority to the older hammer-blocking designs; the revolver could fire only if the trigger was deliberately pulled completely to the rear. It also vastly improved on the earlier design in durability, and offered the advantage of employing sintered iron internal parts rather than expensive forged ones. The sintered parts also allowed for improved fabrication tolerances, and could be given a special heat treatment resulting in a harder more wear-resistant composition. Using these parts virtually eliminated hand fitting, significantly lowering labor costs associated with the assembly and manufacture of the MK III line.[2] The springs used in the Mark III internals were also an improvement. Unlike the older flat style, they were coiled and made entirely of corrosion-resistant stainless steel.[3]"

This new REPR is also eligible for the AIMPOINT Micro T-1 Promo. Buy this rifle, and LWRC will send you a FREE AIMPOINT valued at $889!!! This is a brand new in box LWRC Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle, or REPR, LR-308 architecture semi-automatic rifle chambered for .308 Winchester. This REPR features a distinctive and practical Flat Dark Earth cerakote finish on the receivers and handguard. The unique LWRC REPR is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm rounds on target in a variety of roles. The REPR rifle utilizes LWRC's patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. This rifle features a unique Spiral Fluted barrel. The spiral fluting reduces weight, increase heat dispersion, and relieves longitudinal forces that can reduce accuracy in conventional linear fluting. LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity. NiCorr surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. LWRC claims their barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24, making it compatible with most .308 muzzle devices, and a birdcage-style flash hider comes equipped. A Magpul MOE+ customizable pistol grip and B5 SOPMOD adjustable butt stock are fitted, ensuring comfortable configuration choices for any operator. LWRC BUIS and a 20 round PMAG are included. Caliber: .308 Winchester / 7.62x51mm NATO Capacity: One 20 round PMAG included Barrel: 16.1"" Fluted Cold Hammer Forged 41V45 steel barrel, 1:10"" twist Overall Length: 40.8"" Weight: 9.5 pounds"

Big difference and big change in costs and values of guns. Putting an ACOG on a DPMS Oracle doesn't turn it into a world class sniper rifle just like furniture on a gun doesn't make it better than stock."

I don't know if it was actually sporterized or just built on a surplus action, but it's had some work done. It has a GI rear sight, front is a Redfield banded ramp with a hood with two gold beaded blades, one .220"" and a .250"" installed.  Seems to zero between 275-300 yards, depending on which blade is used.  As far as I can tell, all of the action parts are of Remington manufacture.  Receiver serial number dates to 1942.  All metal parts are blued. The barrel is a 4-groove with a nice bore, but the Redfield front sight covers the date and manufacturer stamp so I don't know who made it.  It may be a Springfield, the barrel is marked with an ""S"" on the underside. The stock almost looks handmade; it's nothing fancy, but it has been bedded.  Headspace was checked by my gunsmith prior to me ever firing it and it was pronounced to be in good shape.

It shoots like a 73 year old military surplus rifle.  It's not an MOA rifle and it never will be without a better trigger and rear sight or a scope.  I shot about 30 rounds through it the day before this ad was written, I can hold at best 4 MOA comfortably from a rest, but rifle is my weakest skill set.  To restore this rifle to military spec will be more trouble and money than it will be worth when the fad dies out.  If you're looking for a decent price on a functional bolt action rifle built on a rock-solid legendary action, give me a shout.  Will ship for the cost of postage, depending on your state laws."

Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.In 5.56 NATO and 6.8 SPC, the REC7 is everything you’d expect from a Barrett rifle, and then some.SpecificationsModel: REC7Caliber: 5.56 NATOBarrel length: 16"" (40.6 cm)Rifling Twist: 1 in 7"" (18 cm)Operation:Gas Piston SystemSemi-AutomaticSelect FireWeight:7.2 lbs.

Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box."

Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots. The Px4 Storm Compact offers a plethora of features that make it easily adaptable to your preferences. Its modular construction allows you to interchange backstraps to perfectly fit your hand and shooting style, while the slide lock and safety are ambidextrous; in addition, the magazine release is reversible, meaning that you can easily train with and use your PX4 with either hand. Other features include a retractable lanyard loop, as well as user-adjustable sights and a number of accessories that make this pistol a true champion in its class.This handgun offers intuitive controls and an absolutely safe mechanism. In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense.Manufacturer: Beretta ( Made in Italy )Model: PX4 Storm Compact Caliber: .9mmBarrel: 3.8""Type: Semi-AutomaticAction: Single/Double Action"

Yes, I know once you purchase a gun it is considered used, but this is as new as you are going to get without actually buying new from an FFL. Not looking for trades at this time, as I will be using the money to fund another gun purchase myself. SC CWP preferred, but SCDL will be required for law abiding citizens with no felonies.
