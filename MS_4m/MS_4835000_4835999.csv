Henry U.S. Survival rifle is ultra lightweight, weighing in at a scant 2.5 pounds. The unique design allows the rifle to break down easily into three pieces in seconds. This enables the barrel, action and two 8 round magazines to fit comfortably into the tough ABS synthetic waterproof stock. No tools are needed to assemble or disassemble. Once disassembled and stowed, it is only an incredible 16 inches long. Carry it in your backpack with room to spare.

I have for sale my camo .300 blackout, has had maybe 50 rounds through it and I bought it new earlier this year. Great fun on the range and farm yet now I need money for another adventure and need to part with this.
Comes with 2-3 30 round pmags
Stock 10 round mag
2-3 boxes of ammo
P-223 scope
Hard case with custom cut liner to fit gun and mags 
The case is NOT cheap at all and comes with key and lock built in.
I paid 999 for the gun bare, and 400+ on accessories... All you will need is a mount for the scope, I suggest a QD mount so it will fit in case. There is one for sale down the road from my apartment for 99$ at a pawn shop. 
Possible trades: I will only consider trades for deer caliber or long range rifles. .308 .300 stuff like that and would prefer heavy barrel since I do long range shooting. Feel free to offer partial trades with money on top for hunting items, trail cams, archery targets, under armour gear, stands blinds etc. the worst I can say is no. But please do not try and trade me an 500 dollar gun and not have anything else of value. If you have a 900 dollar rifle I will not trade you even since the value is not close. Add cash 
Text me or leave a voicemail, with my schedule I will probably not answer unknown numbers... Email also works fine! 615-587-three788"

Similar to dueling pistols but with sights. Spectacular pair of European .42 caliber smooth bore, percussion cap numbered pistols in original Walnut case. Made by Fiala of Pozsonyban in the first half of the 19th Century. Pozsonyban or Pozsony is now known as Bratislava, Slovakia and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary through 1783. It was then subsumed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire until becoming part of Czechoslovakia at the end of WWI. They feature octagonal Damascus twist style wedge fastened barrels marked Fiala on underside at joint of barrel and breech block, with numbered wedges. Also inlaid marking Fiala Pozsonyban on top of barrel, single gold inlay line on breech, numbered breech block and tangs. Hammers are engraved in a fish or dolphin shape. Both trigger guards are engraved with ornamental scroll work in the form of zephyrs originating from the mouth of a lion-like animal figure. Back straps are engraved as well with scroll work and what appear to be mountain goats in rustic, rocky scene. The one on the pistol marked number '1' faces right, the other faces left and they are slightly differently executed. The lock plates and off side plates are engraved on each of the pistols but with different scenes. The lock plate of the pistol marked number '1' upon the breech block is engraved with a hunting dog crouching but ready, a tree, ornamental scroll work and makers mark Fiala. The off side plate on this pistol features an impressive stag eating from a tree, more ornamental scroll work and the city mark Pozsonyban. The other pistol, bearing a number '2' on the breech block features a complimentary hunting scene including tracking hound dog, ornamental scrollwork and makers mark Fiala. Off side plate is engraved with a coursing doe (the mate of the stag on the other?), more ornamental work and city mark Pozsonyban. Lock on pistol number '1' works flawlessly with stops at half and full cock. Lock on pistol number '2' has a good spring but does not catch at either cocking position suggesting repairable misalignment of internal components. The stocks are walnut and are in good condition. The finish is intact but there are small marks from handling as one would expect. Each pistol is fitted with a single fixed notch sight in the rear and a brass blade type front sight. The pistols are housed in their original case with faded red or puce colored lining. The case has a lock but the lock escutcheon is missing. We do have the key and the key works the lock. The case is sound and in good condition however there are small veneer chips along the lower edge, particularly in the back. Included in the case are: A horn powder flask, horn percussion cap container, wood and brass adjustable powder measure, and wooden funnel. There is also a brass cleaning rod with gutta percha or shellac molding compound knob and a turned wood wedge hammer/ramrod combination with horn end. Additionally is a single ball bullet mold with sprue cutter, octagonal shank circular punch for cutting wads, screwdriver, wedge pin tool, and hexagonal pewter oil vessel. Also some smaller tools, original cast lead bullets, cloth wads, and caps. A fine set that would have been carried by memebr's of the wealthy gentry or better classes of civilians or ranking officer's during the tumultous European mid-19th century. More phot's avialable upon request."

This is a 1942 Finnish M39 built on an 'antique' 1895 receiver. Overall I would say it is in great shape, the bluing is in nearly perfect shape except for the butt plate, and the bore is perfect as far as I can tell with no pitting/dark spots / etc. The stock is in good condition with no major nicks/gouges/dings with an old repair spot of some sort by the butt plate. It matches the finish on the rest of the stock, so I believe it was done prior to import (which - by the way - the import stamp is unobtrusive and under the front sight area). It is a 'D' stamped barrel & was manufactured by Valmet (VKT Stamp). The trigger & bolt function smoothly as is normal for the M39

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs.The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall / crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP40 uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels - accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP Series has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left-or-right-handed shooters.A new feature found on VP pistols is HK's patented charging supports - simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; either 13-round or reduced, 10-round capacity magazines.VP Series pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD 1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to hand mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams).VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK's famous cold hammer forged barrel - made from cannon grade steel - ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP40's machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.The VP40 is essentially the same dimensions as the 9mm VP9 model. The overall height of the VP40 is one millimeter (.04 inch) taller. The VP40 also weights 2.37 ounces (67 grams) more, 28.93 ounces for the VP40 versus 26.56 ounces for the VP9.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch's Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch's limited lifetime warranty, the VP Series is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.SpecificationsCaliber 40 S&WLength7.34 inchesHeight5.45 inchesWidth1.32 inchesBarrel Length4.09 inchesSight Radius6.38 inchesWeight (with Empty Magazine)26.56 ouncesWeight (Empty Magazine)3.28 ounces"

When you try on the ESS Crossbow, you'll discover it's unlike any other ballistic eye shield.  Experience the Tri-Tech Fit frame that achieves an amazing universal fit with max comfort and zero pressure points.  Then notice the lenses.  They won't fog.  That's thanks to groundbreaking Clear Zone FlowCoat technology, engineered to eliminate fog inside and prevent scratches outside. As you stare down your objective through distortion-free ESSOPTICS, you'll see just how optically precise vision can be. When you're ready to switch tints, the innovative DeadBolt Lens Lock pivots up for easy release, then clamps down for rock solid retention under impact. It's from ESS, so of course the Crossbow is compliant with U.S. Federal OSHA, ANSI Z87.1+, CE EN 166 and U.S. MIL-PRF-31013. Form, Fit, Function. Perfected. The Crossbow features interchangeable 2.4mm polycarbonate high-impact-lenses that provide 100% UVA/UVB protection. Comes with micro fiber pouch, Snap-On elastic retention strap, and instruction booklet. Call or text me at REDACTED"

The gun is in extremely nice condition (99-95%), with little signs of wear save for very slight cylinder marking and a tiny blemish I tried to capture in one pic. The grip screw head shows rust, but the bluing on the revolver is absolutely beautiful. Slight marks on the muzzle surface; no holster wear; evidence of .38 cartridge firing.

667,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4835667,For Sale:  modest AIRGUN collection,"Springfield, Eugene, Oregon",$ 75,"Listed On: Thursday, November 5, 2015",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"My research is subject to your own confirmation. Most old air guns need new seals, O-rings etc, and those are often available online at low cost. I just overhauled another old air gun that I've had for 36 years (NFS). It was straightforward, o-rings etc cost $10 on e-bay and it was a fun project for a cold winters morning.      For sale:      (1) Benjamin Rocket .22 pistol model #262 serial#13644 1955-71 (brown grips). A little surface rust. It shoots good. First couple of shots on a new cylinder it will just pssst, but then after those, BAM. Not a surprise since it hadn't been fired in years. Pretty accurate at beer cans at 30 feet. FUN. I’ve seen these around $70 for an 80% er.        (2) Upper of a Benjamin Franklin cal .22 pistol model #252 Super Co2 1953-1954 with original box no serial #, This should be a good parts gun. Somebody in the past tried to build a bottom out of plexiglas(orange trigger). Doesn’t function, but the upper seems very solid. I’ve seen these online complete for up to $150. In this shape as parts maybe $35. Original box is pretty good shape, a little dirty, one corner torn. Original owners sheet is dirty but intact. I’d guess the box is worth $30 by itself.       (3) Crossman .22 rifle model #120 serial #REDACTED-1954 Rare all brass barrel and tube indicates early production. Nice condition. Doesn’t shoot but everything seems to be there and it pumps, cocks and triggers, just won’t hold air, needs seals/o-rings R/R. Nice wood. I see these type rifles for $70, but have not seen an all brass one for sale.       (4) Crossman V-350 rifle 1961-1969 barrel cocker(dark brown stock). Pretty rough shape but it does cock by pulling the barrel back towards the breech, but doesn’t shoot. Probably worth the $25 I gave for it 5 years ago . Got it because it was COOL.      (5) CO2 cartridges (small 8 gram) Used in 2 pistols above. 18 boxes of 10ea = 180. I see these for sale in larger quantities for $34 per 100, so this box = $60. Total: $70 + $35 + $30 + $70+ $25 + $60 = $290. If you want them all then I’d consider $75 on a local sale."

The SW990 is the product of a joint collaboration between Smith & Wesson and Walther. The modified receiver used in the SW990 is supplied by Walther similar to P99 and is manufactured in Germany. Smith & Wesson manufactures the slide and barrel of the SW990 in the United States. The SW990 variant does not incorporate a de-cocking button as the other models do meaning the firearm is in a constant double-action mode, and the trigger has the same long heavy trigger pull as the SW99 in double action mode, and will reset as such with each cycle.
