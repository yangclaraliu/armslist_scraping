It does wear the original Colt walnut grips with gold Colt medallions. It does include the Colt box, however I do not believe it is the factory correct box. This gun would still make any Colt enthusiast a proud Python owner. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks for looking.

This scarcity is due in fact to the low production numbers originally produced and the attrition that resulted from use in 3 wars and countless training sessions as part of Army inventory post war. These rifles did not apparently enjoy the wide scale refurbishment programs that most of the other Finnish rifles did. The total production of m/28 being listed at 33.016 is by far the fewest of any Finnish service rifle from 1927-1945. The Finnish Defense forces list an inventory from 1951 of only 16,600 of m/28 type in storage. These rifles are the forerunner of the famed and storied m/28-30 and many shoot as well as their famous younger cousin. These rifles also have some of the rarest official variations in a series to be found in this model such as the civilian purchase/upgrade model and the transitional models produced by the factory from remaining m/28 stockpile parts. The Finnish Defense Force officially declared the rifle obsolete in the mid 1980’s and disposed of them to the collector market in the US. in 1986. Today they are a highly sought after collectors piece both here in the States and world wide.   This rifle has no importation stamps!!!    It was more than likely great grandpa's bring back rifle from World War 2 but was made/originally issued circa 1931 as a Civil Guard weapon made in the sako factory   .  as seen in the pictures it does have 3 kill notches carved into the stock.. numbers match bolt and receiver. the bad it is missing the rear swivel ski style sling mount... and the good has an immaculate sharp bore with a Type 2 SIG barrel ....  the only reason why I'm selling or willing to trade for a 91 -30 Pu is because I want to put one in an archangel stock... needless to say this rifle does not deserve that treatment... it holds way too much history.

This watch is sunning!

When I purchased it new it was nearly $5000 and from what I can see on line my price is fair for what you are getting. I am willing to entertain your best offer but low ball offers wont get a response I am in no rush to sell it. I might even be interested in a trade but will depend on what you have to offer. First come first served I will not hold it or take payments. I am more than willing to meet you at your jewelers if you like

One last thing due to spammers and scammers, I will not answer any one line emails such as ""is the item still available?"" Please put something in your email to indicate you are a real, local person actually interested in the item for sale. Thanks for Looking!"

gentlemen and a few bass ass ladies!  I have three lots remanufactured LAKE CITY .50 bmg API ammo for sale. i am asking $2.50 per round which is the cheapest i see it currently on here or anywhere else online- for this price i will ship for free in the green ammo cans! 

the lot with 92 rounds is $230 ($2.50 per round plus free shipping!!)

the lot with 126 rounds will be $299 ($2.37 per round and free shipping)

the lot with 150 rounds will be $337 ($2.25 per round and free shipping)

if you want it all i will of course come down in price so that all rounds are only 2.12 per round and free shipping!! so $780 for all 368 rounds!!!!! 

notice from the photos two of these lots have been polished to an extent the silver paint is OFF they are however API rounds meaning not many ranges want you to jack up their gongs.  and of course you need to be aware you could spark up a fire too.  the lot showing some rounds with paint is about 50/50 paint and no paint.  these are 650 grain projectiles, i have used rounds from all three cans and have good luck with them, i just do not need this many rounds at this time."

Kept in climate controlled safe and hasn't seen hardly any use. 

Cash or Trade but I heavily prefer a trade for this gun. Basically rifles only, definitely no handguns unless you have an FNP .45 tactical in decent condition. I'm looking for a .308 but the right 5.56/.223 might do. 

You can make a cash offer but it's not too likely that I'll go for less than MSRP, (which in this case would be around the $1,400 range) I love this gun. My ideal trade would be an M1A, maybe a nice HK91, etc. I'll consider high-quality milled 7.62 rifles on a case-by-case basis, and definitely send pictures for those offers please. 

Details:::
Gun's finish is what Springfield calls ""Black Armory Kote"" in matte black, it is durable. I'll be very frank and detailed with the description of this gun, honestly you have to look very closely to find any imperfections on it anywhere. It has a stainless barrel that has slight smear-like wear over the chamber of the barrel at the 1/2"" of the front end of the chamber top where it meets the ejection port front end, no scratching. I've put 300-500 rounds through the gun, it's in collection condition and has always been kept in a climate-controlled safe. I take down the gun after every use and treat it properly. 

Cocobolo wood grips from South America with 18LPI checkering. Adjustable tritium Trijicon sights front and back. Slight holster wear on the same half-inch or so where the barrel smudging is contacting the slide, and at the front inch of the slide on the corners. Comes with ammo, maybe 300-700 rounds? and 3 mags. Let me know if you're interested, if you are I'll take closer pictures for you.  

Here are the Trijicon sights on the 1911:::

Below is the product description.

A single button does the math. Just squeeze the trigger and remember your knife. Amazingly compact and simple to use, the Scout 1000 ARC figures distance based on terrain angle to give you an accurate “shoots-like” distance to 1,000 yards. Rifle Mode even tells you where to hold. With selectable Bow and Rifle Modes, it has the same capability some competitors need to split into two separate units. All with the tap of a button – in a vertical unit small enough to fit in your shirt pocket. In capability and ease of use, no one comes close to Bushnell.

Unmatched ballistic capability. Extreme up-and-downhill angles after true horizontal distance to your target. ARC accounts for the terrain when calculating distance, so you know precisely how to shoot the range.

Built-in digital inclinometer measures angles from -60 to + 60° with +/- 1° accuracy

The Charter Undercover looked and felt enough like a Smith & Wesson Airweight to suit us, and since those were the days of Super Vel Ammunition, we liked the Charter Steel frame. By 1984, when the 2 inch .357 Tracker debuted, we no longer needed Super Vel, you know, shoot it with .38 wadcutters and carry it with Federal 125 grain magnums. Here is Charter’s Magnum Pug in Lightweight Stainless. Manufacturer is Charter Arms of Shelton, CT. Factory variant number is 73520. Type is traditional double and single action true swingout revolver. Chambering is .357 Remington Magnum and .38 Smith & Wesson calibers interchangeably. Construction is all steel, with the exception of the alloy trigger guard and grip frame, with factory rubber combat finger groove grips. Barrel is one piece, with six groove right hand 18 3/4 rifling fore in a full lug shroud. Front Sight is serrated ramp type rib integral. Main frame is stainless steel, with an alloy grip frame. Cylinder is stainless 5 shot, and the Charter accepts ammunition from a 36A size speedloader. Trigger is .300 serrated face, with matching serrated spur hammer. Charters generally pull double action in the 10 – 11 pound vicinity, and 4 pound area single action, with minimal felt creep. Ignition is floating firing pin, with transfer bar safety mechanism that prevents the hammer from contacting the pin unless the trigger is fully depressed. Weight empty is 23 ounces, a shade less than a Smith & Wesson 640. The Mag Pug stays more point of aim with heavier bullets, 158 grain .38s or .357s. This revolver is not a fun gun to shoot with full house magnum loads. Each Magnum Pug comes in its factory hard shell case with protective papers, instruction manual, factory registration card, and gun lock. Similar revolvers from Taurus, Smith & Wesson, and Ruger command prices upwards of $800 apiece. We’re offering the Charter Magnum Pug Lightweight .357 Stainless in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 359.00.

Before I list the glorious members of this bundle, let me assure you that everything is PRACTICALLY NEW since I've only used the gun once, at a range (less than 50 shells fired). So, here's everything:

- Mossberg 500 12-guage pump-action shotgun (once again. less than 50 rounds fired)
- Full, improved, modified chokes
- Owner's manual
- Soft shotgun case
- Hard shotgun case

- Hoppe's Bore Snake (unused)
- Hoppe's Silicone Cloth (unused)
- Hoppe's Elite Gun Cleaner (unused)
- Super Leight Shooter's Earplugs (8 left of 10 in pack)

I will also include 75 rounds of Winchester Super X as they remained from that one session at the range. 

Everything that I just listed is located in attached pictures. Once again, the gun is basically new. 

RULES:
- Buyer must have valid NJ firearms purchaser ID and live in NJ. I'm not doing interstate transactions.
- Buyer should look at questions 1-10 of the STATE OF NEW JERSEY
CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY (http://nj.gov/njsp/info/pdf/firearms/sp-634.pdf) ahead and if there's something they would answer 'yes' to then ignore this ad. Basically, if you're a fugitive of justice or something of that sort, don't bother.
- Buyer must also have valid NJ photo ID which matches the address on their firearms purchaser ID. 

For those interested, please call 1-REDACTED

As long as the buyer is relatively close to central Jersey, I'm willing to bring the stuff to them. No ""475 or best offer"" bs here. This is worth far more than that.

""The 38 Military & Police"" .38 S&W Special

Features Include;
* 4"" ""Pinned"" Barrel
* 1/8"" Width Front Sight
* Case Hardened Trigger and Hammer
* Single / Double action
* Walnut, Magna Style Grips
* Additional Set of Wood Laminate grips from Altamont
* 6 Round, Fluted Cylinder

This is a ""D"" Prefixed Serial Numbered S&W with a Shipping Date between 1969 and 1970
I would classify it to be in Very Good (VG) Condition. It locks up tight and functions as a S&W Revolver should. I would rate it to be about 90%
Finish Quality and 100% for Function.

S&W states that any .38 Special Revolver that has a model number can safely fire +P ammunition. Basically that would be any S&W revolver dated after 1957. So, .38 Special +P can safely be fired from this revolver.

This Revolver is completely original, right down to the Serial Numbered Wood Stocks (Grips). It is NOT a ""Safe Queen"" and will make an excellent
Night Stand Gun, or just take it to the range and have fun punching holes in paper.

Although it is Not accompanied by the original Box or Documentation, it will come in a very nice carry case that includes a matching Holster.
Included are the (As Pictured) Very Nice Wood Laminate grips so the original ones do not get messed up. They are getting very valuable these days and costly to replace. Also included will be, 1 box (50 rounds) of Remington 148 Grain, .38 Special, Target Match Wad Cutters"

What we have here is a Sig Sauer 556 Swat Patrol rifle chambered in 5.56x45/.223. This rifle is a piston driven merge between the AR15 and AK47. It takes any AR-15 magazines, but thanks to the piston system it does not suffer from all the dirt and grim blowing back into the chamber that an AR does. The rifle also has an adjustable gas system for rough environments or when the rifle is extremely dirty and you need it to function. The rifle itself is stock with the factory diopter sights. I've added a 2 point sling and magpul Vertical Fore Grip that will come with the rifle, along with one 30 round GI mag and the original box/docs/lock from the factory. The rifle hasn't been fired, I just found another rifle I'd rather have so I'm selling this package to afford it.

The pistol included is a Sig SP2022 chambered in 9mm. It comes with a range kit that includes 3 15 round magazines, a swappable back strap, chamber lock, Sig holster, and the original factory box and documents. The pistol has had 45 flawless rounds fired through it, and is the same quality DA/SA with a de-cocker that you would expect from a Sig hammer fired pistol.

A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily.

Test shot pic shows date of 3/2/15.  Just built this Custom Shop gun!!

I simply have too many guns, including four other custom CZ's and decided to let this one go.  Keep in mind I follow all laws on gun transfers, and have no interest in trades.  Comes with three 18 round mags.

Below is the blurb:

CZC ACCU Shadow  (CZC Custom Version with Match Fit Barrel)
CZC MATCH BARREL & FIXED SIGHT
CZC 75 SP01 ACCU Shadow #91735
USPSA Production Approved!
Features
*CZC Fitted Match Barrel
*CZC Stainless steel barrel bushing.
*CZC Stainless steel reverse plug.
*CZC SHORT reset trigger system “CZC SRTS”
*CZC Competition Fixed rear sight.

These modifications have been added to the already customized CZ Custom SP01 Shadow Pistol. #91029

We have been very busy at the CZ Custom Shop over the last few months. We have been working and perfecting some new products and parts for the SP01 Shadow and the CZ 75 Shadow. This details the changes brought about to create the CZ 75 SP01 ACCU SHADOW.

Let’s talk about the difference:

We have hand fitted the ""Made in the USA"" CZC Match Grade Barrel, tighter fit and tolerance then standard factory barrel.

The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug.

The bushing keeps the front sight in the slide so no pin is necessary or needed (fitting the pin will damage the bushing threads.)

The bushing will need to be removed before the barrel can be taken from the gun.

Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group.

The only thing it needs is rear brake pads. I have a pair of six six one boots size 12 worn three times and a xl fox chest protector for few dollars more if interested. 

I have cchp also.

I prefer to be contacted by text and then we will go from there. 980 297 483one

It will also come with an OWB factory holster and hard case. In addition to the factory 6rd mag I have added a 7rd extended mag (which was $40) with pinky rest which makes it much more comfortable at the range. This is a great pistol I have only put 150rds of 115g fmj and 40rds of Speer gold dot 147g jhp down the pipe. This pistol has been well maintained and has had zero non-staged malfunctions so 100% reliable thus far. Its a very nice compact pistol with a great single action trigger which makes it extremely accurate for such a small package. The only reason I'm letting it go is its a bit small for what I like.
