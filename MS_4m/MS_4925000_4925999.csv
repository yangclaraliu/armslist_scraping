From what I found out they were produced in the 80's and early 90's. I'm not certain of the year this one is but we think it to be 90's. I spent 2 + hours researching and it seems they are somewhat rare. Saw non working ones going for 250 to 300$. Working ones going for 450 to 500.

I purchased this a few months ago as my everyday CCW, with the intent of transferring it to my girlfriend.  She decided she wanted a larger caliber for her CCW, so I am selling this.

I am the original owner.  The pistol was stripped, cleaned of the factory grease and re-lubed, and taken to the range to test out.  The pistol has only seen 28 rounds down range.  Other than that, it is in new condition.

The LC380 has a 3.12"" barrel, 3 dot adjustable sights, weighs 17.2 oz, and has a 7+1 capacity.

This sale comes with original box and all original paperwork, original lock from Ruger, Ruger takedown key, 2 Ruger 7 round magazines with extended pinky grip (they only come with 1, I bought a second one), original Ruger soft case, and a right hand IWB holster.  The sale also comes with a box of 25 Hornady Critical Defense, box of 50 Blazer Brass FMJ, and 400+ rounds of Freedom Munitions Reman.  The reman ammo is what I fired through it down range, and it shot great with no FTF's or FTE's.

Since I do not have another .380, the ammo must go with the sale and is reflected in the price.

Please note: All prices include shipping, tracking, insurance. Delivered right to your door, and we ship anywhere in the USA or Canada.

       Almost all the world's crossbows are manufactured in the same factory. The factory we represent here also produces Barnetts, Jaguars, Cobras, and more. These are the exact same as name-brands without the hefty price tag.




Pictured is our best selling model, the 150-Basic. Comes in several styles but the wood furniture is the best-seller by far. The second picture is our next-best seller; the Deluxe Compound Crossbow. Hand-stained furniture, features a roller stirrup for the smoothest possible reload. 


Every crossbow for sale is made of either ultra-dense nylon fiber, or aircraft-grade aluminum. Either material will last for years and years with proper care. ALL crossbow sets also include:

-Crossbow
-String
-2 End caps to protect the limbs from damage, and lengthen their life span
-2 Aluminum Bolts w/ Solid Steel tips, and polymer stabilizers



We have dozens of models and styles available to choose from; pistols, rifles, compounds, all shapes, sizes and colors. Email anytime for a full advertisement.



If you are looking for a Christmas gift, place your order now. Nothing says ""I love you"" like a bit of medieval weaponry. And the total lack of recoil on a crossbow means that even smaller people such as children, often shy about the recoil of firearms, will have fun with these weapons.

Any orders beyond December 10th carry no promises that they will arrive by Christmas day. We are in the middle of the holiday rush, and shipping companies are absolutely swamped with packages. At current rates, we won't have a single crossbow left in stock come Christmas day. Typically there is a 2 week turnaround for shipping, however the factory has opted to increase shipping speed during the holidays. Up to the minute tracking is provided on all orders.


Payment can ONLY be accepted through Paypal. This is to protect both our company, and the customer. Paypal offers complete buyer protection, as well as a helpful platform to track your package.


We also have plenty of extra bolts, spare limbs, etc. Email me with any questions.





NEW NOTICE: 
-We are SOLD OUT of the pistol crossbows, all models. Sorry folks.
-We are SOLD OUT of the 150-Basic in Desert Camo. All other styles still for sale.
-We are SOLD OUT of the Powerhouse in Desert Camo. All other styles still for sale.





I personally have the Deluxe Compound Crossbow, and the 150-Basic, and I can attest to their quality. Shot both for years and years, have never had to replace anything other than the string(which is purely for safety concerns). I also opted to spend the extra money for the Carbon Fiber bolts, and have yet to break or bend even one."

For sale is the gun with everything that came with it from the factory with extras.

-Factory barrel
-Alternate spring, alternate front sight, lock out tool
-Padded factory case
-All the paperwork
-Extra magazine

Pistol package $408.00
Gemtech Threaded Barrel: $150.00
Extra Magazine $26.00
Total: $584.00

About the gun:
The gun was purchased new.  I've shot about 200 rounds with the Gemtech barrel.  The accuracy of the pistol has greatly improved with the barrel.  The original barrel has about 500 rounds shot through it.  The accuracy of the factory barrel on these guns is not that good.  Another benefit of the Gemtech barrel is no thread adapter is required for most 22lr suppressors.  The factory threaded barrel requires an adapter to use most commercially available suppressors.

Everything has been cleaned with MPro7 cleaners and lubed with MPro7 grease.  The gun has almost no wear on the outside.  The only modification done is the addition of grip tape to the front strap of the grip.

It is a great training pistol especially for sig sauer shooter as all the controls are in the same place.  Another bonus with this pistol is the extra spring and sights included so you can tune the pistol to whatever ammo you prefer to shoot.  Windage is adjustable with a screw on the rear sight.  You could purchase a factory threaded barrel pistol but it will not be as accurate as this pistol with the Gemtech threaded barrel.  Most other 22lr pistols on the market do not have a picatinny rail for attaching accessories such as lasers, lights or opics base.

Cash Price: $ 400 obo.  I will entertain all cash offers.
The only trade I'm interested in is a 9mm 1911.  I'll make up the cash difference on a trade."

Marlin 336:
Heavily used, has some pitting on various different parts of the receiver and barrel, wood stocks are dinged up but functionally the gun is sound. Have shot it on numerous occasions without a single hiccup. 

Stevens 62:
Gun had once been painted green, but was stripped off some time ago but there is still some residue left in the interior of the stock and a small amount in the checkering. Bluing is in good shape and the gun functions well. 

Asking price is $250 for BOTH rifles. Don't really have a need for either gun, I don't give them enough love. The Marlin was going to be a project gun but I just don't have the time to dedicate to refinishing it. Mainly looking to sell but may entertain trade offers for other firearms as well."

Reviews



“ - wow this thing will shoot! The last time I shot a gun that had this kind of accuracy was when I was a teen, and got to shoot a match-grade MCO Anschutz single shot that was worth close to $3000. Laying prone on the lawn, with no props or rests, a ten shot group was less than a dime at about 40feet. Went and got a proper .22 target and shot another 40 rounds at 20meters, this time laying on the ground, and using a bag of cracked corn as a rest. I managed to shoot three different 5 shot groups that were barely larger than a pea. The largest were a tad bigger than a nickle. Anyone looking for ultra accuracy at an affordable price, give this gun some thought. Tried Winchester, Remington, and Federal ammo. Best groups came from the Federal. I never played around with the Accutrigger setting, manual says states factory set at the lightest (around 2.5lbs) setting.” 



"" I recently used this gun at boy scout camp while getting my rifle merit badge and I loved this gun. I had never used this type of sight before but it was great and at 50 feet with 5 shots it gave me a group that fit under a penny and connected all the holes together. I was so good with this gun that it even surprised the range master to see me get every target with it.”

From manufacturer: Combining the strengths of a red dot sight and the flexibility of a variable power riflescope, the Mark 4 1-3x14mm CQ/T Riflescope is a revolutionary optical sight for firearms such as the AR-15 and M16. Eleven reticle illumination settings to match any light conditions. Common AA batteries power the CQ/T for more than 600 hours at medium setting. The true 1x setting allows you to shoot with both eyes for fast target acquisition and reactive shooting. Choose from 2x or 3x settings for the power to accurately engage targets at medium ranges. The integrated MIL-STD-1913 rail mount cross slots allow you to easily attach a variety of accessories to your CQ/T. Mark 4 CQ/T A.R.M.S. throw lever mount offers dependable, repeatable accuracy. The Circle Dot reticle offers a bold aiming point with built-in range estimating capability. Red illuminated reticle reverts to black when turned off, or without battery power. Flip-open lens covers. Windage and elevation dials in 1/2-MOA coin-click adjustments. Extremely rugged and 100% waterproof. Sale of the Mark 4 CQ/T is restricted outside of the United States. Will sell outright for $600.

The Glock 30 comes with all original accessories, the box and some .45 FMJ. (not sure how many rounds..44 give or take a few) if you have a G 42 that is like new, I would like to trade straight across. (And of course Ill cover my transfer fee) 

Other wise, first $450 gets it. If you decide to purchase with cash, you are responsible for the $25 fee charged for paper work. 



(Legal stuff: Buyer pays fee. if we trade we pay our own fee's. Buyer/person making a trade must show me their valid WA state CPL and I.D. and Ill show mine. The Transfer(s) will happen at the Issaquah West Coast Armory Located at : 240 NW Gilman Blvd, Issaquah, WA 98027)"

It comes new in the box with one factory Steel 30rd. mag.  You can use the sights in the detachable carry handle or remove it and add any optic you wish.  The most proven and reliable AR's out there based on the numbers sold and actually being used daily have to be Colt and Bushmaster rifles.  If you are looking for a solid AR-15 to build onto and make your own, this is a great rifle for any occasion.  

$820 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  Online I see these for $880-$960+ right now before any tax/shipping/FFL fees, so you are still saving around $100+ on a new rifle.

I will consider trades only if they make sense as far a being a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal. 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in more semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less interested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns. 

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 mainly.

Quality optics, scopes, red dot type, magnfiers etc.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same, if the deal is good.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in Garland/Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

The Ruger P345 is a medium-framed semi-automatic pistol chambered in .45 ACP. It is part of Ruger’s P-series of centerfire pistols.The P345 pistol features a slimmer-profile and stainless steel slide with a completely recontoured polymer grip. This new pistol has a 4.2-inch barrel, eight round magazine and fixed white-dot front and rear sights. The Ruger P345 pistol also features an unobtrusive internal lock, magazine disconnect, loaded chamber indicator, and all-new camblock design, which helps absorb recoil. The smooth, short trigger pull of the Ruger P345 helps improve accuracy, while the ergonomically shaped polymer frame provides a comfortable grip."
